Anyone wake up a little moist?,"I don’t want to say I was SOAKED but I was a little sweaty for some reason, and it wasn’t even warm in my room. My whole body felt wet. I have an appointment for a sleep doctor on April 4th to see if I have sleep apnea. Can apnea cause that? I honestly don’t know why it happens. "
Running on sleep deprivation and caffeine for 20+ years! Who is with me?!,"Just as the title says, I've been running on sleep deprivation and caffeine for 20+ years. Anyone else?

I'm 30 years old and been battling insomnia since 1997. I've tried most, if not all OTC and prescription sleep medications with little effect. If they work, they only work for a certain period of time before I become ""immune""/build up my tolerance. I've also had some interesting side effects with Ambien and Lunesta......I consider it a good night If I'm asleep between 2-3 AM! 

Lack of sleep has been the norm for most of my life, I am just used to it. It sucks! "
medications or sleeping causing headaches???,"ok ive been taking trazodone for sleep & escitalopram for anxiety in the day. I stopped the escitalopram for two days so far. I think I took it 3 times and they were half 10mg each time. I heard bad things about this med if you suddenly stop, but I only took it maybe four times I think. But every time I come from the gym I have this terrible headache. Im sleeping at least 5 hours a night so far (I hope)….I'm still in denial about taking medication because as if now I am kinda satisfied with just sleeping at night that I'm getting. I know im no t getting the best sleep right now, but my body seems fine when I get up and im strong during the day....but when I come back from the gym I have this weird headache. 

Can it be from the medications?? or just my poor sleeping which is about 4 or 5 hours a night. I don't feel tired though. Im sure the anxiety might still be there. No, its still there and I know this...im just trying to stick to a everyday workout to see if I can improve this situation without extra meds.

thanks "
"I’m tired of sleeping and dozing off at work, nothing has helped.","Nothing has helped in terms of sleep hygiene and it’s all in my head these stupid thoughts.

Can a therapist help me? Or a psychologist? I think I will forever be this way now, an insomniac getting 1/2 hours sleep. "
"Hey, was wondering if any of you have used Ambien, had successful results and gradually weaned yourself off of it?",I’ve had insomnia for about a month now and found a drug similar to Ambien that works for me. However I’m afraid I’ll get medicine dependent and constantly need it to sleep. Need to hear your experiences 
Yo,
I think I'm nocturnal,"Welp, for the 2nd night in a row I slept 2 hour and woke up. Sleeping at night is difficult. When I get the oppotunity to sleep during the day I seem to get better quality sleep. Maybe I'm not an insomniac but nocturnal? Either way it sucks. Fuck. "
Who else is awake?,"It's 1:42am and I have to be up at 530 to start getting my kids ready for school. I'm debating on continuing to toss and turn and audibly groan when I see the time next or just get up, make some coffee and play some Farcry......decisions of an insomniac."
Quick question about body composition and sleep.,Can being at a low body fat cause insomnia? I've always stayed at a low body fat year round; right now my bf is 7.2%.
RLS is ruining my life,"the literal minute my legs hit the bed with the intent to sleep or relax, they need to move. or they itch. i feel like im being kicked in both patellas every 10
seconds. this week is so bad already i haven’t slept
more than two~ hours since saturday night. every medication/remedy slowly tapers off over time and i’m then i’m back to square 1. i hate this so much, 

it affects my job and my ability to function in basic tasks like DRIVING or household chores. slowly being drained and i feel so damn helpless. "
Ambien is making me even more tired than usual,I saw a psychiatrist and got prescriptions for Lexapro for my anxiety and Ambien for my sleep problems last week. I've been taking both since Saturday and so far I'm not noticing anything from the Ambien. When I go to bed I don't notice any effect of the drug as far as helping me sleep. I am getting to sleep slightly faster (within less than an hour) but I'm still waking up intermittently during the night and not getting more than a couple hours of real sleep. Today and yesterday I feel even more exhausted than I normally feel when I don't get much sleep. Anyone have any suggestions? 
Things to do when we can't sleep?,"*Run the dehumidifier for white noise
*Sort Lego
*Waste time on Reddit
*Eat a bowl of cereal
*Have the TV on adult swim with the volume so low I can barely hear it
*Smoke a bowl
*Watch a movie I've seen a thousand times"
Does anybody else find they’ve developed some adaptations/involuntary behaviors around sleep?,"I️ used to sleep well, if I️ were to average it out though I️ get chronic insomnia for 4 months out of the year and it is in direct relation to life stress and seasonal affective. Over the last 2 years it’s really become an issue and I’ve noticed my behaviors around sleep have changed a lot because of it. Here’s what I️ mean 

- I️ get really finicky about the covers, the feeling of them I️ mean, like if they’re not right I️ have to get out bed and start over
- I️ get tics, like itches all over my body the second I️ think i’m in a comfortable position
- My heart pounds like i️ just ran a marathon when I️ wake up in the middle of the night 
- I️ don’t sleep with other people in the room anymore and will find any excuse not to spend the night with my partner because I’m already so anxious about what little sleep I️ can get. 
- i️ have a pretty rigid sleep routine where I️ used to just get in bed when I️ was tired 
- like clockwork i️ wake up at 2:00am 4/7 nights a week and am not able to fall back asleep for 2 hours if at all. 
- i’m incredibly irritable after losing 3+ hours of sleep and try to stay out of social interactions if I️ know I️ didn’t sleep enough


My doctor tells me i’ve started to develop a panic disorder around sleep, that I’m in a frozen state of fight or flight the moment sleep comes into the picture, that none of this is normal behavior surrounding sleep. maybe i’m in the wrong sub but god I️ feel like I’ve tried everything. 

Has your sleep behavior changed for you since you’ve developed insomnia? What do you do to calm your nerves before bed?"
CBD oil for insomnia,"Any ideas for dosage?   I have sleep maintenance insomnia, so wake after 4hrs sleep and struggle to return to sleep, lower level of anxiety helps to sleep better. I have read that taking it at bed time can be activating rather than relaxing...."
How do I taper off 50 mg of Trazodone and avoid any withdrawal effects each time I drop the dose?,I also want to get off it in a reasonable amount of time. I’d  ask my doctor but he doesn’t think withdrawal exists. Thanks. 
Help for my girlfriend!,"Hi all, my girlfriend struggles with insomnia combo'd with lower back pain. All I want to do is help her, but i am not sure where to start. I stay up with her when she is really struggling and it hurts to see her struggle with this. I want to find ideas to try out with her to help her sleep more! If anyone has advice, it is greatly appreciated! "
Managed to use my insomnia for something,"I have struggled with insomnia since I was a teen, 'going to bed' more or less meant lying in a dark room with my eyes wide open, tossing and turning and over analysing every anxiety inducing aspect of my life. I have often used alcohol and other various supplements to different (short term) degrees of success.

My main issue is the way my thoughts constantly loop as i lie there.

I decided to make an album of music that constantly looped, changing very slowly over time  as nagging thoughts alter slowly in my mind during my bad nights. Most of it was done very late at night/early in the morning.

I'm pretty happy with some of it, I'd be fascinated  to hear from other insomniacs if this music reminds them of their own sleepless nights.

I have a plan to fix my insomnia!,"I was up so late last night that I was asleep until noon, and missed out on school. I was thinking that in order to get a full 8 hours tomorrow, I would stay awake all night tonight and then go to sleep at 10 PM tomorrow. Does anyone think this will work, has anyone tried skipping a day before?"
Can someone help me ASAP?,"I am currently lying in bed, and trying desperately to sleep. But I can feel my pulse beat powerfully throughout the body, and sometimes when I'm about to fall asleep, it's almost like the pulse shoots blood really quickly into my head, making me wake up. And if this does not happen I get hypnagogic hallucinations, and I cannot get rid of them, I've been trying for about an hour now, and it's scaring me. "
Can't stay asleep,"I've always had trouble falling asleep, but for the past couple weeks, even when I do, I inevitably wake up two hours after. Then I'm totally unable to go back to sleep.

I have no idea how to fix this. If anyone experiences something similar or has experienced it in the past, I would be incredibly grateful if you tell me how you deal with it.

It's like my life is blurry right now. I just want to be able to rest."
I...somehow got sleep without medication?,"This is a weird feeling. My insomnia has been pretty terrible for the last two months, mainly to me smoking myself out of my mind in the past. I tried exhausting all of my options for my insomnia, but the last thing I tried that has had a huge effect on me are CBD edibles.

The night before last, I went out with friends for St Paddy’s Day and of course some beer was had, but when I got home I laid wide awake for a little bit and decided to open the new CBD gummies I bought from a lounge in town and they made me super groggy, due to the fact I took a little more than I should have on accident.

After going to work yesterday and busting my ass all day groggy as hell, I came home and put in more work, becoming exhausted to the point where I didn’t need to take anything before bed, and here I am wide awake about to go in to work refreshed for the first time in a long time.

Here’s to more of these odd morning feelings, hopefully."
Been dealing with on and off insomnia for five days now.,"My 27th Birthday was on February 22nd. On that day, I got into a car accident with my mom driving and it completely threw me out of a loop. Wanting to enjoy my birthday despite the car accident, I decided to smoke a bit of weed. I've always been an anxious person and used to be on medications for it like Valium (Benzos), but I got addicted to them and as a result had to quit. I hadn't been on meds for a few years, and I even hadn't smoked weed for a few years either. The only thing I ever did was drink a bit, but I was never an alcoholic and only drank one Four Loko can once a week.

Then my mom tried to drive me to college in another car, but it had the brakes go out and we had to go take it to the mechanic almost immediately. I was absolutely scared, and was scared of the car accident before.

Not only that, but the last time I smoked weed was 17 days ago. I've only smoked on my birthday a few hits from a joint, then on the 25th of February I smoked a few more hits. Then on March 1st I smoked my last bit of weed and got a bad trip. Since then, I have been really struggling.

My social worker who I see for therapy is leaving in two weeks to take another position. I myself am not feeling okay, as I'm going through heavy fits of insomnia. I had a Math exam Monday, and while I know I shouldn't of done it... I had to take 25 mgs of Trazodone from my mom just to sleep and take the test in the morning as a one-time thing. Anytime I go to my Math class now, my nerves immediately spike and I have a panic episode. It's my only class and I'm doing well in it, and I didn't have this problem before the car accident. I lost a huge support group of online friends before my birthday, which really hurt me far worse after the car accident.

I've tried cutting caffeine out of my life right now, and I haven't had any alcohol in two weeks. Yet I still cannot get any rest whatsoever, and I tried following the instructions to a tee. I took a lukewarm shower before bed, I ate three meals for the day, drank water all day except for two hours before bed, and this just has not gone away like I'd hope it would. I try to turn my phone off and everything, but my mind is literally just begging me to get some form of rest that isn't happening. My body last night kept jolting awake, as if it didn't want to sleep. It's hard to stay awake and focus now, and I have my Math class again tomorrow. I tried guided meditation to help me sleep at night, but it didn't work at all, although it does relax me. I just get out of bed after 20 minutes,

I assume what I have to do is just tough this out like I did before, but it's so difficult with all of this going on. I'm currently trying to reestablish my circadian rhythm, but I'm also trying to do deep breathing as to not let the anxiety overwhelm me. If it's not one thing, it's another. I'm debating on whether or not I should see a doctor or go to a psych, but I really don't want to be back on medication. Any advice?"
Sleep books?,"Hi all! I’m looking for a good book to read up on CBTi, sleep restriction or how to fight insomnia. Currently working with a sleep therapist, but I’m having a visceral reaction to this guy. Not because he’s restricting my sleep or the recommended plan, but he just gets under my skin and says he can’t talk to me about meds (seroquil), but one of the reasons I’m there is because I’m trying to get off them along with the insomnia. Ugh. I need to find someone else, but I want to keep working on it while I wait to get in to see someone. Thanks! "
Anxious to sleep,"Hello everyone. 
For as long as I can remember, I’ve never slept on time at night after I started med school. Not cos of the workload but just generally cos of anxiety and also cos I feel like I can think more in the silence of the night in the dorms. I know for a fact I’ll be sleep deprived in the morning and throughout the day but I just can’t seem to try harder or even be able to correct my schedule. 

1. Any one else in a similar situation? 

2. What do you do to take yourself out of this cycle? "
Is CBT-I/sleep restriction making my insomnia worse?,"I signed up for a six-week CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia) course after reading about how effective it is for managing insomnia.  However, ever since I started the sleep restriction component of the course, I've been sleeping much less than I was before and my anxiety levels have gone through the roof.  Before I started it, I was averaging 5.5 hours a night (albeit fragmented and not the best quality), and now I'm down to about 3 fragmented and poor quality hours a night.  I have a six-hour sleep window from 1 am to 7 am, which I think is generous based on other people's sleep schedules I have seen online.  I've thought about asking my therapist whether I should reduce it, but I think that would actually worsen my problem.  It's only been a few days and I feel like it's complete and utter psychological torture (as opposed to simple tiredness or discomfort, which is what I was expecting to feel).  I'm tearing up and having a hard time breathing just thinking about it.

My problem is that I obsess all day over whether I'm going to sleep during my allotted window and then can't fall asleep or stay asleep during the window due to the anxiety.  It's the same way I felt before beginning therapy, but on steroids.  I've been unproductive at work, half-assing or skipping my workouts, either avoiding social situations or leaving hangouts early because I'm too tired to engage, and crying on and off all day due to the frustration, anxiety, and exhaustion.  I was not like this before starting CBT-I.  I try to get out of bed and read at night when I can't sleep, but I can't focus on my book, and my thoughts race and I cry a lot (including as I'm typing this).  I feel very sleepy around 11:30 pm or 12 am but force myself to stay awake until my designated bedtime of 1 am, and by that time, the desire for sleep has completely fled and I'm stressed and psyched out.  

It seems like most people whose experiences I read about online were able to fall asleep and stay asleep for anywhere from 4-5 hours after the first couple nights.  They reported that the technique actually removed the pressure to sleep for them.  Everything I've read points to the overwhelming success of CBT-I, and I haven't read about anyone failing at it.  This is adding to my feelings of being ""broken"" and unfixable and it's absolutely devastating because I really thought this would work for me.  Am I doing something wrong?  Should I change the way I've been doing things?  In the alternate, has anyone not succeeded at CBT-I and found success with another technique?  

I am seeing a therapist, who is a pleasant person, but seems to be formulaic in her thinking and hasn't tailored the course much to my needs up until now.  I expressed my reservations about how sleep restriction therapy would make me feel to her, but she made me feel like I was being uncooperative by not being on board with the idea right away.  I know I should be directing these questions to her, and I will during our next session, but I've been lurking on this sub for a bit and it seems like people are very supportive on here so I wanted to see what people thought."
Haven't been able to sleep much more than 4 hours every night for the past year.,Every night when I go to sleep I just lay there looking at my wall for like 2 hours until I can't stand the boredom anymore and start watching YouTube or eat something. I've tried most breathing and concentration techniques and played countless different ambient noises to see if one worked.  I can't go to the doctor for a diagnosis therefore I don't have any prescriptions for any sleeping pills or melatonin (not sure if you need a prescription for this one). I've tried some over the counter ginseng vitamins  and my brothers prozac but none helped much. Looking for advice. Currently 3:40 and have to get up at 6.
Potential Insomniac??,"So I've always had problems with sleep-  I remember going through all 3 years of Middle School with less than 6 hours a night and then I'd ""crash"" and sleep 10 hours on Friday and Saturday.

The summer before High School I got super depressed and would sleep 12 hours a night, and then in high school- poof, fine. No depression, 8 hours a night, all 4 years.

Almost immediately after I got out of high school I started having issues again. Just starting up late, waking u early, 7 hours a night then 6, 5, and this has been over 6 months now. Then we get to the current situation.

For the last 4-5 weeks now (this'll be the 5th week) I wake up, don't sleep at all that night, stay up until 8-10 pm the next day, sleep until 5-6am and then repeat. I go a break the weekend before last and actually slept 10pm-6am two nights in a row!! And then instantly snapped back to this.

I know you're not doctors, and if you are I know it's against your code of ethics to diagnose someone but- from someone who's questioning and is concerned, does this sound like any of your all' experiences? Those of you who have Insomnia or don't? Either way, I just want some answers.

And no, going to the doctor is mostly out of the question. Too expensive and my parents just dismiss me, not like it's matter. I wouldn't afford the medicine and I wouldn't take it either- I'm just too stubborn/forgetful haha."
Love hormones have given me crazy insomnia,"So for some reason, i have been high on some crazy powerful hormones like cortisol, oxytocin, adrenaline, epinephrine and norepinephrine for the past few days, and they have come with very, very little sleep. It's 4:44 AM and my heart is beating at least 115 bpm and my mind is racing. I have to wake up for school at 6. It's funny how I can find all this information about what is happening to me right now on the internet, but I can't seem to find any solutions whatsoever, besides the non-helpful ""Try not to get lost in the high."" What does that even mean? Anyway, I was hoping I could reach out to people who have this regularly to see if I can apply any strategies that are working for any of you. If you have any tips I can follow for this (hopefully temporary) insomnia of mine, please help me out! Thank you!"
My insomnia,"So, I have had insomnia since about the time my depression was daignosed, at age 12.  Usually, my insomnia is just me waking up randonly multiple times throughout the night. I can usually go back to sleep fairly easily.

Tonight though is different. I have been laying down since about 9:40ish. Not so much tossing and turning, just... nor falling asleep. My usual tactics, reading, day dreaming, meditation... nothing has worked tonight. It's now almost 2 am. I have gotten up to drink and go to the bathroom, but I will see if I actually get to sleep.

Just a boring story I wanted to share with my fellow insomniacs.

May have dozed off, but otherwise still up :/"
Zopiclone and Trazodone experiences?,"I've tried pretty much every otc sleeping supplement/herb, and the only thing that worked for putting me asleep is doxylamine succinate. Lately though it has stopped working, probably due to tolerance, so I'm looking to try out Zopiclone and/or Trazodone.

Would love to hear your experiences with either of the above. How effective was it for making you fall asleep faster? Any side effects you came across?"
I can't remember the last time I've had a full 8 hours,"25/m, I'm prescribed Adderall 30mg XR and 15mg IR. Have been for about a year now, and on lesser dosages for over 3 years now. My sleep issues started becoming more apparent in January 2018 that's when my Psychiatrist put me on Ativan, then Klonopin 1mg where I'm at now. Aside from that I work out 3 times a week, started working in my full time job a year ago, and it seems like ever since then my sleep cycle has gotten worse and worse. My biggest hurtle at night is simply falling asleep to begin with. This takes hours or from what I perceive it doesn't happen at all. I've been doing mindfulness, meditating, tried every over the counter Vitamin Supplement that are available and nothing seems to help. Even on the weekends when I don't take Adderall it's still the same issue. Very rarely Benadryl works, and Valerian Root also gives me incredibly pleasant dreams. But in my day go day life I feel like a shell of a human. I can feel all the proper sleep I haven't been getting. Everything is so bright, my mind is always perpetually racing. It's actually crazy im able to manage myself at work after getting any sort of recognized sleep, and by that I mean you can tell that you fell asleep.

I honestly wonder most of the time with my mind being so preoccupied playing out random stories and scenerios in my head if they are dreams or me being awake and making them up. That's the other thing to. So bizarre. The klonopin at this point does absolutely nothing and on top of that gives me brain fog and makes my memory horrible. I've tried Seroquel before and that stuff knocked me out wonderfully but again that has its tolerance issues also. I've been offered that in that by psychiatrist, I might persure that. 

What kinds of things are you guys prescribed or do at night when you can't fall asleep to focus on to quiet your thoughts that get in the way?

I’m at a loss I can’t go to sleep I work a 3-12 shift. Got Advil pm worked great. But mom started buying generic bull shit. Can’t sleep,I’m just sick of this bull shit. 
Any sleeping pills that aren't anti-depressants?,"I can't take antidepressants, I was on them my whole life up until 18, whenever I take them, they fuck up my life, make sleeping really difficult, give me super fucked up dreams (on top of my already daily super fucked up dreams), and I don't like the programming feeling they give. Literally every time I go to the doctor for a sleep aid, I get a different anti-depressant for sleep. I don't think most doctors actually pay attention to the counter-indicators related to each medication as well, meaning you'll basically sacrifice all other aspects of your life for that one ailment to be relieved but end up worse than you were to begin with.

Any ideas of sleep aids outside of the realm of anti-depressants? I currently take gravol, I've already exhausted melatonin out to the point 20mg doesn't even have an effect, and can't smoke marijuana because of work, despite it being legal."

Boyfriend is worried I will die,"Ive gotten 9 hours over the last 3 days 4 hours the past 2 nights from xanax (perscription it wears off after 4 hours) i tried melatonin last night (10mg max dose) for the first time and got 1 hour of sleep. I'm having trouble speaking out loud. Hes worried im going to die from all of this. I told him i got 8 hours 2 nights in a row before 3 days of restlessness but that didnt comfort him since I had the same troubles the entire week before those 2 days. Timeline is weird sorry if it doesnt make sense. Point being: What do I say to comfort him? Telling him I got sleep for 2 days stressed him out and saying it takes 11 days of constant no sleep at all not even a little to die didnt comfort him. What do you tell your loved ones? Also I won't lie to him so thats off the table. 

Edit: I force myself to lay in bed and try to sleep all day and i come back to such lovely replies! Thank you everyone ive quelmed his fears for now and I'm truely sorry for everyone suffering worse than I am. Its not a ""who gets less sleep Olympics"" but I am sorry and hope all of you get some relief soon.

My First Panic Attack?,"Edit: Fixed grammar and multiple choice answers.

So I have a friend who is more prone to panic attacks than me. Never having had a panic attack before, I could only sympathize. ""Must be rough."" Yeah. No kidding. 

I can't remember the exact hour this all happened. Probably around 1 AM.  I attempted to lie down on my bed, and the very instant my head hit the pillow, my heart started racing. My thoughts were rampant and worst outcomes immediately made the forefront of my mind. I think the only reason I didn't go completely insane was because I had taken some diphenhydramine HCL (Zzzquil), and it was starting to come into affect. The whole thing lasted between 5-10 minutes, but it felt like forever. I now empathize with anyone who had or has panic attacks. I had never had them prior to last night.

The problem is that I can't explain why I had the panic attack. Was it from an induced anticipatory sleep anxiety? It seems like the most likely explanation, but I'm not ruling anything out. I also start college again today (back from my Spring Break), and there's this big exam. Could that be the cause? Also, I have experience with loneliness, small bouts of depression, and of course anxiety. I remember feeling lonely last night before I fell asleep because I have this longing for a significant other, but no valid options. Been that way most of my life. Maybe all of these factors are the cause?


What are your thoughts, fellow redditors? You guys are more experienced than I and could use some opinions. Thanks in advance. Since I'm taking an exam later today, I'll make the possibilities that come to my mind multiple choice.

Why did I have a panic attack?

A)  Anticipatory Sleep Anxiety

B) The start of college coupled with the big exam

C) Loneliness and depression

D) All of the above?"
"Racing thoughts, noisy brain, not even a spec of light, heavy pillows stacked","Post got deleted for some reason, so reposting:

I've struggled with insomnia since I was a small child (8 years old is when I really stated dreading bedtime). In college it got worse and I wrote this song that would mimic the headspace of racing thoughts and desperate attempts to fool myself into sleeping, but also as a self-deceptive lullaby ( I've found ethereal music with heavy bass and reverb have helped)

So if this is relatable,  or helpful I have written more music to trick the mind into wandering and distracts from noisy thoughts, but this was the first"
Anyone else experience this situation?,"I have sleeping problems far back in to my middle school days. Currently reaching mid-twenties and still having this problem here and there. 

As I get ready in bed and just when I hit the point of deep sleep, my brain all of a sudden says “hey let’s do this then you can sleep”. At that point I may or may not fall asleep till about a few hours/minutes/seconds later, when in my head my brain is repeating the phase “hey let’s do this then you can sleep.” (It doesn’t get loud but it is in a loop)

So for example, one night at 11pm my thoughts told me “let’s try doing a push up then we can sleep.” I some how got an hour of sleep after pushing (pun intended) that thought away. But the thought kept going in my head and I woke up. I try to ignore it but at this point it was almost 4pm and I really wanted a few more hours of sleep. So got out of bed, attempted 3 push ups, laid in bed and instantly knocked out. 



Just curious if anyone has this sort of situation? "
"Melatonin, nortriptyline and Lunesta","It's sort of working right now, and I'm not sure I want to ask my doctor if this is ok, because she'll probably disapprove. I stopped taking Lunesta because it made me sleep eat, have memory problems and dissociate. The nortriptyline was supposed to replace it, and while it helps, it doesn't quite do it if I'm too anxious. I'm starting a job this week after being unemployed for 8 years, and I kinda need to sleep. I looked up interactions and it SHOULD be safe."
Medical marijuana to help sleep?,"I have been suffering from insomnia since my second baby was born. I can nap, fall asleep on the couch but when it comes time for bed, some nights my brain just wont shut off. This is more an anxiety thing than anything else but Xanax etc don't really help so I've been taking Ambien to knock out. 

I don't really like the hangover I have in the am from Ambien so I'd like to try something else. Has anyone had success with marijuana or CBD oil? 

I just want to be able to fall asleep......"
Third day in a row of not being able to fall asleep.,"It’s gotten to the point where I take Ambien, 4 10g melatonin, 4 sleep aids, 4 motion sickness pills, and 2 Benadryls and 2 Xanax. 

That’s just to get me drowsy and doesn’t actually put me to sleep. I know I am taking way to much meds to fall asleep. I am thinking about talking to the doctor on my next visit to see if I can get a different RX. He would be mortified to know just how much stuff I am taking. But nothing seems to work. 

When I do actually get sleep I am a zombie the next day. 

If anyone has tried a different sleeping pill other than Ambien, can you tell me how it worked for you? 

I am scared at this rate one day I won’t wake up."
Anyone else find it very difficult to speak when you’re sleep deprived?,"I can hardly muster up the effort to open my mouth and attempt words when I haven’t slept. It feels like it requires quadruple the effort. And making eye contact is difficult for me too when my eyes feel so heavy.

And people get frustrated with me for giving slurred responses and short answers... I’m trying I swear"
Doesn't it suck being caught not sleeping?,"Almost every night -

Not knowing if were sleeping or not.....,"Ok so since going threw this new insomnia bout as of now I'm starting to wake up with these thoughts of ""did I sleep, or not""....I don't know if I'm getting sleep. Is my brain damaged over this shit. Because when I do get up, most times I'm waking up with a slight headache. The anxiety is still here. Again I'm taking Trazodone to try to sleep. Tonight I might take one & half. 

I'm getting up, but I'm not sure if I was up the whole time. Its weird. My head does feel a bit crazy as of now though. 

The battle will continue.

I need some help,"I've been getting about 2 hours of sleep maximum the past 4 nights in a row. It's really affecting my mental state. 

I never know what day it is, I'm missing schoolwork, I'm going to text a friend to see they texted me hours or days ago that I opened but don't remember seeing, I'm on the verge of a mental breakdown.

I used to be prescribed trazadone but now I'm not anymore. My insomnia hasn't acted up in a while.

Meditation isn't working, ASMR isn't working, exercise isn't working. 2 nights ago i lied in my bed from 1AM to 6AM without any sleep. I tried to force it this night as well with no luck. I'm feeling so stressed and I don't know what to do about it.

Any advice would be appreciated, and thank you"
Have you gone to a sleep lab?,"I've always suffered from chronic insomnia, even as a baby. I am currently 43.

Someone suggested I try going to a sleep lab (one where they monitor sleeping over night/day). I am considering it, but I don't think they'd be able to do anything beyond perscribing the same pills I can get from my psychiatrist. 

Am I wrong on this? "
Quick question about tips on falling asleep.,Does closing your eyes and pretending to be asleep help you fall asleep faster.
Journaling has been really helpful for my sleep anxiety/racing thoughts,"I’ve never been a fan of journaling, or even blogging. Never even kept a diary.

I’ve had a rough week in terms of sleep for the last two weeks, at it’s worst, 72 hours of no sleep and still awake even after taking 35mg of melatonin and three diphenhydramine pills.

For the past few days though, my sleep has been decent, without even the need for sleep aids.

Writing down a to do list and addressing all your anxieties was really helpful.

I write down everything that i have to do or think or worry about for the next few days, so my mind has less to worry about. I write down all my thoughts, worries, and anxieties, everything.. until i have nothing left.

After doing so, when i lie down, My mind is mostly quiet, since i’ve already exhausted everything. It really helps curb down all the anxiety and stress that i never noticed i’ve built up.

Anxiety and stress makes your body release high amounts of adrenalin and cortisol, and weirdly so, more when you’re sleep deprived, which makes it impossible to sleep.

It sounds weird and futile, especially when you’re desperate already and all you really want is something to finally knock you out.. But it has been really helping lately.

hopefully it helps you too."

Remeron and sleeping ?,"I’ve been prescribed remeron recently for sleeping problems/anxiety/depression but it seems like these aren’t doing too much for me, I started them 2 days ago and I haven’t experienced the sedative effect seeing that I took it around 10pm (30mg) and it’s currently 4:37 am and don’t feel tired, I did drink tonight but shouldn’t that enhance the sleepy effect and yknow make it easier? Overall I feel like my body isn’t reacting the way it should and the anxiety is overpowering the sedative effect these pills are supposed to produce. Any words of advice ? "
Need some advice on what to do from here.,"Hello all. 

I’ve been prescribed ambien in the past and it’s the only thing that works perfectly for me with no side effects. For the past month or so, I’ve had absolutely terrible insomnia, like going 4 days at a time without sleeping and when I do sleep it’s for like 1-3 hours. 

I’ve tried 20 other medications that either don’t help or have severe side effects.

Well I made an emergency appointment with my psychiatrist hoping to get ambien. She got all flustered and acted like I was asking for meth or something. I understand it’s a controlled substance but it works for me and I’m suffering. At the end of the appointment nothing was changed. 

Should I just go to the ER at this point? Would they just tell me to fuck off like my doctor did? I’m like hallucinating, shaking, crying and cold all the time. 

I’m at my wits end and just want this to stop. 

"
Can't sleep for more than a few hours at a time!,"I could really use some advice here. For the last several months I've been unable to stay asleep. I think there are three factors contributing to it, but even after treating those factors, I can't stay asleep. 

I have sleep apnea but I have a CPAP machine. 

I have a hiatal hernia, GERD, acid reflux but I take Dexilant and I'm careful to not eat trigger foods before bed. 

I have chronic pain in the form of degenerative disk disease in my lumber (S1, L5, L4, and L3) but I take Aleve about an hour before bed. 

Because of the reflux issues, it might be a good idea to prop myself up and I have an adjustable bed that allows that but because of my back, I can only stay that way for about a half an hour before that becomes very uncomfortable.

I fall asleep around 10:00, 11:00 or 12:00 and up around 1:00, 2:00 or 3:00 after only a few hours.  I have taken melatonin to help me sleep and I sleep, but then I wake up.  Any thoughts?"
Does this sound like insomnia?,"Lately and historically, I've been having difficulty falling asleep. I have the racing thoughts, turning in bed, shallow-feeling sleep. However, I've also had periods of intense dreaming and 4 hour sleep cycles, where I wake up at the end. And before that, for a while, I would suddenly fall asleep at 10 pm, in my jeans, with my computer on my lap or whatever.   


Does insomnia kind of change like this, or could I have something else going on?"
"Foods, supplements, lotions, meds, etc cause me insomnia","My sleep is generally ok, although I had a year of extreme insomnia 16 years ago.  Since then, when I’m exposed to any number of substances, I can’t sleep until 4ish.  Some substances are obviously and typical: caffeine (even tiny amounts of chocolate), MSG, some antihistamines, some meds (Vicodin).  

Other things are not so typical: omega 3s (even salmon for dinner), omega 7s, any “stimulating” product (like for wrinkles, hair growth), estrogen, supplements good for your brain (Ginko biloba, American ginseng), B-12, fortified cereal after dinner, Indian food, etc.  Most things act on me from exposure in the morning. 

Experiences also keep me awake: evening meetings, arguments, exciting shows, bad news, parties. 

Do other people have these sensitivities? They seem really extreme.  I want to calm down my system. Is there any hope for recovery from this?"

Possibly due to overactive bladder?,"I had posted before about drinking wine and this helping me even when just drinking a small glass or half a glass. After experimenting again with drinking wine, I feel that I was able to fall asleep so easily because the wine helped relax my bladder. I looked up some info on this and found that some people with cystitis and constant urges to pee had noticed a positive effect when drinking red wine. 

&#x200B;

Normally, when struggling to sleep, I would have a hard time drifting off as I felt the urge to pee (and would be able to pee small amounts) every 15 mins or so. I had always thought that this was a side effect of being anxious when suffering from sleep anxiety.

&#x200B;

Some suggestions about the wine were that the presence of magnesium and/or bentonite or perhaps the alcohol itself in the wine was helpful for overactive-bladder-induced insomnia. 

&#x200B;

Last night, I fell asleep very easily with a much lower dose of Benadryl than normal and red wine. (Normally, I can't sleep well with lower doses of antihistamines as my tolerance has grown.) While the wine does help me relax, I feel that the effect on my bladder and reducing the need to go frequently has been the most beneficial on allowing me to go to sleep. I have taken magnesium supplements before and had issues with too much magnesium causing me to pee even more frequently than normal.

&#x200B;

Any thoughts? Has anyone else experienced issues with insomnia due to an overactive bladder? I don't think that I have issues with my bladder itself as I primarily have problems when I'm anxious or just lying there trying to sleep.

Has anyone had experience with these two drugs. Again I'm dealing with insomnia that gave me terrible anxiety. The reason why I have insomnia was because of sleep jolts/hypnic jerks. I fear them. I'm afraid of it because of what happened to me back in 2010 & 2014. I had those jolts back then when I had a scary bout with insomnia. It made me remember those times. Scared me to death then, and it scared me now it seems. 

Long story short I'm gonna try these meds. These meds are from new doctors. I wanted to ask you guys, if we take meds, can this heals us??? Can we get healed from insomnia. Or is this a life long thing where sometimes it works and sometimes it don't? Then I have to change meds. Can we get free of these meds after were sleeping? 

Thanks so much "
Rant: Why the heck is exercise suggested to help insomnia?!,"I won’t deny that numerous studies show that consistent exercise helps alleviate symptoms of depression, anxiety, and insomnia - it’s pretty much a fact at this point.

But how are you supposed to keep a consistent exercise routine when you can’t fricken sleep?!

Numerous studies also suggest exercising while sleep deprived has harmful effects, such as slower recovery of the bodies muscles and CNS, weakening of the immune system, and in the long term causes overtraining, a dangerous state for the mind and body to be in.

Not to mention that it’s dangerous - lifting weights while sleep deprived, for instance, increases your likelihood of an accident.

But I personally wouldn’t want to swim or run on only a couple hours sleep, either, unless I’ve had caffeine, but I don’t want to have to depend on it.

Everywhere online, and by real life doctors, you get told exercise helps alleviate insomnia. 

Okay, I’ll just go to the gym on a day I have the energy too, when I’m well-rested enough to be swinging around huge weights. 

When I’m **well-rested** enough, of course.

Wait a minute...

*sighs* At least I found ONE study that actually agrees with me and points out this *vicious* catch-22.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3716674/

“Conclusion: Research suggests that **sleep influences next day exercise rather than exercise influencing sleep**. The relationship between TST and next day exercise was stronger for those with shorter TST at baseline. **These results suggest that improving sleep may encourage exercise participation**.”

You don’t say...

Just needed to get that off my chest, as someone who loves fitness but hasn’t been able to exercise in about 3 weeks and is being set back because of it, and we all know why.

"Every time I doze off, my body jerks itself awake.","I have no idea what’s going on :( 

I’m so frikin tired and I can feel how sleep my mind and body are. But every time I start to doze, my body has a “sleep start.” 

I know this happens to everyone every once in a while, but it’s been happening to me constantly for the last two weeks. And it’s EVERY time I start to doze. 

I’m miserable. I’m depressed. I don’t know what to do. 

My iron is low, and I’ve been on supplements for about two weeks now. My doctor just told me we should give the supplements for time and if not, maybe I need a sleep study.

Anyone want to be sleep restriction buddies?,"Hi all,

I saw a similar post a while ago, and I would like to try it out.

I'm 32/M, and I've been dealing with sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia since late September (my dad died, work is irregular, post-travel blues, changes in dynamics with my closest friendships, etc.). I've been trying SRT since December, but the different medications I was on made me too lethargic, and when I got off them, I had anxiety attacks again in the mornings. Now, I am getting more stable emotionally with the help of yoga and can keep a consistent wake time again. 

I could use someone to motivate me, and who perhaps needs some motivation from someone going through the same thing, and who's willing to commit to their schedule.

My behavioral sleep specialist and I are looking at me going to bed at 1:00 AM. and getting out of bed at 6:30 A.M. for the next two weeks. Without medication, it takes me 1.5 to 2 hours to fall asleep, and I sleep about 3.5 to 4 hours. 

Let me know if you're interested. We can talk once a day over email, text, Reddit chat, or WhatsApp (if several people would like to support each other, we can form a WhatsApp group). We would let the other person know that they've kept to the protocol and exchange tips to manage stress, anxiety, and sleepiness during the day. As for timezones, I am in Ohio, so it's EDT. We can work around that, so no worries.

If we have similar sleep issues, it would be a more ideal match. Thank you in advance!

Confidence at an all-time low,"It's been a little over six weeks since I've slept and my confidence has completely plummeted. I rarely engage in social activities and find myself going out strictly for work (I'm a freelancer). I always make up excuses when friends invite me out. When I go shopping I usually stare at the ground and avoid eye contact. I feel like I've aged 5 years. I have dark spots & lines under my eyes and I swear my face has gotten thinner. As an already thin bald guy I joke that I look like the grim reaper. 

I met a woman in late January and it was going really well but I've essentially stopped communicating with her due to sleep deprivation and zero confidence. I've never had confidence issues with women and consider myself relatively charming & witty. Now though? I don't even feel like I'm the same person. I keep telling myself I'll message her when I get a few nights of sleep but of course that never happens.

Ironically, my career is actually going relatively well and I'm finally gaining some traction in my field. The problem is when meeting new clients I'm so self conscious and awkward because it feels like my brain is only functioning at about 70% and also I'm constantly wondering if they notice how stressed/tired I look. Furthermore, sleep deprivation has killed my motivation and drive. I have to force myself to finish projects or even start new ones.

I no longer have any excitement about life. It's like I'm going through motions everyday, never actually feeling good or happy. I used to wake up and at least feel content. Now? Each day blends into the next and I sort of sleepwalk through daily routines. 

I'm not on meds btw (nothing has worked) but have a doctor's appt this Monday. I'm considering taking up boxing. At least that might tire me out to the point of exhaustion..

Brain not falling into deep sleep,"So for some time now I cant remember if I sleep or not.

I also wake up with random shit going on in my mind, the same shit that I fell asleep with, but I can't remember what I was thinking about. Is this just a factor of stress and anxiety or is it something else?"
"What's your go-to response for the ""just drink tea"" folks?","I have come so far in fighting my insomnia. I get upset when I have days of sleepness but I also have to recognize that getting good sleep is now the norm for me while I used to hardly ever sleep at all. First, I dealt with a fear of sleeping due to childhood abuse and putting down my guard equating to more abuse. Then, I had a very stressful job and academic experience that rarely gave me time to sleep. Now, my life is much less stressful and I am going to therapy.

I know I still have a lot to overcome in dealing with the roots that caused my insomnia. I am a very open person about my past and my current struggles, which I feel is beneficial for me although it does provide more opportunities for responses that might not necessarily be helpful.

But it is really frustrating encountering the ""just drink tea"" folks. Yes, some holistic approaches and focusing on routine might be helpful. But it's hard to keep a routine if I might be up till 5 am struggling to sleep one night and doing much better another night. I *wish* just drinking a cup of chamomile tea and going to bed at the same time each night were a guaranteed recipe for good sleep.

Need advice on hotel situation - sharing a room!,"Hi everyone,

I have a special opportunity to travel to a conference but I'm anxious that I'll have to share a hotel room with someone I don't know. 

Whenever I stay in a hotel room, I tend to have a very hard time sleeping. Either I'm awake all night (it makes me super anxious that I wouldn't be able to get up and pace or do something else, since someone else would be sharing the room and trying to sleep) or I have really bad hypnagogic hallucinations (I get these often but they are very bad in hotels because of the new setting, tends not to be very dark, lots of little lights, random sounds, etc). My hallucinations almost ALWAYS involve me waking up and thinking someone has broken into my room, so I'll say things like, ""Holy shit, there's someone standing over there!"" ""Someones looking in the window."" etc. Can you imagine sharing a room with someone you don't know and trying to explain this without scaring the shit out of them?

"HELP and advice needed, sleep after truffles"," Hello,

almost 3 weeks ago I took a recommended dose of shrooms from a well-rated shop in amsterdam. I had a bad trip despite me prepping a safe space/mindset. It lasted around 3 hours and managed to prevent a panic attack. Afterwards I slept like a rock.

Since then my sleep has been fucked to hell. A week later I could not sleep an entire night, but that was because of anxiety. The anxiety has almost fully dissapeared after I saw a therapist and doctor. During this 3 week time I have gotten only about 4 days of good sleep/slept almost throughout the night.

My ""default"" nowadays seems to be that I fall asleep like normal and sleep 4 hours- wake up- go back to sleep- sleep on and off, waking about each hour until I cant go back to sleep any more. The sleep after my first awakening is shallow and bad quality. I usually get a total of 5-6 hrs when before the drug I could sleep in for 10 hrs. I often have vivid dreams which I hate, they make me exhausted.

I already live a lifestyle of a balanced diet, excersize 2-4 times per week, and have a stable job. I have only had caffeine twice since the trip, I am currently trying meditation but I am bad at it.

The doc visit was short so she only gave me anti-anxiety meds which I have not taken, because to me that is a self-solvable part of my issue. My concern surrounds my sleep. I have searched online and found some people in an old forum that had the exact same symptoms I have...and later they wrote that the problems persist years later. This freaks me the fuck out because people claim that any long term issues after psilocybin use dissapear after some weeks/months. what is the truth?! If I knew this could happen I would never had taken the risk in the first place! The science around hallucinogens seems completely biased and i am truly pissed!

I have been considering contacting a sleep doctor but that may be difficult or impossible in my city.

Please, please if you have gone through the same or know someone who has, tell me if it got better or not. Im scared. I want nothing more than to sleep peacefully again."
"I woke up at 7pm yesterday, missed work, am still awake at 12pm today.","It is truly a mess. It's been months or maybe even a year since I had a nice sleep schedule. I should probably mention my work schedule too. I have been working at this company for 9 months, where there are a cycle of morning, afternoon and night shifts. It changes every two weeks, so just when I'm getting used to going to bed at a certain hour, it changes. It's my only option right now so I try to keep up. There have been times that it gets easier to just switch the hour by staying a little later but for the last two months I've been going through hell. Every time I try to sleep I just keep rolling around in bed for more than 2 hours before I can actually fall asleep.

I tried everything. Reading, meditation, staying awake until I'm about to pass out, drinking chamomile tea, stretching... I don't feel hunger much so I thought maybe that was it, I get hungry until I go to bed, so I try to eat like 2 hours before. Some of them worked once or twice but there never got to be a third successful attempt for any of them.

I do sometimes overthink that I need to sleep, so there's that. Sometimes migraine keeps me.

The thing is whenever I put my head on the pillow and try to sleep, thoughts just run around and focusing on the positive, trying to keep my mind away from daily challenges never work. So I have to keep myself busy until I drift off.

Reading posts here or playing a narrative game had helped until 2 weeks ago. Now those don't work either. Audio books, no. Relaxing music, no. Sleep guidance videos, no. Nothing. Nothing works anymore and today I hit the bottom. I have a doctor's appointment at 15:00 and I need to be at work on Saturday and Sunday at 09:00 and I have a 3-hour flight on Monday.

I have also been showing symptoms of anxiety and am in search for professional help but as of today, I am out of solutions for the next few days. I usually try not to overthink when I can't sleep but today I am angry at myself, angry at the situation, frustrated with all this and I don't know what to do. Even I fall asleep any time from now, I won't be able to make it to the appointment or fix the hours to wake up at Saturday morning.

I screwed this week up very bad I guess. I am open to any suggestions, comments, anything. Thank you for sticking with me up to this point."
Why does my mind keep noticing how my body changes when I start to sleep...,Anyone has the thoughts like me? It started when I have a sleepless night and it keeps going on until now and I don't know how to deal with it...
Share some hopeful stories?,"My strange and perplexing and severed insomnia is new, only a couple weeks old.  But it’s definitely a huge struggle.   I believe in positive thinking and trying different approaches as the only way to deal with this until solution (even though there are serious slips from time to time).  Anyway, I don’t much like to read stories of catastrophic and desperate situations at this moment, although I feel for what everyone is going through.  Can anyone share some positive stories, of overcoming the problem altogether and/or learning to live in a high spirit?  Would be much appreciated!"
Can sleep neglect cause memory issues/confusion?,"I would really appreciate if ya'll could read this story and give me your opinion. It is all relevant to the situation.

For the past 2 years I have been convinced I had ALS, AIDS, Pancreatic Cancer, Fatal Insomnia, Parasites, Ear Cancer, Intestinal Gangrene, etc. Now, for the past month I have been worried about Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease (dementia that kills you in months) I initially worried about it cause of a bout of depersonalization..and found it was a symptom so I was stuck on it. Then that went away and some other symptom would come about...like tremor or forgetting the name of something. Both those resolved a few weeks ago.

For the past 2 weeks, my sleep has been out of whack. I usually go to bed around 12/1am and wake around 10/11am. My husband had been away for a week and I always sleep like crud when he is not around. 

I ended up in a pattern where I couldn't fall asleep till 5am, 6am, 7am, 8am, 9am, then 10am. For the past 5-6 days...I sleep from 10am till 2/3pm which is technically within the normal range in terms of 'amount' of sleep. I have been trying desperately to sleep at midnight or even 1 but I will just lay there with my eyes closed, not feeling it at all. I can lay there for hours.. and hours. It doesn't help that I am having closed eye hallucinations EITHER. In the dark, in general, I see blobs and stuff...which is normal vision fluff for people in the dark. When I close my eyes, those blobs change to images. Sometimes they are triangles or bunches of moving shapes and sometimes they are people, realistic scenes. It looks like....if  you stare at something for a long time and then quick close your eyes... you can still see it pretty vividly for a second right? It's exactly like that. It isn't imagined, I can see it on the backs of my eyelids...and when I open my eyes in the dark too! It doesn't last a long time, maybe a few seconds. If I stare at it it morphs into other images, if I don't it goes away. 

This happens to me every time I try to 'force' myself to sleep and even more-so now cause I worry about it before I even 'try' to sleep. I lay down and go ""what if it happens again, am I dying? Does it mean I have something wrong with my brain?"". It's like... I see it is 12am and I reluctantly go to bed..I just have that fear in the back of my head. Then a image pops up and my heart starts racing like crazy cause I am scared . Once I DO fall asleep, those images are a thing of the past. Like, I can wake up, go pee, come back to bed, and go back to sleep without issue. I don't know if it is cause I am consciously 'looking' for these...so therefore they pop up (?) I don't even know if that is physically possible. However, I do know that when I am relaxed (like when you wake up)..the hyperawareness for those images is just gone. I just wake up normal and it just doesn't happen. I was looking up this phenomenon and I see ...SO many people on like, Yahoo Answers, dream sites, here, etc ask about ""images I see when closing my eyes"". I probably found like...30 hits? And I would say 75% of those people complain about images they see just when merely closing their eyes BEFORE trying to fall asleep, and they see the images projected onto their eyelids... like me.

&#x200B;

For the past 2 days I have had 'brain farts' I suppose. I keep correlating them with the images I am seeing at night and I keep thinking hallucinations + dementia = CJD (which technically it does).

 

 For instance.﻿ I was in the bath and couldn't remember which faucet handle was cold/hot. Like I thought about it before I did it BECAUSE I was nervous about how worried I'd be if I picked the wrong one. I turned on the left handle thinking it was hot water but it was cold water... then I got scared. After my bath, I checked my weight on a beam scales (which I use a lot) and the notch bit on the end (that you use to determine whether to move the slider down or up) was down and I questioned whether I move the slider up or down to balance it out. I figured it out pretty quick and it was like a 'duh' moment.. but for that 1 second, I forgot. So I panicked. I also was watching Family Feud and the question of ""what is something your mother let you do, that your wife won't"" and I kept confusing it with ""something your mom didn't let you do that your wife does"". ﻿I also confused a goat for a donkey...and an otter for a beaver. Last week I was playing poker online (which I do all the time) and it came to my bet and I got totally confused for a second..like I had 100k chips and the bet was 2k and for some reason I questioned what 2k was..I just stared and contemplated it (isnt that odd?) It is a fast paced game, each player has 5 seconds hold/fold. I obviously figured it out right away..but for that second, I was lost! Afterward i panicked and did an online mathematics test (algebra, geometry, percentages, etc) to make sure my brain was working right...and my answers were almost always right (and i did every single equation in my head...i didn't use paper or a calc at all). Today I had 1 thing happen, my husband got some Pad Thai today and mine had these unique, awesome, 1 inch wide homemade noodles in it, they kinda looked like pieces of dough. Tons of bean sprouts, white onions, meat, etc. I acknowledged the noodles before i started eating...right? I was sitting with my husband, watching tv and I bit into a bean sprout thinking it was a small noodle...but it was crunchy, so i dug my fork to find the noodles underneath and then it hit me.. I realized I totally just blanked out on the fact I had the homemade noodles already in it. It was a total duh moment.

Now I am flipping myself out thinking I ACTUALLY have sporadic CJD..and the only way to diagnose it is a post-mortem. I am only 31.

Do my symptoms sound serious (serious in the pathological sense, not psychiatric )"
Does just laying there with your eyes closed give you any rest?,If you cannot sleep is it worth it to just lay there?
Inconsistent poor sleep,"My sleep has never been brilliant but seems to be up and down as to why, I had a period of time where I couldn't sleep until around 4 or 5am, until suddenly I could sleep again for around 6 hours. Then all of a sudden I began having 2 nights where I would sleep around 6am or not at all then 1 night of around 10 hours and repeat, then suddenly switched to sleeping between normal times but for 30 mins at a time at most. Recently I've started sleeping around 2 or 3am which isn't too bad but waking up at 6am for no apparent reason. There don't seem to be any changes I know of it just seems at random so as soon as I get used to my sleep it changes soon after"
Any ideas?,"Hey everyone, I thought I would write a post just in case anyone can relate - plus what else shall I do at 3 in the morning? ;-)

So it seems most people here developed sleep problems as children or adolescents. I was sleeping just fine until the age of 30. 

For the last year I've been struggling with some kind of new type of depression which has resulted in me being a lighter sleeper and waking up in the mornings, before I'm fully rested, so I'm almost always very tired and feeling rubbish. Sleep quality is also reduced. I'm taking St Johns Wort. 

I initially got stress related depression a few years ago but am only experiencing sleep issues now. 

My assessment is that there could be something wrong with hormones in my body e.g. thyroid, testosterone, etc. Doctor found nothing from basic blood test and psychologist is prescribing anti depressants which I'm really reluctant to take. I have the opinion that given the right nutrition and lifestyle all these problems should resolve themselves. 

Please don't bother with the usual sleep hygiene advice, as I'm already a ninja level. I am currently teetotal and caffeine free. Pitch black room. Red light filters on devices. Often wear earplugs. Healthy diet. Stop drinking water hours before bed. Some yoga. And so on. 

Can anyone relate? "
A month with no sleep,Hi I recently been having trouble falling asleep. I went 20 days with no sleep. Then 4 days of only little sleep. Now I'm back to 13 days with no sleep. I'm currently on an antipsychotic which I think is affecting my sleep. The strange thing though is I don't feel tired and my brain is working okay but from time to time my heart feels funny. I tried sleeping pills but they don't work. I'm worried that I will die from not sleeping because it doesn't look like I'm going to be sleeping anytime soon. I'm slowly getting off my antipsychotic but this no sleep is making me want to rush off of them. Has anyone experienced this. Could it be FFI? Help I'm a scared.
Anyone here taking trazodone?,Does it work for you? I've been taking it for a couple of months and it never once affected me. I started off with 50mg then 100mg and then 300mg. Never felt drowsy or anything with any of them.  Anyone else have this problem?
Insomniac parents,Any tips for falling back asleep when you have a baby that is waking up 1+ times a night? This is my baby #2 and I wake up so widely when she needs to eat (she’s 4 months) that falling back asleep is so hard (even though she does great). Pro tips?
Has anyone been prescribed promethazine (brand name: phenergan) for occasional insomnia due to anxiety?,"Mirtazapine used to work on me until lately. It left me waking up groggy and laggy in the day.

My psychiatrist then suggested using lorazepam. I was a bit concerned with a potential risk of cognitive impairment for it belonged to the class of benzodiazepines.

So he resorted to promethazine without mentioning other options.

I'm wondering if anyone here has something to share about this medication. In particular, I do wanna know how it compares to zolpidem (Ambien/Stilnox), in aspects such as pharmacokinetics. I am actually regretting not having raised these questions at the clinic.

Every answer will be much appreciated! :) Thanks

P.s. my English is not so fluent because I'm not a native speaker of it plz bear me with this 😉"
Do you feel the same?,"Soooo....this is Sleep Awareness Week....  
It seems like when a person has really been through something and comes out of it in victory, it creates a beautiful moment to pay it forward and help others who are still on their journey to their breakthrough – whatever that may be. ❤️  
For me, it’s sleep. I had HORRIFIC insomnia for over 12 years. Like REALLY bad. I would be up 12-14 days, couldn't nap, couldn't sleep AT ALL...then I would finally crash...for 1-2 hours. That's it. It led to disease, adrenal fatigue, gut issues and more.  
I was just reading an article and this year’s Sleep Awareness Week theme is ""Begin with Sleep"".   
As I was sitting here, reading what this theme is all about and what they are going to be touching on this week, (the benefits of optimal sleep, its effects on health, well-being and safety) I was thinking about what this theme would have meant to me 3, 5 or 10 years ago.  
When I dealt with horrific insomnia for over 12 years, I felt at times like it was going to take me out.  
As I was thinking about the theme for this week I thought ""So what?""...  
What do I mean by that?  
Well, that theme is all great for someone who sleeps good most of the time…someone who may not get enough sleep because of their own decisions (staying up late with friends, working late, etc. because it's what they want to do).  
But I’ll be honest with you.   
That theme would have almost felt hurtful to me when I was going through all those years of wanting SO badly to sleep…longing to be able to close my eyes and drift off to REM, literally willing to give up everything for one good night of restful, peaceful sleep.  
So as I was reading this article, I thought of you.   
I want you to know that someone hears you.   
Someone understands.   
And someone is standing beside you whispering in your ear that there is hope.   
There is hope that you will sleep again.   
There is hope that you will get your breakthrough and get the victory that I have experienced just last year.  
I know it may not seem like that today. I know a voice inside your head may be telling you otherwise.   
Don't listen to that voice.   
Listen to me instead. I don't have all the answers but I do know things can get better.  
Don’t stop moving towards your victory.  
Don’t ever give up or give in.  
Just remember my story. A simple girl from the Midwest that was in a horrible place not too long ago had a turnaround and is now sleeping and you can too.   
Have a blessed night.

Alcohol gets me every time,"Every single time I drink alcohol, anything more than 2 drinks, and I'm up in the middle of the night. All I want to  do is unwind and have a good time with my family and enjoy a couple of drinks, it's so frustrating."
Can chronic sleep-deprivation lower your IQ?,"I don’t mean in the short-term, of course that your mental performance isn’t as good when you didn’t have enough sleep the night before, but after a good night of sleep you usually go back to normal. What I’m asking is if years of sleep——deprivation can permanently impair your cognitive abilities in a way that even if you change your lifestyle or get treatment for insomnia and start sleeping a healthy number of hours every night your brain will never be the same."
"my anxiety is down, but still wont sleep???","Ok since I've been exercising yesterday was the first day I felt a bit free from anxiety. I felt tired for the first time in a long time. So in my mind I'm thinking ok maybe I'm back lol....but last night I truly believe I think I did go to sleep for a few hours. But I know that I laid down resting a lot or if not most of the night. 

Can this be a form of recovery going on??? Also my eyes are so bad right now. I feel pressure when I look at my computer screen"
Feeling Lost,"I shared this in r/sleep, but I'll post it here as well.

For the past two years I've suffered from none to very little broken up sleep. Originally this was from an overactive bladder, but even now that I've reduced the urge to urinate with medication I still can't get to sleep. Even in the rare case that I do fall asleep I'm still woken up 3 or 4 hours later and struggle to fall back asleep. I don't understand it, I'm young, I eat right, limit fluids, avoid alcohol and caffeine, exercise, multivitamin, you name it I've tried it. I just don't know what to do anymore.

The last thing I can think of is treating my anxiety, which hasn't been an issue since high school. I meet with a psychiatrist soon to see about this."
Tips for being awake after an all nighter?,"I have an important interview later today, right after pulling an all nighter... funny how that tends to work out.

I'm most concerned with being perceived as slow, quiet, the way I act when I'm tired.

Anyone with similar problems have tips for being alert, friendly, and most importantly: looking like a good job candidate? Any ideas would be helpful, since I'm so damn exhausted. "
Just can't fuckin fall asleep!,"I took a lunesta. Waited. Then melatonin. Wait. Then felt drowsy, but I had to cough. Woke me up. Felt freezing cold. Took Ambien CR. Turned off the air conditioning. Waited. Took more melatonin X2, nothing. Just took a sonata. If I can't fall asleep in half an hour, I will take a Benadryl. It's getting ridiculous! I can't fall asleep in 3 hrs with 6 pills. Ahhh! 😱"
food and supplement sensitivities behind insomnia,"Hello insomnia community.  I'm turning to you because a) you understand how horrible things can get, and 2) you have a lot of collective wisdom and wide experience not sleeping.  Here's my predicament...

I had severe insomnia for about a year, but that was 16 years ago, when I was suffering from severe agitated depression. I know about sleep hygiene, restriction, CBTi, and all the sleep herbs and drugs under the sun. Now I am happily medicated, although I am experiencing cognitive decline/impairment)   That may be from 10 years of Ambien 6 years ago, or from Paxil, as I've just learned. :-(

My insomnia now is sporadic, and I've discovered that LOTS of things keep me up. Some are typical: MSG, American ginseng,  caffeine (even small amounts of chocolate), stimulating movies, evening meetings, disagreements, traveling. I used to get raging insomnia before my period. Some things are weird: any lotions that ""stimulate"" anything (like collagen, cells, or hair growth), turmeric supplements, fish oil (even a piece of salmon for dinner!), ketogenic diet, Ginko biloba, fortified breakfast cereals, and other things I can't remember.  

I don't even know how to describe how sensitive my body is, much less what I can do about it.   

Does anyone else have issues like these?  I want to be more robust, so I can sleep reliably.  "

Sleep Maintenance Insomnia,"For the past 2 months off and on have had periods of high anxiety and life stress. Though I feel better now during the day I fall asleep around 9-10 and wake up first between 11-1am then 2-3 am and toss and turn till 5 am. 

I feel like I’m going to faint at work, highly irritable, verge of crying. 

I’ve tried CBD oil, ashwenganda, melatonin, meditation, hot showers, work out regularly, eat healthy. I fast from 7:30pm till 9am. Rarely drink coffee and if so before 10 am 1 cup. 

Just ordered magnesium and theanine. Use marijuana sometimes which helps a little. 

Also, I journal before bed and make to-do lists. Shut the phone down around 8:30 and read. 

What the hell am I missing? Anyone have success stories in overcoming sleep awakenings and insomnia? I’m ready to give up. "

Little or No sleep?,"When pulling an all-nighter would you feel less tired staying awake through the whole night and perhaps consume caffeine to keep you awake or would an hour or two of sleep be better? I know it sounds obvious to at least get SOME sleep but from prior experience getting very few hours of sleep makes feel very tired the next day and almost unable to function, yet if I don’t go to sleep instead I am still able to keep going.

Early morning insomnia,"I have something called early morning insomnia where I wake up at around 4:00 am to 6:00 am while others can enjoy their sleeping in. What can I do to stop this, or at least help it?"
"Mind projecting realistic images when falling asleep, normal?","I will try and keep this simple. My mind kinda 'projects' images when I close my eyes and try to fall asleep. This isn't like...dreams or your imagination roaming as you fall asleep, rather like...sudden detailed snapshots of things or faces coming to the forefront. Most of the time, the snapshot is of something I stared at a lot that day or simply saw that day .. like playing solitaire on my phone and then I see like ...a photorealistic image of all the card rows (in detail), or simply the cover of a movie I had looked at that day. A lot of times, I also see it if I open my eyes (but then it fades away faster) It isnt bothersome, I just notice it. It seems more prevelant now that my sleep is all backwards and I keep failing to fall asleep early.

Does anyone else get this sort of thing??"
What Helped You?!,"So I've had insomnia now for pretty much the entirety of my adult life. I'm 26 and I have been struggling with this since around 20. For me the ""episodes"" (or so I call them) happen in waves. I sometimes go weeks sleeping pretty decently, and then out of nowhere comes the horrible wave of no sleep. When it gets bad NOTHING helps. I have tried everything most people suggest: melatonin (my body laughs at that), Ambien, natural substitutes for sleep meds, Marijuana, working out to tire my body out, etc. When the episodes are mild the weed or ambien will do the job, but when it gets out of control I just have to endure the sleepless nights.I fantasize about a normal restful night's sleep and dream about the day I wont have to down a shit ton of chemicals to knock out. I think what it comes down to is my brain won't shut off at night, and the constant random thoughts that pop up refrain me from sleep. 

&#x200B;

So my question is.. what have I not tried that I need to consider? what should I try next?

Ya'll I'm losing my mind and I'm sure I'm not the only one on here feeling this way. "
Don’t recall ever sleeping a full night?,"I’m 38, I can’t recall ever sleeping right through the night, I wake several times and struggle to get back over I just assumed this was normal but I’m learning it’s not.

As I’ve got older I find I can’t get back over to sleep, I wake every morning 3-4am and that’s me, doesn’t matter if I go to bed at 1am I will still wake early.  I have zero issues falling over initially.

I’ve tried various tablets and supplements over the years for this, I still wake early but wake feeling doped up rather than raring to go.

The problem with all this poor sleep is it affects gym recovery as muscles build and repair when asleep and because I’m not getting enough I’m not getting anywhere in the gym.

Any tips or advice?"
Is wine for sleep as bad as it's made out to be?,"I have always been notorious in my group of friends for falling asleep after just half a glass of red wine. On the other hand, for prescribed medication, I could take enough antihistamines to knock out a horse and still anxiously keep myself awake at night. Klonopin is the only medication that knocks me out, but my psychiatrist has been trying to wean me off of that. I have horrible side effects with trazadone and antihistamines can mess with my stomach and make me feel nauseated.

Sun night to Mon morning,  after 0 sleep even with antihistamines, I felt horrible since I was hyped up on antihistamines AND had had 0 sleep. I bought some red wine, drank a bit, and took a 4-hour nap last night and then fell asleep again from midnight to 9 AM.

I have heard so many warnings about alcohol, from my developing a dependency to my experiencing liver damage to it causing restless sleep. But while I'm a heavyweight with what meds I take, I'm a lightweight when it comes to alcohol. Half a glass of wine and I'm so relaxed that I fall asleep easily. I have to keep plastic wrap to put over my glass since I can never finish it before I fall sleep.

So I know I sound a bit defensive here, but is wine all that bad if I can drink a tiny amount and sleep well while most medication makes me feel horrible and has mixed results on knocking me out?"
Should I try and sleep?,"It’s 3am now I have class at 8am.

Can exercise truly help me????,"I decided to get off quetiapine fumarate ""Seroquel"" and try to use exercise & breathing to get back my sleep and My life. Yesterday I had a great workout and felt great after. But when it was time to try to sleep I felt so numb. Like my brain was not able to figure out that it was time to sleep. This is the third month so far dealing with this CRAZY insomnia. I know the exercise is helping because I can feel it. Can it be the quetiapine causing this feeling of emptiness???

Also the doctors that gave me the quetiapine I'm no longer with. I've been taking quetiapine 25mg on and off for maybe two or three weeks. Its so bad right now. I'm awake right now and don't feel sleepy. This is scary. 

Also yesterday I found a new doctor that said that I should not be on quetiapine. And she now has me on trazodone at night and escitalopram in the day. Both are small dose. I haven't taken it yet because I'm so scared of meds. I want to try to use exercise daily and hope I can beat this terrible anxiety. 

Guys this is the third month of dealing with really bad insomnia. Do I give into meds or try to give exercise a really strong go for a week. God I cant believe this got so bad. This all happened over two jolts in my sleep and here we are 

thanks  "
A sleepless life.,"My entire life has been a losing battle with sleep. At night, my anxiety is unimaginable. Panic attacks, derealization, self harm, suicidal thoughts. I can’t take this anymore. I am not healthy in any sense.

Recently I’ve just been staying awake, crying until sunrise and sleeping until noon or later. The day is gone before I know it, having done nothing and gone nowhere, and it’s nighttime again. Restart the excruciating cycle, cue the debilitating anxiety.

I don’t want to live like this anymore. I can’t. 18 years of this is enough. My body and mind can’t take it. I fucking hate that I have to exist. There’s nothing I can do. I can’t get better, and I can’t die. I’m stuck. I can never be a fully functioning adult, and I can never be independent. I wish I was never born.

I‘m not planning suicide, don’t worry. Just needed to get this out, and this is my only option. Thanks for reading.

I didn’t expect that anyone would actually read this. I really appreciate the support, it means so much to me. Thank you!"

"As a physician, I get many parents that are sleep deprived and asking how to get a better nights sleep. Here are some tips you can try before you try medications","**Cross posted from:** [**r/sleep**](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/)•Posted by[u/LifeofDrMom](https://www.reddit.com/user/LifeofDrMom)

All you parents out there probably know the importance of a good nights rest. Without it, we are more cranky, irritable, and our mental health suffers. There is something called “sleep hygiene” that I recommend to all of my patients, young and old, who are having trouble sleeping. This is usually the first step your doctor will recommend before reaching for the prescription pad or any further testing. For people with insomnia or sleep deprivation the best proven treatment is not with medication but actually specialized cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. Sleep hygiene is a habit that you can start to form at night time to help the brain “shut off” so to speak. Because our brains are active and busy throughout the day, its hard for our brains just to turn off when we want them to.

Sleep hygiene is a set of behaviours you can implement at bedtime to help your brain shut off and get a good nights rest.

Parts of our society also contribute to peoples having difficulty sleeping – screens from iPads, iPhones, laptops, and TVs are a major contributor. These screens emit a type of light (blue light) that actually interferes with our hormones in our brain (melatonin) which disrupts our bodies sleep-wake rhythms. As a result, its more difficult to fall asleep at night.

What can i do to sleep better:

Create a comfortable sleep environment that is quiet, clean, and dark! Make sure your room does not have light coming in during the time you are asleep.

Don’t use your bed for anything but sleeping (sex is the only exception to this). Relax for 90 minutes before bed – no stressful conversations, intense tv shows, or working really hard.

Never go to bed hungry – if you need to, have a snack.

Go to bed at the same time every day, and wake up at the same time every day (this one is hard – especially when your on call over night at the hospital, but do it as much as possible because it is very important). Even if you get a crummy nights sleep the night before, still try to get out of the bed at the same time the next morning. Over time, with this your sleep will become more regular.

Get active throughout the day. Try and get at least 30 minutes of heart pumping exercise. Preferably at the beginning of your day, but for sure no later than 2-3 hours before you go to bed as this will prevent you from winding down.

Avoid alcohol – alcohol disrupts your restful stages of sleep, so although you might fall asleep easier and even sleep more, you will not spend your time sleeping in the restful stages which will make you much more tired the next day (anyone whose ever had a hangover probably has experienced this).

Don’t smoke, but if you do try not to smoke several hours before bed. Nicotine stimulates the brain and can make it more difficult to sleep.

Get as much natural sunlight throughout the day! This will help regulate your sleep-wake cycle. If you live in a part of the world that gets light at all hours (for example – Iceland in the summer time) – you will want to black out your house from light during the night and in the 2-3 hours before you wind down for bed.

Go to your doctor and have them review your medications – some medications can prevent people from falling asleep (like thyroid medications, and medications for ADHD). Likewise, some medications can make people sleep throughout the day (like medications for the heart). Optimizing medications that are interfering with your sleep may will help.

If you have difficulty with sleep, avoid napping throughout the day (unless you are a toddler). Napping throughout the day can throw off your sleep cycle making it more difficult to fall asleep, and stay asleep, at night.

Sleep hygiene is a process and you do need to be patient! Hang in there, be persistent and consistent with the changes you made!"

How to Stop 20 Years of Trazodone?,"If it weren't now considered to be such a huge risk factor for dementia, I'd stay on it. I'm 54. Until 2014, I was on 100, then dropped to 75, and now on 50, tho recently I've used bigger doses to fall and stay asleep. 

I have other risk factors: genetics ( homozygous for MTHFR and COMT mutations), one APOE gene, lifelong anxiety and major depression, and was on benzos for 24.5 years. Dementia, imo mixed Alzheimer's and vascular, killed my dad in early 2018. My wiring seems not unlike his, but very luckily for me, I received testing at a mental health clinic this year that revealed the mutations, and I now take l methylfolate and B12.

So far, my heart has done nothing unusual. 

I want to remove trazodone from my life. Been on it 20+ years. I used the Ashton Method to taper off benzos, over a period of 1.5 years, going comfortably from 1.5-2 mgs of klonopin/d to 0. Cold turkey twice may have caused some brain damage. I'm also 3 years out from menopause. My cognition is shit. I don't want to see it get worse. 

Anyone have a good plan for a trazodone taper? Also, what might I take for rebound  insomnia that won't further bollix my brain?"

I wanna here your “fun” stories of over exhaustion,I decided to ask this because I’ve been sleeping very little to not at all the past few weeks and have hit a point where very mundane tasks become extremely difficult. I was cooking for my self and threw a cup of water in to pan with boiling water with out thinking about it and nearly started a house fire as it took me a couple of moments to realize what the hell was happening. Please share any similar stories. Thank youv 
I sleep 8 hours with the help of pills and feel drowsy the whole day,"Hi! So a week back my doctor gave me some pills to finally sleep after so many years. The first days I was super happy because I went to sleep at midnight and woke up at 8, so I got the perfect eight hours for my body. But now I realized it's very hard to get out of bed and I feel drowsy for the whole day. The pills I take are Zopidem Desgen 10mg. Does anybody know if there is a relationship?"

Haven’t been able to sleep for a month - don’t know why!,"So self-explanatory title but...my body is extremely tired and I find myself exhausted every day but my mind just won’t shut off! 3 mg of Melatonin has no effect on me anymore.

How can I stop the influx of garbage  thoughts that pervade my mind every single day for hours on end?

If 15mg of Sonata isn't working will 5 more help?,"TL;DR basically the title. 

I'm totally awake, like that leg bouncing awake where you know the night ahead is gonna be a tough one.

I'm not manic right now, I feel 100% confident about that statement. I'm 26 bipolar 2, I take 300mg lamictal during the day. I don't think this is related but maybe important info to know. I've had bouts of insomnia my entire life.

Anyway, is there something I can do? Can i take another 5 and expect results from there? I need to sleep

Took my first dose 5mg, an hour+ later I felt absolutely nothing.  So I took 10mg, an hour 1/2 later I feel slightly more than nothing but so close its comparing white to off white

Will taking another 5 be the push to make things work?
(while waiting for it to kick in I'm in a fully dark room, sleep routine complete, 100% ready for bed, I ate a light dinner an hour+ before)

All of the thanks. "
3 days awake but still not yet sleepy,"I’ve been awake since Sunday, and it’s now Tuesday. I’ve actually had a 2 hour nap though, but that’s that.
I also had intense exercise under the sun yesterday to wear myself out but still wide awake.

The longer i’m awake, the harder it is to sleep, and the more stressed out i get. it’s like my adrenalin is constantly pumping or something.

I’m really desperate for sleep, i want to cry.
I don’t know what to do anymore."
Daylight savings set me back.,"I was starting to get a few hours of sleep a night, but the anxiety and panic of “springing forward” and losing an hour of sleep made me unable to sleep Saturday night. Now I’m back to feeling anxious and sick and unable to sleep.

My anxiety sky rockets on big days and i end up with zero sleep no matter what,"I play tennis every Monday and it’s something i look forward to a lot.

My anxiety always sky rockets though. While i could somewhat sleep on regular days, during the nights before days i’m excited about, **nothing works**.

I’ve drank 35mg of Melatonin and 10mg of diphenhydramine and i ended up having only an hour of sleep. I was so frustrated that i was yelling with my face buried on a pillow and just punching stuff out of so much stress.

i’ve tried going to a different room and reading a book, tried sleeping in a different room, tried having a snack. tried meditating. tried relaxing my body part by part. Nothing works.

I had an intense match today under the blazing sun and i was a worried i’d pass out. I’m obviously also having breathing difficulties and heavy movement.

I’m literally the walking dead.

This only happens on big days.

Why am i like this? I feel so frustrated and i have zero clue on what to do."
tired but energetic,"I'm so confused on why I get specifically 3.5 hours of sleep each night, with one night specifically 6 hours. It's so precise, as well as the fact that I don't feel tired all day with 3.5, just in the evening  whereas 6 hours leaves me feeling awfully dead.

I feel like my body is treating the short spans of sleep like power naps I guess but it's odd.

Man I'd kill for a solid eight hours sleep, I have exams and job interviews coming up goddamnit. 

Anyway, does any one else get this? (I'm guessing yes but I think it's peculiar and I'm interested in seeing how many people are the same)"

"Anyone sleep good one night, bad the next, then good the next?",It seems like that’s what’s going on lately.

Guys I’m not tired and it’s freaking me out,I have had insomnia since I’d say middle school. If I get 5 hours of sleep in a night it’s probably the best night of sleep I’m getting that week. But I’ve grown pretty used to the cycle of it all. Anyways for the past two days I have been completely unable to fall asleep and I haven’t felt tired or lethargic at all. Which is strange because normally I feel exhausted but I can’t force my mind to shut down. Anyone experienced this?
Has anyone bought the $250usd service from Sveti Williams and became naturally able to easily fall asleep?,
What to do if you have insomnia but afraid to take meds??,"Hi. 

Little background. I always had bad anxiety. Bout two years ago I started to get insomnia while working 3rd shift. Went to the ER after a two day sentence with no sleep. (Biggest waste of time) but they gave me Atarax 25mg. Being a wimp, I'd brake them in half. Most nights it would eventually get me to sleep. Then someone suggested melatonin to me. I bought 3mg of those and same story. Broke them in half.  This went on for about 3-4months. Then I stumbled on to something about magnesium deficiencies. And how insomnia is one of the symptoms. Along with anxiety and a few other symptoms that I just happen to have. So my ass googled foods with the highest amounts of magnesium. Went to the grocery store and got to it. And it really started to help. I ended up getting off 3rd shift and  then my sleep drastically improved. For a good few months I slept great. Then I started having issues again that was pointing towards possibly having a magnesium deficiency so I been dealing and stressing over that. Which brings us to this past Monday where my sleep started to go down hill. I got a lot of sleep over the past weekend. Then Monday night I only got around 5 hours. And it's been declining ever since. Now I'm lucky if I even get 3. The only Atarax I have left is old. I have some Lorazepam 0.5mg that I've never taking. And melatonin 3mg that I tried taking last night but didn't help. People keep suggesting Tylenol P.m or NyQuil, none of which I've taking.  Any suggestions??"
Scared to go to sleep now,"I'm now scared to get into my bed and try to sleep, I stay up as late as possible avoiding it. Once I turn my light off and get into bed my heart starts pounding and my breath gets short. My mind starts racing. I start thinking will this be another night of tossing and turning?  I'm even scared when I feel sleep coming on, I get intense anxiety and wake back up. Its hard to let go. "
I slept from 1:00 am to 9:15 am! So proud of myself.,
Anyone dealt with insomnia from coming off Mirtazapine/Remeron?,"I did an accelerated taper to get off Mirtazapine because I'm doing a new drug therapy trial and can't be on antidepressants. Now I'm lucky if I get five hours of sleep a night. Part of the reason why I went on Mirtazapine was because of sleep issues but now it feels like it screwed up my sleep even worse coming off it. Right now I'm on about 10 mg of Melatonin and 50 mg of Hydroxyzine and that gets me to sleep but I still wake up early.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Does it get better? FYI, I've been off Mirtazapine for a little over three weeks. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Edit: Also, if you are going or having gone through these type of issues when tapering, what dosage did you start out at before your taper? How long have you been tapering? Also, what's your taper schedule been like? Thanks!"
"Anyone had success with a non-standard prescription sleep med, if only for a few days?","I have DSPD, Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Since my mid-teenage years, sleeping before 2-3 AM has been an impossibility for me. I'll keep this short because I'd imagine not being to sleep at all sucks far worse than my situation.

For my job, I need to change my hours drastically for a few days. My psychiatrist has prescribed me ""the usual suspects"" for past similar (but shorter) situations, and none have worked: Ambien, Lunesta, Sonata, Trazodone, Seroquel, Doxepin, Mirtazapine, Rozerem, Belsomra, melatonin, and lots of OTC/herbal medications. 

 I looked at drugs.com and surprisingly found lots of medications I have yet to try. So all is not lost. Have any of you successfully had a good night's sleep even if only for a few nights on any prescribed sleep medication not on this list? Have any failed? All experiences welcome! I know the ""none of us are doctors"" disclaimer, but others' experiences will really help here, as my doctor has told me to do some research myself as to what might help.

Remember, I will only be taking this medication for four nights at the most. Then I will return home and can return to my unusual circadian rhythm. Thank you!"
I've become extremely paranoid the second I attempt to sleep,"Okay this isnt the best place to post this but i cant think of anywhere else to post this. So recently (last 2 weeks) I've been unable to sleep until the early hours of the morning because I am absolutely paranoid something is in the house.

My bedroom is above the sitting room and all our animals are always locked in the kitchen. There's a bird nest at the corner of my room in the gutters but I know what they sound like. There's no attic either so no real chance of critters. 

When I start settling down for the night I hear thuds and noises, almost like someone just mooching around in the living room during the day. They're the same sounds like someone picking up or putting down a tv remote or sitting on the couch. The tv is always off and same with any console. There's nothing that can really be making noises down there.

I'm a big skeptic too so I don't really believe in the paranormal. And even if I did there's nothing that's happened in my house to warrant that sort of activity (the house is relatively new and we knew the owners before us). But sometimes I hear shit when I know completely that no one could actually be down there

I've become paranoid to the point of breakdowns in the night and always get up in the night to walk down the hallway to find both my parents and my brother asleep. Animals too. I never really muster up the courage to actually go downstairs tho (cause lets face it im a rather small woman in the case of something being there). 

I have honestly no idea what to do because it's stressing me out so much and I'm constantly anxious. I don't know if it's auditory hallucinations possibly manifesting due to school stress (I have big exams coming up) or what but I feel  like I'm going insane. My mom thinks I'm just anxious and need to exercise more or whatever but idk. 

What do y'all think?? Is there any sort of solution??"
Seeing vivid images every time i drift off,"Like I will lay there, just kinda drifting off...having my imagination take over (which is normal) and then BAM i get a 'flash' of a persons face. Not just a flash, but like...it stays there for like a solid minute in the absolute most vivid, detailed way. It is like literally, physically looking at a photo. I open my eyes at this time and it is still there, just as clear. Then it fades out. I try and sleep again and it does it again. O have never had this happen before but it seems routine for me the last week or so. Like multiple times a night. Am i dying or going nuts? This doesnt seem like normal going to sleep inagery if it happens a lot and sticks in my vision even when opening my eyes."
Melatonin +magnesium,Anybody takes melatonin and magnesium together to help getting better sleep? Is it safe to do so?
Even if I take a 15 minute nap it will ruin any chance of sleep I may of had,Does this happen to anyone else? I uncontrollably fall asleep when I'm relaxing from exhaustion but if i accidently fall asleep for more than 15 minutes I know i won't be sleeping that night.
Does anyone else dread Daylight Savings time?,"Something about losing an hour of sleep triggers a bout of insomnia with me. I don't know why, something about losing that hour of sleep (or at least that hour of trying to sleep)? I've been dreading this for weeks."
"My body's saying 'Let's go,' but my head is saying 'no'","So I've started experiencing a whole new level of hell with insomnia. In the last few months, especially when I'm really tired, I am sometimes entering this weird ""sleep"" where I can feel my body shut down, but my brain is still running normally. It's so weird. When I feel it happen, I can feel the vasoconstriction starting (my extremities all get very tingly, then almost numb, but not unpleasantly) and I can feel all my muscles relax. My breathing becomes slow and relaxed like it does when you fall asleep, and every physical part of me feels as though I've entered into sleep.

Except my brain. My thought processes still run as usual. I could be thinking about going to work, grocery shopping, etc. It is the most bizarre sensation to have my body be asleep, but my brain be awake. Additionally, I've experienced sleep paralysis in the past, but this isn't it. It's something else entirely. And I get bored. Because consciously, I'm just fucking laying there awake while my body sleeps.

Has anyone else experienced this?"
It's not working. Everything. All useless.,"Nothing can push me through the night. I tried every other pills, dozens of them, and nothing came out of it. Only ambien can, but I always overtake it and lost control during the process, severe selfharm, going out while unconscious, etc. Now my mom and my doctors probably will never let me use it again. I am lost. I don't know what to do. Scars, or consious sufferings.

They all say you can't go on like this, you would collapse.
And all I can say is, yeah."
My experiences with insomnia (tips from a recovering insomniac),"First of all if any of you suffer from acute insomnia and haven't yet seen a GP - go see one. My biggest mistake was that I was too stubborn to go to the doctor, when I suffered from stress-induced insomnia.

&#x200B;

The following is a couple of experiences I've had battling my insomnia. They might work for you and they might not . Insomnia has many faces - figuring out what triggers your insomnia is the first step towards treating it.

&#x200B;

(If you don't suffer from mental-health issues or respiratory diseases, you can skip the following two paragrahps).

&#x200B;

As mentioned my insomnia started when I was going through a stressful time in my life. I had too much work and there was an imbalance between workload and spare time. Therefore, if any of you feel like things are out your hand, that you have just too much on your plate - take a break. When I found out just how stressed I was, I sought out help from a psychotherapist and gave myself a six-month vacation to calm down and recover. This helped me immensely. Your mental health is alfa-omega when dealing with insomnia, so do not hesitate to get psychotherapy.

&#x200B;

Second of all, I suffer from asthma and allergy, which means I use steroid-inhalers daily. The side affects of these vary individually. I found out that they have an arousing affect on me, so I started taking my medication earlier in the day.  Another implication of having allergy is that I have very sensitive sinuses and get a clogged nose very easily, which in turn made me breath through my mouth instead of my nose, which then made me wake up with dried out mouth several times a night. To counteract this I started using a presciption nasal-spray and started breathing more through my nose during the day. The latter may be counterintuitive, but the logic is this: how can a vital organ of the body function, without it being used? Think of it as a muscle - they grow when they're used and wither when not. As I looked in to it, the connection between breathing and sleeping is also very well known. E.g. when you focus on your breath you stimulate the prefrontal cortex of your brain, which regulates emotions and that might help you to relax, which is why mindfulness meditation work for some. So if you're suffering from respiratory issues - go see a GP.

&#x200B;

The most effective thing I implemented however was CBT. Shit works. Mainly for me it has helped regarding the anxiety that I got every time I went to bed. Now if I feel uneasy or unable to sleep it's okay, because I know, that if don't fall asleep within 20-30 minutes, I just get out of bed and do something that I enjoy and that is also relaxing. Like reading a nice book or taking a shower. CBT has proven to be the most effective treatment for insomnia. In studies it has been found to be more long-term beneficial than medication. As CBT is so often mentioned on this page, I won't go any further into describing it's benefits and principals because it's mentioned a lot on this sub, but seriously if you haven't tried it yet - try it. You can find all the information you need regarding CBT through a quick google search.

&#x200B;

Blue light: Do not use your phone or computer in bed and at least one hour prior to sleep. Your circadian rythm is heavily dependant on the balance between light and darkness. Try out som blackout curtains aswell to block out the light that might wake you up in the morning. Sunglasses are also very useful in blocking out light, when you just have to watch a game of late night sports or a good movie. F.lux is also helpful in limiting blue light.

&#x200B;

And there's one last thing which I've found to be helpful: when you go to bed find a comfortable position and then just lie still. Don't move whenever you feel an urge to do so. The logic behind this is that just as being physically active make you more awake - the opposite must be true. Physical inactiveness should make you more sleepy. It's a theory of my own making and therefore it might not work for you, but try it out.

&#x200B;

Lastly, to anyone out there feeling like life just isn't worth living. Hang in there. You have so much to live for. Don't let insomnia get the better of you, and I for one believe in you and your ability to change your life for the better. Seek comfort in the fact that you are not alone and there will always be people on this sub to support you, when the going gets tough.

&#x200B;

And thanks to all of you for all the guiding I've had from reading this sub.

&#x200B;

(pardon for my short-comings in english. I'm not a native speaker).

&#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to mention caffeine and nicotine. There's a very common misunderstanding regarding how long caffeine affects your sleep. When people say that caffeine only affects your sleep for 5-8 hours, they're actually thinking of the half-life of caffeine, which is 5-8 hours. Therefore if you get 300mg of caffeine by noon you'd still have 150mg in your system by the time you go to sleep. My advice is to not drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages after noon."
daylight savings can eat shit,"already was awake bc can’t sleep and have to be up at 7, now daylight savings hit and i lost another hour :) :)"
I gave in and got Ambien. The results were not as expected.,"My cardiologist who is also board certified in sleep medicine was alarmed to see I only sleep 2-3 hours the few days I was in hospital. He questioned me on whether I was just uncomfortable in the surroundings but I laughed and told him I never sleep more than that. 

He was shocked and said how bad that is, and he made a note of it. Offered me low-dose, one month Ambien to work on my sleep and then we’ll start aggressively attacking whatever is keeping me up (dozens of labs, sleep Study if I want it, checking hormones finally but first electrolytes iron etc etc). So I happily accepted, battled with my insurance to cover it, and hopped into a bed after a long day. 

And waited. And waited. Finally knocked out at 2am and woke at 7, assuredly an improvement however slight but not what I had expected. A friend said she was on 10mg I’m on 5 so maybe that’s why? Anyway. I’ll take it, but it’s no magic pill. Hopefully the extra sleep will help me clear my head and be more focused on fighting my health issues. 

Much love to all my fellow sufferers. He’s Ivy League educated and laughed when I said my PCP said mild potassium and magnesium deficits couldn’t cause insomnia. He says they can, do maybe that should be checked too? Just an idea for anyone with an uncooperative doc like I had prior. I am anemic which used to keep me sleeping 7 hours a day but now it’s turned on me. Still anemic, 20 Years off and on and no longer can sleep at drop of a hat. "
Sleep restriction therapy - Can your body adapt to it and make insomnia worse?,"My girlfriend’s insomnia has recently gotten to the point where she now doesn’t sleep at at during the night. She has tried to do different aspects of CBT, like not being in the bedroom before bed or using her phone past dinner time, but she still couldn’t sleep. 

So recently, she started going to bed late and getting up early. After a few nights, she actually got a few hours of sleep; the first time in a while. 

However, the following nights were sleepless, again. She actually doesn’t feel as tired in the morning as she did before, though she still has a hard time going through 9 pm - 12 AM. 

Can the body adapt to it and actually require less sleep? And how long. Does it take to see beneficial effects to your sleep? She has been doing it for over a week, but not much more and she’s already feeling discouraged because of what I described. 

Also, how should I feel about that? We’re not sleeping together anymore because she can’t sleep next to me and I understand. However, yesterday, I had 5 hours of sleep and I felt completely drained, but I felt bad because she wasn’t showing that she felt drained, though she had close to 0 hours of sleep. And I sleep very well and so easily. It often makes me feel bad to be tired after sleeping so much, compared to her. 

Thank you very much for reading this and helping. "
Insomnia and keep waking up after dreams finish,"I've had a lot of issues with sleep over the past 5 months which led to me taking sleeping pills for a few weeks, followed by lorazapam and mirtazipine (remeron) - both of which I only took for 2 weeks and then stopped. 

I now find myself unable to fall sleep for hours despite feeling sleepy and being near the point to where I usually would drop off to sleep and remain asleep. After a few hours I'll enter a dream (or what feels like a dream, sometimes it feels like a dream in a wakeful state) and then wake up as soon as this dream has finished and it's only been 20 / 30 mins. This will happen throughout the night : dream - wake up - dream - wake up - dream - wake up. 

The periods in between waking up and falling back to ""sleep"" again can also be lengthy too.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? It's been a week like this for me and it's getting really uncomfortable for me. I've probably only slept 2-3 hrs max a night this last week due to this. "
I did sleep but wake up tired sleepy like I didn't sleep at all.,"Help. This been happening for three nights in a row and I don't know what's wrong. I fall asleep easily even I woke up in the middle of the night I fell asleep again. But the next morning I am extremely tired and sleepy like I never slept in the first place. I don't know why. My neck hurts and I have mild headache. Last night, I woke up with my left leg feeling dead. Is that normal? I don't know what's wrong. I just started a new job and its been going well. I don't want this to be a setback for me. I have experienced insomnia for 5 years. When the first time I had it, it have similar symptoms like this one. At that time I couldn't fall asleep like at all maybe an hour or two per night sometimes nothing at all. It was the worst time of my life. I pushed through with no meds. Nothing. I don't even know how I did it. And now the symptoms is coming back again and I don't know what's wrong. I've been to doctors, plenty of em they don't know what's wrong with me. My symptoms consist of brain fog, extremely sleepy even though I did sleep, legs feeling dead when I wake up, mild headache, neck pain, my menstrual cycle stopped ever since my insomnia started (Yes, I have to take medications for it). I've gone to plenty of specialists and doctors. No one could figured me out but I still pushed through.  But now its coming back and I'm not sure if I have any strength left in me."
Insomnia suddenly getting better,"Hey there!

A couple of weeks ago I started to fall asleep at night without even noticing it, and it's been like that ever since. 

A bit of background: I started having insomnia over four years ago. I was writing my dissertation at the time and working a lot overnight. I work much better at night, but then at 7 am I'd have trouble falling asleep. So I started taking Ambien to sleep on those days. At about that same time, my partner started snoring louder than ever. I mean, it was a nightmare (ironically). He got surgery, but the problem never went away completely and his snoring would still keep me up. After a while I decided to go back to my normal sleeping hours to see if that would make things better. It didn't work. And so, the insomnia became a constant in my life.

Ever since I would only be able to sleep a full nights sleep after taking Ambien. No specific thoughts would keep me up, I was able to really relax up to a point of almost being in trance, but then I would open my eyes, need to pee, feel uncomfortable, too hot, etc. I wasn't kept up by anxiety or worries about my dissertation, for instance. So much so, that after it had been accepted and I was finally done with it, I still wouldn't sleep. 

I didn't understand: how could other people do it? I tried everything from tea, yoga, meditation and mindfulness, acceptance techniques, ASMR, aromatherapy, no blue light, exercise regularly during the day, you name it.

But then, about four weeks ago, I started sleeping naturally again. Just like that. I remember waking up in the morning and thinking ""what the bleep just happened? When did I fall asleep?""

The only thing that had changed recently was that I started CBT again. But it's weird, 'cause I still hadn't had any time to implement the techniques the therapist suggested. And I've been doing nothing special, no meditation, no nothing. Just going to bed.

I still don't know what exactly happened, but hey: I sure hope it stays like that!

Just wanted to share some good news :)"
Late night thoughts: the worst part about growing up is realising that all your idols were wrong.,"I know this is not the conventional thing to post on here but I thought it would be helpful for me to keep a log of the thoughts that keep me up at night, so here it goes. As a child I used to idolise my father and my mother, only to grow up to realise that they’re severely flawed human beings like the rest of the world. When I was a teenager I turned to the one place I could to find a role model: film. This one film in particular stuck with me; it was called Into The Wild. Christopher McCandles was my absolute idol at 17 years old. I remember I couldn’t wait to come home back from school and watch the story of his life from my laptop. Now, 2 years later, I realise that he was wrong about a lot of things. His whole philosophy, no matter how right he may have been, is the reason he’s dead right now. It makes me wonder, is everything I’ve ever admired or aspired to be just bullshit? Does growing up mean you have to let go of every fantasy you’ve ever had of things getting better and just let your life happen to you, one disastrous moment at a time?"
"I created my own technique to fall asleep, and it's working! Hoping this helps others!","I have tried many, many things to help me fall asleep at a reasonable hour regularly. I came up with this idea and it has been showing really positive results for me! I feel like I have taken control of my sleep! Let's do this:

Hypnagogia is the experience of the transitional state between wakefulness to sleep. During this transition, the mind can create a wide variety of sensory hallucination, the most common being visual and auditory, but can also be tactile and nonsensical thoughts.

For the sake of this technique, we will only be focusing on sight and sound.

Visual experiences can range from bright flashes, random speckles, lines or geometrical patterns, to a nonsensical recreations of physical reality, similar to what you experience in a dream.

Auditory experiences vary in intensity from faint impressions like white noise (babies sleeping to white noise might be helping them reach the hypnagogic state), to loud noises, like knocking, crashing and bangs, to sentences being spoken or someone saying your name.

 

The Technique

This technique involves tricking the mind into believing it has entered the hypnagogic state of consciousness, so it can take the next step and allow the body and mind to enter sleep mode.

To trick the mind, you must simply create the experience of Hypnagogia inside your mind. The easiest to recreate is the visual experiences. 

The first step is to close your eyes, and completely relax your eyes and eyelids.

Next, visualise the moving patterns you would see in a kaleidoscope. Rather than with bright colours, make the geometric patterns grey and dull. Mine appear more like dark swirling clouds. Focus only on this visual disregarding the minds random thoughts, just as you would focus on one thing only during a meditation.

Once you can visualise this, the next step is to allow yourself to step into the scene happening inside your mind. Leave your physical body behind and feel yourself in your non-physical body inside your mind.

This alone should be enough to create a momentary shift in your reality that feels much closer to sleep. 

The final aspect you can add is the sounds, or rather lack of sounds. Focus your hearing on the scene you have created in your mind. You should experience silence or a very low dull hum. This will help you fully immerse into your kaleidoscope scene. 

Try this every night, and work on holding the visual for longer periods of time. For the first week you might only be able to hold this in your mind for a few seconds before your mind interrupts you. That will be long enough to fall asleep if you keep trying, although it may take 20 attempts. Keep trying when the distractions come up.

Once you have began to pay attention to the hypnagogic state, you should start discover different visuals that you experience naturally as you fall asleep, and you can recreate these as they may work better for you.

Would love to hear anyone else's experiences/results after trying this!"
Guys a question about Quetiapine & Lamotrigine???,"Hey guys im back

 So I had a terrible case of insomnia & anxiety that happened in late jan. I posted on here as well what I was experiencing. My sleep was gone and it almost drove me mad lol....since then I've been put on meds for the first time, which still scares me.

 My question. The doctors said that they want me on Quetiapine 25mg at night for sleep. And they want me on Lamotrigine 25mg in the morning. They told me its not addictive. They said that they want me on this medication until my anxiety can get back to normal. Are they lying? Or is it possible to get back to your normal self threw these medications???

 I had this same type of thing happen to me in 2010. And I beat it threw exercise & breathing. But I think the difference now is that I'm working now. And I'm also battling a terrible stomach bacteria for almost a year now. I'm sure my body is not getting the right amount of nutrition to make me better so I can fight this.

 But yeah can medications truly cure you???

 Thanks everyone"
"Alright, I'm sick of it. How are we going to cure this shit?","I'm not gonna sit down for one more day and be at the mercy of a disease that objectively destroys every good thing in life.  


Chronic insomniacs have a miserable quality of life -- and it's simply not understood by those who are not afflicted with it.  


This disease is a silent killer; when you're not sleeping, you're not living.  


So how are we going to fix this, because it seems like NO ONE knows how bad this shit is but those who are afflicted by it. So if anyone's gonna fix it, it has to be us.  


Let's find a cure."
Anyone else only capable of sleeping for 1.5-2 hours max at a time?,"I was taking 1 mg Ativan and that was helping to get me to 3-4 hour stretches, but I quit taking it every night so I wouldn’t become dependent. I’ve been trying 10 mg melatonin or CBD syrup that also has 2.5 mg melatonin along with 100-200 mg L-Theanine. My insomnia started milder about 6 weeks ago, but it got worse like this about 2 weeks ago."
I fucking did it!!! I've made a breakthrough.,"For the first time ever in my life, I slept at least 7 hours a night during all 5 nights of the work week,  and went to a 7-3 job each day.  (I also worked my part time job at night!) 

I have always worked jobs that start late in the day,  and lately I've been substitute teaching because of the flexibility.  If I can't sleep I simply don't work that day and nobody cares.  

BUT I'VE STARTED A FULL TIME JOB AND I FINALLY DID IT! Of course the first few weeks were awful though lol.  

I'm just so happy.  

I credit EVERYTHING to exercise.  Yoga with Adrienne on youtube every day and gym a few times a week.  Just feeling so good about focusing on my health and having better habits about using my energy the right way have made all the difference.  

I hope this isn't just a fluke! 

Thanks for reading.  I'm so glad this sub exists and that we're not alone in this.  

Exercise exercise exercise.  I'll never go back.

Sleep restriction seems to be working but coming off Mirtazapine is making it more difficult.,"Second week of sleep restriction of seven hours in bed a night. It actually seems to be working. I sit in the dark in a room waiting for midnight to hit so I can sleep and it's hard, can feel my brain craving sleep. I have also reduced my hours at work, so it could also be that I have less on my plate. 

Ive had two nights with poor/broken sleep, one was because I had an UTI that kept me up.

I mean I feel like shit not going to lie. But getting there. 

I'm also coming off six years on mirtazapine as didn't want to stop it once my sleep was fixed and have rebound insomnia. Decided on two birds with one stone approach. Having pretty crappy withdrawals starting today, almost like a part of my brain has been sucked out. 

Has anyone managed to successfully come off mirtazapine? "
Fight Club Opinions,Just wondering how you all feel about fight club and it’s portrayal/description of insomnia 
Trazodone,"I went to the clinic I regularly go to for HRT (I'm on testosterone), and I told the doc I couldn't sleep and that I was starting a new job soon. Diphenhydramine and melatonin stopped working for me, and I've already tried valerian and kava kava. She recommended trazodone, as she's on it herself. She said it was a game changer for her, so I really hope it is for me, too.

Just took my first 50 mg tablet. Hoping to get some rest tonight. 🤞"
Waking up thrashing and ready to fight,"For the last year or so I've been getting violent outburst kind of like sleep terrors but I'm half asleep when they happen.  Happens a lot when I hear a sound that wakes me up partially. Any body else have this?

Most of the time I think I'm being attacked in my bed and fall around violently and it feels very real. It isn't a nightmare my mind just suddenly screams INTRUDER NEXT TO YOU WAKE UP. 

It just happened to me right now and my foot is bleeding from cleaning my night stand and my legs are cramping pretty bad. I like to think of myself as a gentle person and it really hurt to see my dog and cat shaking with fear in the corner of the room.

Sometimes the ""intruder"" can be linked to a noise and if it's not in my room I don't thrash. I however go on high alert, this happened once as my mom peaked in to make sure the cat was with me and only seeing her hunched over outline half asleep I screamed WHO ARE YOU and I was all ready for a fight and shaking with adrenaline for about an hour. She was fine but I really hate that I would act so hostile at family.

They started happening when I went on mid-day 3-11 shift a year ago, however I get much better sleep on it then morning.

I have no trama though I've always been sensitive to bumps in the night."
Never being able to sleep fucking sucks,"I know this is dumb, but I just want to rant. I have to get up at 7:00 every morning and I usually stay up til 5:00. Sorry for lack of details, but fuck you brain "
Overdosed but still didn't sleep,"Overdosed on meds bur still couldn't fall asleep. Just got really really sick. 100mg trazodone. 2 mg Klonopin. 4 unisom. 4 melatonin. Feel more tired and sick still can't sleep. Only 2 hours yesterday, probably zero tonight."
8pm to midnight sleep schedule,"Well this is the weirdest yet. Under immense pressure at work so I’m simultaneously exhausted but also wake up and start stressing. 

First time my insomnia had manifested this way.  Usually I’m awake and asleep every 2 hours throughout the night but I’m sleeping a solid 4-5, just would be nice if I didn’t pass out on the couch at 8 and just stay awake when my husband wakes me at midnight to “go to bed” - thanks now I’m up all night."
Sleep aides never work,"Remeron lets me sleep for two hours at the most. Melatonin doesn’t work. Benadryl doesn’t even make me yawn. Nothing helps. I don’t fall asleep until 4 almost every single morning and when I do fall asleep, it’s almost physically impossible to get out of bed!!! "
Phd Defense in 7 hrs,"Im defending for a PhD at 9am and its 2am and Im wide awake. Good news is that the gym opens 4 hours. Wish me luck!

Edit: I PASSED!"
Feeling like I didn't sleep. Blanking out for like 3 hours and waking up in the middle of the night,"Okay.. I have these pseudo sleep pills, and now a couple recent times when I have took them I open my eyes again after a period of apparently (not sleeping) but incredibly long periods of time have passed. Like 3-4 hours 

So it feels like I haven't slept but it's been too long for me not to actually notice"
could i beat insomnia by staying up for 24 hours straight?,and then passing out because the human body can only be awake for so long?
Can we talk about how awfully boring insomnia is?,"At night I can't sleep, I can't use any screens and I'm too tired to do any of my hobbies. My concentration and memory are horrible so I can't even read books so I just....sit. It sucks.

And then during the day I'm too tired to engage in meaningful social interactions or activities. I have to spend at least an hour in the gym every day to get at least some sleep and after that I'm too tired to do anything. Last night I did not have enough energy to even shower. Everything is exhausting but not exhausting enough to sleep. So I just sit here waiting for sleep to come. 


How do you guys occupy yourselves during the night? 

"
7 am sleep doctor appointments are just mean,"I had to be awake at 6, which is my bedtime.

“We know you don’t sleep at the normal time, so we’ll make you wake up bright and early and ruin the rest of your day!”"
"I’ve never met anyone with this issue, but very often I can’t fall asleep (especially when I wake up very early in the morning) because I can’t keep my eye balls still. Like since I can’t focus on anything, they just move rapidly and keep my awake.","So like the title says, I will have my eye lids shut but my eye balls will be constantly moving around, as if they need something to focus on but there is nothing to focus on. It’s actually exhausting. I’ve never really had this problem up until this last year. It’s like I don’t have this problem, until I think of the problem and then it just doesn’t go away. I usually just give up on sleeping because it is so frustrating. It has nothing to do with me not being tired enough to sleep either. I’m always really sleepy when it happens. I can’t find anything about this online either so I have no idea how to go about fixing this issue. It’s often in the early morning (4-5am) but still happens when I go to bed or wake up in the middle of the night. Can anyone relate to this?"
"Hey everyone who is a long time insomniac, when did it start for you?",For me it was a fairly traumatic incident(s) as a tween...25yrs later nothing has changed.(except now I have a psychiatrist 😀)
.why can't i sleep anymore?,like today i had a long day at work and when i came home i felt like i took 5 sleeping pills mentally hats how tired i was.....yet i was just laying in bed tired instead of actually sleeping
weighted blankets?,"has anyone ever tried using a weighted blanket to see if it helps you sleep better?  
  
i tried one off of amazon and i've read that it should be 10% of your weight + a few pounds. i'm about 145lb so i got a 20lb blanket, maybe it was too much?  
  
i think i fell asleep (but not really? like that half-awake-half-asleep state) for like 2 hours and then apparently couldn't take it anymore and i remember kicking the blanket off to the side against the wall. afterwards, i felt like i was floating, but it felt like i was pretty much sore all over. not painfully so, mind you, just kinda feels like my skin was pulsating after being freed from under the weight of the blanket.  
  
is this something i just have to get used to? or did i just go too heavy with the blanket? "
Edible for insomnia,Did anybody try edibles for insomnia? Does it really help? Does it affect you the next day in anyway? 
Do your shoulders/ knees/ wrists/ elbows hurt when you sleep on your side? How can i avoid this?,"I never used to have the problem, but now that i think about it does line up with when my insomnia began too. When i sleep I wake up frequently through the night to switch sides because these joints will hurt."
The never ending cycle,"Does anyone ever have a night of terrible sleep where you awake multiple times, sleep very lightly, stay awake for durations during your sleep, unable to fall back asleep.. and feel as if, if you didnt get out of bed and have a day, you could stay in the awful cycle for days? Like your sleep quality was so poor that you could just carry on like that? 

Just kind of a experience of mine I thought I'd share. "
"I'm so, so jealous of the many normal people who can just lay down and sleep, and have a far better rest than I ever could, even if I put so much more thought into sleep hygiene and relaxation and my exhausted self takes a full dose of sleeping pills.","I don't need any advice, rather I just want to vent about how fucking annoying this disorder is."
Maybe 2 hours of sleep last night if I'm lucky,Fuck this shit.
please I need some reassurance. scared again.,"I’ve always been an insomniac tbh all my teenage life but back then I never stressed about it. But as I grew up my mental health got worse and worse due to trauma and issues in my home life. Anyways around the time I turned 21, my mental health and insomnia had gotten so bad I ended up attempting suicide. I got to a point where once I didn’t sleep for 2 days straight and that was scary af...i was hospitalized in September of last year and put on medication and things got better but not perfect. Its been a few months and things improved a lot. I was told I have borderline personality disorder, major depression and generalized anxiety. Now lately I’ve been doing well except the past 3 nights I honestly didn’t sleep that bad. But I always wanna overanalyze my sleep. Normally the past few weeks I had been more depressed so I had been sleeping so much. Then suddenly I started waking up earlier and I started being obsessive about my sleep again which gave me anxiety. Last night I couldn’t sleep so being the anxious person I am I went down the rabbit hole and started reading about fatal insomnia and I know I shouldn’t have because this happened to me before and I know it’s not good to look at this things. Anyways I tried to sleep and I eventually fell asleep but I truly don’t remember how much I slept. I don’t feel sleep deprived tbh. I always feel sluggish bc of my depression so that’s normal. I think I slept brokenly. I just don’t know I’m so anxious. I wish I could take more ativan but my doctor isn’t letting me. I need some reassurance please. Does life ever get better? What has helped y’all? I’m on citalopram 30mg, ativan 1mg and seroquel 200mg.  "
Can insomnia be a way to get attention ?,"The insomnia keeps going and I don’t get crazy over it as much anymore, but I’m TERRIFIED of going to sleep. Because the worst is feeling like you’re about to sleep, and then suddenly you’re awake again.

So I just stay in bed reading on my phone even though I’m kind of sleepy because I’m terrified to turn off the lights and just stay there forever and nothing happens.

Yesterday my mind was roaming and I was starting to fall asleep. Then I realised it and started panicking to the idea of losing this feeling and never get to sleep.

Sooooo I don’t know how long it’s been but I’m a fucked up zombie. I have headache all the time, terrible mood and my skin is as bad as when I was 12 again, despite being very careful what I eat.

I can’t spend much time with anyone because I’m also so tired I don’t feel like going out.
I was looking forward to this weekend that I have organised but unfortunately I already know what it’s gonna be like : pretending to have fun when all I want is to shower and sleep. Even though I know I won’t sleep but still, that’s all I can think about.

Maybe insomnia is a way to get attention ? Not in a whimsy way but more as in people who have been neglected or abused in their lives and they start developing things like anorexia or self harm...
Sometimes it seems like the subconscious will speak through the body asking what it needs that way because it never got it in normal situations. Like they didn’t receive care or love and being sick is the only way the psyche has found to get this care and love if that makes sense.

If you can’t sleep your health deteriorate and people then have to notice you.
I have no idea how this kind of problem can be solved though.
How do we heal neglect or abuse ?"

Help pls,Guys i suffer from chronic insomnia and have trouble from sleeping from time to time. And it has started again I haven't been able to get a good night's sleep for over 2 weeks no matter how hard I try I just can't sleep and it becomes morning by the time I'm moving and turning around in bed. It is causing me serious dysfunctions in my day to day life. My head feels heavy I can't function during the day. I sleep for like 3-4 hours during the day and it's seriously affecting my mental health which is causing me depression and bad negative thoughts in my mind. My relationship is also not going very well. Any help and tips will be appreciated.
Has anyone here taken Xanax only once or twice a week long term to help them fall back asleep? How long does it work for before it stops working at that frequency?,
Does our mind know when our body starts to fall asleep?,"Hi. 

Does any expert here know if our mind acknowledges the moment when the body starts to fall asleep? 

This is kind of weird for me: When my body starts to fall asleep then my mind kind of wakes it up immediately. This is so stupid but it just keeps going for me even if I’m tired and it makes me sleep much less per night. Is this just illusion of my mind? because some nights when I feel panic and close my eyes eventually I can sleep.


Thank you. 



"
I’ve just developed an irrational fear that I will never sleep again,I truly hate it. Is there a cure please help me.
A method i’ve found for having a more restful nap... the “Xanax nap”,"One trick i’ve found after dealing with chronic insomnia for 4 years is what I call the “xanax nap”... Just a low dose of Xanax is needed (0.25 - 0.50mg) and there’s no need to fall asleep during the nap. Just take a Xanax and then lay down for 30-50 minutes. After doing this I genuinely feel rejuvenated every time (and it only works if I take Xanax before the nap) even though I never actually fall asleep.  So somehow the Xanax is making my naps more restful.

As a side-note... I DON’T recommend taking Xanax before bed because that can lead to dependence. Remeron is a better option I think."
I keep waking up at 3 or 4:00am,"I wanted to create a regular sleep schedule so I went to bed at 10:30pm. I often read Kindle before I sleep and start sleeping when I feel tired. I get anxiety easily so I've been practicing meditations to manage it better. When I wake up at 3 or 4:00am for 7th day in row, I usually just read some more books till 6:00am, feel tired then fall back asleep for an hour or two. It's quite frustrating as I wanted to wake up at 6:00am instead of having this darn gap.

&#x200B;

My plan is to cut the ebook and maybe start reading some paperbooks instead. Does anyone otherwise have advice?"
Anyone get insomnia from eating food late?,I had some ground beef last night with seasoning hat has MSG in it. Woke up 3 times throughout the night. Has to related to that 
lmao who’s all awake let’s start an interesting fact feed,post any cool things you’ve learned lately yo 
How common is it for insomniacs to not be able to fall asleep during a nap?,"For the last 4 years i’ve had chronic insomnia (and lost two awesome jobs because of it), and i’ve been able to get restful sleep every other night (thanks to Remeron 15mg)... but on bad nights I have to spend the day taking “naps” throughout the day (except i never actually fall asleep during these naps, so not sure if they’re technically “naps”). I just can't get myself to fall asleep during a nap. Also, once i’m up (usually 6-7 am) I’m unable to go back to sleep (or “sleep in”)... so are there actually people here that have chronic insomnia but are able to fall asleep during naps in the daytime?

I think the cause of my insomnia could be because of being threatened by a person with a gun because ever since that happened my brain seems to be “stuck” in fight-or-flight mode to some extent... but maybe not.

Btw, i’m 35 y/o male with no other known health problems except scoliosis.

Bad patch of insomnia,"Hey guys having a bad patch of insomnia since Monday night. For the past year or 2 I would have one bad night followed by more anxiety and stress and it would be repetitive for week or so. I use Zquil as my OTC sleep aid. This time is a little different. On my 3rd night of zquil now.... if I try to sleep without it, i will fall asleep and wake up in5-10 minutes in a PANIC. This happens repeatedly for 1-3 hours until I take zquil and just pass out.

Help ! :("
"4 days without sleep, frustrated and depressed.","I've always had trouble sleeping or staying asleep but the past couple months have been very bad. I usually get 4 hours a night in total, waking up a couple times or eventually knock out at 6am. Melatonin used to help. 

&#x200B;

The last time I slept was on Sunday morning (7am - 11am) and I haven't slept since. Monday night I tried melatonin, didn't work. Tuesday, I tried melatonin again, gave up and drank a lot of alcohol, still doesn't work. Spent all of wednesday tired as fuck, tried to nap and couldn't. 

&#x200B;

I've been so tired, frustrated, randomly breaking down crying. I've always struggled with depression but the lack of sleep is making me down right suicidal. I almost went through with it last night when the alcohol couldn't knock me out. 

&#x200B;

How do you deal with it when it just keeps getting worse? "
Excited for the weighted blanket,"Finally decided to treat myself and buy one and it gets here today. I've had terrible insomnia and i know it's going to get worse  as i sober up. Also bought some more CBD oil so i have a feeling I'm going to sleep really great tonight.

Something i read in this sub was was someone talking about how it helps to psyche yourself up for a good night sleep and it kinda helps to visualize it...anyway, i'll have to report back tomorrow morning."
Prescribed Zopiclone but scared to take it..,"Hi all, I'm 27F, have never been an easy sleeper and over the past year it's gotten considerably worse and I can easily go 2-4 nights without any sleep at all. Especially when I have something coming up and set an alarm, the anxiety is unbearable and sleep is impossible. However I've never seen a doctor for it and have never taken sleeping medication. I've always just let it pass or smoked weed and eaten loads of food just before bed! This reliance overtime has ruined my health and I need to undo the damage. 

Recently I've been looking into my gut health and trying to change my diet/lifestyle to heal my gut which will hopefully balance my hormones etc, as of Monday I cut out sugar/starch/Gluten and im basically doing IF/Keto - of course I haven't slept this entire week because without a bunch of sugar and carbs before bed my chances of sleeping are greatly reduced. 

I am in a very difficult but exciting time of my life, unemployed and chasing my dreams, often have to travel for meetings etc. I have a trip tomorrow with several meetings and a studio session. It's going to be a long and socially demanding day I cannot be unrested, groggy and miserable. It'll jeopardise a lot for me so I called the GP and got an emergency appointment hoping to get some melatonin (as many Americans suggest!). I was told only over 55s are prescribed Melatonin and I could have Zopiclone instead however it's addictive so I should only use it sparingly. 

So basically Im looking for any experiences with the drug and if it's not worth taking it this one time. I'm desperate! 

Thank you x"
Prozac seems to be messing with my sleep in a weird way.,"Prozac 20mg 2 months:

im so confused... doctor said if i wasn't sleeping 4 hours a day i would be dead but...,"i go many sleepless nights of me just laying in bed unable to actually sleep. there are two times i can remember my eyes actually shutting and my brain shutting off... a month ago when i was really drunk and another time where i spent 24 hours up and ended up crashing.

&#x200B;

besides that.. i literally lay in bed every night and don't fall asleep and i go to school, work, and gym.

&#x200B;

up until i was 25  i could literally nap during the day and sleep at night with no issue... now my body completely forgot how to sleep? i can't fall asleep for a nap or at night. so is it possible to be consciously sleeping or something?"
Can’t Sleep,"Started thinking about my life, my problems, things i have to do, etc etc and now i can’t relax myself to even begin my routine of “closing eyes, attempt to sleep, roll around”. 

Does anyone else have that problem? Where you think you’ll get a couple hours of sleep or you know tonight’s the night you’ll finally be blessed to sleep after several sleepless nights but your brain suddenly decides to fuck with you and you just wanna cry? "
Any recommendations on what else to try ?,"Hi,

I’ve been suffering with insomnia for the past year. I originally had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Now I can fall asleep fine at 10pm but wake up a couple of times then when it gets to around 3am, I have absolutely no hope in getting back to sleep. In my mind I’m already thinking about work and how horrendous it will be if I don’t get back to sleep. Then I start basically counting down the time in my head till it’s time to get up.

I’ve tried various different things my rooms dark, quiet (ear plugs) and comfy. I’ve tried hypnotherapy, calming music, natural sleep aids, prescription sleep aids zoplicone and amitryplene. They all had a similar effect, they helped get me to sleep but didn’t keep me asleep.

I try to exercise regularly but I feel so drained all the time it’s seems such a chore.

Most recently I’ve been referred to a non respiratory sleep disorder clinic. But I’m unsure this will help where it says “The majority of the patients presenting with insomnia have some psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety. Since we do not have resources to manage primary psychiatric problems, we encourage that such patients are referred elsewhere from primary care.”

I’m 99% sure mine is related to stress/anxiety so don’t really understand why my doctor referred me or wether to even book an appointment with them where I don’t want to waste there time.

I’ve got a telephone consultation for CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy) near the end of the month that I’m hoping might help.

It’s got to the point now where it’s affecting every aspect of my life I start the day absolutely knackered, I look so drained all the time and it’s even rapidly increased my hair loss which makes me more stressed and anxious! Work is a struggle, I never feel ‘on the ball’ anymore, I kind of feel in my own little world. I’m a lot more snappy which is causing arguments in my relationship. I love exercising but when you’ve had 3/4 hours sleep and have been at work for 10 hours it seems daunting. I do manage to drag my self there almost every other day still. But very rarely feel energised enough to give it 100%.

I’m hoping CBT will help change my thought processes and stop my overthinking and I’ll be able to overcome this but until then I was just wondering if there is anything else I could try ?

I’ve considered trying weighted blankets where a lot of people seem to have good results with these ? But I get fairly hot during the night and all of the recommended breathable ones are from other countries (I’m in the UK).

Sorry for the life story!

Night terrors type thing happening to me on top of insomnia?,"I've had this thing 3 nights in a row where as I am FINALLY falling asleep, I start feeling EXTREME panic and anxiety and wake up immediately. My arms will be burning when this happens. Also I fell asleep for like 30 minutes and woke up with a gasp and extreme panic I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I am getting this on top of having a really hard time falling asleep in the first place and jerks/jolts sometimes when falling asleep. Its like my body is doing everything it can to not sleep every night. Still got a solid 6 hours though. My body is extremely stressed out and anxious which I think is causing all of this, as well as being sleep deprived."
Can you get accustomed to insomnia?,"So, I’ve never been a big sleeper. I usually get 3–6 hours sleep a night, but even that’s broken up into sections, I wake at least once an hour, and have done for as long as I can remember.

But, on the odd occasion I do manage to get a normal nights sleep, 8+ hours, I’ve realised I always wake up with a pretty severe headache and just feel terrible in general, whereas on my nights I get say, 4 hours sleep total, I feel absolutely fine. 

So, am I so used to the ‘poor’ sleeping situation that a ‘good’ sleep does the opposite of what it should do?"
Does anybody here get stress headaches and migraines due to lack of sleep? Trying to prevent these seems to cause anxiety and prevent sleep more.,
Melatonin,Does anyone have a preferred brand of melatonin that seems to work better than the others?
Had my first decent sleep in a while - here's what I did!,"I have had awful insomnia basically since high school (which was a decade ago, wow). Essentially cant get to sleep until 2 am and then wake up groggy every single day. I've been meaning to change my sleep schedule to have a positive affect on my mood, weight, focus, health in general. Last night i finally took a few steps.

&#x200B;

\- I worked out after work which helps because it tires you out for the evening (i usually do this but just mentioning it was a factor)

\- Had my dinner around 7:30 PM

\- Did headspace meditation for about 10 minutes 

\- took a 5 mg melatonin

\- hit the bowl :)

\- turned all my lights off and started an audiobook with a sleep timer

I was out right when i wanted to be (about 10)

&#x200B;

I also downloaded Pillow, the sleep cycle app. wakes you up when you're in your lightest sleep closest to your desired wake up time, so i rolled out of bed feeling mega refreshed!

&#x200B;

This is just what worked for me, but i think it was quite relaxing. Let me know if anyone has a similar plan in the evening.

&#x200B;

Good luck everyone!"
"Has anyone been on non benzo sleep aids for a longtime, like ambien, lunesta, etc? If so, are they any longterm risks or withdrawal symptoms if u go off them?",
Antidepressant insomnia: I would not wish this upon my worst enemy,I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL for my anxiety and ADHD and it has completely fucked my sleep schedule. I have to get up at 6 every morning for an early class at my high school and I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep this entire week. Every waking moment it feels like someone is pushing in on my temples and rubbing sandpaper across my forehead. It's getting to the point where I feel like the side effects are hurting me more than the drug is helping me. I have these rare moments in the afternoon sometimes where I just get overwhelmed by a tired feeling but I always have to get up to do something and then it's gone for the rest of the day/night. With ADHD-I my working memory is already compromised and I mentally cannot function when that's combined with only 3 hours of sleep. I have this huge AP Gov test tomorrow and I only have 4 hours left to even fall asleep. I feel like I'm going insane 
Can you survive on 3 hours of sleep a day? This has been going on for a few months already,Title speaks for itself
Anyone else feels suicidal when the insomnia is so bad? Wondering if this is a normal thing,"i keep getting negative thoughts and i wish id die on the spot. I noticed it alwaaays happens when im tired and sleep deprived. I don’t wish death because of my bad insomnia I just simply get negative thoughts about life in general. Id never act on it though because i know they’ll go away after i sleep.

When i reach 16-18  hrs of being awake this starts happening and that happens everyday since all of my days are more than 16 waking hours.

Some days are okay because I’d sleep after 18 hours so id get these annoying though for an hour of two. 

Some days are horrible because i might stay awake for 24-72 hours. 

This usually happens when im alone and everyone is sleeping. 



When i sleep and wake up i think to myself “what the hell was I thinking!”  "
So tired but can’t sleep,"I’m a college student, which probably has some effect on this, but I have to wake up at 7 am for class MWF. Regardless, I go to bed around 12-2am. In the past few weeks I’ve been exhausted by the time I try to go to sleep but once I’m in bed and I’m actively trying to sleep, I somehow can’t. It’s like I don’t even feel tired anymore. I eventually just end up going back onto my phone until 3 am. I try to get comfortable and any slight noise wakes me up if I start to eventually drift off. It’s so frustrating and I’m always exhausted and fatigued by the time my alarm goes off in the morning. Granted I’ve been pretty stressed out with exams and roommate drama, but I’m posting this for advice and also to rant since its 2 am and I’m currently experiencing what I’ve described in this post. all I want to do is go to sleep just like everyone else lol"
Best sleep I get is from a small glass of vodka,"I get occasional insomnia, and have taken Ambien but don't like the chemical hangover. I noticed a small glass of vodka (4oz) will almost always knock me out and give me what feels like the best sleep possible. When I wake I am instantly alert, well rested and feel great.

I know all the warnings against alcohol and sleep but it is without a doubt the best sleep I get, better than normal sober sleep even. I've tried everything I know of. Anyone else?"
In need of reassurance,"For the past three weeks I've been unable to sleep more than 5 hours and it's getting worse. In January I suffered a major panic attack from serotonin syndrome that has made me feel worse and worse. I at least got some sleep. But it seems to be worsening. Especially these past two weeks. I've slowly stopped having an appetite and I haven't eaten more than 2 times a day this past week. I've lost nearly 15 pounds since January. My anxiety just keeps getting worse and more intense. Now,two weeks ago I consumed a a bit much of alcohol and I woke up the next day feeling horribly panicked,and it's caused me to slowly lose sleep. For a few days after it I didn't get any sleep and started hallucinating with severe panic. (Bad idea to drink) anyways now this entire week since Saturday I have slowly been getting less and less sleep. And when I do sleep (5 hours max) I feel unrested and have excessively vivid dreams. And last night I only managed 1 hour of sleep and I took 20mgs of melatonin. I woke up feeling like my skin was on fire. And was very panicky including having a deja Vu like feeling. Three weeks ago when this all started I managed to come across SFI (Sporadic Fatal Insomnia) and I've obsessively looked into it and it's become a serious fear I'm having. I'm now afraid to sleep. I'll admit my sleep got worse after googling everything about it. I know it's extremely rare and almost statistically impossible that I have it. Yet, the more my sleep declines,the more fearful and real it feels that I have it.  My pupils aren't miosis,yet I keep thinking about how badly I've been panicking,losing sleep rapidly(especially this week) and loss of appetite. I've got migraines,and  see ocular flashes. I'm burning and sweating when I wake up as well as panic. And now my chest burns when I lie down.(maybe it's because I haven't eaten?) Sometimes it feels like I'm having a concious seizure. My brain feels foggy, my body is weak and exhausted. I'm very sleepy and tired. I just want to know that it's just my anxiety and that I'll be okay once I get a grasp on it. I am so far down the rabbit hole of severe panic and sleep deprivation that I can't convince myself I don't have it. I'm scared and just want to sleep normal again. This is just too much."

Ambien CR making you feel more awake?,"Just started Ambien CR today 12.5 mg. I don't feel sleepy at all. Has this happened to anyone else?

A little background: Previously tried lunesta, sonata, restoril, and trazodone. Sonata just can't keep me asleep, I have to take Benadryl with it. With lunesta, I can stay asleep for about 5 hours, then have to take a melatonin. Trazodone made me feel awful, tired but can't fall asleep, and cloudy all next day. Restoril made me dream lucidly.

Thank you!"
Overthinking almost every night,"I have this bad habit when I just keep on thinking and thinking about random things that worries me almost every night. I almost always sleep at around 2am Everyday, the worst was a few weeks ago when I had to hand in my final year internship report and the day before I couldn’t sleep at all and slept at 4.40am. How the heck do I sleep well and stop worrying or overthinking at night? Do any of you have this issue?"
Insomnia causes me to start half dreaming as soon as I close my eyes?,"I used to lay in bed trying hard to sleep but now it happens fast and I wake up after an hour, but lately for the past few weeks when I simply close my eyes and just think about stuff it feels like my thoughts become dreams instantly and I start responding to something in my mind like a conversation that gets taken over by a dream state 

It feels like my normal mind is getting confused with REM because I’m naturally exhausted from shitty sleep and so for a second I’m in a half dream half thought state and I snap out of it as soon as I realize I’m not making sense. 

This happen to anyone else?"
What works for you guys?,"I’m frustrated. I’m tired. The insomnia is worse than it’s ever been. It started fall quarter and hasn’t slowed down. I’ve always had it but never this bad.

My doctor knows this, I’ve told her forever but she gives me the same solution every time. Wind down before bedtime, no phone, have some tea and use 25mg benedryl as a last resort, or maybe melatonin.

I understand she doesn’t want me on a ton of meds but like... really? I tried that and tried getting into a routine, it’s been the same since I was little! Sleep patterns have not changed.

My psychiatrist, on the other hand, has given me Xanax, seroquel, and amitriptyline. None seem to do the trick.

Tonight, I had 2 ibuprofen PM, 50 mg seroquel, and .25 mg Xanax. It’s been hours and I’m still wide awake. That should knock anybody out. I’m at a loss on what to do.

What works for you guys? I’m willing to give anything a shot at this point. "
The first time you tried zaleplon/Sonata did you get a hangover the next day?,For those who have tried it. 
Has anyone had success with any type of remedy that didn’t cause a hang over feeling or over sleeping?,I have probably tried just about everything with the same usual results.  Either there’s some type of chemical hangover or it is too strong and I’ll sleep for 15 hours. Has anyone ever found a middle ground? 
No sleep at all last night,My average is 2-4 hours but last not I got none. I'm so upset. I have a busy day too.
I have two questions 1)did any of you have insomnia as an infant? 2) i keep hearing and reading that most people with insomnia need CBT and that their sleep hygiene is simply bad. How much truth is in this?,"Im not disagreeing with this at all.

I don’t know if it’s simply a coincidence that i have insomnia now or if it is something im cursed with since birth. 

My parents claim that i had dark eye circles as an infant and that sometimes they’d get so tired and sleep. 

I didn’t cry I just stayed up for hours starting at the ceiling so im assuming i did not stay up because of gas or stomach pains. 

My mom freaked out and took me to a doctor and he reassured her that nothing is wrong."

I can’t sleep much for the past few days. Need advices,"Hi, I have been sleeping well last week. However, it was a Saturday night when I suddenly could not sleep, then the thoughts of not getting sleep started to creep in. Since then, every night I am worried about going to bed and fall asleep. When my eyes closed, multiple thoughts of not getting sleep come in and I cannot stand that, I feel like I don’t want my body to lose consciousness. And I wake up, getting caught by that vicious cycle...

Has anyone been in my situation and what are your advices?

why can't i sleep? even when im being crazy productive.,"i can go to work, then night school, then the gym... come home and still not pass out tired?"
WOULD APPRECIATE ANY kind of help!!! Feeling hopeless at the moment. I have a question about antihistamines. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride to be specific it is an ingredient in bendaryl and nyquill. (Short. Just skip to last paragraph),"Skip to the last paragraph if you’re not interested in reading the whole thing.

Hello guys, I’m desperate honestly and i need a quick fix at the moment because i have an important exam on Monday and this is a fucking nightmare.

My GP referred me to a sleep specialist i’ll see him in a week. I asked him if I could use antihistamines occasionally till my appointment and he says it’s fine.  

Anyway I usually get tired after 12-14 hours of staying awake just like a normal human being but I simply cannot sleep. So every single day i get extremely tired and im unable to sleep and sadly i cant even study and be productive bec of the tiredness. I have no issues with sleeping 8 hours straight my issue is just falling asleep.

My issue is that i cant sleep at a normal time. Even if i force myself to stay up the next day I noticed that i still can’t sleep at a normal time despite being tired. I’ll give you an example let’s say i get sleepy and im ready to sleep by 6am i cant sleep at that time because i have college. I go to college get back home  and i still cant sleep! I have to stay up till it’s past 12am in order to do so. If i slept comfortably without forcing myself to get up my sleep will keep on shifting forwards every day.

My GP told me it is ok to use antihistamines (diphenhydramine) occasionally im just wondering if it would work if im not sleepy? Would it work if i took it after 12 hrs of staying awake or do I have to be a little tired? I know everyone is different but i also know melatonin and valerian root for example do not work for sooo many people. Im assuming antihistamines work for almost everyone. So when is a proper time to take it? 
 
EDIT:  When I said “sleep comfortably without forcing myself” i did not mean sleeping in. I simply mean if i get 8 hours of sleep everyday my sleeping WILL keep on shifting forward. I can only get 8 hours of sleep during the weekend. During the weekdays I force myself to wake up for college so i get less than 8 hours "
Why am I awake?,"I know it’s a simple question pondered to oneself yet sent out to this whole subreddit because every night I struggle to sleep even for like a few hours at a time. Sometimes, medication, meditation, music, background noises, Netflix, and video games help, but there’s never one single when one size fits all or anything that works 50% of the time. I come here asking everyone who also fights these nightly nighttime battles: WHAT WORKS FOR YOU THE MAJORITY OF THE TIME TO SLEEP/ STAY ASLEEP/ GO TO BED AT NORMAL HOURS AND WAKE UP AT FAIRLY REASONABLE HOURS? I’ll listen to and try almost everything at this point. Thank you in advance all!"
Zopiclone once per week long-term?,"Originally posted this on r/AskDocs but got no reply.

I currently do shift work, up to 18 hour shifts, sometimes not getting home until 7 am or so. I then may be working again at 9 am a day later. I sometimes do long shifts like these on no sleep whatsoever. I've been prescribed Zopiclone 7.5 mg a number of times for use before particularly important days - and it works pretty well. I'm looking to get a 9 - 5 job as clearly this line of work isn't a good fit for my insomnia. I'm also looking to move to an expensive city, so would like to do some shift work on the weekends to supplement this. My problem is that if I go to sleep at 4 am one night, I can't fall asleep earlier than 4 am any night following this - until I do an all-nighter to reset my pattern.

I was thinking that I could work 9 - 5 throughout the week, pick up the odd late evening shifts on the Friday/Saturday, and then, every Sunday evening around 11 pm, take Zopiclone to put me back on a good pattern for the following week. Rinse and repeat.

Is this an awful idea? Would I become dependant long-term if only taking it once per week? And would any GP actually prescribe this?

Thanks"
Waking up at 2am and not falling asleep again.,"Over the past month I've started waking up at 2am and never falling asleep again. The past 2 nights have been even worse with no sleep at all since I have a bad cold.

I don't know why I've developed insomnia this time (used to have it in college but that was years ago). There's been no change in my daily schedule and no new stress.
I do all the proper sleep hygiene stuff. Screens are off at least an hour before bedtime. I get up at the same time every day(7am), go to bed at the same time every day(9pm). I don't have any caffiene after noon.

 This hasn't changed yet I can't fucking sleep. Melatonin helps me fall asleep but doesn't prevent me from waking up. Taking it more than a couple nights in a row makes me depressed. Other sleep aids like unisom make me feel drugged for a whole day after taking it.

With the sinus pain of this cold and added side effects of cold medicine I feel like I'm in hell. All I want to do is sleep."
Waking up choking/gasping for air within first 15 minutes of sleep,"So I have more of a problem with middle insomnia. Falling asleep fine, but waking up two hours later, then every hour on the hour after that until I eventually give up and accept that I am awake at 4am. 

My doctor approved me for Silenor so that has me hopeful. Waiting on my insurance to receive the prior authorization so I don’t have to pay $400 for it...

Anyways, the past few weeks I’ve had something terrifying happen. Within the first 10-15 minutes of drifting to sleep, I’ll wake up gasping for air, coughing violently, eyes watering etc. It is terrifying and usually sets the tone for a restless night from then on. I’m not sure what could be causing this. I sleep on a wedge pillow and avoid eating right before bed due to a history of reflux...I feel like being elevated would reduce my chances of reflux causing this but idk. I’m worried if I mention it to my doc she’s gonna send me for a sleep study which might now show it because this only happens every couple nights or so. Either way it’s terrifying and I wanna know if anyone else has dealt with it. Sleep apnea does run in my family but I’m a 24-year-old female that is far from overweight so I feel like my chances of OSA are small. But who knows. Just looking for advice I guess. "
Using new Fitbit to track what helps me sleep and what doesn’t. It’s helpful but depressing...,"And honestly kind of creepy how accurate it is. For example last night when I actually got some rem sleep I kept waking up from nightmares and falling back into them, it was bizarre, and all tracked too. I don’t know how but it was startlingly accurate. 

I’ve been tracking exactly what I do vs how much sleep I get. Does anyone else do this? Do you find it helpful? I found that on the nights I take ambien, I don’t get much more restful sleep than the nights where I don’t. I almost always take melatonin, and get about 3-5 hours, almost all of that time spend in the light sleep stage, periodically walking up. The past week I’ve been extra depressed and exhausted, but my sleep didn’t feel abnormal (for me).  My watch told me I was getting about 10-20 minutes of deep sleep per night, and always less than an hour of rem.  70% or more spent in light sleep. 

Last night I was having manic episodes followed by crying so rapidly that I thought I was losing my mind. So I took one of my emergency Xanax, that I usually save for airplanes (I travel a lot to visit family). I got a whopping TEN HOURS tracked. Two of those hours I was awake in the middle (see mention of nightmares above).  But still that is eight hours!!  I never get eight hours. Two hours of rem, one and a half hour of deep sleep. How can Xanax be more effective for sleep than ambien? 

Of course, the dangerously addictive and hardly prescribed drug is the one that helps the most.  I have a cousin who was addicted, downing pills and chasing them with vodka every day.  I know the risk is real.  I’m still a little blown away by how easily I went back to sleep after I woke up (that also NEVER happens, once I wake up in the early morning that’s usually it and no more sleep will come). Has anyone experienced anything like this? What does it mean??

I know I’m all over the place, thanks for reading if you got this far. 


"
Nothing seems to work anymore,"Background: 25yo F, I’ve had insomnia for 3 years now, I’m currently on 25mg of Atarax up to 4 a night and I’ll also take a natural sleep aid with valerian and melatonin mixed together and usually that works for me. Recently atarax has not been doing anything... at all, I’ll take my normal nightly cocktail and I’m awake the whole night, no joke. 

Before I was put on atarax I was taking Zquil on a nightly basis and basically overdosed on it, giving my self chest pains and I was taking up to 5 of those a night. I don’t take zquil or Benadryl anymore but when I do it definitely doesn’t make help. 

I’ve had kidney problems for the past 2 months so I have to be careful what sort of medication I am taking especially NSAIDs , but I’m getting any restful sleep to let my body heal.

I’m just at a loss, I just want sleep! "
Enough is enough,"I was very hesitant to post here but... I'm really tired of all this. My fear of not being able to sleep properly again keeps growing more and more. I have already talked to my doctor about the issue and he has prescribed me ambien, but from what I've read and know from a close family member who has used ambien before, is that ambien is bad for your health specifically your heart for long-term use, the ambien has somewhat worked, I do feel more energetic when I wake up when I take it but as already said, it's not meant for long-term use. This insomnia has become problematic for me and many others, but I fear I might have something worse that I have come across on the internet, a brain disorder known as ""sporadic fatal insomnia"". I am unsure if it would be far-fetched to assume I would have this disease, I don't have a family history of ""fatal familial insomnia"" which is a familiar disorder to the one previously mentioned. All I know is that SFI is hard to detect and would require countless of money to be wasted just to get a yes or no answer to a very rare disorder that only a small number of people have it and it's currently uncurable. This is more of a cry for help, but obvious I have no choice but to wait and see what happens and apparently you die after 1 year as soon as the insomnia kicks in."
Why do I stay awake?,"After highschool I got in this awful habit of staying up all night, after a few years of this it lead to habitual drug use and alcoholism, sometimes staying up for days at a time. I cleaned up a bit but the insomnia is still here.

I now am off the drugs and booze but have crazy insomnia. I work at 6 am and often find myself up until 11. I’m tired all day long, I work out 3 times a week, I’ve been eating healthy, when it’s time to go to bed I’m wide awake. I need to start getting 8 hours of sleep each night.

Why am I tired all day but awake all night? I always heard that shift work was unhealthy and bad for your circadian rhythm, but I honestly feel like 2nd shift is for me. When I worked 2nd, I could stay up until 3 or 4 am, wake up at noon, go work out and go to work and be fine with it. 
"
Something scary is happening when I try to sleep this week and I really really need advice,"So I’m probably going to ramble because I’m in fucking zombie mode right now.     

4 days ago I started really struggling to sleep, I’m not sure if it’s related but the first night I was also really drunk, not blacked out completely. I tried to sleep and the entire night I’m in a stage of half sleep, every 5-10 minutes I’m moving around trying to get comfortable again. Also related: at this night I started having this strong pain in the sides of my neck, a crazy headache going from the back of my head to my temples, and a pulsing sensation on the back “soft spot” of my head. So all this has made me unable to sleep on my side which is how I normally sleep. I’m forced to lay down like a mummy on my back so my neck isn’t in a lot of pain. 

Please bare with me cause now it’s going to sound like complete bullshit. 

Most of my life, in my head and thoughts or whatever I’m constantly hearing music or dialogue of random people talking, or most common I’m seeeing scenes from shows or movies I recently watched. So for example the last few nights, I started watching Ozark, the TV show, and all through the night and most of the day, I’m seeing these kind of, alternate timelines in the show, stuff that didn’t happen but is just going along in my head. SPOILERS: last night it was when Ruth is hiding from the cartel when they see her talking to the fed agent when he stops his car near her. So Ruth and (Tim?) the acting manager of the stripclub are in the back office figuring out what to do; it was like 3 hours of that just going along. Fucking weird. Sorry that just really sidetracked. 

And I also got reallly freaked out, because 2 nights ago I had a sleep paralysis episode. Maybe related to me being half asleep and laying on my back. But I kept hearing people coming into my room and talking to each other, talking to me, I heard glass breaking and things falling off my shelf, Someone was touching my arms and face too. It freaked me the hell out. And a few hours ago it happened again, ( it’s 6am here now, and I live alone by the way so there was no one actually in my house). This time a few hours ago, it was more of a hallucination. When I would close my eyes I kept seeing faces. No one that I knew, but they were all staring at me with this “knowing” look. And I closed my eyes again and I saw a lady dressed in all black, and she nodded to me smiling and I freaked out and ended up screaming “stop fucking staring at me”. 

I’m sorry this post is long but I’m reallly really freaked out, I’m not exactly in a place to go to a doctor for maybe two days or so but I could use some advice please "
"Cannot sleep whatsoever, even when tired","Hi,

Friday night and Saturday night, I was able to sleep. Sunday night, I was tossing and turning all night and began to feel drowsy at 8am today. I had to wake up though because I had to have a blood test. I came home and even though I have so many assignments to do as they are due, I told myself to listen to my body and sleep. It's been 2 fucking hours I've been laying in bed trying to sleep. I hate this so fucking much. I have no energy for anything and it's causing stress. Lack of sleep is destroying."
Night vs Morning sleep,"Anyone else have trouble sleeping at night but are then able to nap easily during the day? This feels like a reoccurring thing for me. To sleep at night I have to take a combination of medications and still end up waking up a million times during the night. However during the day I can nap super easily because of how tired I am. 
It’s driving me nuts "

Will Melatonin Help?,Just started a new job and I already had stress and anxiety problems well now they are times 10 and I’m just not sleeping. I woke up at 2 AM this morning after about 3 hours of sleep and was up till I went to work at 8. Will melatonin help with this problem? I’m open to other recommendations if anyone has some. 
Kind of at my wit's end,"So I'm not sure if I have ""insomnia"", but since I was a child I have had periods of time where I just don't sleep. As a kid, it was pretty easy to recognize that it was stress related, and my go-to solution was to set up camp somewhere else in the house and start fresh after a few hours of laying awake. So I would go to the couch, or my brother's spare bunk bed. Now, as an adult I'm pretty much stressed out all the time, so I'm not able to see a pattern...and my sleeplessness lasts longer and longer each time. Currently, I am in my 6th month of getting between 3-5 hours of sleep every night. It's made worse by the fact that my husband snores, so if I wake up at all there is no chance of me going back to sleep. I have tried earplugs, sound machines, headphones, and unisom. My husband has tried multiple anti-snore methods, and had no luck. This is the longest I have ever dealt with sleeplessness. When I am sleeping normal, I normally would get 7-8 hrs of sleep. I don't know where to begin. I just have no clue. I am afraid to see a doctor and not be taken seruously. I'm afraid of being told it's all in my head, because my husband kind of has that mentality. He isn't trying to be mean or anything, he just has never dealt with the inability to sleep. Sorry for the wall of text, I'm on mobile. Just looking for advice on where to start with looking for a solution. "
Advice for sleeping through a lack-of-sleep headache?,"I've recently developed a problem where I can't fall asleep till 3-4am on weeknights, despite relaxing for sleep around 12am. I try to sleep till 8am, but am usually awake by 6:30am. This results in very unpleasant headaches that are a constant reminder of my sleep troubles, making it even more difficult for my body to get the rest it needs. I'm trying to avoid caffeine at all costs and minimize my ibuprofen use. Any suggestions on how to make these headaches go away so I can relax back into normal sleep?"
Waking up everyday at 4-5 AM suddenly since 3 weeks.,"Hello all,

3 weeks ago, for no apparent reason, I started only sleeping until 4-5 AM, without the possibility of falling back asleep where as I would always be able to sleep until my alarm at 7 (I go to bed at 11 every night). It seems that I was a bit more anxious during this time, gf is overseas for a few months, I obviously miss her, work, etc.

After a few days I would also be stressed when I'd wake up again at the same time and after 10 days of not sleeping and being ABSOLUTELY miserable, affecting very much my work and day to day routine, went to the doc, who prescribed the smallest dose of Klonopin to take before sleep to take the edge off.

It worked. I wasn't feeling any more anxious than I usually would, but the sleep never came back. Went back to the doc, told me to up the dosage, and I asked for some blood work, even though she was fairly sure it had nothing to do with it. Upping the dosage didn't work (so I went back down, and only on off days) and blood came back good, except a vit D deficiency (magnesium was supposedly fine, although I've read here that many people take supplements?). I was prescribed 10000iu once a week for a month, and I also take 2-3000iu every morning (it is only sold as 1000iu tablets in canada).

I'm still not sleeping a full night. I miss it so much. Falling asleep at 11 sharp and just waking up to the sound of my beautiful alarm (you really do start missing the alarm). Now I don't feel as exhausted during the day, I'm guessing my body adapted? But I'm still definitely in a constant state of tiredness and therefore lower motivation. I've always been a fine sleeper, although I always needed a strong routine. My sleep hygiene is pretty good in my opinion (no screens, shower to relax before bed, reading, etc., and it was much worst before this episode started and I never had an issue prior). Tried working out hard, no difference, and the lack of sleep definitely doesn't help my workout performance.

So I'm now turning to you guys. What do you suggest I try? Seems my body can't go back to its old rhythm. Seems early awakenings are a symptom of depression but I don't feel depressed? When I get a few hours where I'm not tired I feel absolutely 100%, but the lack of sleep definitely hurts my motivation."
I've recently discovered that having a small amount of pressure on my chest (i.e. a pillow) helps me to fall asleep. Does anyone know why that is?,"I realized recently that when I sleep on my stomach, I can fall asleep in a relatively normal amount of time, where as when I lay on my back (which is more comfortable), it takes several hours. Because sleeping on my stomach is so uncomfortable, I've started sleeping with a pillow on my chest, to simulate that same feeling while laying on my back, and it seems to work. I'm just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience or knows why this works."
Physically cannot fall alseep,"So it's been a few months of bad sleep. I have had a lot of anxiety and it has prevented me from sleeping very well. But tonight I am scared I'll never be able to sleep again because Everytime I try to sleep and almost fall asleep I get a wave going through my brain and I'm wide awake again.  This will be day two of no sleep. I'm never like this, I always can fall asleep. I've tried zzzquil and it usually makes me tired and I'm unaffected recently. I'm also mortified of having sFA. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm very tired and scared."
Moving around during sleep," 

When i fall asleep... I move around A LOT .. i always wake up a few times a night, sometimes it’s clear i'm waking up from a dream/nightmare; i’m often switching from side to side then. 

&#x200B;

When i get up in the morning my legs can feel as if i danced all night.. I woke up this morning with a pulled muscle in my arm.

Does anybody else have issues with this?"

Natural ways of curing insomnia??,"Does anyone have any idea what are the natural ways to beat insomnia? My mom suffers from insomnia mostly on account of her being a very sensitive and light sleeper. Last night I sprayed some lavender oil over her blanket and pillow before she went to bed but she said the smell kept her awake all night. 😂 I don't know what went wrong because lavender seems to help me, I guess so I thought it would do the same for her. But apparently not. Anyway she's also strongly against taking medications for her insomnia. I tried convincing her but she just don't budge. 🙄 
I really don't know what to do. She wakes up tired and cranky and it's come to a point where it's starting to effect her health. And it's not like she remains idle through out the day, she has an office job and returns at 5 every evening. So she's pretty much beat by the end of the day. But somehow she just can't sleep. 

So if anyone has any idea how to overcome this problem via natural methods, please do share. And I'm sorry if this topic has been discussed already before, I just joined reddit and I'm new to this whole thing so pardon the newbie mistake! Thanks! "
better sleep last night,"last night is my second Day took Seroquel 50mg at 12am without mixing any antidepressant. felt so sleepy, stone, eye so heavy but didnt make me fall asleep. Until 3am, as my Dr told me, took another 2mg Lorazepam, then fall asleep at 3:30am untill 9am, feel sleepy then sleep again till 11:30am and push myself to wakw up. Dont want to sleep too much cause insomnia again tonight. Any advice or idea everyone?"
The Bedtime Story Method,"Longtime insomniac, here. I've recently hit upon a method for getting to sleep that has been pretty effective for me so far. It may be weird and too idiosyncratic to be helpful to others but I thought I'd share!

Basically what I do is get in bed, turn off the lights, and tell myself a bedtime story, the exact same story every night. At first I used to run through the whole thing and start over but lately I never even make it to the end before falling asleep.

In my case it's a story I made up (sort of a fanfic based on a book I love) but I think it could work just as well with, say, a favorite TV ep you've seen a million times. Just close your eyes and begin ""watching"" the story, the more detailed and immersive the better.

I think it works because it's interesting and enjoyable enough that it pulls me in and distracts me from the hamster wheel of anxious thoughts but familiar enough that it kind of runs itself and I have no need to find out how it ends.

It's probably somewhat akin to mediation. I used to try to use meditation techniques like picturing a beach or a floating balloon or whatever but those never worked to distract me from my thoughts for long. A familiar but enjoyable narrative works better for that. 

Anyway, feel free to try it! Nowadays I get a little sad that I never make it to the end of the story! :P"
My Advice For CBT,"I have been really angry at CBT in the past, because it didn't work for me.

That was because I had a serious sleep disorder, and my Dr's didn't really know how to deal with it. 

&#x200B;

So I'm going to share my advice on CBT. 

It works for people who are otherwise healthy, and who are causing insomnia through bad habits. 

But it can KILL someone, and yes I really mean KILL someone who actually has a physical sleep disorder. 

&#x200B;

CBT focuses on not worrying, it says that anxiety is a wave that will crash over you if you just relax. And this is true for MOST people. However, if the insomnia is a symptom of a serious disease, it CBT will drive them right off a cliff. 

&#x200B;

Thats why I want to share some advice about it. 

\#1. Try it yourself, if it doesn't work go see a Dr. 

\#2. If you Dr sends you into professional CBT, make DAM sure you get screened for physical conditions  that can cause insomnia BEFORE therapy. Those include; Blood thyroid and blood iron disorders, Breathing disorders and allergy/sinus problems, epilepsy and restless leg syndrome. 

\#3. Tell to your Dr if you bed partners have ever said you snore or your limbs jerk. 

\#4. Discuss a contingency strategy with both your Dr. and your therapist. What happens if this doesn't work? Who do we escalate the problem to?

7 weeks of insomnia getting worse feeling like ending my life,"I'm about to lose my job, which would mean my health insurance, which would mean I cannot ever get better. I feel like taking my life. In mid december I had the worst flu of my life, it lasted 3 weeks to recover. This is when I started to get bad anxiety thinking it will never go away. After the flu, I quit cold turkey 2 substances I was abusing (kratom and phenibut) which give rebound anxiety and insomnia as withdrawal effects, that was 7 weeks ago. My sleep started to get worse and worse. My boss told me my productivity level was too low as I was not performing. I called out a lot, I am one more strike from getting fired with also adds fuel to the anxiety fire. At first I had regular insomnia, then it turned into this weird thing where my body would fall asleep easily but i'd be awaken by a jerk or a jolt, followed by me breathing fast and heart race. This would go on all night. I tried getting meds from a doctor, he claimed I was an addict and thought I was still taking the kratom. He would not give me sleeping meds. He did give me lexapro but after 3 days of taking it it has made my restlessness and insomnia worse, so I am quitting. I don't know what to do at this point. I have to go to work tomorrow and work all day, I've been sleeping 3 - 4 hours a night if that. I'm dead tired but cannot sleep and wired with anxiety. THis has been almost 2 months of this I don't know how much longer I can ""live"" like this. I have tried every supplement money can buy, every OTC sleep aid, salt baths, stretching, breathing, even had to take a benzo a few times and still nothing."
Been suffering for almost 4 weeks and thinking about doing an all-nighter to restart a normal sleep schedule. Good idea or not?,Hi.

Anybody tried sleeping in a hammock? Results?,"[According to a recent article](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2019/01/190124110844.htm) there's some evidence that rocking during sleep, like with a hammock, might help some people sleep better. You can get a pretty good hammock and hammock stand on Amazon for less than $100. Has anybody tried it? Results?"
Seroquel for insomnia,"Hi, i am new here because i was having insomnia for the last few weeks after End of relationship, alcohol and zopiclone abuse. 
Today is my 5th Day sober but the sleeping was very bad, my Dr told me Zopiclone is not working for me anymore unless very large dose.( took 7 x 7.5 everyday witn alcohol for a week) Yesterday, my Dr agree to let me try Seroquel, i usally have SSNI everynight and yesterday took 50mg Seroquel, my heart beat so fast and cannot fall asleep until later took 1mg Lorazepam but only slept for few hrs. 
My Dr tell me to try again tonight but take the SSNI at am instead of pm together with Seroquel. 
Anyone have any experience about Seroquel? any advice? Just want a better sleep."
Insomnia bc of depression and not wanting to wake up in the morning?,"I have never been very good at going to sleep at night (there are many stories of me as a child bugging my parents in the early hours of the morning because I couldn't sleep), but the past few years it has gotten really bad. I always take some sort of sleep aid, but lately I've been noticing a shift in my thinking that is related to my depression: I fear falling asleep because that means I'll have to deal with the pain of waking up. 

Waking up every morning and just living everyday has been getting harder and harder to manage, and I notice myself not wanting to sleep at night now because well... if I don't sleep then I don't have to wake up. I'll already have done that from the day before, so it is one less struggle. Even though I know sleep makes things much easier to do, my mind still falls into this pattern. 

This is a relatively new realization for me - do any other insomniacs with depression relate? Do you have any advice for getting back to wanting to sleep? Even if I'm unable to actually do it - at least having the desire may help. "

This insomnia is going to make me snap!,"I suffer from insomnia when I get overly stressed, worried or anxious about something. It’s been like this for eleven years. I refuse to go get on sleeping medication because I always feel really tired from it the next day and I don’t like that.

I tried to take 3mg OTC melatonin but even that didn't help. Now I'm just taking naps during the day which seems to be eating up my days too. Any thoughts on what I should do to get rid of this?

Childhood insomnia caused trauma?,"As a kid I couldn’t sleep. I thought it was because of my anxiety about monsters and robbers. Actually, I think the insomnia created the anxiety. As a kid I had to lie in my bed and not move even though I wasn’t tired just because that’s what you do. But isn’t that kind of horrible? At least as an adult I can get up or listen to music or whatever. But lying in a dark room at night with nothing to do for years? 

Well, do you think that’s enough to cause trauma?"
What to expect from seeking help from a doctor?,"I’ve been having trouble with sleep for years but have never seeked help for it. I’m at my wits end recently and haven’t been able to get a full nights sleep or a normal sleeping routine in place for about 6 months at this stage. Ive tried everything i can think of - cutting caffeine, exercising, no phone/screens for an hour before bedtime, otc sleep aids etc and none of it has worked. I’ve decided that I finally need to see a doctor and try get help for it but I’m quite nervous and don’t really know what to expect. 

I have trouble both falling and staying asleep, the rare night I do fall asleep with ease I wake up again 2/3 hours later and am awake for the night again. I’m constantly exhausted and it’s really stressing me out. How do I approach a doctor with the situation? Is it likely to be prescribed any medications from a first visit or would I be pushed towards some sort of counselling/therapy to help (not opposed to this, just curious), or both? 

My friend had the same issue and was prescribed Zopiclone 7.5mg, she gave me one a week or two ago to help me sleep and for the first time in weeks I fell asleep within 20 minutes. Could I directly ask my doctor about this medication? Would it be frowned upon if I told them that my friend had given it to me or could I say that I tried it and it worked?

I’m a 20 year old girl for reference. Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated, thanks so much!"
Sleep restriction. How long does it last and how to get through it?,"Fourth or so day. Feel so tired. ATM only 7hrs. First night was rough, by the second I could barely keep my eyes open to midnight. Third day slept in and sort of ruined it. This morning stuck to it and feel so lethargic. 

How long did it take you to get to a stable set hours in bed without feeling so sleep deprived? I'm also coming off Avanza at the same time. "

Insomnia & Dating,"Hi,

I have trouble sleeping the night before a date. As in, it isn't uncommon for me to stay awake the entire night. I'm not a great sleeper otherwise, but dates definitely exacerbate it to the point where it hurts my work performance / health.

I don't feel especially anxious on the dates themselves. To be honest, my dream scenario is for someone to suggest a same-day date so I don't have to worry about sleeping through the night.

I blame my insomnia for ruining some dates for me. I've actually gone out after being awake for 48+ hours and I'm clearly not at the top of my game.

Can anyone else relate? I'm not sure what to do about this but I stay up regardless of sleeping pills / thc.

I'm also generally ashamed to admit this, lest I freak out someone. The stigma about mental health really stinks."
Anyone get psuedosleep,"You lay there in bed trying to sleep and time just seems to fly. You check your phone after tossing and turning for a few hours and your alarm is going to go off in a few minutes. Or you sleep and have dreams that you're laying in bed trying to sleep. I thought I got an automated call in the middle of the night saying I got a ticket for speeding on a toll road the other night (toll roads have those scanner things) and hung up angry, checked a few days later and never received that call. I was just laying in bed trying to sleep when that happened. I get this with a lot of the little sleep I get. It's a piss in the face. Anyone else?"

Podcasts but not on phone,Listening to podcasts help me sleep when I have insomnia – but with a recent anxiety and insomnia streak – the light from my phone is so alerting it messes me up all together.

Anger and disturbing thoughts.,"This doesnt really happen. Not often. Last time was a few months ago. My insomnia right now is peaking, as I havent been getting enough sleep. I'm sleeping even less than I was. It's just getting worse. But does anyone else have extreme emotional mood swings when they get really bad sleep deprivation? My thoughts dont get like this often but today I've had numerous murderous thoughts, mostly wanted to stab my head. Easily irritated by everyone in my family. Head hurts, thoughts just wont shut the fuck up. "
An interesting revelation,"I had had insomnia for as long as I can remember. It was my anxiety that caused it for the longest time. But I did notice that if I’m able to put my head down and fall asleep more quickly then my anxiety doesn’t have time to reach the point where it keeps me up. 
Recently I’ve had stomach issues but I didn’t think they were severe enough to warrant any medications. I took a famotidine (Pepcid) tablet with my night meds one night about three weeks ago and for the first time in years I slept through the night. I honestly had no idea my stomach issues were playing such a big roll in my sleeping habits.
Apparently, acid reflux can be caused by sleeping medications, antidepressants and antihistamines. 

I also started using a cotton based blanket instead of a comforter, and while I prefer the weight of the comforter I can’t deny that the blanket has kept me cooler. 

Just two small changes I have personally made within the new year that has helped. "

Weird Sleeping Ritual For an Insomniac,"So, I recently disclosed to a close friend my weird ritual for falling asleep. I'm a very bad insomniac and over the years have had to get creative as I am sensitive to medication. Basically I have to turn on a fan and sleep in the fetal position while listening to ASMR. It has to be one specific video and there is a timestamp in the video I have to hear before my brain triggers and drifts into sleep mode. Am I weird ? Are there any other people out there who have weird rituals/habits? Feel free to comment or talk about it!!!!"
Trazadone and Overactive bladder?,"I'm starting to reach my wits end with my sleeping issues, which I've been dealing with for about 13+ years now...ever since my early teenage years. Unrelated (or so I thought), I also have a severely overactive bladder - which, in addition to tons of daytime trips to the bathroom, also includes a minimum of 4-5 trips at night. I went to see a urologist last week to finally address this longstanding issue, and she casually mentioned a possible connection between my Trazadone and overactive bladder. I feel kind of stupid for not having thought of this myself, because right around when I started the Traz (6 or 7 years ago) is when these bladders issues began. I think I was just so relieved to finally be prescribed some sort of sleeping med that I didn't even make the connection. I guess I also have been ignoring the fact that it ultimately hasn't even been giving me a solid nights sleep for years now. Anyway, I would LOVE to hear if anyone else has had this same symptom as a result of Trazadone!! I'm starting to go crazy with the combination of insomnia + peeing a thousand times every 24 hrs. I guess I need to go cold turkey and see if I experience any relief. Also, has anyone switched from Traz to another med? Any success stories?"
It has never been this bad before.,"I have always dealt with some form of 'insomnia' since high school. I suffer from pretty severe general anxiety and social anxiety and insomnia was a shitty side effect. I always just kinda dealt with it, and made up for my lack of sleep by taking constant naps from pure exhaustion during the weekends. However, the last few months it's gotten so. Much. Worse.

I've been taking CBD and melatonin products to help, and they've been doing their job up until a few nights ago -- I decided to take a midday nap, and I constantly woke up and felt my heart racing the entire time, not able to fully 'fall asleep'. Then, last night, I fell asleep fairly quickly -- however I woke up 20+ times, have multiple nightmares, and was completely restless. I feel like I haven't had a deep sleep in forever. 

Is there anything I can do? I am so tired of feeling this way and it is to the point now where I am having migraines and my job performance is lacking."
Problems...,"Hey, so this is my first post here, I’m not really used to this sort of stuff, but I thought I’d post here to see what others think.

Essentially I’m a 16 y/o M and I just recently got “diagnosed” with elements of OCD I suffer with harm intrusive thoughts and have had great deal of anxiety and stress dealing with them I was placed on a CBT list and am waiting for 6-8 months for an appointment. lately it has affected my sleep terribly, I wake up every 2-3 hours and after my first awakening my second usually always ends in a nightmare, this has happened for the past 3-4 days, and it’s starting to make me worry about going to sleep, because I’ve never struggled to sleep before, and it’s effecting me terribly, I usually just lay in bed TIL 6-7 then I wake up as after my second or third awakening I struggle to go back to sleep, and feel tired and have less energy throughout the day, I suffer from depression and have thoughts about self harm and suicide, obviously this is not something I would ever contemplate just something that causes me worry, does anyone here have any recommendations to something that may help? or thoughts as to what may be wrong with me?"

first reddit post,"Does anyone experience insomnia due to chronic pain? Taking more pain meds isn’t an option because I only get two a day. I’ve tried hydroxyzine, amitriptyline, a few different muscle relaxers etc. My doctor isn’t too keened on using benzos because I take opiates every day and have taken Xanax before and it’s hard for me to ween myself off. She just prescribed me Lunesta so I’m hoping it helps me. Does anyone have any tips on ways to help insomnia due to chronic pain? I’m only getting four hours of sleep a night and it’s driving me insane haha.

The benefits of not sleeping,Destroys hope which prompts an increase in one’s ability to stop giving a shit about everything
Help with 8 year old please!!!,"First time writing on here hoping for help. My son is 8 years old. He was diagnosed with both types of sleep apnea as a toddler. Got his tonsils/adenoids removed at 3 years old which I guess gets rid of the obstructive sleep apnea. Other type is neurological and isn’t cure able. 

He’s always woken up once or twice throughout the night, but in the last several months it’s been him waking up crying, sleep walking, coming to my wife and I and waking us up for literally nothing and then going back to sleep. It’s getting worse. He’s waking up now and coming in our room and when you say his name he looks surprised, doesn’t know why he came to our room, etc. 

Do this sound familiar to any of those with insomnia? Any advice is welcome. "
"Have had insomnia for a year. For my sake, someone help.","Title says it all. I can fall asleep, no problem, but can't remain asleep on any given night.

This past year has been hell, and I'm not seeing a light at the end of the tunnel. Talked to a therapist in October. He told me to exercise. Which I do. Told a doctor about my problem a month ago. She put me on Trazodone, but I'm not comfortable taking something like that. Being someone also against taking meds, she recommend a nutrition store in my area.

Last Monday, I went to the store and picked up Deep Sleep, an herbal medicine, and 5HTP at 50mg. I've been taking them for just over a week now, and my sleep is still garbage.  I'm losing my mind over this.

Would like to find another alternative to Deep Sleep: I'm paying about $7 for 10 pills. And the packaging suggests taking two of them nightly! It's insane.

Should I give the herbal medicines time, or am I just wasting my time? Haven't tried Melatonin. Since I'm having problems staying asleep, will Melatonin work? If not, can you recommend anything that's helped you?"
Does anyone have any tips for cooling down?,"My room is always a bit hotter than the rest of the house, and in addition to that I get hot flashes after eating and when lying down due to my IBS flaring up. I lie down for a nap and feel hot and itchy and gross either before or after I wake up. In summer it’s particularly awful. I have an air conditioner in my room but in warm weather it doesn’t make much of a difference unless I put it really low, but then it gets expensive.

The other thing is I’ve put on some weight ever since my IBS got worse because it makes me hungry all the time, so I guess that extra insulation could be part of the reason I feel hot.

I open my windows at night too, but again that doesn’t make much difference in summer.

Anything more I can do? Apart from just wait until winter?"
Anyone else start hallucinating if you get no sleep at all for more than 24 hours?,"I start to get quite bothersome auditory hallucinations if I go about 30+ hours with no sleep at all. This really sucks when you have chronic insomnia and it’s therefore highly likely you will go such lengths of time with zero sleep.

I recognise that they are hallucinations but I still worry that I’m going to say something that sounds crazy and ask my co-workers who is playing music or whatever when no music is actually playing. I think I might have musical ear syndrome as I’ve always had problems with my ears and hearing. However, the hallucinations only really become an issue when I’m sleep deprived.

If you look it up, the condition is basically your brain trying to compensate for hearing loss, which results in you misinterpreting background noise as music. It often sounds like someone is playing a radio in another room. I’ll hear all kinds of random songs (country music, rap, pop) that don’t even exist. I’m kinda proud of my brain for being able to make up new one hit wonders to follow me around all day, but it can be quite bothersome. Because the idea of someone playing music in another room is no where near as far-fetched as schizophrenic hallucinations (such as a single, disembodied voice saying hurtful things about you), I often question whether or not the music I am hearing is real. Because sometimes it has turned out that someone actually was playing music. Usually I’ll assume it’s not real just to be safe.

Does anyone else have this problem with hallucinations caused by sleep deprivation? 

I’ve also experienced visual hallucinations once or twice when I went about 50+ hours with no sleep. I recognised these were hallucinations as well, because I knew that the assignment I was proof reading on my laptop didn’t usually morph into a post-modern watercolour painting of a tropical bird."
Unable to fix my circadian rhythm - induces insomnia,"For school reasons in the past, my sleep schedule now is such that I'm going to bed at 3:30 and waking up at 10, which worked fine for me because I'll have sufficient energy for the day.

Now I want to be able to fall asleep earlier, maybe around 1, and be able to wake up at 8 just because my schedule works differently than it did in the past. But every time I try to sleep even a little bit earlier (say 3:15) my body enters this insomnia state (I can feel the shift in my brain, it's like I become colder all of the sudden) and I can't enter REM sleep for weeks. This has happened 2 times so far and after each of those instances, the way that I resolved the insomnia is by going to sleep at 3:30 again. Then it's all fine. My body locks in insomnia until I return to the 3:30 that I usually fall asleep.

The most recent time (ended yesterday) went on for 20 days and I kept trying to go to sleep at earlier times just because I was so tired, but it did not work and I had to do 3:30 in order to exit the cycle.

I use melatonin and valerian root as supplements to help me sleep but if I take it during one of the ""cycles"" it just helps me sleep for one day but does not break the cycle.

I feel stuck, and it's making me nervous that my circadian rhythm can only be adjusted in one direction... any help is appreciated. "
I fucking need help,"I'm pretty sure I had insomnia ever since high school, but it wasn't so bad to the point where I felt like I needed help. I'm 23 years old now, and it has just been getting worse. A few days ago, I went to Disneyland. I woke up at 6 AM to meet up with my friends. We were at Disneyland until 10 PM constantly walking around. When I got back home, I thought that I would sleep well that night, but I ended up sleeping at 7 AM. My sleeping schedule has been so fucked that I don't even really have one anymore. I used to be a runner, and I noticed that exercising just makes me more hyper at night. The only thing that has been helping is melatonin, but I don't want to rely on it forever... :/

edit: Thanks for the unnecessary downvote."
Almost had it!,"Laid down at 10, was pleasantly dozing until my roommate started screaming and what sounded like throwing things down the stairs, and then went into her room, and then started what sounded like pushing things over. 


(Background: that shit makes me unnecessarily anxious because I grew up where those sounds preceded me getting hit just cause they felt like something was my fault. I've told my roommate this. I've begged her to stop doing shit like this  I've told her it freaks me out. I'm really tempted to get in my car and drive away. I had plans to leave eventually. But it's midnight now and I have to be up in seven hours. No, I don't know what's up with her or why she does shit like this. This happens a lot.)

Has anyone had success with CBD oil?,"Since I'm in Canada, I've been curious about trying CBD oil to help with sleep. I occasionally experience insomnia, some times worse than others but it's not a huge problem in my life, thankfully. But when I do experience it, it lasts for a few weeks and it gets extremely hard to function during the day. 

Is there anyone here that can lead me the right direction with CBD oil? Maybe a strain or dosage that might help? 

Currently I'm experiencing insomnia but it's due to pain and I am on percocet. I obviously don't want to get dependent and the pain is not chronic so I will stop taking it when I'm not in pain but it helps me sleep so much. "
Insomnia on work nights,"This is really weird for me, mostly I sleep like a rock for 7-9 hours. Since two weeks ago every single night that I have to work the next day, I just cannot go to sleep.

I don't really eat in the evenings, I don't drink coffee after four, I have blue light filters on all my devices, I burn lavender oil before bed, I drink milky Rooibos before bed, (can't stand warm milk) my job isn't stressful (like seriously, my boss is a really chill guy) I'm not even THINKING about work, I'm not anxious about not falling asleep, I'm completely relaxed. On the point of sleep. But my consciousness just doesn't shut down.

Any helpful thoughts?

&#x200B;

Update: On the off chance that this is helpful to someone, it seems one (or all) of three things worked. I started taking supplements for iron, magnesium, and Vitamin D. So far no more insomnia.

And good luck to all you chronic sufferers, I have newfound respect for the fact that you even do anything at all."
I can't fall asleep,"I have a really hard time getting to sleep at a good time. It really hinders my ability to concentrate in school, and I sleep through classes sometimes because of it.

Because of this I tend to think a lot about stuff while in bed trying to fall asleep, and often I get quite lonely. I just want people to talk to late at night or something idk. "

Night time venting,"Haven't been able to fall asleep at a reasonable time for years, when I was going to school, fine it didn't have any impact except on myself when I was late but now that I work I need to get something to help me sleep. 
But have this really irrational fear of doctors, I know what they do for a living I know they want well for most humans but I don't know what to say to the nurse when I book a appointment or what questions the doctor will ask me
What if I stumble on my words and they just say that nothing is wrong with me

I just want something to help me fall asleep even my boss pushes me to get it done because she says she wants me at 100%

Duh ofc she wants but I want to keep my job

Should I just go?
Should I just book the trip to the doctors?
But what if I just get to go home and keep laying here in bed all night like usual?
What if I get my hopes up at falling asleep at a reasonable time only for me to spit in my own face by throwing in a bad joke or something? 

Just venting and asking stupid questions

Can't seem to fall asleep,"Last week I landed back in Europe after a trip to the states which made me uneasy to fall asleep again.

It all started last Friday night: I would twist and turn and get a bit anxious which would cause me to have the occasional cigarette (yes I know which keeps you awake). Nothing, couldn't get a single hour of sleep.

Obviously the jet-lag was my rational choice and didn't make it a big deal.

Then Saturday, Sunday, Monday and Tuesday nights. I have been 5 nights without sleep and it's becoming a paranoia.

I get anxiety before getting into bed which keeps me from falling asleep.

The  issue is that I don't even get those 2-3 hours of sleep that at least make you more relaxed and hopeful for the next day. I might have gotten 1 hour or so here and there, with the occasional fast-paced dream caused by melatonin, but nothing in the order of a full relaxation sleep.

Does anybody else suffer from this total lack of sleep for so many days?

Thanks"
5+ years insomnia sufferers?,"Hi all. I wanted to reach out to people who've had chronic, long term insomnia. I've had it for almost ten years now, and it started pretty early in adolescence. My main problem is falling asleep, but I've also had periods where I struggled to stay asleep, and recently I've been waking up earlier than I would like. I was on Melatonin for about the first five years, working myself up to 10mg until that stopped working. Eventually I was put on Trazodone and have been using it ever since. I find Trazodone works great for me, sufficient at least, but if I ever forget a dose or sleep at a friend's house I always go back to getting 2-3 hours of sleep.  Occasionally when I smoke or drink it gets me sleepy but it either isn't enough to put me to sleep or I wake up after two hours unable to fall asleep again. 

Has anyone with such long term insomnia ever gotten better, or is it just something you've learned to deal with? I always wonder where mine comes from. I vaguely remember having a period of constant nightmares before the insomnia started, and when I started taking Trazodone for the first few weeks I woke up in a cold sweat every morning, and had a decent amount of at least ""stressful"". Sometimes I feel as though my psyche has an aversion to sleep, and don't know how to fix it. Really just curious about other experiences. I could definitely have it worse, but the idea of this going on forever is frustrating to say the least. "
Hello again 3 am,"So I had been on Ambien for last 7 days. I'm out of it. I only get a few at a time and as soon as I run out I go back to not sleeping. 

I'm really finding it so difficult to cope with this right now. I know I'll be up for hours more. I can't hang out with friends becuase I'm too tired to do anything. Too tired to function. 

I need a solution. I am sick of this vicious cycle. "
"I probably haven't gone to bed before 1:30-2 AM in 6 years, minimmum","I don't know why but every single night I can't fall asleep, even if it is my intention. Even nights i am tired and just want to nap after work, no matter what I do i just cannot fall asleep. I bring it up because yesterday I got home from work at 5:30, ready to nap for a little or maybe go to bed at 9 and wake up early, feeling rested. Instead the time flew by while I read and watched a little tv, and then all the sudden it was midnight. Then it was 2:30. Why cant i ever sleep!! :("
"every night I wake up at the same time, 3 hours later after falling asleep????","Ok for the past month I have been dealing with a terrible NEW insomnia/anxiety symptoms. I had insomnia years ago, I think in 2010 or 13. I beat it I think through exercise & breathing. 

Ok long story short. The weirdest thing is, for the kast two weeks I felt comfortable to fall asleep at night. But I wake up every night AT THE SAME DAME TIME which is usually 3:30 AM...I wake up with my heart rate going fast. Its weird because threw the day my anxiety feels gone and I feel relaxed. I did a great workout earlier today, and I felt the anxiety in my body dying away. I felt so great at work. I knew I was gonna come home and get a great sleep tonight. But AGAIN I get woke up by some kind of force. And all I know is that when I check my pulse its rapid. Is this more than anxiety???? I go to my doctor tomorrow, but its so crazy that for the past two weeks I believe, that my body seems to wake itself up at the same dame time every night. 

Is this anxiety. Or possible something more??? 

Thanks and god bless everyone here "
Quick question,"Does having insomnia interfere with your love life? If so, how? "
Waking up too early if I go to bed before 1AM,"As the title suggests, recently I have been having issues staying asleep if I go to bed in time. 

I have finally fixed my sleep schedule from going to sleep after 1AM to falling asleep at 10-11PM, only to wake up at around 1-2AM and later at around 4-5AM. I wake up pretty restless the second time and haven't been able to fall asleep again. I've been suffering from this for about a week now. 

I have never had this issue when falling asleep at 1-2AM. Unfortunately I can't stick to this late sleep schedule since I have to wake up early for work. 

Anyone else that has suffered from this, or any tips to prevent myself from waking up?

Anxiety Induced Insomnia?,"Well I seem to have given myself Insomnia, something I've never had a problem with. A friend told me he had been struggling to sleep properly and it reminded me of Fatal Familial insomnia and the sporadic kind that isn't hereditary. I told him about it and instead of forgetting about it I got curious and did some heavy research into it because I haven't read about it in so long. I believe this triggered some anxiety.

&#x200B;

Haven't slept more then a full 4 hrs in the past 3 days mostly lying in my bed for 8 hours at a time, convincing myself I have this illness. Attributing it to various things, for instance I have been eating bacon every morning, lot's of it recently, and I like it more under cooked than normal, so I tell myself that contaminated meat gave this fatal disease or something.

&#x200B;

It really blows, I always thought insomnia was nothing super serious, but feeling all the days meld together and not waking up refreshed or never having the feeling of starting a ""new day"" messes with your head. I read about sleep restriction which is something I am willing to try.  I will also try to use some medical marijuana gummy oil drops to sleep later as well.

Just wanted to vent and maybe get some tips on how to sleep easier? My body feels tired but my eyes don't get that heavy feeling or comfortable when I close them and lay down, it's shitty."

How I managed to get to sleep,"I'm a lurker and I'm on mobile, do forgive me 

Okay, so I've been on this thread a couple of times now, especially on the times where I couldn't sleep at all. I'll give you guys a bit of a backstory on what went on.

About a couple of months ago I started to wake up in the middle of the night, for no apparent reason whatsoever. It was weird, as I generally went to sleep pretty fast and I never really had this sort of issue. I figured ok, its probably normal. So I tried to go back to sleep, but I could not. It was about 3am when I woke up and I needed to wake up for 7am for school.  I was awake for most of those hours, until about 6am. I go to bed at 11PM, and on that day I had about 4 hours of sleep, which is pretty bad. During that time, I was anxious and stressed over the fact that time was running by so fast and that I needed to get to sleep. I also was calculating how much time I had left, and that only kept me even more awake. I had previously known breathing  exercises, particularly the 4-7-8 method, and that did not work at all. On the next night, it happened again. Woke up at 3, didn't go back to sleep until half past 6. I thought I was going insane. I genuinely thought that I had a sleep disorder.

So on that day, I decided that it was best to take some sort of sleeping remedy. In the UK (I think in the US also) there's these pills that you can get called Nytol, which are like these herbal tablets designed to keep you calm and to get you to sleep. This was the first time that I ever took this, and I was getting worried that it was going to happen again and again and that I would become dependent on Nytol. Took it, and I had a good night's sleep.

On the next night I didn't take Nytol, to see if I could go to sleep without it. On that night, I slept completely fine. The next night I slept fine. The night after that. It all seemed like it went away.

That was until about three weeks ago, where, out of the blue, it happened again. The exact same scenario. Woke up at about half past 3, couldn't get back to sleep. I was so worried to the point where I cried myself to sleep at about 6am as I thought that it was all going to happen again and that I had a sleep disorder, even though I had previously asked my dad who said that I didn't meet the signs of insomnia, as insomniacs tend to find it hard to initially get to sleep whilst for me it's really easy.

On the next night, I took a Nytol and thank god I was fine and I had a good night sleep. A couple of days later, I went to go to see my therapist, who deals with my stress and anxiety issues, for which might have caused these sleeping problems. I told him about it and he said that it's normal to have these sorts of issues when you're stressed and anxious, and that's what started to paint the picture as to why I was having these issues as I was stressed over the amount of work in school and that I was stressed and anxious over how long I had left to sleep.

He then suggested that I should use a breathing exercise apart from the 4-7-8 method, which is known as ""box breathing."" Apparently, he told me that it is used for when soldiers have to keep calm on the battlefield. As well as sleep, it could also be used for other things as well, such as keeping calm for when you're nervous or when you are stressed for example.

Here's how to do it, in case some of you don't know.

Step 1) Breathe in to the count of 4.
Step 2) Hold your breath to the count of 4.
Step 3) Exhale your breath to the count of 4.
Step 4) Hold for the count of 4.

He told me that once you do this exercise for at least 10-15 times in a row, you should feel relaxed in no time. So, on that night, I was a bit anxious over a test that was on in school on the next day when I went to bed. I used this method for about 20 counts, and I somehow surprisingly went to sleep until I had to wake up at 7am. I didn't even wake up! 

Ever since then, my sleep schedule has been getting back to normal. I implement this method for every time that I am either stressed or anxious for when I have to sleep, even when I'm not sleeping at all I use this method to calm myself down. 

I think the conclusion to this would be that if you ever find yourself in a situation where you cannot sleep at all or for when you wake up in the middle of the night and when you can't get to sleep, the best solution for you is to use the method of box breathing, to calm yourself down and to get yourself some well needed rest. 

Another factor would be to use Nytol if you can, it's not as powerful as more advanced sleeping pills but it does help.

Also, try not to check the time on your phone when you wake up in the middle of the night. It will only make you worse as you know how much you have left to sleep. "
"I used to have chronic mild insomnia, and going to bed gave me anxiety. Here's the exercise I learnt that triggers sleep reliably for me.","I now take about half an hour to fall asleep on a bad day. That's good enough for me, given what I was used to, and I'm optimistically confident that I'll fall asleep faster in time.

I used to have chronic mild insomnia: I used to take an hour or more to fall asleep each night. Waking up in the middle of the night was crap because I would take ages to fall asleep again and I would only fall asleep by the time I needed to get out of bed. 

The following routine worked for me. I don't have any chemical imbalances (that I know of) and I guess I fall into the category of people who ""forgot how to fall sleep"". I used to be terrified of the dark so I deliberately tried to stay awake every night as a kid, watching the lights of the car headlamps stretching across the wall. It was kind of lonely. That's probably how the insomnia started. Since I started the following routine, I've been 2 years free from chronic insomnia. 

1. Focus: I find it easy to fall asleep in front of the TV, but the moment I move to the bed I'm completely awake again. So annoying! I can fall asleep in boring lectures, but I can't in bed. Focus leads to sleep. I focus on the feeling of my blanket .

2. Focus on whether my posture is comfortable and adjust accordingly. Start from toes and go all the way up to the top  e.g. Are my feet in a comfortable position? If not, move them. Knees, hips, elbows, is hair in my face?

3. Relax my face. Relax my forehead, eyebrows, inner corners of my eyes, relax nostrils, corners of my mouth, lips should be slightly apart, tongue, jaw, cheeks

4. Full breathing. Very key. This technique can be googled. 

5. Start to focus more on the out breath than the in breath.

6. Feel how my body is becoming more heavy. More and more heavy...

7. Focus on the full breathing.

8. Focus on the out breath.

9. Feel my body getting more heavy...


There are other things that would help minimise insomnia, like relaxation exercises in the middle of the day. But I work full time plus I'm lazy, so I skipped all the advice about not using phones before sleep or doing more sport. The above routine alone works for me. That said, maybe those techniques could help others.

Reddit has been amazing and opened my world. It's saved my ass in times like when I left a massive mark on the ceiling and got advice on how to fix it before my SO got home (magic eraser peeps!) and opened my mind to other ideas (r/philosophy). I love reddit and I owe reddit. This is probably the only topic where I have something real to contribute, so any questions please feel free to fire away.

Edit: forgot to mention the routine I've listed is one cycle. If I'm not asleep yet, I repeat the cycle from the start. I do as many cycles as it takes until I've dozed off."

Did I turn myself into an insomniac?,"When I was a kid (around 15 years old), I started staying awake (by choice) and sat at my computer all hours of the night.

New medication keeping me from sleeping.,"Hey all, 

I’m on a new medication (antidepressant) that has insomnia as a side effect. My doctor told me that it would probably go away after the first week, but it’s been over a month and I can’t get any sleep at all. I generally get 1-2 hours of sleep a night, if any, and then one day a week I’ll crash and get 8-10 hours of sleep. It wouldn’t be such a huge deal but THE HEADACHES. It’s terrible. And I also feel woozy, almost like I’m high. 


For a while, I was microdosing on pot, and that was helping a lot with sleep, but it was getting in the way of my studying.... and I also ran out. Lol. I can’t get any until mid March. 


What can I do to hold me over to my next doctors appointment on Thursday?


Thanks again. I’m always so excited to see that reddit has a community for everything that I could possibly need to discuss."
Melatonin supplements increasing frequency of dreams?,"I have a bit of a mild insomnia problem, and turned to melatonin supplements a while ago. I’ve found currently that they don’t really help me fall asleep too quickly, but when I do, I have very vivid and frequent dreams compared to almost never having them without the melatonin. Does anyone else experience this?"
Blue light filter- IPhone,"I had been looking everywhere for an IOS App to filter blue light on my iPhone with no success. Found one but it only worked in app so I couldn’t use the rest of my phone. Anyway I just realised there is already a blue light filter built in. I don’t think it blocks 100 % of it but my screen is well proper Orange so it must be doing something. For those who aren’t familiar with it, go to Settings > Display and then turn on night shift. You can manually adjust the warmth there too."
NyQuil. The only way for me to sleep.,"I can’t sleep naturally and my only way to get some rest is to drink NyQuil. I usually take 1000 mg a day. It becomes dangerous when you start doing 4000 mg daily. However , I feel like I’m hooked to it. It’s the only way I found to dumb down my mind. "
I finally can sleep.," Hello.  Dont want you waste your time with unless info, so here you have what  help me to sleep everynight before 6 years of imsonia. Please, comment  what you think and post any Q:

What  works really fast for me  is drink coca leaf tea (you can buy delisse  coca tea from internet) and apple juice.  In Peru, people says apples  juice cures insane people, and i think they  are right. What i exactly  do is drink 15 bags of coca tea (try with  little doses, i drink a lot cause love it) and then drink apple  juice (a lot  1,2, 3 litres) and wait to relax.  The way people make apple juice here is different from USA, we  buy  little apples (1 or 2kgs), and boil them for 30 minutes. Then we put them in the  blender. then strain the mashed apple and mix with the water of  the  result of the boil. Works very well for me.  this nock out me all  nights. Please, tell me if  you tried it and how helped to you."

Ways to stay awake??,"So basically, I can sleep in the daylight no problem. Once the suns up I can sleep right through sometimes until 5/6 o’clock. I love to nap but it just means it doesn’t help my insomnia.

I have a 12 hour shift in 4 and a half hours, and then I’m meeting friends after for a night out. I need ways to stay awake and alert tomorrow, because I know this lack of sleep is gonna hit me like a sack of shit. I’ve already taken a sleeping pill a few hours ago, but it’s not kicking in. 

Any advice?"
Insomnia due to constant nerve pain,"Hey guys, it's almost 4am now and I'm still awake because of the pain in my legs and back.

Do any of you have a FEAR of sleeping?,"I know it sounds crazy, but every night as I’m struggling to sleep I get scared. Of what? I’m not sure. Maybe that I won’t wake up?

How many of us have trouble sleeping because our phones/computers put the internet right at our disposal and we’re so used to jumping from one thing to the next instantly that our minds move at that same speed as we attempt to fall asleep?,
It's selfish but i wish i had insomniac friends,Or foreign ones or someone who would be up at this time of night so it isn't so bOring omg ahah. I used to go and find people online and that was fun for a while but it's so emotionally exhausting I wish I could meet up with someone who cares about me at this time of night so it'd be less frustrating. I wish I had friends in general tbh. The ones I do have don't care v much about me and if they do it's because they feel bad. Idk I just gave myself until next Tuesday to get everything sorted and I'm more of a mess than ever. I haven't even done these essays I have to do but I cant function enough for anything I write to make any literal sense. I fucking hate this. I think I give up I'm just going to take some of the stuff I have left and not care about the hangover lag tomorrow. Im getting so fed up of this I want to sleep but I really don't want to wake up tomorrow.
"I have finally been able to sleep for a full week without interruption, however every time I sleep I wake up more tired then when I last slept.","So, after a long while of suffering from shitty sleep and waking up throughout the night, I have finally gotten it under control for a bit, and actually slept for 12 hours straight the other day. If you want to know what helped me, I started going on walks before bed, stopped keeping my brain so active 3 hours before bed (where that were possible), stopped mindlessly browsing the internet, and listened to [Ethoslab's early mineraft lets plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHngf-CKCzk&list=PL1523184A958895EF) who has a voice more relaxing and soothing than Bob Ross himself. He's a great entertainer as well. Edit: should also mention that this took a while to work, but the routine is what helped the most. Sleeping in a different bed also helped because I believe I started associating my overthinking with my other bed. Double Edit: Taking vitamin d in the morning was also a big help.

However, I've run into another problem, which is that I feel miserably tired in the morning, every single morning, and this only goes away to a certain extent throughout the day. I'll kind of feel like I'm in a constant dream-like state, and when I want something, say a laptop that is right in front of me, I will find myself staring at it for a couple seconds before actually grabbing it. Or sometimes I'll just be wandering around aimlessly, not knowing where to go or what to do, however I still function just enough despite this to live a semi-normal life with my mothers help.

I also get that feeling you get when you're in a dream where you feel that you want to run or hit something, but can't because you're too weak. I will feel this constantly.

Perhaps the most weird thing, is that I caught myself half asleep one night, moving my arm around, and grabbed a cup of water that was on my night stand and knocked it over on to me. I only fully ""woke"" up when the cold water reached me and I sat there in bewonderment at what the hell just happened. I've had memories of me thinking incoherent things to myself throughout the night too and will mix up my dreams with reality.

I had a sleep study done six months ago and was told I had no condition, so I honestly don't know what could be causing this, although I didn't have these symptoms then. I actually felt better when I wasn't able to sleep than I do right now, not that that makes it okay to not sleep, but it is very worrying.

If anybody has any ideas, I would be happy to hear them or if you know of any other subs I could post in for help I'd appreciate it."
Does anyone get scared into not sleeping?,I sound like a massive pussy but whenever I’m settled and ready to sleep I close my eyes and then boom horror character and now I can’t sleep.
Relaxation and sleep design?,"Hello guys!

I am a senior from Parsons School of Design currently working on designing a set of products for people who experience insomnia for my graduation thesis. I began this project knowing that my grandmother, age 85, experiences periodic insomnia and would not talk about it. So many of my friends experience this problem in varying intensity. Worst of all it is a personal struggle...

I have been researching and coming up with ideas for months, as well as speaking to a psychologist. I don't personally experience insomnia on a weekly basis but I am here to listen.

Currently I have two directions for my design:

1. Using sleep tracking technologies and sensory relaxation to promote healthy napping practices to restore energy in the day
2. Using sensorial cues (smell, sound, light, heat) to create an environment for serial diverse imaging (a randomized imagery for people to drift thoughts away which psychologists have developed)

I can elaborate on my ideas further if anyone is interested.

Please let me know your thoughts and feelings around gadgets, beddings, sleeping, life, and so on.

Thank you so much :)"

Amitriptyline for sleep?,"It says it’s marketed as an anti depressant, but I’m already on effexor for that. My psych NP gave me amitriptyline for sleep, first at 10mg and now at 25mg and this shit does nothing but annoy me when I’m still up at 6 in the morning. "
Hard to fall asleep,"When I try to fall asleep it sometimes takes up to a hour of laying still to fall asleep I tried soothing voices, rainfall,and music. I can't try weighted blankets because I am to young to order stuff online and I can't ask for one because money is tight. Most days I fall asleep around 1:00-1:30am but on bad days I can stay up until 5:00am it is currently 2:15 where I am now. But when I do fall asleep I only sleep for like 1-4 hours and I feel perfectly fine but I know I'm not because my eyes hurt."
"Yeah, sleep is cool, but have you ever laid awake for a few hours helplessly ruminating on things you have no power to do anything about?","...just kidding; I know everyone here has done that.  

I had all my little rituals down pretty good for awhile, not sure what went wrong but this week has really gone sideways and last night I just wanted to go to bed early and rest.  Totally boomeranged; I slept about two hours and then my brain decided that since it was nice and quiet it'd be a great time to open the file drawers of ""shit I've forgotten about, feel guilty about, or generally bugs me if I think about it.""

My dog and I really need help.,"Hi i need help. I’m up all night ( until 5-6 am) And  sleep all day. I need to break this cycle! It wasn’t that bad until last week when I was tapering off gabapentin. I was  on 300 mg a day and I was down to 100 and I just could not sleep! I have Fibromyalgia, Depression and Anxiety but I used to be able to fall asleep by 2:30-3:00 AM ! So, now I’m going back on the gabapentin even though I think it’s making my hair shed drastically. But I don’t know what else to do. It doesn’t help me sleep but this insomnia is horrible. Any help or suggestions to get me on a “normal “ sleep schedule would be SO much appreciated! 🙏
I’m also very underweight and this schedule is making me lose more weight. And I have a service dog and it’s totally freaking him out too ( he thinks I’m dead) .

"Up another 48 hours, any help would be appreciated","I’ve never needed much sleep, 4 hours or so and I was good. I have attempted prescription sleep aids, melatonin, no caffeine, unfortunately none of it helped. The last 2 weeks though, I’ll be up 24-48 hours, fall asleep for maybe 1-2 hours and the cycle repeats. I truly want some sleep and am at a loss. Has anyone else dealt with this issue?"
Anyone else wake up 3-4 times a night?,"I’m honestly convincing myself I have some sort of hidden disease/sickness that is causing me to wake up during the night WIDE AWAKE, and it’s causing more stress for me because when I wake up during the night I’m thinking something is wrong with me AND I’m frustrated I woke up. Does anyone else wake up multiple times a night and have no idea why. I swear it felt like I woke up almost at the be beginning of a panic attack, I’ve never felt that before. It was like my body and mind just thought it was perfect time to start freaking out as soon as I opened my eyes. "
Doxylamine succinate and hallucinations,"I’ve been taking this daily for several weeks. Sometimes it helps and sometimes it doesnt. I have to switch up OTC sleepaids and NyQuil cos my doctor doesn’t want to prescribe sleep aids. 

Last night was the first time I got visual hallucinations and minor auditory. The lights and walls were flowy and I was seeing faces when I closed my eyes. I thought it was because I was sleep deprived. 

But I already took a tab a few hours ago and decided to just look it up and basically I’m reading it is a rare side effect or signs of an OD. 

It’s 4 am and I can’t sleep and now I’m panicking and am worried that since I took another I should be gong to the ER or something. 

Anyone ever have this experience? "
How to get to sleep?,"I don’t have severe insomnia, but my life is still noticeably impacted by my lack of sleep. On a good night, I get to bed at 1:30 or thereabouts. Most common is 2-2:30. I’m up and going by 7:30-7:45 every day except Sundays. 5 and a half hours is not enough for me to function. Any tips?"
Anyone tried pulling an all-nighter to reset?,"Despite struggling with insomnia, I do pretty well with sleeping 8 to 10 hrs a night. The problem is I take a lot of meds (antihistamines and sometimes Klonopin) to do so. 

The root problem is that I was abused as a child and never learned good sleep habits because I would be awake at night, waiting for my mother to come hurt me. This has caused a hyper-awareness at night as part of my PTSD symptoms.

Even with the meds, I often struggle for hours before finally falling asleep around 4 am and then waking up at 1 pm. Thankfully, I work from home and have a flexible schedule so this is not an issue.

 I want to stop taking as many antihistamines but I can't fall asleep without them and I build up a tolerance quickly. I want to try pulling an all-nighter with no meds to help reduce my tolerance and see if I can train myself to sleep naturally at a certain time. 

Thoughts?"
Tell me honestly because I need the truth.,"This question is for those who developed insomnia in their late 20's or early 30's (due to a surge in anxiety, stress, grief, trauma, or something similar) but never really had sleep onset and maintenance issues before and were able to sleep deeply on most nights. Bonus points if you couldn't nap even if you wanted to.

Now that your insomnia has (mostly) resolved, is your quality (and perhaps quantity) of sleep the same as or close to what it used to be? Or has it never fully returned to normal?

Please be brutally honest so that I can better accept my new reality. I have been struggling for the last 6 months, and it has made my life unrecognizable."

I haven’t slept through the whole night in years and I’m so fed up with this never ending exhaustion,I’ve had problems sleeping through the night since I was a child and everyone thought I’d simply grow out of it. I never did and over the last 6 or 7 years my sleep has slowly gotten worse and worse. I average about four hours a night and don’t know how I’m still alive; been running on an empty tank sleep wise for too long. As a kid it was the nightmares that kept me up and woke me up screaming about three nights a week. As an adult it’s the stress of everything I have to get done during the week. I also suffer from adult night terrors where I scream audibly and even get out of bed and run around screaming in my sleep. I know a main cause of this is stress but I can’t just stop being stressed out like people so unhelpfully recommend like there’s some magic switch I can pull. I’ve tried every over the counter sleep aid and melatonin is virtually useless on me. I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this.  And on top of everything else the stress of not sleeping is making it harder to sleep!
Insomnia makes me so desperate I just want to jump off a fucking building,"2:35 and even though I’ve been sleepy all day long and was sleepy a few hours ago, it’s over now : back to being tired but fully awaken.

The worst about insomnia is that when it becomes frequent, it makes you scared to go to bed, scared to turn off the lights because you can feel this is going to be another void of just waiting laying...
And that just makes everything worse, the apprehension of sleeping (not sleeping).

Ok I’m not going through this again. I’ll just drink a pill.

I can notice the sleepy feeling simply vanishing, just like that and it makes me want to cry and shoot myself till I’m fucking dead sleep.

I thought maybe I was just this kind of person who doesn’t need much sleep. But not at all. Once I’m asleep I can’t wake up before 10-12 hours.

Once I had tried to deprive myself of sleep every single morning so that I feel totally sleepy at night and just drown. It didn’t work. I ended up not being able to wake up, sleep 10 hours or more and then the cycle came back.

And having my husband snoring next to me creates just more frustration and stress. He lays and in seconds he’s completely asleep. I envy that.

For some reason some days are fine (or maybe the reason is the 4mg of tranquilizer...). I just sleep like everyone. But that’s like once in a fortnight.

I just don’t know what to do anymore but ask for some sleeping pills. Because the pills I’m drinking now are for bipolar disorder. They make you moody and suicidal the next day it’s awful. But it puts you to sleep at least.

It has so many negative impacts on the everyday life. I’m not moody just sleep deprived.

The stress has never left me since I was a toddler and I honestly just want to kill myself just so I can stop that.
I don’t hate life, I’m just sick of my body being so constantly tensed and awake, shoulders up, touching my nails constantly, hands and jaw clenched, jumping of surprise everytime someone approaches me.
I used to bite my nails to blood since kindergarten until high school.

I tried therapy and breathing and shit nothing works. It works when everything is fine. When my body has decided not to sleep, it just won’t and it makes me feel so fucking desperate."
Waking up 4-6 times every night,"I don't have any trouble falling asleep but during the night i wake up at random times, i don't feel that cold or any noise wakes me up, it just happens out of nowhere. I then fall asleep again in about 5 minutes and this repeats a few times every night. I then wake up really tired and grumpy and stay like that for most of the day. This effects my life greatly and i don't know how to fix it, any suggestions?"
Can a ssri like Prozac cause weird sleep?,"I never feel fully tired like I should at night. Also when I wake up I don’t feel that well rested feeling like your normally do.

Can this be Prozac?"
Haven’t been sleeping and not tired,"So the title explains most of it but basically, I haven’t been getting much sleep but I’m just not tired at the end of the day. For the past week I’ve gotten less than 5 hrs a night (usually waking up 1-2 times during that) except for last night where I only got ~2 hrs. After all of that, I woke up this morning wide fucking awake. I had my usual morning cup of coffee (at 8 am) but I didn’t have anything else and now it’s 1 am and I’m just not tired... I know I should be sleepy but I’m simply not. I’m a healthy girl in her 20s who exercises regularly and eats healthy. I’ve never been great at sleeping but I’m finally sick of the compounding exhaustion that I know will hit eventually. "
Waking up irritated and angry after 4 hour sleep.,does anyone has problem like this? Every morning i wake up i’m really irritated and aggressive i fucking hate everyone around me i can shittalk to my family members like for nothing and after i feel like an asshole. I’m not aggressive person i’m really chill but this insomnia is fucking my nervous system up. What i can do?
Fairly Debilitating Insomnia Out of Nowhere,"To start off, I take a prescription stimulant that normally has never affected my sleep. I also follow a strict sleep regimen so that I regularly get 8-10 hours a night. The problem developed about a week ago, suddenly I found myself barely able to achieve even 3 hours a night at most. I immediately stopped taking the stimulant, as that seemed like the most logical thing to cause it. Currently it's been a week without the stimulant and there's no change, I can't think of any other causes either. I continually get 0-3 hours of sleep per night, it's beginning to cause serious issues. However I am worried that if I bring this to my psychiatrist then my stimulant meds will be stopped. The meds help so much with my ADHD that a week without them plus insomnia has already impacted grades quite heavily. What is the best course of action in this situation?

TLDR: Rapid onset insomnia with 0-3 hours per        night for the past week. Worried that ADHD medication will be revoked even though it's not the cause. What's the best course of action?"
Getting good results with a weighted blanket!,"I have suffered from insomnia for 30+ years, but have just begun to sleep with a weighted blanket on me. It has greatly helped me fall asleep, stay asleep and sleep more peacefully.

It holds the sleeper down and very still, like when a parent holds their baby as the baby falls asleep. This stifles involuntary or even voluntary movements. I think psychologically it also tells the brain to be still, as well as the body.

They come in various weights. The one I have is a bit too heavy, actually. When I put it entirely on top of me (three nights ago), I felt suffocated. However, I now just put half of it over me, or just a diagonal edge of it, and it works great. I feel so much clearer headed, less irritated, forgetful and groggy.

I would recommend for anyone who can afford one to try it.

Sporadic Fatal Insomnia?,"I have problems sleeping in the last seven months. Vivid dreams, averaging two to four hours a day, can't concentrate or even remember conversations, misplacing things, can't type correctly or read a book, lost my fucking job, breathing through one nostril and never feeling tired. "
Well...the sleep era has ended. Insomnia is back in charge!,"That was fun while it lasted. My insomnia tends to come and go in cycles. Does anyone else's insomnia tend to come and go like this? I'll sleep fine for 2 -3 weeks, then have insomnia for 2 -3 weeks, etc. It just goes round and round. 

Weeeeeeeeeee!"
Anyone else have young children whose own sleep problems make yours 10X worse? Strategies for managing anger?,"My 3yo has this magic ability to wake up crying in the night 15 minutes after I’ve *finally* fallen asleep. Sometimes this will happen 4-5 times a night for a week straight. 

He’s not a terrible sleeper and has long stretches where it’s a non-issue, but I find it very difficult to control my anger when we’re in a phase like this. I’m not worried about hurting him physically (never happened, no impulse to do anything like that), but I do find myself yelling a lot and it’s not good for either of us. 

Perhaps this is more of a parenting question than an insomnia question, but since you folks understand the reality of chronic insomnia and won’t just ask if I’d tried melatonin, I’m curious to hear any thoughts or suggestions. 

Do any of you struggle with this too? We’re all aware of how insomnia makes US miserable, but it can bring misery to the people around us too. 

How do you manage your emotions when you feel unhinged and close to breaking so much of the time?

Anxiety around trying to sleep? Is this a thing?,"I’ve always had trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember. For many years now, my preferred method of getting to sleep has been to just stay awake doing something until I’m so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open and I know that I will almost immediately fall asleep as soon as I try. This has been my only surefire method of getting to sleep for a long time, but it has obvious problems. Luckily I’m at a place in my life where I rarely need to get up early, but that isn’t always the case and it’s resulted in a very haphazard sleeping schedule.

I think I’m scared of two things. When I’m stressed, I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts. I’m terrified of lying awake, stressing about work/relationships/etc. and not having anything to distract me so I just keep doing pointless shit on the internet until my eyes start to protest.

When I’m not stressed. I get scared of all the tossing and turning I know I will inevitably have to deal with. I don’t think I ever learned to “switch off” once I get into bed.  If I have something to think about that isn’t stressful, then I’m fine. I enjoy having the wind down time to think over my day/week. But if my mind is blank, I know I’ll just lie there bored for hours, watching the clock and trying to resist using my phone.

The only thing that helps is weed, but I’m currently trying to cut back, so that’s not an option.

Is this a normal problem? Is it a form of insomnia? I have no idea if this is even the right place to ask."
"I don’t have anxiety of sleep and don’t really care about sleep no more, but I still can’t sleep even after exercise and everything!! Can this be due to a vitamin deficiency or something?","I used to really worry a lot about the effects of insomnia and I know it’s pretty bad but I can’t do much about it, yet I still find myself wide awake and not feeling sleepy even after a day of shit sleep(2-4 hours if lucky). 

Could it be due to the coffee I have which is very little, or exercising late at night or a vitamin deficiency? The coffee and late night exercise was never a problem for me before so why would it be now?

"
I’ve found a medicine that works!,"I’ve tried melatonin, Lunesta, Trazodone, Ambien, CBD oil, indica edibles, and Belsomra.  

Ambien was the only that semi worked and it was fickle and only worked 3-4 days of the week and it was bad, interrupted maybe 6 hours if I was lucky. 

My doc gave me 1mg of klonopin to take 1 hour before bed and I’m out within 10 minutes and I’m sleeping 10 hours because my body is trying  to catch up. 

I’m so happy I can finally sleep and in the same bed as my SO which I’ve never been able to do because of my insomnia. 

Anyway, thought that might help people who are only trying traditional sleeping pills!

Activity to help you fall asleep,"I’ve been suffering from severe insomnia for over a year now. I’ve always been a bit of an insomniac (sleep onset insomnia) but a year ago, I developed sleep maintenance insomnia. I started getting anxious about this new sleep problem, and pretty soon, I couldn’t fall asleep to begin with. After much suffering and trial and error, I’ve found an activity that pretty reliably puts me to sleep ( it doesn’t help me stay asleep, but sleeping a bit is better than not sleeping at all) and wanted to share with you guys so it can hopefully help some of you. What I do, before bed, is that I listen to an audiobook to learn foreign languages. I’ve found audiobooks like the “The Paul Noble approach” or “The Pimsleur method”  are pretty good because you don’t need to put much effort memorizing words. I think the reason it puts me to sleep is that it utilizes some brain power, so I’m tiring myself out, and also, since my mind is focused on creating sentences, I’m not getting anxious over sleep. I’d be curious to find out if learning a foreign language could work for other people (Btw I’m learning mandarin chinese)"
What can I do to fall asleep after watching/reading something scary?,"I’m SUPER sensitive with scary stuff, even just stumbling upon something not very scary on accident can leave me sleepless for the whole night. What can I do to avoid this?"

It's not that late yet it's just that this is day 3 without ANY sleep and it's making me malfunction ugh idk this is getting to be a lot

I think I'm getting stressed about weird things like I'm looking at my phone even though I know none of my friends will be up because I'm so scared that they'll need me and I won't be there for them and I feel gross because the beds uncomfortable and I was too wobbly and tired to stand up and shower so I'm gross and stuff and I need to change my clothes I just want to pass out

Any advice on stopping my brain from chatting it's arse off before I take some strong pills and get today over with?

Those that have used diphenhydramine,"How quickly do you get used to it?

I was scared to take Zzzquil at a full dose for the first 2-3 nights (bad experience with Nyquil, but I know they're v different), took a full dose the following night, and tonight I took Advil PM (which is the same but with ibuprofen to kill pain). I didn't feel like I got to sleep faster last night, and now I'm worried I won't fall asleep easily tonight either.

Could I get used to it that quickly? I was hoping to get a regularish sleep cycle started with it, then just use my routine to fall asleep. "
Insomnia is a systemic problem and must be treated that way,"Every year, a new study documenting a rise in insomnia sufferers. 1 in 4 develop it per year. 30% of Americans suffer from it. 10% experience it chronically. Lost productivity cost us $63 billion a year. It’s a major factor in motor vehicle crashes.

But we need to stop looking at each sufferer as if they exist in a vacuum. We live in a time where, for the first time, younger generations will make less than their parents. Jobs are demanding more of us but giving less in return. Studies have shown that if Americans were paid for emails and phone calls they took while “off work,” they’d actually need to be reimbursed in the thousands. Younger generations have been found by studies to be “work martyrs.” That is, they don’t take sick days or vacations because they’re so worried about proving themselves and trying to avoid getting fired. Less and less space is given to self-care. And we’re all addicted to technology because the technology trains us to become dependent on it so we continue investing money in it. And all of this stress and chaos leads to a hyper vigilance that prevents us from falling asleep. Try to address it, and we’re failed by a lack of adequate healthcare. I have begged doctors for a lost decade of my life to help me with this problem, only for them to tell me medications are addictive and move on without a solution. It did not matter that I told them I started missing classes or work because I could not operate a vehicle. It did not matter that I told them I was injuring myself because my balance and reflexes become impaired. It did not matter that I told them I was only guaranteed sleep on Friday night because I had nothing scheduled on Saturday, and that I often went through weeks with only one decent night’s sleep. I’d just receive a dismissive “deep breaths” or “turn off your devices before bed” or “have a warm glass of milk,” as if things so minuscule could begin to combat any of those sweeping sources of stress I mentioned earlier.

The consequences of long-term sleep deprivation are real and severe and research backs that up. Yet doctors ignore complaints of insomnia. Probably because they don’t know how to cure it. Probably because they’re focused on the individual.

My question is, how do we shift the focus from the individual to the culture? How do we start transforming a society where we’re all supposed to be emotionless robots pouring all of our energy into our increasingly demanding work?"
Chronic insomnia,"So for the last month at least three times a week o go to sleep and then i wake up 2 hours later and i cant return to sleep all night and it really affects my life
Is there any medication for insomnia?"
How long should I sleep to recover? (60hours awake),Ive been up for 58 hours now. I think I can finally fall asleep by 6pm so in 2 hours (58hrs awake). I have to get back up by 10am at the latest. Should i try sleeping for the whole 16 hrs? Or just gun for a base 6 hrs. I've been hearing alot of conflicting ideas about long sleep ins making it worse. 
Really need some positive insomnia stories and how you overcame it. Starting to freak out. Pretty sure I’m never going to get over this. Currently working with a therapist and will start CBT in a few weeks. Also trying to stop taking Seroquel.,
Wife Got Mad At Me No more sleep pills lol. My New Plan!!! wish me luck.,"She saying I'm too worried about sleep and spending too much money  on sleeping pills and my time is too concerned with sleep. She's also tired of my complaining about the side effects of these pills.

 She said snap out of it and forget your anxiety  issues  lol. Restricting me to only 2 tylonel a day for pain  and 1 melatonin if I want before bed.

Body shock injury and my mom being diagnosed with cancer orginally caused my insomnia about 4 weeks ago. I started to become upsest with sleep once I started to have a hard time sleeping, (days without sleep) making the issue worst.

I'm limited now. No matter if I get sleep or not. 

Here's my plan...

- mainly cardio or lightweight Exercise early in the morning (45 minutes to an hour, 5 days a week (hiking or Gym)
- Eat healthy and try to lose some weight. (I'm about 25 pounds overweight still)
- take 3mg high quality melatonin 1 hour before bed. Safe amount.
- practice healthy sleep paterns.
- try to be as social as I can.
- Try not to worry about anything!
- not to force my sleep and if I get it I get it. Have to start thinking of sleep as whatever.
- participate in my daily normal activities again before insomnia got a hold of me.

Wish me luck. I Might go a few days with no sleep, or hopefully it will go well. I have done this before, by day 2 1/2 I usually pass out. 

Anyone have any tips for going all natural and taking the suffering approach? Lol"
"Positive thinking and living in the moment is key!! Easier said than done, I know but if you have anxiety please read.","I’m constantly worrying that having insomnia would cause this and do that to me, but after seeing a few students in my class have anger and anxiety, I thought to myself, “If I die tomorrow, would all this worry have been worth it? NOPE!

So if you get anxiety because of that, just live in the moment and not the future because you never know what will happen! LAUGH, joke at everything and just laugh honestly. Enjoy the present feeling of whatever your doing and embrace every second. 

Quite honestly this approach may help me fall asleep, but I don’t care as much. If I don’t sleep I’ll just get up and go to work and enjoy the day, talk with my coworkers, make work fun. It is what is ! :)"
Becoming dependent on sleep meds... afraid to bring it up to my doctor,"I used to take the “as directed” dosage of otc sleep meds (2). I’m now needing to take one more to fall asleep at a decent time... afraid to bring it up to my doctor bc I have a shit ton of other ailments that I “prioritize” more. My other meds add to my insomnia but are essential for my everyday well-being. I conk out after 3 and wake up feeling refreshed but don’t wanna perpetuate the cycle of needing more.


I’m half just getting it off my chest to see if anyone else has had this experience, half looking for advice.


Tyia friends 💛


Edit for clarity (my response to a fellow redditor): Haven’t brought insomnia up to my doctor. I’m a relatively new patient of hers bc I’m new to this area, and it just feels tricky to bring up a new problem every time I see her. I feel overbearing and like a hypochondriac... idk. I mean I know people go to the doctor seeking meds for meds sake, rather than for an actual illness... but I’m afraid of her assuming thats what I’m doing, if that makes sense."
Scared to try Trazodone because of reports of hunger after taking it,"The subject line pretty much sums it up, but the last thing I need at the moment is something that will make me want to eat an elephant. I am on Buspar right now but I think it's contributing to my insomnia. It's working for anxiety but it gave me horrible hunger for about 3 weeks before it stopped, finally. But my doc prescribed Trazodone in the event that my insomnia is too much. But as the subject line says, I'm scared to try it for this reason, and I'm wondering that if anyone experiences that, did that side effect ever go away. (like it did for me in the case of my other med).  "
My poor brother,"Hey poorly rested Redditors. 

My brother is in hospital right now with Pancreatitis (most likely caused by alcohol use). 

He has been abusing alcohol to get to sleep for years and I'm afraid to say it has caught up with him. 

He uses melatonin also to get whatever sleep he can. 
He suffers from hypnic jerk as well as insomnia and this seems to be a large part of the problem. We have also both had a very difficult life and I'm sure he has some wounds that would possibly heal or at least benefit from talking to a professional about these things. 

He seems very willing after going through what he has to try to make some real differences in his life. I can't help feeling that he will lose faith and interest in a healthier lifestyle if he doesn't start getting some results with his sleep pattern. 

Anyone that can give some advice would be sincerely appreciated, I understand there is no easy answer. But any changes in ones lifestyle/  education or attempted sleep pattern would be amazing 


Thanks "
Took Melatonin..Now i’m up,I took melatonin around 10 and fell asleep after an hour. I woke up at 2 and been up wide awake for an hour and half. School tomorrow (or later today rather) is going to kill me
I have now been up for 28 hours and have a full day of travel with four kids.,My inability to sleep is ridiculous.  Going on 15 years of this crap.  On a ‘good’ night I am up at least 10 times.  Most nights I am up in excess of 20.   Doctors have no advice other than “limit caffeine and screen time”.  Sleeping meds make me hung over and miserable.  Is this really how it is going to be?   Forever?  
Well this sucks. Trazodone 50mg not working.,"Just took 50mg 2 hours ago and feel wide awake. Should I take another 50mg?

 Tempted to take an ambien because that puts me to sleep but the side effects might not be worth it between the two. 

Feels like one of those zero sleep nights for me."
Correlation between intermittent fasting and insomnia?,"I just started Keto(-ish...) about a month ago. A big change in my diet has been IF, in other words, skipping breakfast. Before that, I was all about breakfast to fuel my days. I just realized this coincided with a lot of my sleep issues and I’m wondering if anyone has experienced the same? 

What feels like “more energy” is actually insomnia/light sleep patterns...and I wonder if there’s a connection there. "
"150mg trazodone, 0.5mg klonopin, 12.5mg of Ambien CR","All in one night; trazodone at 10pm, klonopin at 1am, then Ambien at 4am...and I’m still not asleep. Up until today 150mg of trazodone is all that I need. "
Afraid of sleeping and having dreams?,"I had a pretty nasty drug trip last year, and since then I've had panic attacks and anxiety.  I also have trouble sleeping sometimes because my dreams are so vivid and feel like they last for hours even though I only slept for two hours.  My anxiety is much better, and I'm not having as many vivid dreams, but now I dread going to sleep because I see it as this oppressive thing where I have no control.  Sleeping used to be my hobby.  How do I fix this?"
Waking up at 3am for months,"I have recently fell into a pattern of going to bed around 10pm. I fall asleep fine. Around 3am, like clockwork, I wake up. And I'm up for the rest of the morning. This has been my pattern for a couple months. I have tried Melatonin, and sometimes Kratom. The only thing that keeps me asleep is Xanax. Could this be because lack of sunlight durring winter months? Any help?"
Stupid Snow Moon,Does anyone else have even more trouble sleeping than usual during a full moon? I usually feel it the day of plus the day before and the day after. 
Just happy that I won't have a long life.,"Hi I'm just glad that the chance for me to die faster bc of my insomnia, my social anxiety and constant sadness is bigger. I don't care if I get cancer or a heart attack bc of the lack of sleep I have. I just hope that it will happen bc the life I'm living is not a life anymore. The problem is that society doesn't care about my health and well-being... They want me to work, work, work like a fucking machine."
Has anyone done a meditation / relaxation before bed type challenge?,"Despite everything, I wonder if it would be worth it.. Setting aside the damn 30 minutes consistently, not just one day randomly. Have you guys had success?"
"Every time I’m about to fall asleep, I jolt awake. Anyone else get this?","Super annoying. I’ll be like, yay, I’m finally falling asleep. And jolt awake."
can doctors actually help?,"I have that kind of insomnia where I go to sleep easily but cannot stay asleep. By the time the morning comes, I've woken up \~3 times and slept for a total of 5 hours, every single night for the past 9 years.

The Washington Post recently ran an article saying that such patterns contribute to memory loss, and a variety of other mental and physical health problems (many of which I'm increasingly finding in myself), and it exhorted the reader to see a doctor.

But, during those 9 years, I've seen four different doctors, including two sleep specialists, and none of them helped me. The advice ranged from ""that's normal"" to ""it's not normal but it's not a problem"" to ""try some ambien"" (which made it worse). A sleep study produced nothing beyond ""you don't have apnea.""

So, my question to you all: was I just seeing the wrong doctors? Can doctors actually help conditions like this? (I've already read and tried all of the advice on the internet for self-treatment.)"
Milestone,"I've hit the point where I actually dread going to bed. I can't even use the drugs anymore to force it to happen :( 

I expect all of this will clear up when I get a regular schedule back. "
"Does anyone else here have sensitive skin? Dry, itchy, sensitive to touch ect. Or just physically sensitive in general?","I feel uncomfortable like all the time. I don’t know if it’s strictly because of lack of sleep or not, however I do feel a lot more “normal” the next day when I do rest well...which is unfortunately very rare.

Overall I feel dehydrated (even though I drink plenty of cold water every day), dry mouth, dry skin, itchy, tingling, sensitive to any kind of touch. I suspect caffeine may be partly responsible for this because apparently it’s dehydrating. But then again I’ve heard people say it’s not really that dehydrating at all. Then I’ve thought maybe it’s my salt intake, but then I’ve heard salt actually prevents you being dehydrated.

So frustrating trying to work this all out with conflicting advice. Ugh."
Vivid dreams,"Does anyone else have very vivid, realistic dreams? Sometimes, as soon as I fall asleep, I start dreaming. I'll have nights where I will wake up after only 30 minutes of being asleep, and I will have had a dream. It sounds like the body is only supposed to dream after 90 minutes. I'm not super tired during the day, so I dont think I have narcolepsy. This repeats during the night, and it feels like my dreams last forever. Anyone else experience this?"
Exercise,Does high intensity exercise help with insomnia?
Insomnia; But I Don't Want It Cured,"It seems that the more tired I am, the more productive I am.

&#x200B;

I'm very sure that I don't have ADHD but when I'm in my passive state, I can't concentrate on more than one thing at a time. Not only studying but video games, movies, and all other sorts of entertainment. My mind just hops from one subject to another and I get bored of everything easily.

&#x200B;

But with insomnia, I am always tired and I can finally concentrate on just one thing.

Although I can definitely feel it affecting me physically and mentally. I'm always feeling nauseous and am having severe mood swings, but I've never done so much studying(programming) in my life.

I am also constantly reviewing my work as not to forget, and always solving problems for practice.

&#x200B;

I know that it's not the best way of studying, but it's certainly a lot more effective than my previous lifestyle where I spent more time doing nothing than something

Trying to sleep when withdrawing from medication.,"I take vensir for a few different reasons and often have problems collecting my prescription (this is an ongoing issue for the last 6/7 months), this occasionally means I have to go a day or two without meds as my pharmacist does not like the modern electronic system (I’m really trying not to lose it and go mad sorry). Anyway long story short find that without this medication I can’t sleep. In the past I’ve been prescribed sleeping pills but didn’t like the side effects. Does anyone have any good tips for someone withdrawing from mental health medication that’s struggling to sleep? "
Not letting last night insomnia ruin the day,"I had a pretty good streak before last night of six hours a night which is a win for many of us. It’s totally my fault for drinking coffee and milk tea after getting comfy. But you know what? I’m bouncing back today and eating healthy, chamomile tea and no sugars today and just doing my best at work. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea recently and though I’m pretty good about working  out I am above my BMI so I’m gonna work it all today. Battling on all fronts cause the war is not over. We got this guys and gals! "
Short spurts of sleep and melatonin didn't help,"I can't seem to get more than four hours a night and it's in spurts.  Between the spurts,  I'm having vivid anxiety dreams about waking up for work.  I work from 7-6 for the next 7 days and I think I'm going to lose it. I've tried extra strength melatonin with a relaxation supplement and,  while it helps me get to sleep, I can't stay that way. "
"Been taken Anti-depressants, can't sleep for more than 3 hours","I've been on Prozamel (prozac?) for about a month and a half, everything was going well enough up until about 2 weeks ago when I suddenly got a massive migraine. 

Since that migraine, I've found that I can sleep for 3 hours most of the time, i'll go to sleep at 11pm and wake up at 2am (i check my phone, it is always 3 hours sleep) and this happens throughout the day too, i sleep at 2pm, ill wake at 5pm. Sometimes i'll get 5 hours sleep if im lucky.

Sleep hypnosis and staying asleep.,"So I've been suffering from insomnia for a while now and last week was my worst ever. A friend suggested sleep hypnosis techniques, my first question is, does anyone have suggestions for good videos or audio for this? I've been using Jody Whitley the past few nights which I find does help me fall asleep quicker, I just want to try as much as I can and see what works best. 

Secondly, my main problem is staying asleep, or falling back asleep once I've woken up. Does anyone have any tips for these?"

About to go to doctor,"I’ve struggled with insomnia most my life 

Lately it’s been especially bad due to anxiety.

Some nights I have trouble falling asleep, some nights I have trouble staying asleep longer than ~4 hours. Some nights both.

Enough is enough. I want to be prescribed a sleeping pill for now. I haven’t taken them in years, I like the idea of not taking pills, but enough is enough.

I do not want a benzo, ambien or an antihistamine.

I want to be able to fall asleep and wake up feeling refreshed.

I want a pill that I don’t necessarily need to take every night, just one that I can take “as needed”

Any suggestions? Please help"
At what point do you decide to just stay awake?,"My issues with sleep have never been this bad - I've got a big lifestyle change coming up and it keeps me awake worrying about it. I've been accepted into the Navy (in Aus.) and that's going to change every aspect of my personal life and I haven't quite come to terms with it. In the meantime I still have a job to go to until I start training. 

My issue is I try to go to bed at 10-11pm to be up  at 7am (which is a healthy amount of sleep) but worry about my lifestyle change keeps me awake. I'm months (at the earliest) away from being sent to the base for training so it shouldn't be an immediate concern. I'm often up until 3 or 4 in the morning. Is it worth it to just stay awake? Or should I try and grab a few hours? Usually I feel like shit if I have a few hours of sleep but I can still function if I just stay awake.

Maintenance Insomnia,"I've been having insomnia issues since New Years.  It started with some restless sleeping and middle of the night awakenings and within a few weeks I developed an anxiety disorder and spiraled into the endless cycle of being anxious over not sleeping and not sleeping because I'm anxious.  This resulted in me being unable to fall asleep and unable to fall back asleep when I woke up. Starting near the beginning of February I started taking an anti-anxiety supplement that works fairly well and I have no issues falling asleep.  However, I cannot stay asleep more then a 2-4 hours.  Then once I wake up I have a very hard time falling asleep.  

I don't know if this is due to stress or another cause.  I've had bronchitis since New Years as well but that has been treated and alot of the mucus and chest tightness has gone away but still pops up due to the cold weather.  I'm not sure if I have developed sleep apnea from the bronchitis, as I definitely have more trouble breathing when I like  down, or if something else (like anxiety or stress) is making me unable to sleep.  I'm really not stressed or anxious about anything in my life except the insomnia. Any insights or advice on how to fall back asleep would be very helpful.  Thank you."
Is it true side effects from pills is just as bad as not sleeping?,Ive heard this many times so I'm weary about getting meds
Rage induced insomnia,"Aside from the usual dose of insomnia, does anyone else stay up for days hung up on one emotion? For instance, my insomnia has been more under control recently (like I can usually manage to get 3-4 hours a day) but now I am seething with anger (unrelated to not being able to sleep) such that another all nighter is inevitable.

Not sure if this is more an anger thing or an insomnia thing but I'd appreciate hearing about your experiences or any advice you'd have to offer. "
Any tips on how to reduce the nods while driving?,"I have a 1.5 hour commute to work and have a lot of difficulty not nodding off while driving. Gum helps a bit, sometimes, but often it’s not enough. It can get, as I’m sure you can guess, quite scary sometimes.   
  
I often just want to pull off to the side and take a nap, but I have to get to work. Any tips? I don’t drink coffee often but today, and some other days, I’ll have a cup or two. I prefer to avoid caffeine though. "
Mind refreshing strategy,"After I struggle with sleep long enough and lose hope I sometimes decide to deliberately rest my head. I get sleep mask and comfortable headphones, play a good instrumental album (soundtracks, prog, postrock, classic) that is 45-60-90 mins. During that time I cuddle in bed, not move, keep the mask on and try to think happier thoughts and stay resting til the music ends. "

Starting a weekly thread - Insomnia Mondays - What was your last week like?,"Hi all sleepless insomniacs,

&#x200B;

Last time I posted here I found there was a group interest in having a space for people who are trying to actively correct their insomnia.  I think there can be a lot of power in reading other peoples' struggles, reading about what works for them and what doesn't, what their triggers are, etc.  Apparently CBT is a good way of treating insomnia, and perhaps by doing a weekly thread we can raise our awareness of our own problems and then work towards solving them.

&#x200B;

I am going to start with a really basic template, and then anyone else who has suggestions of what we should discuss should comment them!  Hopefully this will be productive for at least one person.

&#x200B;

I am a 30 year old female, I have been having trouble controlling my sleep for almost as long as I can remember.  I think I first began staying up late as a way to exert control over my time - I wanted to stay up late reading with a flashlight under the covers every night, as a way to pack in more entertainment and things I wanted to do in the day.  That started with I was 9 or 10 years old and has continued through to this day - but now it takes the form of watching youtube videos or tv shows, reading pointless comment sections, browsing reddit until really early hours of the morning.

&#x200B;

I have tried ""just going to bed sooner"" but I will lay there, becoming more and more awake by the second, until I find something to do to stimulate myself until I fall asleep.  Usually this is my laptop or phone.  If I don't have those, it becomes a book or something to read.  I can't stand just laying in bed, and if I try, I will lay there for what feels like an unbearably long amount of time.

&#x200B;

Diet: I am starting to pay more attention to when I eat, and am not eating past 9pm.  I go to bed around 11.  I usually fall asleep around 3am.  I wake up around 8 or 9.

&#x200B;

I have had to start consistently being somewhere at 11am, and it's making it easier for me to get up in the morning.  I also get sleepy earlier.  However, I still can't fight the compulsion to push my consciousness to the edge of how long it can stay awake.  My last week, I was able to make all of my morning appointments, but I still stayed up every single night and didn't get a satisfying amount of sleep.  I slept in a lot on Saturday and Sunday, and took some naps on Saturday too.

&#x200B;

Looking forward to hearing others' experiences!"
Insomnia beast may win tonight.,It's nearly 1:30AM and I'm wide awake. 😞
More sinister than insomnia,Is the pain of having fatigued eyes that can barely open and yet not be able to sleep.
CBD Oil?,"Hey everyone! I struggle a lot with insomnia and fairly severe anxiety. My MIL recommended trying CBD oil. I don't smoke marijuana - I don't judge other people for using it or anything, it's just not for me. From what I've researched, CBD doesn't give you the high that marijuana does. 

Does anyone else use CBD oil? Does it help with your insomnia and or anxiety? Also, does it have any unwanted effects such as drowsiness, the high, etc.?

&#x200B;

Just FYI: The main reason I don't smoke marijuana/want the high, is that type of feeling really screws with my anxiety and PTSD. It just makes it worse haha I do not like that high/trippy feeling at all! "
Constantly worrying about insomnia and Brain damage and health affects?!?!,"God I can’t stop thinking about it and I can’t go to sleep the more I think about this motherfucking issue.

8 days with almost no sleep (help!),"This is my first time I'm posting, so bear with me! I've had insomnia for a while now. Usually it's mild, maybe one or two days without sleep. I've only had a few times where it's been really bad like it is now. Are there any suggestions on what I can do to sleep? "
Has anyone geographically relocated to a warmer/sunnier year-round climate to help with insomnia/mood?,"I suffer from lifelong, chronic insomnia and occasional depression. I’ve lived my entire life in New England, and I consistently sleep better and feel happier in mid-to-late Spring through early Fall than in the winter. This has always been the case.

I’m not looking for any tips for combating insomnia - as I said, I’ve dealt with this my entire life, have seen specialists, had testing at a sleep lab, have read many a sleep book, and am currently seeing a therapist for CBT treatment.

What I’m curious about is if anyone here has experienced the same thing, and if anyone’s taken the plunge and relocated to a geographic location that’s relatively warm and sunny year-round. It’s something I’ve considered doing a lot and likely see myself doing at some point for the improved quality of life."
I start my new job today and I got maybe 2 hours of sleep,I've really started to realize lately that it's been forever since I've had a night where I slept for 8 hours uninterrupted.  Really hoping I don't fuck this first day up because of it 😞
Been taking unisom for about 3 years straight,"Hi, so I started taking unisom about 3 years ago after some traumatic events happened to me, and I guess I just never stopped. 

There'll be some nights I dont take it but I take it basically all the time to help sleep. I switched to the liquid zzzquil cuz it works better...

I've been trying to stop taking it. Last night I didnt but i was up until 4 am trying to go to sleep...i dont know why i cant just sleep...its like i get this anxiety before I sleep and I just want it to go away. "
What do you do when you have to sleep outside of your comfort area?,"In the past year I can easily say that I've gotten my insomnia mostly under control. But recently I went on a trip. Saying I have cabin fever due to my shut in tendencies is one hell of an understatement, and despite this being my second night here I have gotten barely any sleep. It doesn't help either that there are new noises I am not used to, having to sleep close to someone, a different bed, and fuck my body wishes it was back home right now.

"Social anxiety might be the cause of my ""insomnia""",Hi people... I've been jobless for 1 year and in the meatime I slowly developed a healthy sleep habit again...

Yeah and that is why I wake up every 30 minutes and it's hell. It's like I'm cursed... The problem is if it goes on like this I will never be able to work and function. Sorry for my English it's 4:41 am in the morning. I hope you still understand lol.
Sleepiness,Does anyone else feel like sleepiness comes in waves and there's a small window of opportunity to fall asleep? I feel like sleepiness doesn't last that long once it hits me. So therefore my plan is to go to sleep immediately the moment I start to feel sleepy.
Need tips + hope. Anxiety induced insomnia.,"Hey guys. Just needed some people to talk to who are in the same situation. Any tips on what has helped with your insomnia/anxiety would be greatly appreciated. (Drug-free pls)

So i’m starting to feel down because insomnia has been playing games with me for about 2 months now. Some weeks i feel like i’m getting better—sleeping at 2 or 3 am (that’s early for me lol) and falling asleep within 30 minutes. And then there are times when i get < 5 hours of sleep for maybe 3-4 days straight due to anxiety. 
On top of all this, i’m only a 20 year old college student. Im worried that this is the beginning of a life-long journey and that it will affect my performance in school and future career. 
I’m currently meditating (guided) every other day in hopes that it would help a little. I noticed that when i go to the gym i will definitely go to bed. But i don’t have time to work out every day.  

Any advice or encouragement would help out a lot. Thanks! ❤️"
Ayy who here holds the record for the highest medication dosage?,Nothing less than 300mg of Seroquel and 3mg of melatonin puts me to sleep. Anyone have me beat?
cbti-coach,"i finally went to a sleep doctor and she honestly just gave me advice. she gave me a referral for a cbti doctor in my area, but my insurance sucks, so i’m going to look into some other options first. 

has anyone ever tried sleepio or cbti-coach. they are online cbt training. i haven’t done much research on either yet, but i’m pretty sure there’s some type of fee for both. before i choose one at random, i wanted to know if anyone had any feedback on either???"
Anyone here use a weighted blanket for anxiety/insomnia?,"I have always had a huge thing when it comes to the weight of my blankets while I'm sleeping. And I found adding a bit more weight to them helps me get better sleep, however, most of the time I just use a ton of blankets to help get the weight rather than using a weighted blanket. So, does anyone here use these blankets? "
Anybody find it easier to sleep when it’s chilly?,I like to crack a window and let the winter air hit me. It kinda relaxes me more. Of course I have the covers on but it still feels good and makes it easier to sleep. 
So stressed about not getting enough sleep that I can't sleep,"I get so anxious trying to get myself to sleep that I end up not getting any actual sleep. The idea of how important it is to get sleep literally prevents me from getting it. I try all sorts of tips and tricks to help myself sleep. I end up just lying in bed thinking ""I need to sleep otherwise I'm going to have another shitty day tomorrow."" 

I just can't stand it. The paradoxical situation I'm in. It gets to the point where I basically just end up keeping myself awake for about 20 to 24 hours and getting about 5 hours sleep max before it starts again.

I seem to even arouse myself from sleep in distress about not being asleep for long enough.

Anyone else relate? Anyone got any tips for dealing with this?"
CBD in *high* doses reported to be effective for sleep.,"For the last three days I started to take CBD in a highly concentrated form (through a Distillate extract) with my vaporizer (actually I use a dab right but people may not know what that is) before I went to bed.

&#x200B;

The first night I did not even realize I had fallen asleep. Next thing I know I wake up and my zopilcone pill is still on the night stand.

The last two nights have been the same.

&#x200B;

Currently I am researching other properties of the cannabis plant and in this video I heard the doctor state at 14:20 that ""in low doses CBD is alerting and kind of keeps you awake. At higher doses it is very sedating and cause you to sleep.""

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52jUXLfHsE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u52jUXLfHsE)

Before I get overly excited and start calling this the miracle cure I will do this for the next two weeks and update my experience.

It is great to hear a medical doctor suggest CBD as well, as this idea originally came passively through scrolling on reddit.  


Edit:   
As I know people are not interested in inhaling smoke/vapor I am wondering if anyone would be willing to experiment with taking CBD before bed orally. 

If you are new to CBD, what you would be looking for is a 20:1 or greater CBD to THC ratio.

A 30ml bottle I would recommend at 500mg of CBD for the whole bottle (or greater). This equates to 16mg per ml (a full eye dropper is a  1 ml)

I would recommend a full 1ml for your first time to determine effectiveness - then if it works on the second night reduce to half a ml to again determine effectiveness. 

Under the tongue the onset is supposed to be quicker (40 min - 60 min) some people hold it there for several minutes.

Otherwise if you mix it in a drink or just swallow it onset is usually around 90 - 120 minutes. 

Take the CBD an hour before you crawl.

&#x200B;

It would be amazing of we could solve this pandemic without pharmaceuticals.

Any success with melatonin?,Has anyone actually had noticeable success using over the counter melatonin pills? 
Insomnia making me suicidal,"I've never had a problem with sleeping until the last few months. It has progressed to where I only sleep every other night. When I don't sleep I feel extremely depressed and suicidal.

Last night I took magnesium, melatonin, and an OTC sleep aid out of desperation. I still felt fucking wired and turned all night long. I look like absolute shit the morning after which adds to the depression.

This is seriously starting to affect my life and my job. It's the most fucking frustrating thing ever.

A few days ago I stopped taking my multi vitamin and vitamin D supplements, trying to eliminate any potential cause. Aside from that, I only take St Johns Wort. I just started the magnesium last night which I feel relaxed me a little but obviously not enough.

Please help me before I go and lay down on some train tracks to end this misery."
Just had a terrible night of insomnia,Fuck you insomnia 🖕 
I was so tired when I woke up but now it’s 5am and I’m wide awake.,"I thought I would finally get my sleep schedule together tonight. I’ve been going to sleep around 8am and waking up around 2pm. It’s taken a toll on me enough that I was exhausted and on the verge of a migraine today. I thought it would force me to fall asleep earlier tonight. I even took a shower and read a book around 2am to help me fall asleep. But, nope, here we are. 5am and I’m still wide awake!"
I can't stay still,I keep trying to fall asleep and when I'm almost there my legs and body shake me awake. This feels like insanity. 
Dating with insomnia,"Does anyone else have a hard time dating or even hooking up because when most people are sleeping, you're just there unable to?  I've had insomnia since middle school and it's gotten worse as I've gotten older. Now I live on my own and sleep over at my boyfriend's house sometimes. But nearly every night, hes alseep by midnight and if I'm lucky i fall asleep after his first alarm. Is this just me? Or does anyone else feel awkward staying awake at other peoples houses?"
Exercise-induced (evening based) insomnia ?," 

Hi guys,

For those who have experienced a difficulty in -STAYING- asleep in a late-afternoon or evening workouts due to either:

\- high heart-rate or cortisol or racing thoughts

\-higher internal body temperature

What did you do to remedy these issues? I am finding perhaps these evening workouts are indeed affecting my sleep quality and quantity.

Is going to a morning session the only way (in respect to a typical office 9-5 schedule) ?

Cheers"
Feeling like the bed is shaking when sitting still,"I suffer from insomnia for 2 years. In the beginning it was really bad. I could go for days without sleeping, but now I'm doing significantly better. However, 5 days ago I started experiencing a sensation like the bed is shaking when sitting still. My first thought was that this is related to my sleep deprivation.

Has anyone experienced this sensation from lack of sleep?"
Please help,"Should I see a doctor? For the past two weeks I've been unable to fall asleep until around 6-7am, then I sleep for 1-2 hours, get up to go to school, come home, sleep til 7pm, and then I have to stay awake cause I can't fall asleep. I have a history of PTSD and I hurt my knee at work a while ago and am currently very stressed about it. My SO suggested I just get off the computer, so I tried it the last couple nights, I'd get off at 11-12 at night, and here I am, 4am wide awake. I'm tired of this and I just want to sleep I'm am constantly tired. Someone please help me"
Just took 100mg Trazodone,"Prescribed for insomnia. Gonna head to the bed at 2:00AM (15min). Last night did not sleep a wink. Before that maybe 2-3 hrs a night for the past 2weeks. Had to try magnesium glycinate for 10days just to get prescribed this. Gonna set an alarm for 9AM, it's the weekend but weekdays i gotta get up at 6AM. I will report back!"
Does eszopiclone (generic lunesta) work for anyone?,"My neuro started me on temazepam a few months ago with some success before I had a sleep study. The sleep specialist waited for 6 weeks after the study to contact me after me calling 3 times (or rather her office did). She prescribed eszopiclone 2 mg, sent me a log to fill out for a month (just finished week 2) and I see her in person in two weeks.

I tried the eszopiclone once and it did nothing. I saw the neuro this week and he said he would have no problem keeping up with my temazepam prescription but try the eszopiclone again because it may work. Took it at 10 and it’s four and all I feel is heartburn and a little loopy like I had a glass of wine. The last time I took it felt the same way except I felt foggy the next day-so didn’t help me sleep and lost the following day feeling hungover.

Is this one you need to continue to take for a few days for it to reach a good level?"
Forgot what it was,"Funny, I had forgotten what it felt like to be wide awake at 3 am. I guess missing that sweet spot threshold for sleeping really messes me up. I cal the “threshold” the times I am more prone to fall asleep. It’s weird huh? Anyone else know what I mean? "
Has anyone elses body developed a sort of..shut down function after a sleepless night?,"I've been an insomniac since about the 5th grade ish? So maybe 11/12 I forget how old 5th grade is (Just turned 17) and over the last year it seems like my body has sort of developed a conk out funtion after I don't sleep. It's one of two things: either I get comfy and pass out randomly (only if I haven't sleep at least two days), or more commonly I'll start getting sick. My head will start to hurt, and progress into being unable to be around light, and start feeling feverish and ill before getting the urge to lay on the cold floor. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this?"
I've only slept roughly 8hours in 11 days,"I am a 25 year old male in fairly good shape, used to exercise 4 days a week. Since last Tuesday I have suddenly started having insomnia, before that I used to sleep perfectly every night. Now I start to go to bed at 11pm and stay in bed awake trying to sleep until I have to get up for work at 8am, not even sleeping for a single second.

I have seen a doctor a week ago about this, and was prescribed zolpidem 10mg. When I take only one pill (as per instruction by doctor), it does absolutely nothing for me, I've taken zoldpidem 10mg before i try to sleep for 4 out of 5 nights, staying awake for every waking second of the 4 days, then I tried taking two pills one night, and slept for 8 hours, I don't know if that was a fluke or not. Now I am out of zoldpiem as I was only prescribed for 7 days worth to start out. Since two nights ago I have bought some melatonin 10mg tablets over the counter. Yesterday I have taken 10mg zoldpidem + 10mg melatonin, has no effect. Tonight I tried taking 10mg melaton by itself (since I ran out of zoldpidem), and then 5mg after staying in bed for 3 hours from 9pm to 12pm, and now I am on this subreddit at 3pm.

I feel like before my insomnia, I have no real change in stress (quite happy), i was pretty fit, no change to my diet, now I am experiencing this life ruining insomnia. The biggest problem for me now is not even medication has been effective for me, i have no breather from this thing. I have been awake for roughly 260 out of the previous 268 hours. I am experiencing heavy short term memory loss (always catching myself not remembering wtf i am doing), extreme sleepiness and extreme fatigue.

If anyone has advice or experience, please let me know. I am 9.5/10 desperate and depressed over this.

I'm so fucking miserable,"I don't know if this is allowed but I just need to rant

I cannot stand living like this

I'm never rested, I never feel okay, I'm constantly operating on 3 hours of sleep, often less

I can never schedule something early in the mornings because without fail half the time I'll stay up until like an hour before and half to cancel because I need to sleep in

I don't even feel alive. Like I just feel like I'm ambling through the day on the minimal amount of energy I've saved.

I honestly don't think I can go much longer like this. I'm just... I'm not interested in living the rest of my life with this. If someone told me that there was no hope for change... I don't know. I worry that i'd just kill myself. Because I don't feel alive already, what's even the point.

And nobody understands. They just think I'm using my phone, or bad at sleeping, the only way I can get anyone to understand is by just breaking down. I have to yell or cry to get someone to realize that this is torture. Living torture.

I just needed to rant. I need something to change. "
How many weeks did Trazodone withdrawal insomnia last for you?,
Waking up every 15 minutes,"So i finally managed to sleep after drinking epsom salt , but what happened is I started waking up every 15 minutes or , I feel like a I ran a marathon instead of sleeping , and my head hurts a lot now , I ended up sleeping 3 hours in total but it was the worst 3 hours of sleep I feel even more tired now , I miss the 8 hours straight of sleep I used to sleep before it’s like was that even real? Does it exist? It’s like a dream, oh gosh I miss sleeping "
Bombed a test,"The night prior to yesterday I didn’t sleep at all. It started off well — after about an hour in bed I started to feel my brain transitioning into sleep. Then a car outside beeped and I was awake. From that point on, I spent the next 6 hours doing a cycle of: “you’re doing great, you’re totally relaxed, everything is okay, you’re awake, you’re not sleeping, you don’t know how to sleep, YOU’RE AWAKE, SLEEP NOW. PANIC.” then getting out of bed and reading until I felt tired again. Over and over and over again until I finally gave up since I only had a couple hours left until I have to be up. 


I spent weeks preparing for this thermodynamics test. I felt amazing about the material and had done such a good job studying the material. I truly felt like I could give a lecture on the topics covered. Then, this stupid fucking brain of mine decided I shouldn’t sleep. 


As 8AM grew closer, I could feel my mental capacity draining. I was so tired. I wanted to sleep but I couldn’t. By the time I had the exam in front of me, I could hardly even add two numbers. I couldn’t even read the prompts without forgetting what the last two sentences told me. I completely bombed the test. The only plus side is I was able to fall asleep almost instantly that night after not having slept for that long. That felt incredible. 


My insomnia has been getting worse and worse over the past year. It’s always ruining my life. I just want to be like other people who are able to use their full mental capacity. I want to be able to sleep. Or, at least have the option to sleep. People almost boast about pulling an all-nighter because of the homework they put off until the last minute. I pull an all-nighter because my body makes me. I’m so good at managing my time, but it doesn’t matter because I waste all that time waiting to be asleep. 


I wish I could at least take that time I spend trying to fall asleep and do something productive. I would be tired still, but I could get more work done instead of just deleting those hours out of my day doing nothing but waiting. Waiting, and waiting, and waiting. 


I hate you, insomnia. I just want to have the same opportunity as normal people. If I was able to fall asleep fast like everybody else, I could get so much sleep. If I could sleep, my brain would be strong. During the day, it’s like someone took my “brain power” slider and moved it down to 60%. When I do get a good sleep (maybe once I month), it makes me so sad because I remember what it’s like to be able to be at full cognitive ability.


That’s all. Thank you for letting me post here. I think this helped, actually. Writing out how I felt. "
Has anyone else tried taking CBD concentrate for sleep? I may be onto something.,"No I am not trying to promote drugs. CBD is non-psychoactive.

&#x200B;

Anyways. I woke up this morning and I noticed that my sleeping pill was sitting on my bed side table.

This is the second time that this has happened - as a result of doing one thing: consuming CBD concentrate.

&#x200B;

So unless you were under a rock you should know CBD is the non-psychoactive component to cannabis. 

You can smoke it or take it orally.

I have found for someone who has a tolerance to cannabis smoking a CBD joint produces little effect (you need to smoke a lot) and the oil gets consumed too quickly. (And also may have the effect of giving energy)

&#x200B;

Concentrates are basically where they have taken a bunch of cannabis and extracted the oil from it to give you a more potent substance. 

I have to deal with a restless leg issue. If I do not fall asleep within 40 minutes I get restless legs and I have to get out of bed and take my medicinal medication to treat them.

I decided to try my CBD concentrate for the second time.

Immediately my leg pain went away, but I also noticed that my head was not active like it would be from anything THC.

And it looks like I fell asleep within 20 minutes.

&#x200B;

Will be experimenting again this weekend.

Mirtazapine - A success story,Assuming that you can't get sleep without medication I strongly urge you to give Mirtazapine a try. Google it for the details but it has been a miracle drug for me. Now to conquer that problem of oversleeping!
So frustrated,"I hate that feeling when you can't sleep at all and you know you have to be up soon.  This is an ongoing thing and i know it's completely unhealthy. I am on my phone making this post, and I have to be up in 2 and a half hours.  It doesn't matter how long I keep my eyes closed, I CANNOT sleep.  I feel like punching something or screaming. I have a full work day and then have my son for the weekend. And he is a ball of energy! I can't stand the thought of being groggy all day tomorrow when i should be having quality time with him. Nothing works and i am at my wits end."
Definitely the worst insomnia so far,"So throughout life I have had insomnia off and on. I had it really bad in college until I started a routine and took melatonin, however melatonin stopped working after my brain adjusted to it. Like many of you know. So now I am in the military and wake up everyday at 4am, sleep was not an issue ever again, my schedule didnt allow me to ruin my night sleep with a day nap anymore, early morning every morning, long hours, etc. I thought I cured this disease.  

Now we wake up extra early and workout extra harder, and I do a separate workout after work, and you would think that any normal person would be exhausted after little sleep, 2 workouts and 12 hours of work and fall right asleep? Nope. It takes me hours still. I get 4 hours of sleep/night and every day I say I cant wait to get in bed early to sleep and have trouble staying awake during the day, usually requiring coffee. However once I hit that pillow I am wide awake, thinking about this or that. I have tried reading and it sometimes works, 

no electronics before bed, blue light filter, decrease brightness. and still nothing. I am so annoyed and frustrated and feel like I may have to go back to melatonin. "
"Taking an hour to fall asleep, been like this for a week, desperately wanting help without using medication.","Pardon the potentially jumbled thoughts, I'm on the spectrum and well, my sleep is being messed up, so my thoughts feel all over the place.

As the title says, I've been taking an hour to fall asleep lately and I can't take it anymore. I have no idea what's causing this, as nothing has changed in my sleep routine that could've caused this. I've had sleeping problems in the past, as I have ADHD, but it's never lasted this long. Normally it just takes about half an hour for me to fall asleep but now it isn't. I've looked things up to try and find solutions that don't involve some kind of sleeping aid (I really don't want to start using something because I know I'm able to sleep normally and I've had a lot of medications mess up my sleep in the past), but it's either things I know won't help me, things that I can't try, or things I've already tried. My usual solutions don't seem to be working either. I've already cried multiple times, and had a breakdown the other day, over this. I'm afraid that at this point I can't fix my sleep schedule and that my body's accepted this as normal now. Is there anything I can do to fix this?"
So sleepy and tired that I can’t sleep,I haven’t slept for days now and as much as I want to I can’t sleep I’m lying in bed it’s like I’m scared of sleeping or something 
4:13 IN THE FREAKING MORNING.,"I am RITUALISTIC about sleep, and schedules, and circadian rhythms, because I have awful anxiety and go through cycles of insomnia because of stress. But my wife recently got put on the night shift for her job. We’ve only been married since mid September, but living together almost for a year. 

So it’s hard to sleep without her. But to sleep with her requires sleeping from like 6am to 2pm. My body and mind are having NONE of that.  But also, I’m so used to sleeping next to her at this point that I’m also having a hard time going to sleep with her. 

I got into bed right around midnight tonight. I tried so many things to shut off my mind, and my body is exhausted. Meditation, made a list, two different breathing methods, over an hour just laying in the dark, masturbation, just plain close-your-eyes-till-you-sleep-stubbornness. I’m getting a headache from not being able to sleep at this point. 

I’m having such a hard time right now because when my sleep rhythm is off, my whole life rhythm is off. Any tips or tricks for resetting and getting your mind and body back in balance and on healthy rhythms? "
Can I have a moment of anyone's time?,"I feel depressed everyday thinking about how i'm probably going to deal with insomnia for my whole life.

My bed is a landmine of fight or flight. What to do about a rowdy sleep partner that wakes me up consistently?,"Hi all. It’s 2 AM where I’m at. Hopefully you’re not up, but knowing insomnia...you probably are. 

For the past month, I’ve been dealing with serious sleep issues.I try to fall asleep at 12-1 the latest, get maybe 3 hours, and am up with no signs of falling back.

My cat screams in my ear every morning and has me trained to feed her then. We’ve started using an automatic feeding system, but...I’m still used to being woken at hour, and I cannot for the life of me get back to it. #catsamirite 

BUT...

My real question is for those with a rowdy sleep partner. Mine suffers from sleep apnea and uses a CPAP. It blows air all night long and sometimes it’s cold, depending where he’s lying next to me or spooning me. He tends to flinch and sometimes smacks me, which puts my body in fight or flight anxiety mode because I don’t know what’s coming at me if I’m in a deep sleep so I sleep with one eye open, so to speak. 

And then, of course, it’s back to no sleep. Up in the middle of the night because it’s game over. He can roll over and take up the majority of the bed (we have a queen), take all the blankets, snore at level 10...you get the idea. I love him to pieces and it’s not his fault at all, but dammit man...he’s a terrorist in bed and I don’t know what to do that I haven’t already done.

Your favorite prescribed sleep aids?,"I have insomnia a few times a week where I only sleep 2 to 4 hours. I have ambien and it helps me get 5 to 8 hours on bad nights, but I don't like the side effects and knowing long term use can mess me up bad.

Just wondering what you recommend for use a few days a week? Maybe something more safe but gets the job done.

Tried a new sleeping medication - Zolpidem. Uhm yeah. Cannot deal with bright light the whole day.,"When it came to anti-depressants I researched the hell out of them before I would even consider taking them.

My doctor prescribed me this new medication to use instead of zopiclone .

Rather than research, because it means I am going to sleep - I am just like cheers and down it goes.

&#x200B;

Well. Lesson learned. Although I guess when it comes to side-effects you never know whether you are going to experience them or not. So even with research this would have been unavoidable.

&#x200B;

Zolpidem has a really bad light sensitivity side-effect. I probably should have wore my sunglasses indoors today.

Tonight I have a headache all around my eyes from having to squint, with a lot of pressure behind them.

Just thought I would share if others decide to try the medication.

I likely will not take it again. Too bad this one wasn't covered through insurance. :-/

She told me there wasn't anything she could do other than send refer me to a sleep study thing - brain's kinda slow sorry. I need sleep now, not a week after them staring at my morning wood!

She then told me I had the flu and they can treat that. I pretty much told them fuck a flu, I haven't slept since sunday and I could get to sleep I'll sleep the shit off. They didn't charge for the visit.

My main doc is 50mi away and I sure as shit can't drive it (work in that city too) and wife isnt' available to help right now. I've taken so many otc supps and nothing is putting me to sleep. I thinking of taking a shitload of thc edibles until i pass out if that would work.

I've taken an old hydrocodone I had from the dentist and still awake. I can deal with missing one day a week (which usually happens) and occassional 2 days, but I'm creeping on 84hrs and it's crap i can't think...

I asked if there was anything non-habit forming they could prescribe as I don't want anything addictive or what ever word goes here. I just want some damn sleep. Maybe if I was more Caucasian she'd hook me up with opiods?

"all nighter changed my sleeping pattern, wont change","all nighter pulled 1.5 weeks ago. Now im going to bed early like 10pm (crash hard) but im waking up at like 3:30-4am wide awake with energy and unable to fall back asleep. These sleeps feel more like short precarious ""rests"" instead of a full night's rest. The ""rest"" quality is low. I don't feel revitalized like a full night's rest should provide.

I become progressively tired around noon and beyond but can still function normally I just feel ""off"". I had a flu around the time I had the allnighter which I do not believe has fully healed because the shift in my sleeping pattern (throat still slightly tender)

I wonder how long it will take for my body to start having full nights sleeps so my body is 100% rejuvenated and acclimatized. The past week it feels like im jet lagged and I have dark bags that have been getting progressively worse. Worrisome. "
Vicious cycle of caffeine when you can't sleep,"You take caffeine to ""perk"" you up, but it causes you to have sleep disturbances, which causes you to turn to the caffeine...you get trapped in a vortex...I'm trying to function on 3 hours sleep...I was hoping I'd get better sleep this time but woke up after 3 hours and couldn't get back to sleep. I can't take it. I don't want to turn to the caffeine again...it really adversely reacts to my medication. "
Surprising benefits of fasting/dieting on insomnia.,"I have insomnia from time to time and recently I have been on intermittent fasting.  When I fast, I get very sleepy. It actually helps me to sleep better. What a serendipitous discovery. I also find out if I eat a carb loaded meal before I sleep, I get ""carb coma"". How weird."

Trazodone PSA: Do Not start taking Trazodone unless you want to deal with 4 weeks of withdrawal insomnia each time you drop the dose by 25 mg,"This drug is an absolute joke. It never worked in the first place, but I kept taking it because it suppressed my appetite and I was losing a ton of weight. I dropped the dose from 100 mg to 75 mg and then to 50 mg a week later. It took 4 weeks total for my withdrawal insomnia to go away. For 4 fucking weeks I was unable to get 5 hours of sleep per night and I would wake up constantly during REM sleep. Stay away!"
My very impractical solution,"For context I have trouble falling asleep and will often fall asleep around 4 or five AM.

What I've been doing is exercising an obscene amount around 2-3 hours of intense mma training. When I get home I'm so exhausted that I'll pass out pretty much as soon I as lay in bed.

Of course this isn't a perfect method. I have to actually do the exercise and I can't really do anything after. If I do something other than going straight to bed it'll wake me up and I won't be able to sleep again. Also whereas I used to be able to sleep till 1PM I tend to wake up around 5AM now, but at least I can still get 6-8 hours of sleep."
Doesn't feel like I got any sleep last night,"So last night when I was in bed all good, in a good mood, I was wide awake at 12 AM and I fall asleep and get a dream, and I wake up 12:20 AM, I was very annoyed by this. After that I supposedly ""fell asleep"" and woke up at 3 AM but it felt like in the blink of an eye because I was suffering trying to fall back asleep, but it just didn't seem like I fell asleep. But then again, I fell back asleep at woke up at 6 AM.

Im so tired.,"I have been struggling with insomnia for 10 years now (I'm 19). I cant fall asleep half the time.  Ive tried exercising, eating regular meals, white noise, CBD, and 8 different sleeping pills. the only pill that works for me in a large dose, it will knock me out for 16-24 hours which is just unmanageable. I feel like shit sleeping all day, and I feel like shit staying up, I have stayed up for 3 days straight at times, and i just cant do my schoolwork, i cant focus on anything, towards the third day i stop creating memories so i will wake up with little memory of the third day usually at some awful time where i miss school. I've missed sooo much school and work over this crap and im so sick of it. I can wake up after 1 hour, and after 4-5 hours, but I feel so exhausted and terrible when i wake up that I usually just fall asleep again. I really wish there was an easy way."
No idea what to do anymore,"I just sat here thinking about how I might have to deal with this for the rest of my life like if this insomnia is permanent I see so many people dealing with it for decades. And so I have no courage of overcoming this and never enjoying my life again. I have never thought that life would get so hard, I have only been a teenager for 6 months, I honestly can't take it anymore.

"Battling Insomnia for 7 years, Just prescribed Trazodone. Help?","Hi everyone,

&#x200B;

I posted in /r/sleep but also wanted to post here. Basically, I wake up 2-3 times per night to pee (25 year old, Male). I've been dealing with insomnia for about 7 years now, ever since I was 16 after drastic weight loss (lost over 100lbs). I was always a heavy sleeper before, and could get 8-9 hours easily. 

&#x200B;

Now, I've tried everything.. from CBD, Melatonin, THC, Valerian Root, etc and nothing has been able to help me sleep FULLY through the night (except THC, but that's not sustainable in the long run). I finally saw my doctor yesterday and he put me on 50mg of Trazodone. I took it last night for the first time, and I had terrible sleep. I woke up 3 times to pee, and ended up waking up at 5:30 am and not even trying to go back to sleep. I plan on trying 100mg tonight, and taking it with 3mg of melatonin. Should I even try? Or should I try to have him prescribe me another medication? 

&#x200B;

Thanks!"
morning insomniac,Anyone else a morning insomniac?  I can fall asleep at the drop of a hat.  Usually within 5 minutes.  But I start waking up around 2:30am.  Most mornings i get up by 3:15am.   Anyone else have this problem?  It is especially bothersome on weekends and days off.
Insomnia,"Insomnia makes me wanna kill myself but I don't want to kill myself, I take melatonin atleast two days in a row then one night I try to sleep without it, and I worry all day and whenever the time comes its a 50/50 chance of long misery or a great night sleep. 

&#x200B;

Today is the day I am trying without melatonin again, and I am nervous, I was nervous the exact moment I woke up this morning. Insomnia makes me wanna shove 50 mg of melatonin down my throat and sleep for 3 days straight. My friend is all telling me the more I fight it and pull through, insomnia will go away. It has been 7 months of insomnia, I cannot take it any longer, my friend who helps encourage me isn't online as much and I am losing my mind.

Does anyone use Gravol regularily to sleep?,"I’ve had insomnia pretty bad since I was a kid. I go through really rough periods where i’ll average 3-4 hours of sleep a night and i’m constantly waking up throughout the night.

I started using Gravol this year and I’ve found that it helps me sleep uninterrupted for about 4 hours before waking up and then i can manage another 1-3 hours of sleep. Recently I bought the generic version of the drug and noticed it not working as well. I’m not sure if this is because I bought the generic version or i’ve been using Gravol too long and its starting to lose its effects. Does anyone else use Gravol regularly?

Good over the counter sleep aids?,"I’ve been suffering from chronic insomnia for several years now. I’ve been prescribed trazodone for the sleep but absolutely hate taking it as it makes me a drowsy, dry mouthed mess who can’t seem to wake up. Melatonin doesn’t work either and I end up taking about 30mg throughout a single night (not all at once but when I do wake up and can’t get back to sleep.) I’ve heard anti nausea medications can be used for sleep but I’m hoping someone can suggest a good sleep aid that’ll keep me asleep instead of having me wake up every hour or so.
Thanks!"
Stayed up all night and can barely keep my eyes open (8 am class),I’m exhausted. It’s currently 9:20 am and I started class at 8 am. I stayed up basically all night because I just couldn’t sleep and now I’m sooooo tired. My eyelids are heavy and I keep getting startled whenever the teacher speaks. How am I supposed to combat this morning exhaustion? I don’t really drink coffee or tea but maybe I could try that...

Am i even falling asleep?,"I've always had trouble with sleep, but its usually oversleeping/staying up all night on my phone. 
3 days ago i started having weird experiences, i would close my eyes, relax and let my thoughts go wherever they want and it feels like im about to fall asleep, but then after a while i would realize ""wait ive been doing this for a while now why am i not asleep?"" i would open my eyes, check the time and realize 1-2 hours have passed. 

That absolutely shocks me. I usually have trouble recalling the thing i was thinking about right before i got up (which hints that i wasn't completely awake) but i feel like i was in some kind of pre-sleep trance state with my eyes closed and no sense of time. Then i would repeat this as many times as i can hoping i would feel rested tomorrow, sometimes i can even recall a dream (which confirms that im getting sleep) but either way i always wake up every 1-2.5 hours. 

Ive experienced this before about a year ago, it lasted about 2 weeks and it seemed to be caused stress and anxiety. 

Is this what insomnia feels like? What can i do?"

Dad has stage 4 COPD and pneumonia,"Rant incoming.

Dad was taken to the hospital by ambulance a week ago. He's back home now and on oxygen as needed and breathing treatments daily. He was on very shaky ground but seems to be on the road to recovery.

For now. This is the part I can't seem to get over. He's recovering FOR NOW. COPD is a progressive disease and it will only get worse. Honestly, he's dying, and he's going to go just like his father, who we all watched gasp in pain for every breath at the end stage. Maybe he has a few years, maybe a few months. I live 9 hours away so I'm having trouble getting there to see how bad it is. I was there for Thanksgiving and he was great.

Anyway. I can't sleep. I work, clean the house, make food, play games -- all these things without freaking out. Then I lay down to sleep (something I already have trouble with due to PTSD) and suddenly I'm so anxious and my heart is racing and 3 hours go by with me lying there. 

I've been averaging at 4hrs/night. My usual go-tos aren't working. No sleepy podcast or staying perfectly still or even prescription trazodone will fix this. I'm exhausted. My chest hurts. And I feel guilty because I'm mourning him while he's still alive and I let him talk me out of going to visit bc he's doing so well and 9 hours driving alone through snowy mountains is scary.

I feel so sad and frustrated and I just want to cry but headaches and UGH. I am so tired, but I laid in bed from 10pm to 1am listening to the Sleep with Me podcast and couldn't sleep."
"I want to quit pot, but when I do, insomnia returns!","Hello,

This is my first post here. It might be a bit long, so thank you very much for anyone who actually takes the time to read it. :)

So, I've dealt with insomnia for years. Sometimes it gets horrific, with me getting 0-3 hours a night consistently for long periods of time, but generally, I sit at around 4-5 hours a night with a couple 6-7 hour nights every once in awhile. 

Ok... So, this is how I was before I started vaping cannabis a few years back. I'll sometimes even do the 5-6 hour a night thing while I'm vaping cannabis, but I do get quite a few 7 hour nights, and, yes, even an 8 hour night sometimes. 

All of this changes as soon as I quit. It's weird, because I quit once for 6 months the last few years, and I was getting 4-6 hours a night then. Not this time!!!!!!!

I recently decided to try and quit again, and I started out getting 5-6 hours of sleep a night. I figured it would be like the last couple of times I quit and just stay at that level, but it did not. It got really bad this time. Like it used to be, a long time ago.

I made it 26 days just out of pure determination. Near the end, I was losing my mind, and it was also having an effect on my girlfriend, who lives with me. We live in a fifth wheel, and there are no separate rooms. It's a smaller fifth wheel, and I was losing my mind having to try to lay still in bed for hours, all while I am wide awake not sleeping. I would finally get out of bed and just have to sit in the dark and read a book on my kindle (with the blue light filter on, of course). I would try to meditate also, and I would, but I would still be wide awake. 

I spent the money I would normally spend on cannabis on herbal sleeping remedies and melatonin, but I tried to sleep naturally for quite a few nights because most of that stuff just stopped working after a couple of times. Near the end, I was taking valerian, melatonin, L-theanine, magnesium, and whatever else I could, and they were having zero effect. Luckily, my girlfriend mentioned Benadryl, and I took 100mg of that to ensure I would fall asleep. That seemed to work for a few days, but I knew I couldn't take benadryl forever, and I had the memories of that nightmare of being wide awake constantly all night. 

So... after a lot of hesitation and being very upset about the fix I was in, because I like how I feel otherwise when I quit cannabis, I went ahead and got some. It's legal where I live, so it's easy to get. I vaped some and easily slept again. Uggg.... The big thing I did notice was that my dream state changed like night and day. As soon as I started vaping again, I remember zero dreams. A small part of the reason I quit in the first place was so I could get more into lucid dreaming, but after running into my old insomnia again, I realized just getting freaking SLEEP was important. 

Anyhow... Thanks for listening. I don't know what I'm going to do. When I quit vaping, it's like a fog lifts, and I get parts of myself back that I haven't been in touch with for awhile. I can think much clearer, and things just begin to feel sharper and clearer all around. I'm a writer, and I found that when I quit, it was much easier after a few days to think of words to use and ways to say things that were more difficult before. My problem... I eventually barely sleep at all when I quit, and, like I know some of you know, it becomes a nightmare. Massive anxiety thinking about laying there in bed again, in the dark, without being able to do much, less I wake my girlfriend and dog up. Dreading night time and having to try to sleep. 

I couldn't believe how tired I was without being able to fall asleep at all. One night, I kid you not, and I know some of you have experienced this, I would literally nod off and then wake back up immediately. It kept happening all night one night. I know I might have sleep apnea, but if that's the problem, then why isn't it a problem when I'm vaping pot? I mean, wouldn't it still be there? 

When I'm vaping pot, I wake up usually once because I have to use the bathroom. Some nights, I'll wake up more than once. It's not perfect with pot. But, there have been nights where I didn't wake up once, that I remember. 

I don't know. I now have this magnesium L-Threonate stuff, too, that I paid too much for and have been taking it for a week and a half. Maybe it's been helping? Don't know because I have been vaping. However, I noticed when I started vaping again after quitting that I am sleeping better than I did before I quit. Yea... who knows. Maybe the magnesium? I also bought this chin strap dealio that might low-key help with sleep apnea. I haven't tried it yet because I've been sleeping fine. 

The thing is, I want to quit vaping cannabis! I had no idea I was going to go on this long, so thank you for listening! Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you very much insomnia community! "
Trazodone questions,"Hello all, I was just recently prescribed trazodone as I am currently tapering off of xanax.  A big part of the withdrawal is having issues sleeping and trazodone has been helping me but I am scared of becoming dependent to it after I finish my weening off the xanax.  The entire process should take me about 4 months or so and before this I had absolutely no trouble sleeping and could usually take naps whenever I pleased.  I just don't want to have trouble sleeping without the trazodone and am unsure how to proceed. Thanks"
"Just when I'm starting to fall asleep, I suddenly wake up","This doesn't happen every night, but it does happen quite often, and I still don't know what triggers it or how to fix it. When it happens, it usually occurs over and over again in the same night, making sleeping almost impossible.

I'm on bed, completely tired, relaxed, falling asleep comfortably... And then, just when I'm about to actually start sleeping, a kick of energy comes out of nowhere and wakes me up, stopping me from falling asleep.

This sudden impulse of energy comes with an unpleasant sensation, as I can feel my heart rate increasing and a momentaneous need for faster breathing (though I don't feel like I'm choking).

Does anyone have experience with this issue? I have been tested for sleep apnea and I was told I don't have it, so it has to be something else... "
Wait till you have kids!,"Going through a bad bout atm and running on 2/3 hours a night for over a week, feeling so down and done with everything. 

Go to work last night and somebody asks why I’m being so quite so I explained I have trouble sleeping and the first thing they say is ‘wait till you have kids then you’ll know what being tired is’ and it isn’t the first time someone has said this to me and it just feels like suck a slap in the face, especially considering she told me she slept 10 hours a few days ago like, is your kid really effecting your sleep that much? Doesn’t sound like. 

Has anybody else had this? Is it just me that finds it infuriating? It just feels so rude and inconsiderate, don’t ask me what’s wrong if you’re going to play it off like it’s nothing. 

Sorry just needed to rant and get that off my chest because it’s been bugging me all night"
CTBi Accountability Thread,"Alright folks, let's get an accountability thread going.  I've thought about starting this before, but bailed at the last attempt because I was sleeping so poorly and was generally too angry to want to try this again.

Insomnia and no sleep,"Hi all! I've been experiencing sleeplessness for months and i'm at whits end. I figured a post on reddit may point me in the right direction or maybe hear some other experiences hopefully like mine that have been rectified. Currently I can't sleep at all. I've tried meditation, melatonin (varying doses), ambien, benadryl, hydroxizine, unisom, zquil, breathing exercises, and a plethora of other options. I've been to my doctor and i've asked everyone and anyone for any ideas or tips. Ambien is the only thing that helps to knock me out cold, everything else leaves me drowsy and hungover in the morning. No meds make it so i just plain cannot sleep. I've cut caffeine, cut stressors, and I relax hours before bed staying away from bright lets or engaging activities. I just get so much energy at the time I HAVE to sleep. This is impacting work, school, and my life in general.

Possible Circadian Rhythm Issue and Bad Sleep Hygiene,"I've noticed that, through many years of experience, that it seems like my brain and body have a rhythm of being the most awake from like 6pm to 3am. If I don't have anywhere to be, I usually wake up around 3pm-7pm and if I try to sleep without melatonin, I don't get to bed until anywhere from 6am-10am, but with Melatonin I can get to bed between 3am and 7am.

I remember for me my sleep issues started with puberty. I would stay up all night until like 4 or 5am, go to school tired as fuck, go home and sleep til like 8pm or so.

Personally, what seems to be making me stay up so late and not be able to get to bed earlier is YouTube and Netflix (just one more video) , going down the internet rabbit hole (like googling something, which leads to something else, which leads to 2hrs past of my brain being like an information sponge), and my brain feeling restless and alert while my body is like an exhausted mother trying to keep up with her 3 year old (the brain)

I'm sure you all can relate.

I'm also a recovering addict (3 years clean) and have BPD, OCD, PTSD, and trichotillomania.

I made it my goal to try better to fix my sleep habits, since I had to cancel my sleep specialist revisit since they wanted me to fix my sleep schedule to going to bed by 3am  and obviously that hasn't happened so they won't do a sleep study. 🤔

I still haven't gotten to sleep yet and I have to grt up in like... 2.5 hours. yay....

I'm writing this to see what you all do for a sleep routine since I'm trying to come up with one to help me out. "
Why does my brain think im on the east coast?,"So I live in Europe. Born in Europe. Always have lived here. My dad's American. 

For some reason, my brain doesn't get tired until it's 5 am here. Which is midnight on East coast of the US. Right. Okay. 

So I'm here awake and I'm thinking this is frustrating. I can't adjust to a GMT timezone I've always lived in. 

So, I spent a month in the United States last September. On the east coast. And for those 30 days, I slept in perfect sync. Midnight roughly to 8 am roughly. Every day.

Effortlessly. What gives? 

I'm a citizen of the United States, got dual citizenship because of my dad, and it's so painful to try and push myself on little or no sleep here I'm considering moving to NY, PA or NJ. 

Just to sleep. Would this be too drastic? I can't sync up here. And even now I'm having trouble because it's 5:33 am and I'm panicking. 

Well, this is quite typical.

Can energy drinks cause insomnia somehow..?,"Hey all, so i'm pretty out of ideas now, nothing new in my life, i'm not stressed and sometimes I just cannot sleep at all, usually happens once a week now its twice, I take 10mg sublingual melatonin if needed or if really necessary I smoke weed but I don't want to become dependent on those in order to sleep normally.

&#x200B;

The only thing i'd say is new to my life is me drinking energy drinks, maybe 4-5 a week in the mornings or sometimes just in the afternoon, no where close of when I go to bed.

I'm not sure if it has something to do with my depression that comes and goes in plateaus. But night and night again i find my self staring in to the dark void that's is the emptiness in my room, trying my hardest to get that sweet sweet release. It's gotten to the point my eyes burn when i close them to ""sleep"" and i have perpetual purple eyes from lack of mimis time. my mom has bipolar disorders ive never been diagnosed or checked but could this be a symptom?

I'm so angry,"7.17 am now and could not sleep a single bit. I'm thinking if I should go to sleep when I feel tired or put myself through the pain and stay awake. I'm so deprived.
This pattern has been happening for months now. It's ruining my life and education. I've always suffered from insomnia since childhood and it's so unfair. 

 I literally cannot sleep anymore even when I'm tired, my mind won't shut up. I begin to feel tired 7am onwards and this is when I should be getting up and preparing for college/my day. Every night for a week I've been drinking clipper sleep easy tea and it does make me drowsy but yet, I can't do it. My education and college attendance is always being affected. Last week, I had a class 9 to 4 and I felt tired at 8am so I slept and woke up at 1pm. I didn't go. I keep repeating bad habits. I'm so behind in work and life in general. Everyone is up to speed with everything except me."
Melatonin advice?,"Hi friends. Currently in a bad bout of insomnia. Benzos and Bendryl aren’t working. Bought melatonin today and the dose is 3mg but I’ve read some people take 10.

Sleep state misperception is the worst!,"I can’t tell if I was sleeping for the past 4 hours or not. I read that it’s called sleep state misperception and supposedly a lot of insomniacs experience this. 

I also can’t tell if the thoughts I remember or the stories in my head were dreams or just deep thoughts while trying to sleep. It’s weird because I would try to sleep and then open my eyes like a hour or two later and not tell if I slept for that time or was trying to sleep!

Part of me wants to believe there is no way I would stay still for hours at a time without getting restless but I can’t tell for sure! I’m wondering if my recent dose increase of Prozac can be responsible for this. "
How many hours do you usually sleep per night? How often do you not sleep at all?,
Weed for sleep?,"My sleep issues are caused by anxiety and not being able to relax . I'm not going to focus on sleep anymore. Going to start focusing on relaxing and bringing down my anxiety.

Anyways sorry for the blah blah.... but apart of my test journey for relaxing is start smoking weed early or late in the day. I have never been much of a weed smoker but I think I hit that point where I need to try new things to relax or normalize anxiety. I'm usually a very strait edged person.

My mom has stage 1 breast cancer right now. She should be ok, but this insomnia set in a few days after the news. My Dad died from cancer a few years ago. 

I have minor physical health problems right now also that are adding to the stress. All the compilations took a toll on me. I don't want to get on meds, I rather try to beat my issues naturally.

Current stress reducers...
 Exercise works for me, but not enough. Now i want to try to add weed on top of this.

Anyone have experience with weed and relaxation or sleep???.  What's your favorite strains?"

Trying to get help for Insomnia and being defeated,"All I wanted to do was get sleeping pills for my Insomnia, Modafanil for my narcolepsy, and maybe some therapy. Instead, the psychiatrist has prescribed me Fluvoxamine because she says the real root cause of my Insomnia is anxiety. She has decided this after fifteen minutes of chatting with me.

I come to find out, after doing some research, that one of the common side effects of Fluvoxamine is INSOMNIA. Well what the hell? It's almost as if she didn't listen to a word I said. And I don't want to take an SSRI.

The feeling I got from going to this Psychiatrist was very much like- you're a broken person, and we're a factory that fixes broken people. We find the problem, give you some drugs, and push you back out the door. They didn't take into account any of my thoughts, needs, or feelings. I felt as if I was a mere statistic. As if they were hurrying me along in their meetings just so that they could get to the next one.

I am really disappointed that I have not been able to find a mental health professional that actually feels like they are ""on my side."" I really tried to be forthright and go along with the process this time, and instead they just prescribed me some drugs and kicked my ass out the door.

It's hard because everyone treats this as a fake disease. Even my damn doctor won't take it seriously. And my employer definitely doesn't have the patience for it. The quality of my life is really suffering. I am going to try to drag myself in to a different psychiatrist that sees fewer patients and specializes in sleep problems. That's my only hope. I am sick and tired of this."
CBT/CBTi Resources,"Hi all, get insomnia every now and then and coming off a hard week.  I see on here that CBT and CBTi are fairly popular. Does anyone have good links to where you learn more about it and start developing a plan for you or do you have to see a psychologist/therapist? "

Sleep maintenance insomnia; caused by high cortisol?,"So, for the past year I have been experiencing insomnia, I have gone to the doctors and they have brushed me off so now I’m asking the Internet for help. I experience sleep maintenance insomnia where I wake up constantly every single night. I also wake up in the morning feeling unrefreshed because of a lack of deep sleep. I also experience headaches. I believe that the insomnia and headaches is due to high cortisol. I have tried using magnesium oil, rhodiola, holy basil, ksm-66 ashwagandha to lower cortisol but I have not felt much of a difference. I have felt a difference in headaches when I take the supplement called seriphos which is supposed to lower cortisol, but I have not experienced a help for maintaining sleep. I have also experienced low sex drive, bad cognition, and poor memory.  I’m a 16 year old male btw, thanks for the help if you can recommend any supplement or anything that can help me sleep and lower cortisol,  I would appreciate it."

Eating much less sugar seems to have helped my insomnia massively.,"I've been an insomniac since I was in my early teens - I'm now 35. Like most people reading this, I've been through all the tortures of insomnia; the effects it's had on every part of my life have been enormous. I've also tried, over the years, all of the commonly – and less commonly – advised measures to help beat it (with the notable exception of CBTI because it's never been available to me). For a long time I've been settled in a not-so-happy middle ground of accepting frequent poor sleep, and self medicating sleeping pills (valium, lorazepam, and clonazepam are currently on my bedside - I try to avoid using these as much as possible, but it's kind of comforting to know that they're there)

&#x200B;

I've always had a sweet tooth, but never went totally crazy on sugar binges. I'd say my sugar consumption has been about average for someone from The West, or even on the lower end of the scale, considering how much sugar is in many people's diets.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been reading a few articles by people who'd cut down on, or cut out entirely, their sugar intake, and who wrote about the range of benefits they experienced (mainly fewer mood swings and more energy, but also less worry about the health risks associated with eating too much sugar). I don't think any of them mentioned better sleep, and I wasn't reading these articles with my insomnia in mind. But anyway, I started cutting down on how much sugar I eat, and I quickly saw a correlation between the days when I ate less sugar and the nights when I slept well, and the days when I slipped up and ate my normal amount of sugar, and nights when I slept badly. I do still have a pretty sugary iced coffee every morning, but apart from that I now snack on things like nuts, beans and roasted peas, and I try to resist sugary things later in the day. In fact I try not to eat anything containing added sugar after about midday.

I certainly can't say for sure that eating less sugar causing me to sleep better - it feels like it is, but it's only been a couple of weeks. But, in that time I have had a couple of nights when I went to bed thinking ""yeah, I'm not going to sleep well tonight - I  can just *feel* it"" - I'm sure all insomniacs know that feeling, and it's usually pretty accurate. Well, since cutting back on sugar, on those nights I fell asleep quickly and I slept soundly. And most nights since I've started eating less sugar, I've had the sleeping habits of a normal sleeper. My body tells me when I need to go to bed, I go up stairs and get ready for bed, read a page or two of my book and get drowsy. I put the book down, close my eyes and then shortly afterwards it's morning! All without sleeping pills.

&#x200B;

What's interesting to me is that from what I recall it's never been suggested to me to cut down on sugar in order to sleep better – not by doctors, nor by any of the numerous articles and books I've read on insomnia. I just Googled ""best ways to beat insomnia"", and none of the articles mention sugar. But now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense to me – to the point where feel pretty stupid for not thinking of it years ago! Some people could surely be less tolerant to high-sugar diets, and it could affect their sleep. Also research shows that insomnia increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. I've not read any of these studies, but the obvious question is could it be because the insomniacs studied ate more sugar, or had a lower tolerance to the sugar in their diets?

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in case it clicks with anyone else. I'm only a datapoint of one, so I really don't want to get anyone's hopes up. Believe me, I know what it's like to try something new to beat insomnia, only for it to fail. But maybe give it a go if you're an insomniac. There are other major benefits to eating less sugar, so even if it doesn't help your insomnia, you'll be making a positive change to your overall health.

&#x200B;

I'd love to know what people think. Has anyone been advised to eat less sugar because of their insomnia? Has anyone tried this and found it to be effective, or tried and it hasn't worked?"
"Paying for CBT is a Scam, don't buy into it","Its really really simple logic.

You either;

A) Have the ability to fall asleep, and you have a bad habit keeping you awake, in that case a MINOR fucking adjustment from a book or an app will fix things. 

B) You can't fall asleep because you have thyroid issues, sleep apnea or a neurological condition, and no amount of thinking will help at all. 

&#x200B;

I guess if you are to lazy to read a book, you could pay a therapist to hold your hand and walk you through it. But if you have even basic interest in your own well being, just read the dam book. 

&#x200B;

If turning off your PC and what not doesn't work, OR and this is a REALLY REALLY important one, you feel like you go to sleep but its not refreshing, go to a DR!!!

&#x200B;

If your Dr try's to write it off as anxiety and send you to CBT, WITHOUT conducting a blood thyroid test, tell them, ""Excuse me I don't want fucking Quack you asshole"" 

&#x200B;

\*\*Non-refreshing sleep is a key sign of sleep apnea which can kill you. This can happen to anyone, even without snoring."
"I'm so, so tired.","  

I'm sorry, a long ramble is coming up, I just need to vent. I'm so tired I feel like I've got a fish tank in the place of my head, dead fish glooping inside.

I've had a shitty summer, fall, and now winter.

Really, I've had trouble sleeping most of my life. My mom, now in her late sixties, likes to tell stories of how I was such a sweet, sweet baby, but I'd lie awake all night, just staring at the ceiling, and then sleep peacefully only during the days. Me, I remember curling in bed under the blankets when I was below double digits, reading by flashlight because I couldn't seem to sleep and it was making me anxious.

As an adult, I'm bipolar, and I'd be okay with being bipolar I think if I could just sleep. If I could just sleep like normal people sleep. If I could go to bed at 11PM and shut my eyes and be asleep within an hour or two, hell, if it just took four or five hours that'd be okay too, I guess. 

For years, I gobbled down every sleeping pill the doctors cared to throw at me, and it made me pathetically miserable and didn't do much to help the problem in the first place. Sometimes they'd help for a few weeks until I'd adjusted and then I'd feel worse off than when I started. I think zolpidem was what was nicest on my brain except when it gave me weird, hallucinating trips and I had to stop. A number of ineffective meds later, I was on Flunitrazepam which knocked me into inky orbit but made me feel like my mind had turned to sludge - it didn't seem like sleep at all. After I realised that a friend had molested me while I was passed out, I had a meltdown and decided that no matter how hard and how ugly things'd get, I'd find a way to live without sleep meds because I didn't want to live like that. I threw it all away. Then caved and got new pills - continued for a couple of months with no more luck... then threw them away again, and now haven't touched the stuff for three years. 

Sleep is shit. It's absolute utter shit. Therapy doesn't help, though I tried. Even when I'm in a period of relatively good sleep, the mere concept is such a point of anxiety now. The bed is a warzone of tossing and turning and sweating and churning, and my internal clock keeps ticking away towards the hour when I know I need to get out of bed. When someone comments that I look tired and I tell them I've had a bad night, and they agree that they sometimes have a little trouble sleeping and I should try some tea before bed or why not meditation - I feel this horrible, trembling envy that makes me nauseous, but I smile politely and say \*thank you\*, and \*I'll try\*.

If I'm lucky, if I have zero plans the next day, if I've been out and the weather was nice and I got plenty of light, if the bed seems extraordinarily comfy, if the cats are cuddly sweethearts, if my limbs feel heavy and soft, if I'm not too tired and not too fearful and not too alert nor too sluggish... I might sleep. Might be eight hours - might be four. I'll take whatever I get and be damn grateful for it. 

Tonight, though, wasn't that kind of night."
What are the risks of taking Zopiclone 7.5mg daily?,"I changed meds to Zopiclone and it seems to be working, but i read that it messes with GABA receptors and causes dependence, but is the only way that i can achieve sleep. Without meds I can go days without a single minute of sleep.

Chronic insomnia sufferers: what are some things I should know about living my day-to-day life with only a few hours of sleep a night?,"I developed anxiety over going to sleep a few nights ago and it’s looking like this is going to be my life now.

I want to throw up when I don't sleep,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but it's a start. 

So, I dont believe I have insomnia. I have a couple bad nights for no reason , but they're not constant enough to be considered something. However, I will occasionally have clusters of bad nights that cause me to because heavily nauseated in the morning.

As a description of the ""nauseated"" feeling I get, I feel a lump in my throat, like a trapped gas. I'll be constantly feeling like I'm about to throw up, to no avail. I'll tend to burp up stomach acid. If I end up throwing up, it'll be a mucus, not actual stomach acid, due to it not burning up my throat. Then my airways close up and I almost suffocate but that isn't special to this scenario. 

Is this a thing that commonly happens? I haven't met anyone or read anything that described this. If it isn't a specific thing, is there anything I can do to not end up feeling like this? Any help for figuring out what's going on is appreciated."
"King-sized pillow, because every little counts","Guys, I just did a complete upgrade of my bedding. Gonna be honest here, it's because somebody I hook up with was in town for the weekend and I looked at my saggy, baggy old pillows that were probably 20% dust mites by weight and realized they had to go. I don't have a king-sized bed but the big pillows called out to me on the store and I also got some nice sheets.

&#x200B;

It's always harder for me to fall asleep with somebody else in the bed. But I swear with my new luxe bedding set up I drifted off in less than an hour. Which is huge for me. 

&#x200B;

I'm not saying just get some king-sized pillows and your insomnia troubles are behind you. I've battled this demon all my life. I am aware of how tricky and almost devious it is. How solutions can be fleeting and root-cause improvements are ever-elusive. But this is a reminder that little things can help on the margins sometimes and it's worth it. Upgrade your pillows. Don't sleep any worse than you have to. I got mine from TJ Maxx they were $24 for the pair. "

Sleep meds to take as needed?,"So I tried the estazolam.

Yes, it made me sleep, but I haven't left the house in three days. Not only it has the usual lethargy and confusion symptoms of every med I've been given. It affects mental cognition dramatically. There are periods during the day where I am DUMB. Like, I have to type 10 times a password I usually type automatically so I copy-paste it to see what's wrong, takes me a long time to see the error, and then it takes me a long time to understand how to correct it. Other shits I've done during the day are way more sad/laughable to share here. So I quit today

I have an appointment with my psych/CBTi specialist monday. I'm OK with taking meds, but I prefer something that could be taken only as needed. Do you know about any drugs I could discuss with her?

&#x200B;

I think my only option right now is to be productive during the weekdays and dead during the weekend as a recovery. I've tried like 7 meds the last three months and just feel like a guinea pig. It's pretty clear doctors can't pin point what might be wrong with me

Any reliable way to track sleep?,"I tried two fitness trackers - fitbit versa and garmin 235. Both appear to be very optimistic about the amount of sleep I get, although the fitbit appears to be more accurate. I have a feeling their software is geared toward a normal sleep pattern but fail for insomnia. On my fitbit, I found that it is more useful to look at the heart rate graph for spikes that show activity, but this is a very limited amount of information. Anyone can recommend sleep tracking that they really tested and found working well? "
"Where can I buy genuine, safe, affordable melatonin that ships to the UK?","My doctor thinks that melatonin could help me with my sleep issues, but she says that her computer says she can't prescribe it for unknown reasons.

Does anyone have recommendations on how to buy melatonin in the UK, or advice on buying medication online in general?"

How did you figure out if you were an Amer or PMer? (Your natural wake up time),"Humans are biologically programmed to have a preference when it comes to natural sleep/wake up time, per all of the research that I've read. Typically this means being naturally pre-disposed to waking up somewhere between 5:30 AM and 9:00 AM (with a small number of outliers).

How did you figure out your natural wake up time? I've anchored myself to 8 AM for the past week, but I keep waking up way before my alarm and end up tired all day, and I'm considering moving it earlier. "
"Marijuana changed how I sleep, and why you should try it","(Shorter summary at the bottom) 

I’ve had sleep problems since I was at least 13 or 14. Not as bad as some, but it makes it so I can’t fall asleep for at least 1-3 hours on a typical night. Some nights, I have such bad anxiety that it feels as though adrenaline is being pumped directly into my blood stream. It often can ruin the good day I’m having, and make my life miserable. As I grew later into my teens, like many, I experimented with weed, and found that it lowered me into the gentle sleep I’d been so desperately wanting for years. Before this I’d tried: Meditation (multiple types, white noise, sound frequencies, melatonin, reading, warm drinks, and other sleep aids. Nothing seemed to work, and then suddenly I discovered this awesome plant that can help me do something I’ve never been able to do well. 

Marijuana is actually legal in my state, but for various reasons I can’t have it be detected in my blood stream. So I finally found something that works extremely well, and it even helps remove my anxiety, but I’m prohibited from using it. I’m not even using it recreationally at this point, just smoking a small amount before bed like you would take a sleep aid in a pill form. I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem fair to me. I guess that’s how life can be though. Oh well. 

This all being said, if you have access to safe legal marijuana and haven’t tried it as a sleep aid, do it! It seriously could have changed my life in that regard. If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask me! 

Summarized: Weed helps me sleep. I can’t smoke weed for certain reasons. I’m pissed about it. If you haven’t tried using marijuana to help you sleep, and it’s legally available- try it. 

Again, if you have any questions at all, feel free to ask me! I can vouch for it 100 percent. "

Why did I drink coffee after 12pm yesterday??,"My work is changing the coffee in our kitchen. I’m especially excited because they’re getting rid of the wasteful k-cups in favour of brewed coffee machines that we’ll compost. 

They decided to have a little event so the office could taste various coffee flavours and vote for our favourites, but the f***ers decided to have it at noon of all times. 

Yes I tried to have only a smidgeon of each and not a whole cup, but here I am overthinking every conversation of the day.

I love coffee, not just for it’s wakey wakey powers when I’m operating on 3-4 interrupted hours of sleep, but I love the taste! Whether it’s the finest most expensive fresh ground espresso to day-old weak gas station swill, I don’t care: all coffee is great!

I’ve always found that I can drink it just fine in the am without it affecting that night’s sleep (hell I love a good morning coffee nap when no one is in the sick room). But if I have even one tiny drop one minute after 12pm exactly, I can forget about ever sleeping that night."

Does it hurt?,Does anyone’s else feel like it hurts when they fall asleep? It is a physical struggle and hurts and feels uncomfortable when I am crossing that bridge to sleep.

Drinking vs sleep,"Hi,

For years I’ve been going out every weekend hammering myself, going to sleep at 3-4-5 AM.

Anyone had those kind of problems resolved with stopping the noose ?"
Sleep advice needed,"Recently I think I've developed insomnia/sleep apnea. I know the reason it developed. It's because I also recently developed bad anxiety. I've done some research for advice and there was a lot of people saying that you should wake up at the same time everyday and that you shouldn't nap at all. This is where my problem lies. Recently I've probably been getting at most 6 hours of sleep (most nights like 4 hours) and I've noticed my anxiety is a lot worse when I don't get enough sleep. I have class every day in the morning and what'll happen is Itll take me until like 12 at night to fall asleep and then I'll wake up at like 4 or 5 and Ill have anxiety because I know I'll need sleep for school and then I can't fall back asleep. I was planning on sleeping in on Saturday because I wont be anxious about school but everyone is saying to keep a constant schedule. I'm not sure what to do because I feel like if I don't get sleep I'm gonna go crazy. I don't know if I should sleep in on Saturday or not. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

BTW Im in the process of getting a psychiatrist but thats gonna take a week. I just need short term advice for this week."
What I did to break out of my year long episode of insomnia,"I really hope this helps some of you. This list is LONG. I was desperate, so I tried a lot of things. I would recommend you don't try them all at once as it could get quite expensive, and this way you'll also learn which ones actually work for you. Here to answer any questions you have, so fire away :)

Bit of background on me: I've been waking up at around 3am almost every night for the past year, and not sleeping the rest of the night. Since about August of last year, I developed sleep onset insomnia where I could not sleep at all the whole night. Needless to say, it was driving me to the brink of insanity. Over the last two or so weeks, I've managed to steadily improve my sleep quality, falling asleep faster, waking up less, and falling back to sleep faster too. I know how debilitating it can be to not get any sleep so I wanted to share how I managed it in case it helps y'all. 

In the interest of full disclosure, the Amazon links *are* affiliate links, but if you’d rather not click them I’ve listed the product names as well.

* Sleep at the same time every night — preferably before 11pm, which is when we get a cortisol 'second-wind'. 10:45 seems to work for me. If you don’t feel tired before 11pm, keep trying to get out of bed earlier until you do.

* Go to the doc's if you haven't already and get some blood tests done to check your iron, vitamin D and B12 levels — my levels of D and B12 were horribly low (I live in England where there's hardly any sun, and am veggie). If you're low on any of those vits, get your supplements in.
The ones I use are sprays, so they're quickly absorbed:

 * [BetterYou Vit D spray](https://amzn.to/2HYFCOW)

 * [BetterYou Vit B12 spray](https://amzn.to/2TIqRRG)

* One hour before bed, I take Magnesium Citrate, L-Theanine and 5-HTP. These are all well known for lowering stress levels and improving sleep. **What really changed the game for me was having a bite of a cracker or a small piece of bread after to make sure I swallowed them down properly.** It makes such a difference.
These are the ones I’ve been taking:

 * [Solar Magnesium Citrate](https://amzn.to/2THaWn3) — these ones are pretty big so I take them first so as the other pills push them down. You need to take two, or however many of the ones you’re taking gets you to 400mg.

 * Hello Pure 5HTP + Vitamin B6 — they’ve stopped selling this brand on Amazon now, and haven’t tried any other brands yet, but again you’ll want a dosage of about 400mg.

 * [Solgar L-Theanine 150mg](https://amzn.to/2Bmdwrq)

* Not sure if you can get these outside of the UK, but I’ve been taking two of these 30 mins before bed. Not recommended for asthmatics, apparently, because of the grass content, but I’ve been fine with them so far. The grasses are super high in antioxidants and are meant to act as a kind of precursor to melatonin production. I didn’t notice any benefit at first, but after about 3 weeks I noticed an improvement. Expect more vivd dreams too.

If you wake up at around 3am as I do, you probably know that it’s adrenal fatigue that’s causing that. If that’s the case, the next two points will really help:

* Bad sleep more than likely points to an unhealthy gut. I’ve been working on this by eating more fermented foods (apple cider vinegar, kimchi, kefir or yoghurt, sourdough, etc.), along with these, which encourage probiotic growth:

 * [Synergy Organic Chlorella](https://amzn.to/2SdkbhO)

* Avoid refined carbs, sugar and caffeine, especially in the afternoon / evening. It’s very taxing on the nervous system and causes our cortisol to spike. In the same vein, don’t leave it too long between meals — keep your blood sugar consistent.

 * [Yerba Mate](https://amzn.to/2BpJgM4) — I’ve been drinking this stuff every morning for about 10 years — no jitters, just a smooth buzz. High in L-Theanine too.

 * As a big bread/pizza fan, sourdough has been my friend (see previous point).

* Don’t be temped to check the clock at night, but if you want to record the times you wake up, I keep my phone on flight mode next to me, face down, and I just take a quick screen capture when I wake up. No need to look at the screen when you’re doing this. You can just check your cam roll in the morning.

* Maybe this won’t be so popular with the menfolk on here, but putting a drop of jasmine oil on your wrists is a great natural sedative and promotes GABA production. In studies it’s been shown to be [as calming as valium](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/7881819/Smell-of-jasmine-as-calming-as-valium.html). YMMV.

* Drink some kind of ‘sleep’ tea that contains Valerian / lavender / hops / etc. about 2.5 hours before bed. I like this one:

 * [Pukka Night Time tea](https://amzn.to/2RKMSxx)

* Use a good quality sea salt or Himalayan pink salt in your meals, especially if you have restless leg syndrome, as you may be low on potassium and magnesium. I also take it in the morning with some water, as it’s supposed to normalise blood sugar and boost digestion (which both help you sleep). Normal table salt won’t do as it’s been stripped of its minerals.

* Get moving during the day, but don’t exercise in the evening. Walks are good, especially in the late afternoon (helps to regulate our circadian rhythm). When I wasn’t sleeping at all, all I wanted to do was lay on the couch all day but that won’t help you. Something aerobic and grounding, like Power Yoga, kickboxing or running is great.

* I use blue light blocking glasses when on my tablet/laptop at night. If you’re super sensitive to blue light, I’d suggest getting one with yellow or orange lenses. They’re about twice as powerful as the clear ones. The pair I use are:

Even fap doesnt work. So tired now. Is nofap actually good to fight off anxiety and insomnia long term?,"Wasnt able to sleep so i decided to fap instead. Now i cant sleep and super tired. Im gonna be like shit at work tomorrow. Fk me.

Anyway, a bit out of the rant. I just want to ask if anyone following the r/nofap and find it useful? I have a mild porn addiction. I jerk off atleast 5/6 times a week to porn. And im starting to think that all those dopamine shit messed up with my mood and anxiety. Is it true?"
Taking Melatonin? STOP!,"I'm posting a public service announcement because I did something to myself that I did not know could happen.

&#x200B;

If you are taking Melatonin every day stop immediately you are causing yourself more harm than good!

I was told I could take Melatonin by my doctor. I followed the instructions. I did not see any warning for this either.

&#x200B;

If you take Melatonin every day, after a period of 2 weeks to a month, you begin to alter your sleep wake state.

Taking this medication will actually prolong when you fall asleep.

After about a month and a half of use, I went from falling asleep at 2, sometimes 4 at the latest. To falling asleep at 7 or 8 in the morning.

It was not until I was researching a cocktail I was going to make that I stumbled upon a forum which talked about the side effects of daily use.

Immediately I stopped and was able to fall asleep at a more reasonable time after I spoke with my doctor and agreed on a plan I came up with to fix what I had done.

&#x200B;

I felt I should share this as its an over the counter medication so you do not really think much about consuming it.

  
Edit:   
I saw a sleep doctor the other day, and my perspective on melatonin has been altered a little.

Apparently melatonin from companies like Jameson, Swansons, etc are garbage.

The doctor recommended I take 1mg of good quality melatonin every night, and do light therapy in the morning in an effort to adjust my Circadian Rhythm.

My trainer uses ""Natural Factors - Tranquil Sleep"".  

Apparently the melatonin would be considered mid grade (no, there is not an advantage to looking at top shelf melatonin)

How can I stop worrying about my sleep?,"Every time I have something going on early in the morning I worry that I won't wake up for it and that worry makes me not sleep and then I worry about how I will function on little to no sleep.

My legs ache a lot when I have insomnia,"Due to my mental illnesses I have a very difficult time falling asleep, and unfortunately medication doesn’t work since it heavily triggers my anxiety. But while I’m laying down in bed at night my legs start to ache so badly I feel like screaming. But this only happens when I have insomnia, because when I’m usually trying to sleep on a normal day I feel no pain whatsoever. Does this happen to anyone else?"

It's not really ideal because i wake up at 6 for work everyday.

But it's gotten to the point where a lack of sleep is affecting my cognitive function: I'll get to work and attempt to do my work but I look at the screen and  it's like trying to read hieroglyphics, this really bad because I'm on the cusp of a life changing promotion I don't want to fuck it up, therefore I need your help ASAP "
What’s the best safe thing you tried to sleep better?,
Anyone hate the medication almost as much as the insomnia,I used to be on seroquil it worked though it was just barley tolerable i got off it recently with a diffrent cocktail for sleep and other underlying mebtal helath issues. But after some outside stressors the insomnia isnt undercontrol anf i don't know which i fear more insomnia or the zombie state that is seroquil.
Horrible insomnia,"Man been trying to get over this situation with a girl and I haven’t really been hurt in a long time so its tough to move on and im trying. I’m already an alcoholic and suffering from depression and anxiety. Ive quit several times but i always go back, longest I went was a year and things were great but like i always do i fuck shit eveything up and now shit is worst and ive been sober for almost 2 weeks now .My mind keeps telling me  I deserve to drink as long I can control myself but I know I cant. Im afraid of the unknown and im afraid maybe I will never be able to have a chance with this girl or be socialable again because we connected thru alcohol and shes a drinker herself.  I blackout and you never know next time could be it. Shit is getting tougher, I cant sleep I work over 16 hours a day, im trying to go to the gym but its tough when you are exhausted. Im in debt so theres no way for me to quit if not my livelyhood goes to shit. Plus my family needs me more then ever. This is all in my head and I cant sleep and i have work in the next 3 hours and a 17 hour work day ahead smh. "
I don't know where this ends and begins anymore....,"I've tried everything bar literally roofie'ing myself.

I've had issues sleeping, having anxiety at night, nightmares, stress dreams, for as long as I can remember. 

Medication, no medication, sleep hygiene, no screens, no light, open windows so it's cold, firm bed, therapy, working out every day, meditation, no caffeine after 15/3 pm, white noise, asmr, THE LIST DOES NOT STOP. 

I don't know how to ever be like other people who just get f\*\*\*ing tired, get into bed and go to sleep at night, who can wake up early and have a day of it.

The anxiety just builds and builds and if I'm not petrified of what insane concoction my brain will make me suffer through when I'm supposed to rest, it's that I cannot face the quiet doom of trying for 3 hours in quiet to get to a few hours stressful sleep just to do more of the same, only all over again. 

Sleep itself seems elusive, cruel, and like some ghost I can never hold, befriend, calm down or grasp. I want to so badly.

Am I developing insomnia?,"For the past two months, I’ve had a problem almost every night - I fall asleep just fine, but wake up consistently around 2am or 3am (with the exception of tonight only, it was 12am for some reason) and usually cannot fall back asleep. I have no issues falling asleep in the first place, but once i wake up in the middle of the night I’m pretty much up for good, unless i’m lucky and manage to fall back asleep about three or four hours later. I’ve only slept entirely though the night a handful of times throughout the two months. I’ve been seeing a biofeedback doctor to help me fall back asleep, which is the reason why I am sometimes able too. Anyways, please let me know what you think. It doesn’t sound typical but maybe is a variation of a sort, my dad developed insomnia when he was my age so perhaps it runs in the family. Please help me out! "
Geodon Withdrawal Hell,"I take a high dose of Geodon at night and rely on it completely to fall asleep. if my nightly dose doesn't absorb right, I go into withdrawal. The main symptom of Geodon withdrawal for me is total insomnia. Some nights everything works right and I fall asleep a few hours after taking it. Other nights it doesn't work at all and I have to take smaller doses several more times in a bid to knock myself out. I've been up til 8 am twice in the last week and was luckily able to fall asleep finally by then.

I can tell it's not working tonight. The problem with the drug is it needs to be taken with food, and it's very finicky. If I have too much food or fluid in my stomach when I take it, it doesn't work then either. If I don't have enough food it doesn't work. Sometimes I do everything how i think it should be done and it still doesn't work, like tonight.

Last week I missed a day of work and school because of this. It's probably going to happen today as well.

I'm completely held hostage by how this medication behaves. My life is on hold. I told my psychiatrist I'm going to wean myself off of it whether they want to help me or not, I'm done. I'd rather go back to how it was before. I had insomnia but it was never this bad. I can take other psych meds. I'm willing to risk a manic episode to get off this medication.

I have yet to meet a doctor who truly understands how this drug works and how the withdrawal affects me. None of them have any answers or solutions except to prescribe useless shit like Vistaril, which literally does nothing for me. I've found when I'm in Geodon withdrawal Ambien also does jack shit.

I'm really struggling with this."
Having trouble sleeping? I used to have it really bad in 2018. These are the things that I tried,"We all suffer from Insomnia for different reasons.

In 2013-2014 I had to sedate myself with several sleeping pills because all I would do is lay in bed thinking about these horrible people I had to deal with at work. The day I got let go - I slept like a baby that night.

I have been on sleeping pills for 15 years due to chronic pain. Last year I went without any sleep aid until August when my Insomnia became severe. They put me on multiple medications (anti-depressants) because these AD's had 'sleepiness' as a side effect. Amitryptline (sp? ) is the only one of these which had an effective sedative sleep aid. This year I am back taking 3.5 - 7 mg of zopiclone every few days when I really need to be asleep at a specific time.

&#x200B;

Moving along.

In order to get better sleep you need to build yourself a system, and then repeat it every night, and eventually your body will understand that you are building a sleep routine which will eventually put you to sleep after practice.

&#x200B;

There are several things that you can do.

\- buy red light bulbs and put them on a couple of your lamps. After a certain time, turn all your lights off, and turn the lamps with the red bulbs on. What you are doing is simulating sunset, which is supposed to send a signal to the brain.

\- drink camomille tea it offers a calming effect, and it tastes good.

\- meditate or practice breathing techniques

\- make a list of things to do tomorrow, or if your head is active, write brief notes

\- take scullcap vitamin as well as Magnesium glycinate

\- look into CBD products, or even THC edibles- listen to hypnotic sleep stories Interglatic space travel by Lina Grace is on youtube.

(I encourage you to download it to your phone and not listen via youtube as you will get wake up by advertisements)

Finally, while you are in bed. If your mind is going just count every inhale as 1, and every exhale as 2, stop when you get to 10, and start at 1. You mind cannot count and think endlessly at the same time.

Re-Edited for better formatting:  
Blue light is a factor. Which is why they say not to look at your devices late at night.   
Windows 10 latest april 2018 edition users:   
Right click on the desktop and go to Display Properties.   
Turn on Night Light, and go to Night light settings

Adjust your color temperature and schedule time.   
Phone users I believe you also have something similar.   
This will reduce the blue light that is emitted from the display (will not change color of your screen during gaming sessions for those gamers wondering - you know why you can't sleep. ;) )

I'm on the fence about exactly how much it effects us. But I can say that I am a little concerned/curious if there is a correlation between our minds being more active than normal due to all the staring into the phone as much as we do.

&#x200B;

Or perhaps it is the north pole moving which is preventing us from sleeping.

"It's a lose-lose. In order to sleep, I have to take 4 benadryls and drink. If not, I won't sleep. Either way, I'm gonna feel terrible","Doctors won't help me. Said that a million times. It's just that now the only things I can get for sleep aren't working and I'm taking hydroxyzine and benadryl (4) + a couple shots. Idk what to do. I'm in absolute GI agony. Unable to eat. Exhausted. Dozzy. Seeing. Stars constantly. Weed doesn't work anymore. Again - that's what happens when doctors wont help you (and in fact, to add more insult, will only give you hydroxyzine and antipsychotics for sleep). If you find something that helps you sleep, and it's the only thing you can get (besides benadryl and hydroxyzine), you'll use it up and by six months later your tolerance has grown and hardened you to the effects. Since its all you can get. That's why weed doesn't make me sleep anymore. The doctor wouldn't help me then, and he won't help me now. So now I'm completely out of options and have turned to mostly drinking for sleep."
Same thing two nights in a row. (Rant),"I haven’t had a bout of insomnia for a while (praise the pillow gods) until Monday night. Since my husband is back over the road trucking, I am doing early spring cleaning. I hurt so bad yesterday from over exerting myself and couldn’t fall asleep till 5 am. And here I am again Tuesday from cleaning my sons room. I ended up having double my dosage of sleep meds to fall asleep yesterday morning. I ended up cutting my toe on a sharp edge of furniture right as I had taken my meds to sleep. Literally was on the way to bed. 

The pain from doing that made me have an adrenaline rush which of course negated the sleep meds I took. This is getting so old. So since I couldn’t sleep I finished cleaning the living room hoping I would tire out. Nope still wide awake. I know that the minute the sun starts coming up I will get groggy. 

Just worried about getting my sleep schedule messed up again. Frustrated that after a long time of being able to sleep without a bout of insomnia, I get whacked with it two days in a row. 

Sorry about the rant. Not helping the fact this is my husbands first week back over the road, I lay down and my mind wants to go racing.  Just really don’t want this to start being a nightly thing again. "
Praaaaazosin (mini rant),"I hate it. 


No nightmares would be swell.  IF I WAS SLEEPING ENOUGH TO HAVE ANY. 

I’d take a good, full night of being completely sedated with some nightmares over this. Give me back my seroquel, dammit. I don’t want melatonin. Melatonin is a lie. I don’t want trazodone, it’s just another white pill to add to the mix. Prazosin makes waking up to pee at night suck. Just sedate my ass and call it a night, please.

I know too much sleep can be even worse but there’s no inbetween for me, I can sleep 8 hours and wake up absolutely exhausted, same with 12, 6, whatever it may be no matter what I’m so worn down and physically can’t get out of bed.

Vitamin Deficiency and Insomnia?,"Good evening:

I posted a few weeks back about my inability to fall asleep spontaneously, and a few of my medical conditions.  That has not changed - and I imagine it won't.  However, last week, my body gave up a bit after working a week of 24 hr on/24 hr off shifts.  I ended up with an acute illness and high fever which landed me a couple of days in bed. 

However, due to my illness, I did have a meeting with my healthcare team, and went for an extensive blood work panel that I don't normally have done with my routine treatments.  

I had mentioned in my earlier posts that my sleep medications were not working as well as they normally do...

Within a couple hours of having my blood drawn, I received a call that my Vitamin B6, B12 and Vit D levels were critically low.  I know I've had them tested previously, but they must've have been abnormally low as I haven't been supplemented. 

Has anyone ever had these levels interfere with their sleep before?  I obviously haven't been able to decipher between vitamin deficient fatigue, and any other type of fatigue. "
Is Trazodone causing me to wake up in the middle of the night?,"I have been taking trazodone off and on for a little over a year, in the beginning it was great and knocked me out cold. But, as time went on I no longer can stay asleep, usually wake up anywhere from 2am-4am and toss and turn till my alarm goes off at 7am.  I sometimes add a natural supplement,  E.g Melatonin or Valerian in hopes it would aid in keeping me asleep but is rarely successful. Haven't had a full night sleep in months.

Does anyone have any experience with trazodone causing this? I read something in a post about it being metabolized into a stimulant later in the night. I am desperate for a full night sleep, but don't want to take anymore prescriptions.

"GUYS, it could be a microbiome related problem!","I just wanted to point this out as I’ve been exhaustively (ha) searching for things that cause my insomnia, and only now did I came accross the idea that it could be an issue with your gut microbiome. These tiny guys are intimately intertwined with the brain play a huge role in your mental health. Alterations in them can even change your personality. Furthermore, chronic insomnia damages these microbiomes, which can very well lead to a self fulfilling cycle if left untreated. Specific kinds of bacteria play different roles and can be more effective than medicine.
I wish I could provide better information but I’m not the best person to talk about microbiology. It’s worth doing some research on the topic if it hasn’t crossed your mind before. 

update after some days of multibiotics and yogurt: It got a lot better.

Now this is my third day insomnia. I didnt get any step to forward and I decided to write/tell people what I feel and live.

I start to meditation for being calm and relax in night times. I hope this will help me with pils and diet program. 

I just sleep less than 10 hours in last three day. If some one read this I want to say hi! and Arigato for read my first diary in here.

Telling/writing my experiance and share it to people might be feel better. I am trying. I believe one day I will beat this stressed feelings and insomnia. 

By the way I want to share my music to you. I am listening when I am trying to sleep. [**https://youtu.be/Adpe3aq8W-w**](https://youtu.be/Adpe3aq8W-w) 

I hope we all get rid of this disease one day!

Best Regards!"
I just want to relax,"I have to work in four hours and all I want is to feel comfortable and calm in my own bed. 

Anyone have quick tips for falling asleep and/or surviving the hellish day ahead?"
Any experience with estazolam?,"I found a psych that specializes in CBTi. I also did a sleep study and I'm waiting for the results

The thing is, she wants to put me on estazolam. Apparently it is a benzo, I'm death scared of benzos. She seemed angry I was reluctant to take it. I have another appointment on Wednesday, the last three days have been really rough so she is probably going to be pissed off

She assured me I would begin to taper in 5 weeks. But I am reading the window of treatment is 2 week max

Anyone has any experiences with this drug? I have too many health problems, the last thing I want to deal with is a full blown addiction"
help with inconsistent insomnia," 

2 weeks ago, i had an extremely stressful sitiuation due to overthinking wich led to me not sleeping well one night. Ive always had from time to time 1 week in wich i would not be able to sleep well, would take a lot for me to fall asleep and i would wake up a lot, and then i went for weeks or months sleeping well. In the past i fell asleep so easily that one time at an edm festival in the middle of the crowd i just sat there and fell asleep. I once slept 2h straight in the middle of a techno club. In the front row of an hockey match, the list goes on. So basically 2 weeks ago i had that night i didnt sleep well and i thought ""well just my short insomnia kicking, 2 days and ill be good"", i literally sleep so bad that i week sometimes i fell asleep at 8am going to work at 11 and then i would take a nap afternoon. Then i decided to go one night with little sleep so i could have better sleep the next night and that happened. The week after, i would take 10 minutes to fall asleep for like 4 nights in a row , and i would sleep 7/8 h a day easily. But then it came again, i ended up falling asleep only after 4h on thursday at like 8:30 AM, didnt have work so i slept until like 13. 4:30h of sleep, not insanely bad but no reeeally bad. Next night i fell asleep in 20 minutes and sleept like 11h. The night after i stayed up very late with friends but when i got to bed i just fell asleep in like 10 minutes (i was high-ish), slept only 5:30h but i was like 6h on bed so it was good. Now the past night i went to bed at 1:45AM with work at 11:30AM, and i fell asleep literally 5h later at 6:45. So the problem here is, when it seems like its going away and im starting to sleep well, it always comes back. Always. I always have that night where i feel extremely anxious about not being able to sleep, where i feel unconfortable, where i just feel i just want to sleep but i phsically cant. Any tips? I was thinking of buying a melatonin supplement thats cheap and has some extra things like valerian root and stuff , its sold here near my house. I would pop that in the nights that i was not being able to sleep. But i was thinking of a way to fix this a little bit better.

One more thing, some of the nights that took me 3/4/5h to fall asleep, i actually kind of fell asleep in like 20/30 min but then after 2/3 minutes in an semi-unconscious state i would wake up and get a spike of anxiety mixed with anger for interrupting my process of falling asleep, wich would make me really awake even after 10 min earlier i was just almost falling asleep."
"Please help!! I cannot fall asleep naturally before at least 4 AM and it’s frustrating. On top of that, I’m TERRIFIED of sleeping alone in the dark. Any advice at all helps!","I’ve always had problems sleeping but it’s gotten significantly worse. I was diagnosed ADHD and took Vyvanse for awhile until I realized it will not let me fall asleep. I’ve been taking melatonin and I’m nervous I will become dependent but i truly do not know what to do.
I lay in bed and my mind will not go quiet. Most nights I don’t even feel tired.

Also, on top of that I am beyond terrified of sleeping in the dark when I’m alone. My racing thoughts intensify in the darkness and I scare myself into turning on YouTube. I’m in my 20’s and it’s ridiculous but I just cannot help it.

I really need suggestions. Anything at all helps.

TL;DR: trouble falling asleep and need help "
"Another night, another struggle to sleep","I take my fistful of PTSD drugs every night and usually get to sleep.   Some nights,  like tonight,  nothing f-ing works.   So i double up my dosages and take them with wine.   Of course i know this is a rookie mistake but it doesn't seem to matter.   I just want to sleep.   And if i don't wake up... that's ok too. "
Anyone else hungry all the time?,"I can eat and be hungry again within a couple of hours even if I make sure to eat plenty of protein and fat. I don’t know whether it has to do more with lack of sleep or my IBS. Maybe both. Sometimes after eating I feel hungry again immediately. 

I think I’m also eating out of boredom sometimes from having to be awake for so long.

This is a big contrast to how I used to be when I’d sleep in until the afternoon if I wanted to. I was much skinnier back then too. Now I’m overeating all the time and overweight.

The frustrating thing is overeating also makes it harder for me to sleep, so it’s kind of a cycle. I don’t know how to control my appetite though, I can’t just sleep in and skip breakfast. Trying to ignore the hunger is just about impossible."
Insomnia is a choice?,"since i was 11 i have troubles to sleep, now, 15 years later, sleep still being a problem, but, i feel like its a choice.

i dont like to sleep in general, waste of time, being turned off, having crazy dreams, completely out of control still being a terrible idea that get me anxious, and most of all, i love the dawn, its peaceful, quiet, i can do whatever i want without anyone bothering me, its my chillint time, from me to myself, so, lately i am more and more believing thats a choice.

but yes, we all know how dont sleep fuck our life in all ways"
Why is it only at night that my mind is just constantly racing,"I'ts been 3 years almost since I last had a good night's sleep.

I just cant stop worrying about things or situations I should have dont differently. I know I can't change the past but man Do I feel like an idiot sometimes..

Whats worse is im so tired in the day time I cant get anything done or dont even want to do anything. It just makes me feel like crap because I'm not advancing. I'm just wasting my days sleeping wasting my night's thinking of pointless crap.

Why do I care so much? Why do I lose sleep over these things I cant change while they probably sleep just fine...."
My prescription drug use is out of control,"Hey guys,

Tl;dr is that I have had insomnia since I graduated college.  My first med I took was trazodone at 50mg and that worked great...

Slowly but surely I have been forced to increase dosages and add in other drugs to get sleep.  

If I listed the growth of my drug use this post would be too long to read so I'll just keep this short:

I now have to take: 150mg of seroquel, 1.5mg clonazepam, 100mg trazodone, 100mg hydroxyzone at bedtime. Then I will normally wake up at 3 or 4am at which point I will then take either, 50mg diphenhydramine and 10mg ambien or 1200mg gabapentin.

This is getting absurd and I do not know what to do. I am so groggy every morning that I need coffee and 5mg adderall to fully ""wake up"" before  noon.

I either need a brand new drug that my body isn't used too or I need to go to rehab possibly?  

I need some advice here."

Lunesta work for anyone? Looking for tips,"I’ve tried trazadone, a few other antidepressants (which confuse me because fortunately I haven’t experienced too much depression if any), and for the past 3 months I’ve been on lunesta. Worked like a charm for a few days but that was about the extent of good things I have to say about it. At this point would anyone with similar experience have other insomnia scripts that have helped in similar situations?"
"Oficially diagnosed as insomnia and intrusive thoughts OCD, but boy this is hard.","Hi guys. I've been lurking on some subs for quite a while but decided to finally post my thoughts here, specially after reading how many people are/were experiencing what I've been through. I'd like to apologize in advance for any typos since not only english isn't my mother language, but I've been feeling shittier than ever.

Anxiety and OCD were always inner struggles for me, and I had a very traumatic month last year in August,  which for the first time on my entire life, greatly affected my sleep. At first, I was merely waking several times a night, but not experiencing any kind of sleepiness or fatigue during the day. 

Eventually by september, it escalated to the point I could ''sleep'' for 9 hours and wake up like I hadn't slept at all. It kept going worse and worse, until somewhat stabilized. I feel my approach on exercising had a role on that. I still woke up feeling I hadn't sleep enough, but was tolerable. During this time my OCD kicked in stronger than ever and, as expected, my anxiety also made me paranoid and thinking I had the worst of diseases (Hi, Fatal Insomnia!).

My doc requested a sleep study (which sucked, slept for barely a hour lol) and there it was: my sleep was a disaster. Yeah, no shit, right?

Since then, boy, It's been one hell of a ride. I've been through 4 meds by now, seroquel being the lastest. It does put me to sleep but not only I get the weirdest dreams but also fucks my daytime sleepiness even more, and I feel like a robot sometimes. She says it's temporary and will stabilize. 2 weeks and nothing, yet.

What really sucks, though, is that now my sleep is crappier than ever. I've tested 2 days without taking any meds and I'm getting a very weird tingling behind my eyes sometimes and waking like...10 times a night, again. I'm not much as active as I was back in september so definitely exercise might help again.

For someone who never, NEVER, had any kind of issue sleeping besides OCD and Anxiety since childhood, this sucks. Hard. I think i'll ask for another sleep study to rule out narcolepsy and i'm considering a keto diet to fight my sleepiness. My quality of life has been greatly affected and honestly although there are worst things out there, I don't deserve this and I'll fight it to the very end.
"
Is Insomnia a meditative state?,"I just began one of my typically weeklong insomnia periods (this time I think it was caused by a sudden change in temperature) and I’m noticing something very strange. 

I recently started meditating about two months ago using the mindfulness/breathing technique which has helped me to calm down, and during meditation I’ve gotten to the point where it feels like I’m just thinking about nothing at all and all wandering thoughts are dismissed upon arrival.

Strangely though, I just tried meditating in this state of insomnia and I noticed that I can’t meditate, because it almost feels like I’m already meditating. It feels almost exactly the same as the somewhat-deep meditative state that I’ve experienced during meditation. All my thoughts are destroyed upon instantiation (or at least it feels this way) and I can’t really think about things clearly. 

Obviously it’s not truly meditative because I get hella irritable after a few days but I’m wondering if anyone else has experienced this connection."
dark under eyes,"my eyes are very dark underneath. kind of purple. without makeup i look sick, and with makeup i kind of dry out my skin and it makes me look wrinkly. anyone know any fun remedies or tricks that help them with dark under eyes from lack of sleep?"
Why does my insomnia always resurface the night before a gray/cloudy day?,"I've slowly gotten better at sleeping over the past few years (mostly due to ambien), but every now and then I have a night where I cant sleep at all, even with ambien. 

&#x200B;

It starts close to bedtime where I dont feel tired at all, and take several hours to fall asleep, then after a few hours of sleep, I wake up absurdly early feeling absolutely wired. I go downstairs and see that my father is also awake, unable to sleep.  

&#x200B;

Some hours pass, and the sun comes up, revealing a completely gray sky. Literally every single time. 

&#x200B;

What about the weather causes both me and my father to get worse sleep? Anyone else experience this? "
Sunlight through a window upon waking - beneficial?,"I'm a lifelong sufferer of chronic insomnia, and I've been reading a couple of books that have given me new strategies to cope with it. There was one 3 month period when I was in my early 20's when I was a lifeguard - it was the best I've ever slept in my life, and it gave me a glimpse into how non-insomniacs must feel every day.

What made that job unique was that I was outside, exposed to direct sunlight, for upwards of 8 hours a day. The books I'm reading all say the same thing i.e. exposure to sunlight in the morning and during the day helps keep your body synched up with your circadian rhythm. The book I'm reading currently suggests going for a walk or run when you walk up to get both exercise and sun exposure, but if you can't do that then to sit by a window with the sunlight hitting you.

It currently being winter in the north eastern U.S. going outside in the morning is hell (freezing) but I can easily sit next to a large window with sunlight directly hitting my face. 

After some paranoia about the effectiviness of this I googled around and found a few random articles claiming that sunlight filtered through a window pain doesn't help at all.

I'm apt to believe these books I'm reading and not random articles from no-name websites, but I am now paranoid about whether what I'm doing has proven effective or not.

Can anyone here cite a reputable source for me showing that direct sunlight through a window is, if not as helpful as actually being outside, still really helpful in maintaining your sleep cycle?

Thanks"
I Never Sleep,"I know, a little misleading. But for my whole life, I have had sleep issues.  Whether it’s getting a few hours of sleep a day in increments, Hypnagogia, chronic multiple nightmares and night, Sleep deprivation to where I can’t stay awake but wake up 15 minutes later in panic, Sleep Paralysis, or just all of the above.  Sometimes I have panic attacks from anxiety and I think it has to do with my blood pressure always being off. I’m at the point where I don’t know what to do anymore. I started drinking heavily years ago so I could just pass out. But now I’m trying to cut it out and get sober because I wanna have kids in the next year or two.  Sometimes I live an entire other life in my dreams, sometimes they just haunt in the worst imaginable ways possible...  i’ve never seen a doctor, but I am so scared of pills.  I’m just losin it man."
I finally found something which helps me sleep! It's a dark screen video with the sounds of the ocean...,"I thought I would share something which has been helping me a lot recently. It's a ""Dark Screen"" video on youtube, with sounds of the ocean. It's a video with no video, which sounds a bit ridiculous, but it is actually really convenient...

I go to youtube and play the video. As the screen is black my phone doesn't emit any light even when it's playing. There is a wonderful relaxing sound of the ocean waves with no other background noise (I don't know where they recorded this but there are no cars, planes people, nothing apart from the sound of waves breaking on a sandy beach).

Here's the vid I use, https://youtu.be/\_28E4C881J4 there are other dark screen videos on youtube, but I love the sound of this one, and the best thing about this is that when this video plays there is no advertising, or pop-ups, or any of those other things which can instantly ruin the moment and set you right back to square one!  


I put this on my phone, close my eyes and listen to the waves. I then use a technique I read about a while back which is a kind of meditation, where you relax your body in a very concentrated way, starting with your feet, and progressively working your way up your boady, relaxing your muscles in one area at a time until you reach your head.  


Once I've done that I have fully wound down, and I concentrate on listening to the waves. I try to visualise them in my head and this helps me not think about anything else (Which is the biggest problem I had in the past, I couldn't switch off and lay away thinking for hours). This really helps me so I thought I would share it with you in case it helps anyone else.

Anyone try Dodow?,"I bought one but I'm scared to get off ambien. It makes me feel pretty relaxed, but I get frustrated when I can't just close my eyes and go to sleep."
Split sleeping schedule,"I scheduled all my classes in the mornings 8-12 this semester in the hopes that I could have a normal sleeping pattern, (having a lab 6-9 is absolutely horrid). However after going to class I am absolutely drained and end up inevitably falling asleep sometime in the afternoon after lunch. This has made it so that I can't sleep until 3-4 at night and waking up at 7 hating everything. This has been going on for a couple weeks. Should I just embrace the split system or should I cut out my afternoon siesta? Anyone else do something similar?"
I stayed up all night for the first time in a very long time,"So for the past few weeks I’ve been dealing with sleep anxiety. I used to go to bed early, like fall asleep at 8pm and wake up at 9am the next morning. Now I can’t fall asleep until 3 am on a good night. 

Usually when it hits about the 2am mark I take a sleeping pill (zzzquil) if I don’t feel tired. Tonight I didn’t take anything despite the fact that my mind was racing and I was jumping from thought to thought.  I worked late (until 1am) today and had an anxious night. (I have depression and anxiety comes sometimes too). The stress of the job made negative thoughts come into my mind. Those thoughts chased each other around in circles until I saw my boyfriend. Then I was very happy and energetic. 

When he fell asleep (around 3:15am) I started trying all the tools I know to help fall asleep. But I couldn’t stay focused on any of them long enough for them to actually work. My mind just keeps racing. I feel jittery. 

It’s now 6:30am I just took a shower because I heard that could help you fall asleep sometimes and I started getting bad anxiety because I couldn’t fall asleep and usually showers make me feel better. 

My plan now is to lay down until I fall asleep or until it’s 7am, because then the CVS down the street opens and they sell melatonin. I need to sleep because I have work in a today until late again. 

I just feel very anxious and my stomach is starting to hurt. I also feel like I wanna cry out of frustration. 

Sorry I just need someone to talk to and vent. "
I don't know if I should ask my doctor for Diazepam (Valium),"I've had severe sleep problems all my life and it's gotten worse with PTSD. I get maybe 11-12 hours of sleep per week. I've tried Zopiclone and it was scary as fuck (memory loss) but didn't work. I take clonazepam for anxiety, in .5mg tablets but asked my doctor if I could have 1mg tablets to see if it would make me sleep.

It did not.

I know that Valium is sometimes used for sleep, my friend uses it for that. But I know that doctors are wary about prescribing benzos and I just filled my prescription for clonazepam 1mg on the 20th. So not long ago. I don't want to walk in there, have something written about me that I could be just potentially drug-seeking and close those avenues altogether. Is that something that could happen?

It is HORRIFIC for me right now and I just started two jobs, so I HAVE to sleep!

What do I do?

edit: Before I forget, for some reason people tell me to smoke weed. IT DOES NOT WORK. I've exhausted all natural remedies and my childhood doctor wanted to send me to some special sleep clinic 4 hours from my hometown and my foster parent refused. Trust me. I have tried. Fucking. Everything.

I'm so tired and frustrated rn :("
"Pretty positive I have sleep apnea, going to doctor asap , how long have you had undiagnosed sleep apnea?","For past two years, I have been waking up multiple times during the night. Just recently I’ve been having dreams of choking and waking up with headache and sweaty. Just last night I woke up and couldn’t breathe, then I started thinking how this could lead to my death or a heart attack/stroke then i couldn’t fall back asleep because I was too scared. I know how expensive a sleep study is but I remembered I have a tax return coming next week which I will use to pay the sleep study. How long have any of you had sleep apnea without getting it fixed with a cpap machine? It scares me to think my body could be causing itself harm and I feel helpless at the moment, exhausted..tired. "
Do I have a sleep disorder or no self control?,"I struggle a lot with sleep, I always have. I always feel like theirs better things to do, but then when I finally decide the day is over, 50% of the time I'm not tired. I'll lay down and try, but I never can sleep when I try. Sometimes I just don't get sleepy. This past week I pulled an all nighter because I couldn't sleep, but finally go tired at about 11am or so, and slept for 4 hours and felt fine. Today I'm shooting for a similar pattern it seems, it's nearly 9am and I'm still wired like it's... Some other time when people are usually awake. 
I have pretty poor sleep hygiene, so any tips for that would be great.
But mostly I just doubt there's anything truly wrong with me, and somehow that's my worst fear, is that it's just me being stupid and I could sleep if only I wasn't so stubborn?
Thanks, and blessing to all of you going into the day sleepless."

How would you approach 8 AM recitations with insomnia?,"I'm a grad student, and I was recently assigned to teach 8 AM Monday/Wednesday recitation sections. I was hesitant enough to sign up to take a 9:30 AM Tuesday/Thursday course due to insomnia, but this is so much worse.

&#x200B;

I haven't gotten my insomnia diagnosed yet (though that's a goal this semester), but basically I sometimes just don't sleep until 5 AM or so. Most of time, difficulty falling asleep or the fear of not getting enough sleep because of early morning obligations causes sleep anxiety, and can lead to panic attacks (I'm pretty sure I have both anxiety and insomnia, not just one of them). When this happens, the anxiety and insomnia just feed off each other. If I try to sleep early, that often makes things worse, giving me sleep anxiety because I'm trying to sleep but can't, and in the end making me sleep less. So If I have to wake up at 7 AM for classes, it's often better to just try to sleep at 1 or 2 AM than say 11 PM because I'm less likely to have trouble falling asleep, at least on my current sleep schedule. I haven't really figured out how to move my sleep schedule earlier because of this, but I suppose I could try explicitly overexhausting myself and then sleeping early, but that has a risk of being overexhausted and THEN not sleeping.  


So I'm trying to figure out how to best approach this. Should I try to shift my sleep schedule (which is extra hard because I'm about to move to a timezone 3 hours ahead), or just accept some nights will be crappy? If I try to shift my sleep schedule, I'm worried it just simply won't work and just cause unnecessary anxiety and sleeplessness. If it works, I won't be able to do things like hang out with friends late (and by late I only mean like midnight), because that could throw it off and I'd have to start over. But doing things like that is just a part of my lifestyle, and I would hate not being able to go out like that.  


On the other hand, it doesn't seem particularly healthy to just submit to getting less sleep the nights before my recitation. It will probably take a toll on my teaching abilities, and could significantly decrease my productivity for the entire day. As a grad student, submitting to that kind of routine would be extremely difficult and hinder my research (which is the most important part of my degree). In this case, I also might have to drop my 9:30 AM Tuesday/Thursday class to ensure I can get sleep on other days, even though I'm very excited for that class, and it might be relevant to future research I do.  


I know you guys can't answer this for me, but does anyone have any thoughts? Any similar experiences? I'm planning on getting a therapist to help me with this, but I probably won't be able to get an appointment for awhile. So I guess I'm on my own for a bit. And for the cherry on top: this is my first winter in a truly cold and snowy place, so walking to school in the morning will be horrible. Thanks for the help!"
This is silly but it’s 4 am and I’m crying because I can’t sleep,"I feel really dumb for crying over such a petty reason but I have work in three hours and I work until 9pm. Now I don’t want to sound pessimistic but it feels like this day won’t be a good one. Again. Wow. 

Aaaaaaaaaa 


[Small edit; Just wanted to thank you all for being so kind and understanding. I’ll try to be less hard on myself.]"
Does blue filter help you guys with sleep?,"I often use my phone before bed just to set alarm, check social media, reddit, etc.

Correlation between sleep quality and potatoes,"Hello my insomniac friends. I made a very interesting discovery today. I have very inconsistent sleep patterns... I go through phases where I'll only get 4 hours of sleep a night, and then phases where I'll sleep somewhat normally. I started to take inventory of what I was doing/eating during these phases and discovered that one of the only differences is that during my good sleep phases, I eat a lot of potatoes.

Sometimes I buy big bags of red potatoes and eat a few (boiled) every day. I'm a broke student so it's a way to save money while also staying healthy. They're also very filling. But sometimes I don't buy potatoes and guess what happens? My sleep turns to shit. 

My guess is that I have a deficiency of some kind that is being corrected by the potatoes. I did some research and found  some articles about how potassium relaxes muscles and increases seratonin. So maybe those are factors? 

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. I just wanted to add, exercise has also helped my insomnia a lot overall, so I can't give potatoes all the credit. "
Mom insomniacs! Was the newborn stage THE BEST SLEEP OF YOUR LIFE?,"Now that new motherhood has calmed down and my son sleeps through mostly, my 4am insomnia is back full force. When he was newborn, was literally the only time in my life that I fell asleep as I hit the pillow. Ugh."
"An N=1 experiment with CBD/THC sublingual, 20:1-- subjective experience and data.","* I track my sleep with an AppleWatch and auto sleep (highly recommend both if you want to take a data-driven approach to solving your sleep problems). 
* For transparency, I take low-dose (2.5mg) methylphenidate (stimulant) and I drink absolutely no caffeine which may affect my results, so YMMV. 
* Subjectively, it was great. I often have anxiety from even light doses of THC, and generally don't take it. With this high-ratio CBD blend drops, I felt full body-relaxation within \~30 minutes of dosing. Akin to light doses of a muscle relaxant, perhaps. 
* I usually get about 5 hours of quality sleep, this gave me 5:20
* My sleep onset (time in bed before falling asleep) was much shorter than it usually is. (\~25 minutes vs 1.5-2 hours)
* I also stayed asleep continuously longer than I'm usually capable of. I usually wake up every 3.5-4 hours, but on CBD blend I was able to stay asleep for 5 continuous. 
* \*I had vivid dreams, but despite this, my sleep monitor picked up \_0 hours of deep sleep\_.\*
* This part is a curious result, and makes me wonder if my sleep was restless or disturbed in some way. These results strongly suggest that I skipped through NREM stage directly into REM, which would make sense given the vivid memory of my dreams.
* Next day subjective
   * I felt alert and rested upon waking, but noticed a substantial cognitive hit and extreme fatigue that worsened throughout the day. 
   * As a weight lifter, I am particularly aware of my stage 4 sleep (""NREM""/""Deep"") which seemed to have suffered the most from the drug. Stage 4 is the part of the cycle that promotes hormone regulation and performs much of the self-healing and hypertrophy (tissue growth) in the body.  I noticed that my exercised muscles felt residual soreness unusual for me, performed poorly at the gym and had not recovered to the extent that they usually do.
   * I also woke up sleeping on my hand and pressing it into numbness, which is unusual for me, seeming to suggest deeper sleep, so it's possible that altered heart rate could've affected the HRM's interpretation of my sleep cycle. 
* I'll continue to report on this, because CBD is an interesting solution to me. I actually meant to post this yesterday but had to leave before submitting. Will submit a separate report for a two day trial of pure sublingual CBD. "

I've suffered with actual insomnia since I was 16, being diagnosed with various disorders and prescribed with, as previously mentioned, everything from seroquel to ambien; ambien seems to actually help. 

I am with someone now who doesn't trust in pharmaceuticals to be a permanent, long-lasting solution to my problem; I've agreed in the past. Now I'm experiencing this intense night sweats that eventually has become only-when-I'm-asleep sweats. It does not seem to matter what I dream about, if there is any sort of conflict or turmoil in my waking life, my sleeping self is just a wet mess. 

I find myself 2, 3, 4, 5x a night waking up to find myself saturated in my own sweat, having to change clothes. That in itself wouldn't be awful but I'm sweating enough in my sleep to make my sheets wet to the touch, dripping wet. I recently lost my job due to, in so many words, my panic attacks and while I have no real responsibilities right now, my anxiety is through the roof while my self-image and sense of self-worth has plummeted.

I haven't had restful sleep in weeks; it has been two weeks since I've woken up in the middle of the night drenched in my own sweat. 

It's become a strain on my relationship; I just recently moved in with what I believe to be the girl of my dreams only to right around that time lose my job. I suffer from crippling anxiety and other various disorders and this job was a god-send but I was fired and now everything is uncertain. 

I just want to sleep. I just want 5 hours of full,restful sleep without waking up. I'm just about ready to try the Dark Web for something as my actual current physician is reluquent to prescribe my Ambien, which I'd been prescribed multiple times in the past by my previous physician before I moved. 

It's effecting my partner now, too, as I keep her up each night with the various things I do to try to keep my mind occupied and to try and fall asleep. "
Sleep scares me,"Its 3 am here on the west coast. I have to be to work at 8. I've been trying to sleep but no luck.  So I've had quite a few head injuries and the last few years my biggest fear has been going to sleep and than becoming a vegetable.  
I've always had insomnia. My mother used to give me nyquil or anything just so I would be able to sleep. I remember her sacraficing sleep so she could drive me around all night. Something about car rides just knock me out. My ex used to drive me around. She isn't around anymore. Since she passed I have slept less, hit my head more and found I'm more paranoid.  Yes I see a therapist and yes we are working on it. However I wanted to tell a bunch of strangers. Why? no idea.  Anyone sleep less after head injuries? "
Someone awake?,"I feel fucking horrible, I don't know why but when I start falling asleep my heart starts pumping faster as if I didn't want to sleep because I might have a nightmare, I don't know how to describe the feeling, it's is like I can't stop thinking of a danger and I need to be awake, my brain hurts and I'm scared. 


I don't know if I have some serious problem but I can't stop thinking about getting to bed for the rest of the day because I'm scared of this feeling, I think I'm going insane"
Death is bittersweet,"As an atheist, I believe after we die we cease to exist. Our consciousness, spirit, soul, or mind do not carry on. There is no afterlife. Death is comforting because it means that this torture will end. In fact, I HOPE there isn't an afterlife because what if this continues on or is some kind of eternal punishment? At the same time, part of me fears death and wishes there was an afterlife because I want to be able to see my loved ones again. I want to be with my SO for eternity, but if it means I'll always suffer the way I am in this life then I really don't know.

Sometimes I wish I never fell in love or cared about anyone because maybe then I wouldn't be arguing with myself so much in my head. I'm sleep deprived. Got 2 hours last night. Sorry if this sounds ridiculous."
How do you get up in the morning?,"Hey everyone.

Same as all of you, I've got major problems falling asleep, staying asleep & actually getting restful sleep. I find the hardest part of the day is getting out of bed. All I want to do is go back to sleep. Not sure if it's because I didn't actually get any REM sleep that night, or I'm too comfortable & it's too cold to get out of bed, but... it's affecting my life. I'm often late to work & spend most of the weekends sleeping in till 2. And I don't stay up all night either. I try to go to bed at 10 pm every night so I can get up for work at 6 am. Melatonin is hit or miss, as I'm sure you know. Strong sleeping pills make it almost impossible to get up in the morning because I'm so groggy. 

&#x200B;

How do you folks get out of bed in the morning after a restless night? (besides a coffee IV drip - I already drink too much coffee)"
Who get extrasystole from sleep deprivation ?,"Hey guys,

It’s 4:30am here and it’s like 4 days a week where my brain didn’t remember how to fall asleep 😴.

Do you get extrasystole when you haven’t slept enough or feeling tired.

It’s a side effect is sleep deprivation for me and really ruin my life.

I always feel I’m functioning at 40% of my capacity. 

Strange life for us people...

Good luck "
Don't know wherelse to post this,"It not so much that I have a form of insomnia but its my sleep schedule that is really really inconsistent. I have to balance school but I just slept for 2-3 hours and almost everything in my life happened. I really need something to either lock me down or keep me awake just for about 2 hours. That's all I needed to stay up for. Any help?

Oh my GOD,"Uhhhhh why..... can’t.... I ..... go .... to ....sleeeeeeep

halp,i’ve always had severe anxiety & insomnia. it’s 5 am here & i have to be at work at 7 am. haven’t slept at all due to being up sick all night and worrying. obviously calling out in an hour or so but it always makes me nervous :( does anyone else get this way?!
"Sleeping medication may be causing dangerous adverse reactions, taken off of it","Wowee oh gosh. My first post here. I’m a woman in my mid 20’s, have had insomnia for as long as I can remember. After a year of a disrupted circadian rhythm in my late teens, I was prescribed a sleep aid. Without it, I’d go 2-4 nights no sleep. 

I had been relying on that to grasp at what little sleep I could/can get for the last few years. As of late though and a lot of blood taken, my doctor decided to pull me off of said sleep aid. Y’all, I woke up the last few mornings after the worst sleep in a long time, feeling like I was hungover with the flu, after running a 5k marathon. 

Now I hop off of the train to sleepy time junction, no longer shall I enjoy feeling slightly rested. I’ve returned to the land of looking stoned all the time from bloodshot, droopy eyes and dark circles on par with being bruised and feeling too heavy to function. ...and 4-6 cups of coffee a day. 

Side note, who else here always feel on the edge of dozing off at most hours of the day, but can never quite seem to ACTUALLY doze off? Even stumbling from drifting off a bit but if you were to lay down, and try to sleep, nada. 

Thanks to anyone who read my rambling"
"My personal story, ending insomnia/narcolepsy shame, and some reading material.","Hey all,

**(Skip to the TLDR's if you don't want to read the whole thing)**

Personal story first.

I've suffered from chronic insomnia all of my life. It had a debilitating effect on my ability to perform academically through the time I graduated high school. College was the first time I was able to excel academically almost entirely because it was the first time I had an incredibly flexible schedule - I woke up pretty much whenever I wanted, I spent almost all of my time in social interactions with friends or classmates, and I spent much of my time outside (sunlight being the major factor for keeping your circadian rhythm in tact).

Since leaving college about a decade ago, I've found that the lifestyle of a career professional has been much closer to 1st - 12th grade than to college in terms of how conducive it is to sleeping well. You can't wake up whenever you want when you need to be in the office by 9. If you're a PMer (someone who's genetically predispositioned to waking up a little bit later in the morning) employers couldn't care less. Suddenly you spend all of your day (and often much of your night) staring at tech devices that blare wakefulness-inducing blue light into your eyes. Suddenly the ability to excersize on a daily basis becomes a struggle - in college it's easy to pop into the gym every day between or after classes - when you have a 9 - 6 job plus a commute, it can be a challenge. Arguably most important of all, you lose your freedom to spend your time outside, bathed in the sunlight that keeps you and your circadian rhythm in perfect harmony - instead, many of us spend our time in dim offices, hidden from sunlight, the sun having gone down by the time we venture outside, and instead spend the night in our homes in full (artificial) light.

None of this will be news to anyone browsing an insomnia subreddit.

**TLDR - The work life of many modern, career professionals are not conducive to sleeping well.**

All of that said, my career over the past 8 years had, at times, suffered heavily because of my insomnia. One of the worst aspects of it was how little control I felt I had over the my condition. Our culture and our media alike consider/portray people who need special sleep considerations, who take naps, who are often sleepy, etc as lazy, and as having personal failings. People who naturally have no issues with sleep are praised for a state of being that they never had to fight to achieve. It's all felt incredibly unfair to me at times.

Two years ago I started what should have been my dream job. It was, at first, until I started managing a few new (but natural) stressors in my life, and suddenly my insomnia (as it always does) immediately became 10 times worse. I had also started the job mid-Spring, so my first 5 months in the job were in the hot, sunny parts of the year, during which managing my insomnia is always a bit easier (I'll try to spend as much time outside as I can during these months, which goes a long ways towards helping keep my natural sleep clock on track). New projects and a new relationship combined just as winter was kicking in to create a perfect insomnia-storm.

It took me another year of suffering, but after my then-partner encouraged me repeatedly to take my mental health more seriously, and after starting a kick of reading books on the neuroscience of sleep, I decided to start taking ownership of my condition. 

I'd undergone a sleep study at a hospital a few years earlier. It lasted all night and into the afternoon the following day, and they diagnosed me with narcolepsy. To this day I'm somewhat skeptical of that diagnosis, but the point was that I had a medically diagnosed sleep condition. I was also seeing a sleep specialist at the time who, after multiple consultations, agreed I was suffering from chronic insomnia.

Point being, I had a medical condition. If I had any other medical condition that left me utterly physically, emotionally, and mentally debilitated at times, especially if I don't manage it, I would garner sympathy from friends/family and understanding and accommodations (ideally) from employers. But as I said earlier, our culture tends to frown on people with insomnia and often chalks them up as lazy. After some careful thought I decided to stop suffering in silence.

**TLDR - My career suffered for years due to insomnia, and I kept my condition largely hidden from friends, family and employers**

First, during my weekly one-on-one with the director of my team, I matter-of-factly informed him that I have a medical condition, that it isn't life threatening, but that I have medically diagnosed narcolepsy and chronic insomnia, that I see a specialist and have had this condition my whole life. I told him that it might just mean that I need to take the occasional mental health day and keep a somewhat more flexible schedule to help me manage the condition. I also told him that I have the condition managed, and that it generally has no impact on my work beyond needing an occasional mental health day to recover if I'm going through a period of time when it's temporarily become worse than usual. 

To my relief, he reacted the same way that I imagine he would have if I had described suffering from a different medical condition - he was very understanding, he thanked me for letting him know, he expressed some honest but polite curiosity about my condition, and told me to please take a mental health day when I needed to and to let him know if there was anything else he could do to help.

Since then I've maintained a fairly flexibly work schedule and I'll take the occasional mental health day when things get bad. That director left my organization a few months ago, and this time, rather than waiting, I had the same conversation with my new director right away - the conversation went the exact same way. She was understanding, offered to help any other ways if I needed it, and was politely curious.

**TLDR - I finally took ownership of my medical condition, informed my employers, and everything went very well**

Not hiding my condition anymore and informing people I know that it's a serious condition has led to me feeling much more confident about my ownership over my sleep. Over the past six months I've started reading a few books related to sleep efficiency and not getting a sufficient amount of sleep that I'd recommend everyone read.

These two are fairly well known, so there's a good chance you've all already heard of them or read them, but in case you haven't:

1) Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams 

This book by neuroscientist and professor of psychology at UC Berkely, Matthew Walker, delves exhaustively into some of the most recent research on understanding why we sleep, what we gain from sleep, and what we lose when we don't sleep enough. I'd highly recommend starting with this book to understand how high the stakes are when we think about our insomnia. It outlines in detail the deleterious effects on our mental, emotional, and physical health when we don't get enough sleep.

2) Sleep: The Myth of 8 Hours, the Power of Naps... and the New Plan to Recharge Your Body and Mind.

This short and highly accessibly book by professional athlete sleep trainer Nick Littlehales is written with the intent to help train yourself to sleep as efficiently as the athletes that he trains. I'd highly recommend reading Why We Sleep prior to, or in conjunction with, this book. I found myself taking copious notes while reading it and am now trying out the sleep strategies that he explains in the book myself. Based on the title I was skeptical going in (worried it would advise the fact-free, mythological strategy of sleeping 2 hours a night and scattering naps all day), but I've found it incredibly helpful. The author doesn't wield pseudo-science or fake, ""here's how to sleep in 30 minute increments 4 times a day and day and live forever!"" mantras. The advice is factual, practical, instructive, and achievable for anyone who wants to give his advice a shot. As the author openly states, he is neither a doctor, not psychologist, nor neuroscienctist (for that you need to read Why We Sleep), but he is acutely familiar with the most recent science on sleep and therefore makes no outlandish claims. I couldn't recommend this book more, it's been a life saver for me personally - and this is coming from someone with a lifetime of insomnia and who's tried a thousand strategies already.

**TLDR - If you're suffering from insomnia I recommend reading the two aforementioned books, in the order I listed them**

My insomnia is nowhere near ""cured,"" but after taking ownership of it and being unafraid to let me condition be known, I've found myself more optimistic than I have been in a long time. If you suffer from chronic insomnia or narcolepsy yourself, I couldn't encourage more that you take ownership of it, understand it's a serous medical condition, and don't be afraid to request accommodations when necessary. The more of us that do, the more normalized it will become.

Thanks for reading

**TLDR - Don't be ashamed or hide your medical condition if you have chronic insomnia or narcolepsy**"
I wrote this poem in an r/funny comment a few weeks ago. I thought it would fit better here.,"

Once in a while

I'll feel like a smile,

But then my mind thinks

About all my mistakes and all of my kinks.


It goes to dark places

All by itself in the night

It goes to places

That give me a fright 


Instead I sit with a frown 

With thoughts to run from my town

And try my life again

But I'm scared of new friends


People to open up to,

People who may help.

People that would want 

To listen to me welp.


But no one really listens,

No one really cares.

If I told them my feelings

I would just get blank stares.


They'll all try to fix me

Tell me to relax and chill,

Maybe the doctor will give me a pill


I don't want a pill, to him I will say

I just want someone to tell me I'm okay

That the past is the past, 

And I'm doing fine now,

That I can move through the stuff

My mind wont allow.


Even my parents pretend 

to be joyful and happy

But If i dont follow

They get rather snappy 



I'll try to be happy, 

and turn my frown upside down,

But even doing things I enjoyed 

Still leave me with a void


With no one to listen

With nothing to do

All I do is sit here

And write this for you


Maybe time will make me better

It's said it can heal any wound

If I can just hang around

To finding a meaning so profound 



Until that time comes

I'll be alone through the night 

At least my dog's here, so I'll feel alright.


Edit: woah! thank you for my first gold on my first poem!

Please help ... any experience with Trimipramine or Quazepam?,"Can anyone share experiences with trimipramine or quazepam for insomnia?  Especially treatment-resistant or medication-induced insomnia?  Or suggestions for lesser-known more obscure sleep medications?

Trimipramine looks sedating with less likelihood of weight gain and a long half-life.  Quazepam (a benzo) isn't ideal, but it has a long half-life and is more selective for the hypnotic GABA receptors than other benzos.

I'm struggling hard.  Even if I can drug myself to sleep, I wake up 4-6 hours later and have been resorting to zolpidem (Ambien) to get 8 hours.

Many drugs are too weak ... benadryl, unisom, hydroxyzine, clonidine etc.

The drugs which have worked have caused munchies and weight gain ... mirtazapine (Remeron), quetiapine (seroquel) and even trazodone. 

I tried 15mg temazepam, but I still experienced early awakening, plus rebound anxiety the next day ... I don't want to keep increasing the dose and become physically dependent.  Same reason I don't think triazolam is a good option.

Right now I'm using lemon balm extract, trazodone, lorazepam, 10mg zolpidem + 5mg mid-sleep and still not sleeping well."
I've gotten only 5 hours of sleep the past 4 days,"as soon as I lay down my heart rate spikes and I get super hot, making it impossible to sleep. Help :("
Slowly beating my insomnia,"After months of 4 hour nights on weekdays, I am sleeping more and with fewer interruptions. I've been focusing on destressing sleep and it has made some positive changes. I also stopped eating in my bed, I moved my PS4 to our living room and while I do play on my phone in my bed, I try to not look at my clock if I elwake up in the middle of the night. I have also been exercising more frequently and eating better.

I feel bad saying this but my depression helped. Seriously, if I need 20 hours of sleep I let my depression take over. That shit has made me sleep entire days away.

I'm not back to the 6 & 1/2 hours I need a night but I'll get there. Stay strong everyone."
My sleeping was fine until that fat bitch attacked me,"Yes, you read that title right. I am a 19 year old young woman. I am intelligent, driven, ambitious, and am actually trying to make something out of myself.

My ""sister"" on the older hand, is an illiterate, ignorant, emotionally unstabled, bully in her thirties. About 6 months ago, she came to our house (my mother and I) with a very nasty attitude.

I tried to pay it no attention, but she insisted on making an argument (because that is what bullies do). She then threatened to ""slap the shit out of me"" and then eventually she charged at me and pushed me down. 

Mind you, I am 5'5 and 140 pounds. She is 5'7 and 270, so the push carried a lot of force and I fell pretty hard. 

Although, I didn't hit me head. I still feel as though something slipped or was triggered that day, because ever since then, I had this chronic sleeping problem.

I am tired, weak, and my head hurts. It is very hard to concentrate. I am in college and going to school is hell, because I literally have to force my brain to focus.

I initially didn't disclose this to my social worker when I went to see her Tuesday, but I am definitely disclosing this to the Therapist I see today, because there might be something seriously wrong with my brain. 

If something is seriously wrong with my brain, I have no other choice but to press charges. This chronic sleep disorder is finally affecting my every day life. And I feel that soon, it will only get worse.

Wife can't stay asleep - any suggestions?,"I hope this post is welcome here. I'm looking for advice because I'm completely at a loss for what I'm supposed to do.

My wife has always been a very light sleeper. The slightest noise wakes her and she is unable to go back to sleep. I've been sleeping separately from her for years now and even with that she still has trouble falling asleep and staying asleep.

We recently moved back in with my parents to take care of them (they are both ill, one terminally so). This has only served to exacerbate the problem as there are more \[sick\] people making noise at night in her vicinity. We took her to a doctor and she was diagnosed with insomnia. It was a huge 'a-hah' moment for us like of course it was insomnia the whole time but now we are navigating the solutions - so far with little luck. The generic form of ambien didn't help. Rozerem didn't help either. Now we're on to trazodone with fingers crossed. I guess I should mention she has tried exercise in the past and it never made a difference. I've also ordered some noise-cancellation earplugs since her major issue seems to be waking up to sounds at night, but I seem to remember a few years back she tried that and it didn't work either.

If anyone has any success stories or suggestions I'd really appreciate it. Thank you all in advance! Also, my apologies for barging in on your sub without doing any lurking first."
Insomnia or just my brain resetting?,"I have found that the past 2 nights I have these very vivid dreams. They end with some massive plot twist that I cannot recall. Then I wake up feeling like I was in deep sleep (REM) then I am awake for not long..and  fall asleep again..rinse and repeat. From what I have read on sleep cycles..we go through 4 stages and about 4 times a night. This matches my experience when sleeping lately..but my question is, is it normal to wake up each time the sleep cycle restarts itself from REM to stage 1? or is that low grade insomnia?

Fed up with my sleeping issues.,"I am writing this at 3AM as I have a job interview which I have to be up at 6AM for. I can function on no sleep because I have learned to so I am not worried.

For the past couple of years I have struggled to fall asleep early. If it's before 2AM I definitely cannot sleep and usually end up sleeping at 4 or 5AM. Throughout university I have had many sleepless nights. I attributed it to stress. However even after not sleeping for an entire day, I will still have difficulty falling asleep the next night, on no sleep. I avoided this problem by setting all my classes to later times so that I can get a full night's sleep. This has been great. But now I'm graduated and I am expected to be up at the crack of dawn for things.

I have taken melatonin to help me sleep sometimes, for an exam for example. And it helped. However this night I took 2 melatonin sublingual tablets and after 5 hours of laying in bed I still cannot sleep although my eyes and eyelids are tired.

I don't know what to do and I don't want to get prescribed sleeping medication because those do more harm than good from my research (I just graduated with my bsc and one of my profs is a neurobiology phd and she only had bad things to say about sleeping pills when I talked to her about my issues).

I have tried countless times to reset my sleeping schedule. Staying up all night and then going to sleep at 9pm or so. But I will still sleep in the next day even if I go to bed early, thus making me go to sleep late again.

I don't know what to do and I could really use some advice. "
Special insomnia,For the past 2 years I've had massive problems sleeping when I know I've to get up early the next day for let's say a lecture. Most of the times I don't even sleep at all when this happens. Does anyone relate/know how to cope with this?  
Why does it take me an hour to fall asleep my whole life?,"My whole life I have had this ""problem"", I haven't really considered it a problem until recently. I'm 20 now and sometimes I just want to fall asleep fast, but my body never does. Never in my life have I fallen asleep in under 30 minutes unless I took a pill or was drunk off my ass. What is there to do? I already take too much medication I don't want to add another pill to my daily routine. I exercise almost every day four 2 hours in the gym, I drink my last coffee at 3 PM. 

This is my current routine: Go to bed at around 10pm on weekdays, watch TV for 3-4 hours, try to sleep at 1 AM and only fall asleep around 2AM. Wake up at 10AM. I also have restless leg syndrome but it only bothers me when I'm sitting not in bed. Anyone have any ideas? I tried white noise, it doesn't work I can't sleep with it on."

... I can't sleep... Stop me if you've heard this one before.,"So as of two weeks ago my personal trainer is having problems sleeping, and may be going through random panic attacks.

It makes me question the possibility of some environmental element effecting our sleep. I have had issues for over a decade, but in the last 3 years I have seen an extensive amount of discussion regarding sleep loss.

Perhaps it has something to do with the poles shifting.

&#x200B;

I suffer from sleep issues.. Used to have Insomnia. But since I have not been employed for awhile, I always fall asleep at some point.

&#x200B;

My situation is fun. I have to manage chronic pain + restless leg issues along with it which only pops up when I lay in bed.

&#x200B;

I have sort of developed a routine. Was experiencing sleep hangovers from the med and have made an adjustment.

My routine now is at 9pm I am taking a scullcap vitamin, plus 250mg of Magnesium Glycinate. I also take half an immovaine (zopilcone - which I have just started using again but am not going to take every day), and I take a 10mg of amitryptiline.

From there I smoke some concentrate before bed. Eat half a cookie, and then the rest of the cookie (edible) right before I fall asleep.

If I do not time it right, and I am not asleep within an hour my legs start aching and then I have to get out of bed and smoke more concentrate. This usually ends up waking my mind up. Recently someone mentioned CBD concentrate for sleep and that it worked for them - that is next to try.

And this is where we are now.

&#x200B;

Hopefully my legs will be quiet long enough that I can fall asleep.

Is melatonin over the counter ?,
Anxiety or sleep apnea?,"Hi all! I've recently come down with a very odd sleeping problem! It started Sunday night so I am on day three of this. Basically what happens is that right before I fall asleep and my body is relaxed, I unknowingly stop breathing and my heart begins to race to like crazy triggering an adrenaline rush that wakes me all the way up. These episodes are very scary and feel like I'm having mini heart attacks. It doesn't help that it was happening EVERY time I almost fell asleep each night. I know it sounds like apnea but there is no obstruction in my throat or nose that could cause this. I am worried it might be central sleep apnea but the sudden onset is very concerning.

Of course as you can imagine this has caused horrible sleep and high anxiety. Sunday night I got around six hours which is actually pretty normal, Monday I got five though but now I'm down to four. My chest and diaphragm feel tight and sore, breathing feels very weird right now even standing and walking around. My body is VERY reactive to my anxiety though as i CANNOT fall asleep when my tinnitus spikes. I have no history or heart or breathing problems although on random rare occasions I will catch myself holding my breath if I'm concentrating or exerting myself.

I've had this happen twice only in the past, and only when I was very stressed. My only prior stress cause was money but that's been resolving itself over time. So now I get to be worried about sleep and breathing/heart problems. I work anywhere between 8-10 hours a day so I NEED my sleep. Going about my day as a walking zombie at a warehouse is no good! If you guys have any advice that would be much appreciated. 

Oh I should mention I do have health insurance and have read that many insurance companies cover sleep studies and CPAP machines but I have very little time to go to the doctor. I am worried I will get no sleep during a study and then the next day at work will be terrible. I am doubtful they do these on the weekends.

TL:DR: sudden onset of potential sleep apnea has me worried!

I didn't get any sleep at all ... Then i made up for it during my classes,"All day my body was such a wreck, i was so sleep deprived.

I sleep better when I'm depressed,"Hello,

It's 2 AM and I can't fall asleep though I really tried. I should be up by 6:30 which leaves me with 4 hours of sleep at best or avoiding school tommorow which might lead to me getting kicked out eventually but I'd rather sleep for as long as I can so I am able to function for a longer period of time (and I had some issues with probably?? a low blood pressure yesterday and I almost passed out and it's more likely to happen when I am sleep deprived and I don't want to feel like that tommorow).

While trying to fall asleep, I found out there might be a pattern in my sleeping habits. When I am depressed, I usually feel numb and I have no problems to fall asleep unless I'm very anxious but that's rare when I am in the depression state. But when I feel okay, maybe even too excited and hype for no reason, I can't fall asleep if my life depended on it. Like now.

Does anyone else have a similiar experience? I just mostly need to vent."
Up at 3:20 with a date tomorrow,Girls love wired guys with black bags under their eyes lmao fuck me right
Trazodone: Yay or nay?,"My doctor mentioned me trying Trazodone again. I did try it once a while ago but it made me feel a bit too groggy and heart was racing a bit. Might have just been anxiety idk but I've heard it can cause some pretty bad side effects and generally, I don't want to have to rely on pills and thinking I might just try to be natural.. What have your experiences been with this medication? "
Question about delayed sleep syndrome,Is it something you are born with or develop later in life?
Anemia?,"I've always had a *little* trouble falling asleep, maybe laying there for an hour, but never before like this. 

A week ago (since it's Wednesday now, even though I went to bed on Tuesday....) I got out of the hospital, where I had been for 5 days getting treated for severe anemia. I was in critical condition and needed a couple of blood transfusions. 

Since I've gotten out I have been having a really hard time falling asleep. I normally go to bed between 9pm and 11pm but this last week I've been falling asleep between 11pm and 3am! I get up at 6:30am for work, so these hours are not doing it for me. Plus, I'm already super tired from the hospitalization and anemia. 

Anyway, has anyone found that anemia can cause insomnia? This article sort of says that could be true: https://www.livestrong.com/article/517941-lack-of-iron-insomnia/

Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

Can't sleep because my body does stuff,"Hello, I hope I find someone who has the same problem and maybe has a solution or at least a reason why my body does what it does.


It started last year after I was very I'll for a month. I started doing stuff and sports and suddenly at night when I wanted to sleep I got this really hard heartbeat and maybe some faster heartbeats (I felt they were hard and flat) plus I have to pee every half an hour and not just have to but I do pee a lot.


This was so bad that I couldn't sleep at all for several days. After a few days I started hallucinating and randomly crying or screaming and dreaming of murder the people around me.

I got an ecg at the doctors office and an ultrasound of my heart. Everything is OK. Thyroid seems okay too. Then after a while it went away and I decided maybe it was from my illness.


The first weekend of January it started again. Got prescribed melatonine and heard ""it's normal it is just stress"". Melatonin didn't help because I am tired as fuck but the hammering in my chest keeps me from sleeping.


Then it went away. Sadly after only two weeks (last Friday) it started again. I am absolutely sure that it is something physiological because I have an active life, nearly no stress, a strong support system and am overall just happy with my life. 


Please, has anyone the same symptoms? I am tired of doctors telling me ""go do sports"". Sorry I did so four times last week. And I do sports hard. Maybe it is something food related? Or hormones? It is hard to not give up when the doctors don't take one seriously...."
Evolution could be why we dont sleep. I believe it,"This article explains it well, and I really believe this is part of the reason I am awake in the middle of the night.

Hello,"Its 5am.

For the past week and a half ive been falling asleep at 4am. Should i just stay up all day now to try and fix it. Ive taken a propranolol about and hour ago to try n slow my thoughts Nd heart but still nothing and i’d take a valium but my doc only gives me a short script per month for GAD and im out till monday.

any ideas (: thnx"
"I was skeptical, but I've had some early success with CBN+CBD","After trying lots of things both natural/OTC (meditating, indica dominant weed, melatnonin, unisom) and prescription (Ambien, doxepin) I looked into CBD which lead me to CBN. Smoking an indica dominant strain didn't seem to help me much- it still tended to make my mind a little busy. I'm no scientist, but apparently your body processes THC into CBN which is the part that makes you tired.

My cousin told me about this product called Gossamer Dusk which is a full spectrum CBD oil with especially high levels of CBN. They've got a spiffy website full of information, it could be junk science for all I know but sounded plausible so I gave it a shot.

I've used it three times now and the first two nights I slept for 7 hours (!!) which hasn't happened in ages. I definitely felt a sedating and calming effect, but obviously it's subtle because it's not a psychoactive. Last night it wasn't quite as effective and I only got around 5 hours, but I blame that on having to work until late which always throws me off.

I've also been trying to do 30 minutes of cardio a day to make myself more physically tired which I think is helping. I'll check back here in a week or so and let you guys know how it's going, but wanted to share my excitement with good results so far!

Weighted blanket has saved me,"I bought a mosaic weighted blanket. I’ve slept through the night 4 nights in a row, and feel so much calmer with the pressure. They’re expensive, but have a 7 day return if you need to use it. A week of good sleep is worth hundreds and this thing has been a savior "
Insomnia/fatigue,"I went to a sleep study and found out I have chronic insomnia. But its not the insomnia that keeps you up at night, its the kind where its in the middle of the night, and I don't even wake up. So there is not much I can consciously do about it, except right before I go to bed, but that wouldn't increase the quality of sleep.

My therapist thinks its probably my anxiety. She may be right--in part. But I can't take medication for anxiety because it is a downer, it makes me more sleepy. So to take care of my anxiety means I have to take care of it through therapy, which is ok.

So I tried making my life more structured. Its fairly recent. I'm trying to avoid naps during the day (usually, if there is a lot going on, my body just shuts down, its not really a choice). Im drinking more water. Im going to eat more by making meals for the next day and a half, so I have no excuse to miss my breakfast. I am trying to make myself do so much during the day that when it comes nighttime I knock out. All of these have helped--in the short term.

This past week, I managed to make everything I have to do efficient. Streamlined the homework, the chores, the food intake. It all worked. It was meant to allow me to hang out with some friends for a whole day. And I did. It was amazing, I missed them so much. It was on Sunday.

I was exhausted yesterday, but I pulled through with some work. I avoided a nap that I really really wanted, and I fell asleep at 1am, not 2. But this morning, when I woke up, everything was wrong. My whole body felt like it had sunk into my mattress. I feel weak. I have a headache. My eyes hurt. I'm trying to get myself to move faster and take care of important responsibilities so that I don't have to buy groceries very late at night, but I don't know what's going on. And its disheartening. I feel mentally more excited because I had a fun time two days ago, but its all wrong. I tried to get up but fell asleep on the couch. How can this be sustainable?

Sorry if this is long. I should be doing work, but I needed to do this. I'm really tired, I got to get enough done. Idk."
Insomnia after hard training sessions,"Hi everyone,

I am training muay thai and other forms of full contact sports since over ten years. And since then I have a problem, I wanted to share. Maybe someone else has it too, or has a solution for it. After hard training-sessions, or sparring which worsens the problem, I can't fall asleep for ages. I lay in bed, my mind is in a state of delirium, but my body keeps me awake. I have tried drinking a lot of water, eating earlier or taking a bath, but all of it hasn't really helped. The only thing that seems to work are mild sleeping pills or drinking alcohol. Both are not my preferred solutions, but the only ones that work. I asked around in my gym, there are some other folks who have this form of insomnia, too, and don't know what to do about it.

Does anyone else have the same problem or maybe even has a solution? Or is there a doctor who knows about this?"
I CAN'T SLEEP!!!!,"I can't sleep and everyone around me acts like they don't fucking get it! For the past 6 months, I have having trouble falling and staying asleep. I know for sure that I get less than 3 hours of sleep. 

My head hurts, it is hard to concentrate, I am cranky, and I am weak. I am also in college, which is torture for me. I really don't even see myself going back to school Wednesday, because I literally can NOT function to a full level. 

The thing is, everyone around me acts like fucking retards when it comes to my insomnia, especially my fat retarded ass mother. She asks me "" What's wrong? Why are you so cranky? You're tired? Take a nap.""

I CAN'T FUCKING SLEEP AND IT IS SERIOUS! Do I have to slip into a coma for people to get this? Do I have to pass put from chronic exhaustion for people to realize how serious this is?"
First post.,"This is my first reddit post.

Long, long time lurker. Fuck i struggle so much with sleep, have done for a couple years now.
I feel so cursed, my life is so normal and great but yet i have to struggle through each day because i did not sleep the night before.
I am on prescribed melatonin and have been recommended to a sleep physiologist but its pricey..
My wife is so supportive and amazing but it's really affecting our life.. everything would just be ok if i could sleep, but this basic animal instinct i just can not do.
Now i rely on alchohol and a handful of pills to knock me out for the next day.
If anyone struggles with a similar problem please if you can offer any advice it would be great.
Thanks very much."
feeling “safer” at night,"so i was officially diagnosed with insomnia back in september sometime amongst other things, but i know for sure i’ve dealt with it for over a year now. its got to the point where i start to have “hallucinations “ if you will. but despite how shitty it makes me feel and how bad i just want to get a good nights rest, for some reason, i feel more at peace at night, maybe because im alone. i don’t know maybe im just rambling. because i still feel fucked in the head but i guess its different. was just curious if anyone else has ever felt similar "
Hi 14 year old here,I just want to sleep. I have important exams coming up and I can't get more than an hour of uninterrupted sleep and I usually only get five hours in total. I don't really want to try sleep meds as I am already on a whole cocktail of meds. How do I cope?
Melatonin,"Does melatonin have any side effects? I've been taking 5mg a couple times every week for about a year now, but haven't noticed any negative effects. Is there anything I should be aware of?"
Honestly feeling suicidal,"My insomnia started January of last year for no apparent reason. Now that it's my 1 year anniversary of rarely sleeping, I feel like my insomnia is never going to go away. I've tried so many different things such as marijuana, 2-3 different sleeping pills, melatonin, bali kratom, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head.

In addition to all of those different medications and drugs, I've installed blue light filters on all my devices, read a book for 1-2 hours before bed, and avoid all caffeine throughout the day. On top of that I've been going to the gym regularly and it still isn't enough to knock me out at night. 

Although my sleep quality improved after trying these things for a couple of days, it never seems to have a lasting effect. Just when I think it's going away I'll be cursed with 2-3 nights in a row of no sleep and I'm right back where I started. I can't help but feel like all my efforts are in vain and that I'm going to be cursed with this shit for the rest of my life. 

I dread going out in public now because I have permanent dark circles and bloodshot eyes that make me look like a drug addict or vampire. I'm also really struggling to focus on doing my school work and my grades have really been declining.

One of the only few things that I'm looking forward to is possibly trying out CBTI (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia), since I've heard great success stories on this subreddit. The problem is, nobody takes my problems seriously and my parents refuse to make me an appointment. Instead, they blame me for being lazy and being on electronics all day despite the fact that I've been going to the gym and reading before bedtime. Anytime I ever ask for help or express my will to book an appointment with a psychiatrist or something they blow up in my face and make me feel like complete shit. 

I'm so tired of trying to fix myself when nobody cares, and I feel like if I were to put a bullet in my head, I'd finally get a good nights rest."
Lost as all hell,"I’ve been dealing with insomnia for a bit over a year now, I was officially diagnosed at the end of last April though. This has been the worst shit of my life. Couple this with my depression and I often wonder how I’m still here. This started my freshman year of college and has had a steady hand in helping me flunk out. Through all the mood swings, not being able to think clearly, and just the total helplessness I feel from this I don’t know if things are ever going to get better. I feel like an absolute disgrace making these excuses for myself. It’s not like school is hard at all I just have nothing left to give. I feel as if I’ve been running on fumes for a few months now and I don’t know how much is left. It’s like my depression hits me in waves and in turn the insomnia gets worse, every couple weeks or months I’ll have moments of being really happy then I get hit with a hurricane of awful thoughts. I’ve had multiple suicide attempts already but just couldn’t quite follow through, I’m an absolute coward for being so weak. 

I’ve been taking remeran (mirtazapine) for a few months (before I took trazodone) pretty consistently and have had almost no change in my racing thoughts, mood swings, etc. As far as sleeping these meds haven’t done a bad job I’m to the point now where I think I’ve built a tolerance to these meds. Before they’d knock me out about 45 minutes after taking them, but now I took them coming up on two hours ago now and here I am typing this wide awake. Since December I’ve actually had the ability to make myself stay awake while on these and before that never happened. 

I feel so lost in my life right now. I’m 20 and I don’t want to live, how depressing is that? Sorry for putting you down in the dumps if you read this. I don’t know what I’m looking for with this, I guess I feel like it needed to get out there."
can only take short naps recently.,"My husband works third shift, When he comes home I try to go to bed with him  but I can't sleep any significant amount of time. I somehow end up awake all day and night when he leaves besides a couple hours of napping. I used to sleep great now I can barely get enough to keep me going. Might not be related but I have had bad anxiety over a recent job loss. I have had two sleep studies done in the past due to a random seizure while sleeping. We figured out it was an isolated incident and nothing abnormal showed up on results. "
"Sleepwalked, very scary?","I woke up walking to my dads room and my left arm was completely numb which freaked me out. I honestly probably thought I was having a heart attack in my sleep and got up to go to my dads when really I just slept on it badly because I noticed a mark on my arm where I was sleeping on it, but as soon as I woke up in the hallway, my heart started racing probably because that’s when I noticed my numb arm and got even more scared then realized I was standing up. Ugh, this has happened almost a year ago also I would wake up RIGHT before opening the room to my dad and notice that one of my arms were completely numb from sleeping on it badly. Does this happen to anyone else?"
I think I've developed insomnia,"I've never posted here before. But here I am again at 2:15am, and I've got to get up for work at 5:30. I feel like shit the entire day and all I can think about is sleeping. 

When I can finally get into bed at the end of the day and put my head down, I'm absolutely wide awake. My mind starts thinking at a million miles per hour and I become increasingly restless. That restlessness is exacerbated when I think about how little sleep I'm going to get, and how shit I'm going to feel tomorrow.

And the cycle just continues. I just want to feel rested when I get up. It's killing me, probably quite literally."
Almost two nights in a row without sleep,"I've almost never had this happen to me. It is currently 12 in the morning, and I haven't had any sleep since Saturday night. The most sleep I've had was around an hour and it was around 7 in the morning yesterday. I have taken cbd oil for my anxiety, I have taken 10mg melatonin, and I have tried relaxing. I literally don't know what to do. I really don't want to miss 2 days of school in a row, I'm gonna have so much work to do, and I need to start on a book drive this week, otherwise I won't get community service hours to get into the National Honor Society. However, I know for a fact that I will literally not be able to function all day, and I just don't know what to do. Screw my insomnia.

Edit: I'm 15."
Do you get cranky easily if you have insufficient sleep?,And what do you do to combat the crankiness
Thoughts about falling asleep vs. staying asleep.,"I can use  few things to fall asleep but most times I will wake up after only a short period of rest—maybe an hour or two. I've used Melatonin, Black Seed Oil, Mugwort Tea, CBD oil, Benadryl and various other sleepytime teas, over the years, but I still can't get past the early stages of sleep. My doc prescribed Silenor, designed to keep one asleep and it works for me about 50% of the time. The directions say to make sure you have an 8 hour window or you can wake up drowsy. Not a perfect solution but it does help me think about the differences between falling asleep and keeping it going. Anyone else analyze the problem this way? If so, how do you handle it?"
Stress and life changes,"In march I will be moving a long way away from home, my friends, my girlfriend and my pets. It's for 5 months and it's for a new job that I hope will be the start to the career I have for the rest of my life. But the thought of leaving everything I know and love behind is keeping me awake most nights and I'm getting serious sleep deprivation. Weirdly I can sleep in the afternoon but not at night. I find myself procrastinating on my phone late at night because I'm scared to be left overthinking. Im writing this to see if anyone has any tips on how to overcome the anxiety and get the sleep I'm desperately in need of. "
I am a chronic insomniac,"I am a 19 year old girl. In the last 6 months I have become a chronic insomniac. I am lucky if I get 4 hours of sleep a night. I have a very hard time falling and staying asleep. 

My head hurts, I sometimes feel uncoordinated, it is hard to concentrate in class, my memory has gotten pretty bad, and I feel weak a lot.

What makes me angry, is that all this could have been prevented had my family not been the illiterate pieces of shits that they are. 

From my mother becoming an alcoholic and having to take on adult responsibilities before I was even 13, having an abusive, bullying, alcoholic drug addicted grandmother, to an emotionally unstable sister, my head is FUCKED UP. 

6 months ago, my trouble-making sister came to my house with a nasty attitude and attacked me. I guess that was the straw that broke the camel's back, because that is what I feel really triggered my sleep disturbance. My sleep has not been the same since THAT DAY.

I am angry because, I was the ""different one"". I am smart, educated, respectful, and is actually trying to make something our of myself. However,   being sleep deprived is having a major impact on me."
So pissed! I had a sleep study in Dec. and have called the doctors office 3X to see what I should do and the doctor hasn’t gotten back with me!! Anyone have this issue?,"I did a sleep study in Dec. I turned my log in at doctors office and thought they would contact me. I called a few weeks ago to see what was going on. Nothing. Called again and they said maybe the doctor didn’t see my sleep study. I said I turned in weeks ago. The next day my primary told me it was scanned in THAT DAY. Still nothing. I called again today saying basically “should I just make and appointment so that way the doctor will have to tell me what is going on” they took my # again and I said please let the doctor know this is my third time and they said kind of sadly “yeah we know”.

The sleep study people told me I don’t have apnea but the doctor would tell me more. Well I haven’t spoke to the doctor. If you don’t have apnea do they just write you off or do they talk to you about other options? I mean at least tell me that there is nothing they can do versus me sitting around and waiting 6 weeks!!"
Waiting for the world to wake up. Sigh.,Been awake all night. It is now 6am and I'm impatiently waiting for the rest of the world to wake up so I can go out and get my day started. I hate this limbo period. Grumble grumble.

Very vivid dreams and loud thoughts,"I feel like I'm going crazy.

Whenever I try and sleep, my mind starts just racing, about nothing in particular. I'll see random images, hear random noises in my head, and sometimes the thoughts will get loud. Loud enough to startle me. When I do fall asleep, I have very vivid, realistic dreams. I'm so afraid of ""going crazy"" and I feel like I am. I do suffer from anxiety and OCD. Does anyone else suffer from these things?"
It begins,I've been doing pretty well with forcing myself to sleep recently. But i had my first day off work in a while today and messed up my sleeping pattern. It's now 3:37 and I'm wide awake hahaha I have a week off so I know it's not going to end until I'm back at work falling asleep at my desk. 
My insomnia is back but in a weird way.,"a few months ago i had insomnia for the first time and keeping to a strict sleeping schedule seemed to have fixed that for about two months.

Now I sleep for about one hour(three if I'm lucky) and my body wakes up feeling like i was a sleep for 8 hours. This feeling lasts   for about 30  min and then i get extremely tired. 

Going back to bed(after tossing and turning for about 45min) will grant me yet another one hour of sleep and the cycle continues.

Has anyone else have something similar happen to them ans what did you do to help you stay a sleep?"
just went for a run at 2am,"I get bad anxiety at night and my heart felt like it was racing, so I tried going for a run and it actually helped because I feel like my heart rate is going down as I’m laying back in bed now lol. Still might not sleep, but better than lying jittery in bed. Just thought I’d share if anyone else wanted to give it a go. "

Feel Worse When Waking Up,"Why do I always feel worse when I wake up than I did when I went to sleep? I can't remember a time in my entire life when I woke up feeling refreshed. Actually, maybe after anesthesia, but I was high on the propofol so that probably doesn't count. "
My sleep quality has declined drastically in the last few weeks with no significant changes to my sleep habits that I can think of.,"I've had problems falling asleep for the past decade or so, so that isn't anything new to me and I've always slept pretty well once I actually manage to fall asleep. The last 2 weeks I've been waking up multiple times a night (usually at least 5-10 that I can count) drenched in sweat but freezing cold and curled up in the fetal position. I wake up feeling like I barely slept and extremely sore. This is the first time I've slept this bad so consistently without an obvious reason. Anyone have any suggestions or experience with this? Thanks!"
Slept at night for the first time in a week,"Hey y'all. I (18F) struggle with anxiety-induced insomnia and generally can't sleep when it's dark outside. I hung out with a friend last night and ended up crying (talking about deep shit haha). Then I went home, changed into comfy pajamas, and put on asmr until I fell asleep around 2 or 3. I woke up at 5:30.

 This probably doesn't seem super healthy but I feel super accomplished. Anyway, love you all and wish you well! Stay fabulous 🤙"
Haven’t been able to sleep at night and desperately asking for help,"been about a year now, I know everyone go through.. But i can’t sleep, I tried tiring myself out by staying awake for 2 days so I’ll start being able to sleep the next night but it’s of no use.. I don’t feel sleepy during day time either... my body feels so tired, head spins.. really exhausted mentally and physically.. but boom eyes wide open every night.... tried milk, showers, alcohol, wine, beer nothing works, all that’s left is sleeping pill which I do not want to start using... any help please.. thanks... "
Has anyone else experieced this?,"I am laying in bed now, and when I am looking at my phone, reading or watching youtube, I feel really sleepy, like I am about to pass out. Then I put my phone away, turn of the light and now I am completely awake, just laying in bed.

"Here, again.....","It’s about 3:50 am and I’m not asleep. Have to be up with a kiddo in about 3 hours for Saturday morning basketball.

Personal experience to improve insomnia,"I am just like the rest of you have insomnia problem. THATS WHY I AM AT THIS SUB. Tried almost everything: masturbate, melatonin, read books, drinking, stretching, yoga, calm music, warm milk, meditating... you name it.

However, I found that talking to people that I love before bed will help me fall asleep quickly like a baby. I FaceTime my mom, best friends or even long lost friends. Of course it doesn’t work every time! But I would recommend you all to give it a shot tho. Is a good opportunity to catch up some old friends.

Well the downside of this method is not everyone have the time or patience to talk to you LOL. That’s why I’m awake now. 4:16AM at Texas.

P.S. don’t tell them you called them because you can’t sleep. Genuinely ask them how they doing!"
Catching up on sleep on the weekends means that I can't sleep a single minute the night before Sunday. How do I get the sleep clock back to normal?,"I am 29 and I am out of home for work from 8am till 9:30pm. The workweek here is from Sunday to Thursday with Friday and Saturday off. I have developed insomnia since a few months ago and this week the sleep was like this: 

Sunday: 0 hrs sleep
Monday: 0 hrs
Tuesday: 4 hrs
Wednesday: 4 hrs
Thursday:5 hrs
Friday: 10 hrs. (from 2am till 11am and an hour in the afternoon).  I felt really refreshed after waking up Friday morning. 
Saturday/Today: 0 sleep!! My eyes hurt at 2:30am and went to sleep but had none. 

This routine seems to have become the norm. I can't sleep a single minute on the first weekday (Sunday) night. So on Sunday morning the entire day is extremely painful for me and I can't function. As the days go by, the lack of sleep compounded with 13 hour days keep making my life and health a hell. 

I MUST sleep tonight otherwise I will not be able to function properly at work tomorrow and the cycle of suffering from the insomnia will start again. "
Trazodone thoughts,"First reddit post ever. 

Just read a post on here that mentioned trazodone.

This is one of the few sleep drugs I've tried and the only prescription I've refilled for years simply because my Dr promises me it's not habit forming.

It does knock me out if I take 150 - 200 mgs which is the most or more than the Dr says is safe... But I never wake up feeling rested when I do cave and take it.

I do wake up feeling relieved that I've slept, but that's about it. Sometimes I throw up in the am and it only seems to happen when I've taken the trazodone.

Also, it always gives me like, insanely vivid dreams - I wake up remembering lots of dreams from the night before, and those dreams feel like they went on for days or even weeks. 

Anyone else get this? Normal sleep doesn't make me dream.... But then, I rarely get normal sleep."
Diet,Has anyone tried eating the bulk of their calories (70%-75%) 2-3 hours before bed?
Is this story familiar to anyone?,"I used to be a night owl when I was younger and then got myself in a bad way when I started using drugs in HS. After I got cleaned up with alot of help from other people, I couldn't sleep well for at least 6 months. I went years where being busy during the day helped alot along with exercise. This year, my work schedule changed to swings and overnights. It seems like the overnights are taking their toll, as recently my sleep patterns have gotten worse. I work two jobs and the second is a part time job in the field I love. I work in IT at night and my exercise routine has died down to almost nothing. If I have a 8AM meeting for the part time, I get stuck awake as I've had trouble waking up on time in the past for meetings early. This week has been the worst in a bit, where I'm waking up in spurts when I do doze off and after eating, wanking, etc. 
Have you folks also watched your sleep pattern degrade due to work load/pursuing a goal? Did it become unhealthy like this?

TLDR: Working two jobs, sleeps gone downhill after starting swings/overnights, looking for others who have been through it"
I was tired as anything last night,"I just stayed awake watching TV. I just didn't sleep until I fell asleep on the lounge at 4AM, missing an appointment I had made with a friend

#insomnialyf"
I feel so alone-I never met anyone with my sleeping disorder symptoms,"If there is anyone out there with my issue?  I would love to hear from you, but I've been searching for years and haven't met anyone with this disorder or the way I feel the next day after not getting several hours of refreshed sleep. In my mid-late 20's, I started having severe sleeping problems. I would wake up to early and feel totally unrefreshed-it didn't matter if I slept 8-hours straight, the next day I felt and now feel like I have the flu, no energy, and unable to perform my job even though I love it. I am now 48-years old and I have several other factors and weight gaining drugs I'm on due to a kidney transplant besides my sleeping meds, which are Elavil, Zyprexa and Prozac combo medication, and Klonopin up to 2-mg as needed. At first and for many years, after being hospitalized,  the Elavil and 1mg of Klonopin was the ONLY thing that helped me sleep and I tried everything. if I started having a problem feeling unrefreshed on Elavil, my doctor would up the dose and I was normal again. I am not normal. I currently take 150mg of Elavil each night and was also put on 25/6 mg of fluox/olanza, which is Prozac and Zyprexa together (6-mg of Zyprexa). Yes, I gained weight from the kidney transplant and the fluox/olanza, but pretty sure it's the olanzapine/ Zyprexa, which causes weight gain. (other than my kidney antirejection drugs I need to take to stay alive). The Past three nights, I've woken up every two hours and took a 1mg klonopin with some warm milk to fall asleep again and then another 2 hrs later and so on until it was 8 or 9am and I had to get up. Even thought the Klonopin put me back to sleep, I am so tired and my face is broken out and feel so alone. I've never been able to sleep even 6-hrs straight and feel the least bit productive the following day. So, taking all the Klonopin, which used to work to put me back to sleep for a few hours isn't making me feel like a normal, but just tired individual and I don't mean groggy. If I wake up groggy from Klonopin, I have a cup of coffee and would feel just fine. Do you know how you feel when you are extremely sick with the flu and you just have to stay in bed until it ends? Well, that is how I'm feeling day after day from just not sleeping well. I've heard of some people not sleeping at all for a day or two, but they still feel someone normal but have a regular tired feeling like they are going to doze off. When I'm extremely tired, I still can't fall asleep. That never happened to me...it's always really bad and I can't function at all. I've lost jobs over this thru the years and thank god I have a supportive loving husband because I don't know if other normal people would have put up with my sleeping problem and more importantly, how horrible I feel when I'm having sleep issues. Can anyone out there even relate? I'm told I could probably increase the Zyprexa, but major weight gain will be an issue and between feeling awful or being fat, I would rather die. I've already gained 35 pounds from my kidney meds (Steroids) and these sleeping meds. I don't know who or where to turn to anymore-I feel like I am extremely unique to feel like I'm dead when I don't sleep well. I've have sleep apnea tests and it came back normal, although my husband says I snore loudly. Can anyone relate? I feel so alone? It's not my diet and when I'm sleeping well, I'm on my treadmill daily for one hour everyday. Thank you for listening to my very long message and I hope someone out there has a similar situation-It is pure hell. Thank you, Diane

I feel less alone,"It's about 5am here, i gave up on sleeping and thought ""maybe theres an insomnia subreddit"", sadly there is but it made me feel better and helped me remember that there are others out there just waiting in their beds until the sun shines or the alarm goes off.  "
Replay ASAP,"So I am getting off electronics at 8 PM which is in 13 minutes and sometimes when I try that, it doesnt work. It's always.

1. Worry
2. Worry
3. Worry some more
4. Worry to the point of crying"
cold matters / rant,"Just a rant.

I had been having a bad week of sleep with my usual set up. Usually consists of a sheet + another cotton sheet folded over itself. Noticed however that the temperature was warmer than usual, hovering close to 22 degrees Celsius and I had ignored this. I set out to lower it, and slept better the following night. I lowered it yet even more, and was so cool at onset that layering sheets wasn't sufficient. I had to grab a comforter. It took me 2.5h to finally sleep. What sleep I did get was deeper, but man I feel like I could use more today.  

Don't underestimate what a change of ambient temperature can do."
What do you guys do when you can’t fall asleep?,"1) read a book

2) browse the internet

3) do homework

4) contemplate on life until the alarm tells you to gtfo."
Has anyone ever semi-dreamed?,"5am here. I have bouts of bad sleep anxiety (from travel usually, this week was bad), and this week as I lay in bed I have these almost semi-dreams. I am too tired to move around and think I am just on the cusp of sleep, but the thoughts are very intense and intricate, like a dream is. My heart rate goes up, and time seems to pass very fast. The whole time I feel almost consumed in the dream, and wake up feeling not rested in the slightest."
Trazodone for insomnia?,"My doctor gave me an rx for trazadone and ambien - she let me have both so I could see what worked best (not both at the same time.) 

I have been changing my sleep routine - but I basically have these on hand to get some much needed sleep. 

I have tried ambien, and it didn’t do anything the second night. I have yet to try the trazadone (50mg) partly because I’m paranoid about the long lasting erection side effect.

Any experiences with trazadone?"
Nothing works I need advice,"Whenever it’s time to sleep I suddenly am super awake, like I could run a mile awake. I’ve tried everything over the counter at this point. I’ve ignored my insomnia symptoms for most of my life but now I’m a young professional in animation and I’m 100% freelance illustrating and boarding for shows and it’s starting to effect my workload drastically. (Real hell is trying to pick colors or do dramatic camera angels on day 3 of no sleep)

I’ve also tried smoking weed to sleep I just stay up all night. Right now I’m trying unisom because so many people have swore it works.....it makes me tired but I can’t sleep. I know the next step is prescribed sleep aids but I’m going to be honest they make me nervous. I was on anti anxiety medication that was also used to treat severe seizures and that would knock me out at 10pm but also I would sleep till 3 pm. I’m just living hell.

Sorry if this is all over the place I’m on day 4 with only a couple hours of sleep... 😭"
I think a lot of times I lose ability to sleep when I share a bed with someone,"I’m not sure if this is the right place. But... I’ve finally started to realize it’s hard for me to sleep when someone else is in my bed. It’s happened with both of the boyfriends I’ve had (which was consistent because I’ve lived w both and live with one of them now) and also with just anyone for whatever reason. Currently it’s almost 3AM and i can’t sleep. I would smoke to sleep and when I quit smoking so I could get a new job and pass a test, it got even worse. Now I find I need some sort of substance to sleep. It’s not cool and worrisome. Melatonin doesn’t work. I’ve literally drank NyQuil often to make me sleep. Mostly I drink now, which is the most bothersome. But I’ll stay up til 3 and get up for 6 to get ready for work! 
I get legitimately pissed off when I can’t sleep. Tonight I almost lost my mind. It’s just... I’ll spend all day at work yawning and same goes for the evening... but my brain starts thinking at maximum overdrive as soon as my head hits the pillow. Can’t sleep anywhere but my bed either. 

Can anyone relate or know any solutions to suggest? I’ve gotten a rain noise maker, listened to a specific podcast, drank a tea specifically to prep you for sleep, taken melatonin, done yoga, etc. my mind is just too freaking active and loves to think the most then."
Calling out from insomnia,"What is your guys view on missing work after multiple days of little or no sleep? I have had insomnia for my entire life but in the last 4 or 5 years it has been increasingly bad most likely due to the combined stress of work, and bad hours. I work as a line cook and I often work 12 hour shifts, close one night and open the next morning. My jobs have all been told about my insomnia, but have not been understanding when it becomes a problem,  to the point where in the last 3 years I have been fired twice for absences all stemming from insomnia. 

I frequently get told to go in anyways, by office friends who can nod off at their desk or rest from home,  but if I haven't slept i feel completely unable to keep up at my work and feel like I am a potential hazard for me and coworkers.

I'm on day 3 of not being able to stay asleep,  and I already called out yesterday and am dreading having to do it again today. "
I took a nap,"I’ve been posting on this sub a bit lately.  A few detail recess.  I work a job with 24 hr shifts, have a brain tumor, and am in chemo.  I haven’t really had good sleep lately and have really been struggling.  My meds have been ineffective on my days off, and they usually are pretty decent.

Yeterday I got called in to work extra and didn’t get home from work u til almost 2am.  I went to “bed”around 3am, and never fell asleep.  I laid there restless and finally got up and went back to work around 9am.  I had a massive headache all day.  I came home and toook some Tylenol at 4:30pm and a muscle relaxant for my head, and then my cat backed himself into my arms and I fell asleep for almost 4 hours.  I have a hit of a lingering headache but I’m pretty sure I actually fell asleep.

"
Best sleep aids for when cycling ambien?,"I have been on 10mg ambien, technically zolpidem, for slightly over 7 years. It has gotten to the point where it isn’t working again. Previously my doctor had me stop taking it for about six months and when I started it back up it worked great for a couple years. Well now I’m here again and my doctor wants to me to try to cycle off it for a while. 

Well the issue is I now have a great job, and those six months last time were HELL. I felt like my ambien wasn’t working before but I guess it was way better than nothing. So for the past couple weeks I’ve been taking 20mg on nights before work, but obviously my script is low. So I need ideas on what to supplement. 

I don’t know the support on this sub for Marijuana, however that is the best sleep I have ever received. My work doesn’t drug test, however we are currently caring for a family member who was just released from rehab so obviously I want to avoid that. 

I’m currently trying that cbd oil thing, it’s night one and I’m not asleep yet so there’s that. I don’t know how effective it actually is and it tasted horrible! However if anyone has any good CBD edible recommendations I would appreciate it! Or anything else for that matter. Except all of this imagine you are somewhere or melatonin stuff. I went though a program with a doctor on how to teach me how to fall asleep better, didn’t work. I also was going through a months supply of melatonin in a week. 

Also I’ll mention I have a weighted blanket on the way, after the one I ordered had a hole in it. 

Edit: fixed some stuff. 

Update: just vomiting up CBD oil, fuck this shit. "
Make up stories in your head.,"Don’t think about going to sleep when you are trying to sleep. 

Instead lay down close your eyes and get deeply lost in your thoughts. Literally make up entire stories in your head and before you know it you will be out. 

That’s what I have been doing for the past 2 weeks and it has worked. And with no medication."
To all those who had success with CBTi and Sleep Restriction Therapy for treating insomnia,What was your sleep like before you started? Did you need to take time off work/school/etc in order to fully commit to the program? How long into the program were you before you started to see results? And what is your sleep like now? Any feedback would be much appreciated
Quick question about diet.,Is it possible that removing cheese from your diet can cause insomnia?
haven’t slept tonight thoughts,it’s 8 am here and i haven’t slept yet. i’ve never not been able to sleep all night before. it doesn’t help that i didn’t actually get to bed until 4 am because i was working on art projects. i’m not tired or sleepy or anything. i feel wide awake. i got around 5 hours of sleep the day before and then i napped for about an hour at 2 pm. should i just give up on sleeping for today? i can just stay home and work on my schoolwork. maybe i’ll have a gilmore girls marathon
"After four years of waking up at 5:30am, I keep doing it without an alarm and it’s killing my energy. How can I fix this?","I wake up around 5:30am every morning without an alarm no matter how late I stay up the night before or how early I go to bed, I feel tired throughout the rest of the day  and just want to sleep my extra two hours instead of laying in bed feeling like crap for two hours. Please, how can I fix this?"
"So many nights I’ll start to fall asleep, then when I’m dozing off, I’ll have the thought “wow I’m about to sleep!” and then it wakes me right up. This happens over and over again, until it’s morning time and I don’t have time to sleep anymore.","Last night this seemed to be a huge issue with me. All I wanted to do was sleep, but every time I was actually about to fall asleep, I thought about how I was about to sleep and it woke me right up. 

Has anyone ever had this problem? It was unbelievably frustrating. It’s not like I can feel the thought creeping up on me. It just happens. Any suggestions?"
Exercise has not helped my insomnia! I have tried everything but prescription drugs. Anyone got any ideas I might not know?,
Has exercise helped you?,Hi all. Just wanting to know if anyone has tried an exercise routine that helped them sleep?
"I fucking hate you, insomnia","You've made almost every aspect of my life more difficult than it needed to be. You're making it so damn hard for me to finish my thesis when I've worked on this project so hard for over two years. I know having a very 'alert' brain also has advantages, but if it had a sleep switch, my life would be immeasurably easier."
What can I do for sleep anxiety?,As of recently I've been getting a lot of sleep anxiety. In the past three days I've maybe gotten a total of 4-5 hours of sleep. I get anxious just thinking about sleep. When I close my eyes to sleep I feel a rush of adrenaline in my chest and my body will twitch randomly which wakes me up. Could this be the result from alcohol withdrawal? I only drink on the weekends but I will get anxiety if I end up drinking to much. 
Hello again my old friend...,I was having insomnia for years. At the most I would get 3 maybe 4 hours of sleep a night and that was very broken and interrupted. My doctor finally prescribed 50mg of trazodone before bedtime. Made falling asleep a bit easier and when I would wake up in the middle of the night I could fall back asleep faster. Finally was at 5-6 hours of swell a night. Doctor doubled my dosage and for the first time in a long time I was sleeping 7-8 hours a night with minimal interruptions. Then two days ago the medication just stopped working. Looks like I am sleepless again... screw you insomnia. 
Not being able to sleep,"Here it's currently 2:40 AM and I have to get up in less than 5 hours. I hate this, it always happens when I have wake up early.
The worst part is that I was very sleepy and actually fell asleep... for a couple of minutes, not even ten. Suddenly I woke up and I'm not going back to sleep.

I'm thinking about start drinking some sleeping infusions before going to bed. Has anyone tried this? "
Something that really helped me last night.,"My mind wakes me up during the process of falling asleep. I have no problem staying asleep, but i have massive problems with transitioning from awake to sleep. I have no control and it jumps me awake Every time I get close to falling asleep.

 I have something that worked well for me last night: try to keep your eyes open as you stare at nothing in particular. Instead of 'trying to sleep'

Not only did i get so bored that I  physically felt sleepy, but my eyes were so droopy so quickly that my brain finally took over and initiated sleep mode within 30 minutes,  conpared to my usual 3 hours. Body's natural breathing took over, everything went smooth and I fell asleep 3 hours before my usual bed time.

REALLY hope it helps someone tonight. I'm really excited to try it again tonight.

It might work by reverse psychology on your own self: I have anxiety about not getting enough sleep as I'm sure we all do here. By trying to stay awake I felt like I'm fooling myself into falling asleep. I guess I'm my own worst enemy considering it appeared to work fantastic last night. "

We don't get the care we need and deserve as truely suffering a horrendlously life alterating condition. How has people with severe chronic insomnia i.e 3 hours a night average.

 Went to NHS psychiatrist and got told ""your body will fall asleep when it needs to"". I almost laughed out loud. My type is getting hypnic jerks/myclonus as relaxing and falling asleep, waking after what 1 hour? Expected to treat my Anxiety and Depression and all this shit through behavioural models which had failed through trial and error.

Leaning over to the dark net now getting to grips with benzos and their addictive tendensies. Modafinil and Pregabalin have been the most important off the net, and Phenibut. Tianeptine sulphate not useful enough although a nice high with withdrawal worse that opiates and tianeptine is an antipressants AND opiate.

I've read stuff about benos. Their suffering withdrawals worse than any drug, yes even heroin and crack. Just tried to get a little bit of sleep before long work hours in a kitchen by popping a cheap pill. Still judging their use/wprtj pver negatives, not spent much in w/ds and chronic use/abuse for 2 weeks now.

Got some LSD too, Class A I know but I'm not woried overworked police officers will care, and if they do the cost wouls sick trash for them, and I use it for therapy and mental health issues. hmm. no invites copers.

Note; Just got back from the shop and dude, I was having so many thought patterns I jump around the place like a asslym seeker in EU cpuntries. (are these attempted jokes banned? Soz if are pls no perma. Probably would want to be a comedian in the future yikes comedy so bland literally women comedians would just end up attacking each other and then jump on a political party.

I love women. I love men. I love all. LSD and cannabis let me see women as equals and against the bigger religions views etc. I used LSD to try treat my insomnia and mental conditions, it showed me something I couldn't describe, only at 50uq for me it was potent maybe im sensitive. I seem morphin which freaked me haha but next time maybe ill have more introspection before jumping for some xanax and burying my  head in my pillow like a huffy 8 year old trying to manage the terror this lsd can cause. Perception changes are fucking enormous people. I took weed and realised ""Comedians are usually sad I wonder what they do ! "" I searched Jum Carrey, and found Eckhart Tolle. I disagree that you can just be in the present moment like a choice, I think he is over optimistic in our ""pain bodies"" momentum it carries through the collective unconscious like that first time you fire your bay blade into that shitty pastic arena thing.

I'm not going to fix this post I'd usually just delete this shit now but hey may some Pepega autismo incel tragic son of a bitch like me will enjoy this sht. Also reading with weed might help. Lsd and reading is.... I wouldnt like to do it yet anyway. Lsd made me love everyone and further forgive women in my life who cause me pain like my mother and other relations. We are all one. Naw, Im no psychotic im just 3 days sleep deprived trying to extrapolate a shit tonne of ideas from my head and a general low self esteem in my writing pride because its anonymous anyway I'll just delete it if its faggy (no offense just the happy faggy as in, your a fag because ur not giving that old women your seat. Not the gay. Also I was probably internalised homophobic before lsd, but now im like who gives a shit 

Also that knife shit about going nuts thats no worry no call the popo if i was gonna kill someone id of killed my mother when i was 11/12. What the fuck must she have done to me, I remember the verbal, emotional, psychological abuse but to want kill her the damage she was doing to me might have been worse than some physical kinds.

Fuck her. But I forgive her. Her intention was never to harm me, psychopaths are very low percentage chance, and categorised as illness too and even psychopaths can restrain themselves just like a horny incel that wants to rape. Im not afraid to talk about this sht cus I talked to many mental health professional and the general concensus is 90% of people think completely fucked up things but, anyway, mr/mrs autismo that read this whole thing. 

If ur a  hot grill message me, I'm not going to get catfished im fairly paranoid and extensively edgy as it is, and tbh, if a girl added me on the internet I'd probably block them just like on league of legends because my mind and emotions goes fucking nuts. What to say? Am I being cool? Is she into me? Am I thinking to much? Yes, ok. Focus on breath. I'm cold. Oh dude if this girl is into me it be so hot. Shit im fantasing about a girl who just wants to playt a game with me im so fucking sick. She made a joke with a kiss mark, is she flirting? Do I make a move? Shit shit shit. Fuck this get blocked noob hehe i play teemo jungle next 20 games fucking reeeeeeee.

I'm ok lads. Ok that one really concerned person reading to see if I say something anymore fucked up, who do you think you are dealing with here? If you draw are on diaviant art or something i l ike that sht hit me up.

3 days Ive been up dude. Have to buy my own etizolam, will knock me out whenever I use it thankfully but without it its just awful. Being up for more than 3 days without sleep is a drunken, stumbling, slurring, brain farting, -20IQ, but I probably more chance of getting a grill like this than with 9000 hours sleep how sad. Talking about girls again fucking get out of me man I know ying and yang are cool and all but, shit man, evolution make it hard - literally - to not think about women when a depressed, alone, never gf, over school age, mentally ill, internet diagnoso autismato certified by Dr Nick!  Childless, relationshipless, my therapist says this is actually a good thing for me because id be taking on others problames but (fuck if reddit has a character counter im going to be pissed I dont want to edit this crap im spewing out intuitive Kappa all over the place.

So right, no gf or kids, die alone etc a lot of western scariest thing. But you know, with meditation and Buddhism (not stricktly tied to the institutional buddhism) you can find peace within yourself. I dont want to be 50 getting boners when I go outside to get a fucking apple. Jesus christ, it slike im 14, im on high dosage ssri paroxetine kills sex drive, still get fucking boners reeeeeee. cant fucking use them feelsbadman.

would you ever become gay in a situation like this just for comfort and sexual pleasures etc? Im like 97% straight just and prostate massage froma  cock would be nice based on my own experiment but the smell is not a fucking cinderalla or jasmine its a fucking gragas or santa after running around the world delivering presents when his dog with the red nose is sick. Women smell so nice, heres a spicy story. I was living in halls up at a close uni to mine, and everyone was out on break, so I got super horny tried to enter a girls room and holy sht... the door was open. I walk around hoping to find a nice dildo but I find out something disappointing, its  a pair of panties absolutely drenched in female pheremones. Fuck, im not gay. Gay would be so easier dude i hate women cus of my mom and sister. Trans is just like, its hot porn but , i mean yeah id like to do it irl if she is hot but.... Im not fucking C9 Sneaky that dude makes me uncomfortable he makes me question fucking eternity and space and everything when he dresses like a cute girl and I want to fucking judge him since i got bullied at school and my parents would judge me but damn id probably fuck him.

there it is, Like it may feel nice but the smell of guy, sweat, semen, dude, im a guy and that shit just aint pleasant or... sexually satisfying. 

Anyway insomnia fucks people up man. I see shadows at corners of eyes past 40 hours awake. I dont give a fuck about that shadow people sht its too drama and unstimulating for me. Ive seen fucking hallucinations. I downed this liquid once at a party at uni campus to impress a girl, no idea what was in it, fucking burned my nose drank 500 ml of spirit could have died but yolo haha xd. I spent time in college observing !alphas! and they just reckless smash shit up fucking retarded johnny bravo motherfuckers, Im more of a Tyler Durden myself. Watched that film on lsd the other day, it was great until I seen how it was basically Hollywood dictating what is really from fantasy, trying to pull you in, tell you what is real isnt, pulls you in again. fuck that shit man. 

That dude has insomnia in fight club. I love that sht. Its sort of an ego identity. Im meditating frequently when I can, obviously not right now shit went down at work didnt want to get pushed around like bullies did in high school fuck sake lose a job 10 years after high school still quit a damn good job, because of the kitchen staff were fucking amazing. The stories, the lifestyle, cant fucking remember their names on Facebook and my old phone broke with their numbers.... so mad. So what, I cant remember names, dont judge me. I dont know why i cant remember names. 

A name is like, identity. Human 1, Human 2. Mother, father. Baby, Adult. McDonalds, Burger King. Trump, one sec im gonna hit some weed not hit in like 9 hours dude./ Nah im not taking a hit yet, want to wait till im queuing  up in league with my teemo jungle sheeeet weed dude hahah so cool ahaha. Actually only tried at 25, after everything else failed. and it showed me the spiritual side of life with its perception changes. It fucking saved my life. I fucks with me,.. She, fucks with me. The downs, the paranoids, the anxiety, the weed hangovers, but damn. So what if people become lazy stoners and sit around... guess what, they wont. Sitting around is fucking BORING. As a depressed medically sick note autismo gibs not having my job anymore at kfc sucks ass. I miss it, but I dont miss any sort of letting some bitches and wanks verbally rub their nutsack on my face just to keep happy a bit. I need to find their names dude and get some one on one, the stories of others, not just boring college people. all the same shit, REAL people living at 48 working at fucking kfc in the kitchen. Now thats the guy I want to talk to.

Women. If my dick never got hard for women, I'd probably like less of them. fair statement, would go both ways. I like their... emotions, fuck its hard to differentiate when your dick in your brain spazies out when you try think about a girl man im fucking neutring you dude nah im not chill my .... no, racism is... it can be funny if it isnt bullying, like joking amongst buddies. Taking the shit outta each other. Im watching some korean lol streamer called Rush, and he keeps calling americans fatty burger faces. Now thats funny, im uk and im shit teeth yellow and drink tea, but from scotland too so im a ginger FREEEEEEEEDDOOOOMMMMM  intoxicated drunk Irish singing partners grandad. 

But women,, fuckkk. Guys are funnier dude, I laugh and joke so make dudes. Some women are out of this word funny, but they aint the comedians on tv they are real life Holemies. I added the girl my sister works with right, if thats you then go ahead message me btch but Im not going long term I do not believe in it humans are fleeting energy dancing between chaos and order and chaos and order cannot fucking stay together especially my parents man.

I cant even remember them fighting but im so sure i used to cover my ears with my pillow to hear them stfu. I told my dad about my mums over abusive behaviour, he says stuff like western daddy dad, chin up, look after your mum she doesnt mean it, sticks and stones (I want to puke at that sht, id rather get my arm broken than this suffering of my soul if feels like im not alive or dead but again in the middle, suborbatory or some sht whatever that christmas thing is.

I want some homies to talk to, and hollies. Im white so i dont get black culture too much i dont listen to rap music except nicki minaj she is best rapper. Anyway, Queen were a great band but Coldplay I fucking loved dude. Their first album, sends me away from my pains and merges with the pain of everyone feeling the same frequency of pain and says ""its ok to feel this, we are here together, you are not alone, you can calm down your nervous system"" where as my body now is like fuck you this is my nervous system bitch overclock this son of a gun lets go fucking nuts.

Ofc this is the id that Frued refers to in his psychotherapy works, the id, subconscious and conscious.

My central nervous system is like... fried man. Fucking might as well be a chicken at least id be tastier. Like wtf man i have to take an ssri, a newly invented drug to not kill myself? What would I have done 100 years ago? Fucking, I'd probably have killed myself or alcoholic. My mums Dad was alcoholic, died from liver alcohol damage. My mums brother was a heroin addict, died 6 months after his mum died (my mums mum, my gran, blood relative). My poor mum. My poor uncle. Heroin man, he got into weed at 12 and then into heroin just naw fuck society. I'm on a razors edge between the same fate. Tried Codeine I hate that warm euphorice hazy sht it reminds me of Breaking Bad scene floating and sht and hell naw I prefer benzos but that sht meant to be worse than heroin withdrawal. going to get off them soon when I get back into meditation.

I tried self medicating in Novermber after I asked a Psychiatrist twice for help, twice 2 years ago, plenty of GPs. I respect benzos are dangerous, I havent withdrawn from any yet just some etizolam and vals to help that rollercoaster of xanax (never used) style ups and downs with th short half life.

Met a guy on the bus the day before I quit KFC. was going to hospital with 30 vals for her. He said ""I bet you think im just some annoying cunt hurry the fk up and stfu get out my way"". I looked him dead in the eye (I was on a bit of Etiz tbh so that helped me not freak out) and said ""I see everyone as the same"". His face paused, eyes locked on me, expressionless. I wonder if anyone had ever told this man he is loved. He looked fucked up by drugs. Ive stopped teh description cus as I said internet is  aplace of everyone and maybe drug kings reading this sht like yeah boy i got a new homie to smack up, so hell naw I want to work for Jessie Pinkman tho that crew was sound (Glasgowegian term: Sound = cool = No problemo = Love thy neighbour). Id watch that show again just the drama is fucking booorrrinnggg second time walters wife and my hatred for women man fuck me it gets toastie in my nervous system it wants to fucking flying of the face of the earth to fucking Neptune to cool down a bit. Dude im pretty sober now, this is just insomnia and my autismo mind. Im sorta high IQ, my mom says im pretty. My dad says im smart. My friend says im funny. Some girl says im so big, girls, thats a compliment we want to here man our fucking chimp brain implodes and we feel like Zues pounding the mother earth (my greek mythology sucks sorry if it sucks reference).

I'd like to hug a girl, sure whatever sex is great but not without complications, id like to share silently, explore, meditate, just fucking be without wanting something all the timee. But where are these girls, and where the fuck is my self-esteem dude gimmie dat back dats mine bro. I feel my mom took my self-esteem, crushed my soul with her black heart and death vibes with her postnatal depression, furthter depression, chronic anxiety and just taking that shit out on your kids is shit. 

I got into trouble at school a lot, wait sht, talk about women again. boobs are nice, bagina is nice, butt nice, leg, feet, hand, neck, head, hair, only bit  women i dont like i probably her poops and her brain. But thats not fair just a quick joke man, shes a man-eater look out boy here she comes. What the fuck did she do to me. I've always been shy, sensitive I think, but, just, crushed in confidence. I loved my dad so much I didnt want anything in my life to harm him. My mum..... she told me she bottle fed me cus breast feeding too sore, dont know significance but I understand. Again I forgive my mother for everything her childhood sounds shit, alcholic dad never home, emotionally abusive mom with .. having a fag lads. Dont smoke just during high stress cus i dont get addicted and confident i can quit, quit job at kfc cus bully managers, girls im a steal come get me. Actually dont im scared of you all i know the potential for girls to get into my emotional ""heart"" and wreck it ralph for funsies, well not funsies its fantasy acted out in reality unfortunately of suffering. 

Dude ive had dreams of cutting dead bodies up for art like on Dexter, necrophelia, stupid fucking freudian big fucking black trains cus i went on 4chan al last summer and always blacked pictures fuck that site its funny tho seen a random soldier steal a tank like on gta never for reported to national news dont think but was unreal. he was drunk he was just trollin bro, lighten up usa. fucking, soldiers. I wont say much. I dont know if the deep cia etc really care about da normie or da autismo internetster or just care about his/her paycheck cocaine and probably lighting up a jay. I mean how can a deep state person start a family, its suicicde dude. We all the same family. if earth blows up, we reconnect with the univerese. the tragedy of self-conscoius life ends. something else happens.

If I have a family holy shit id love my kids so much it would hurt me, i might e ven suduko cus of current mental illness in future relapse, or wife is like my mom in which case i fucking take several lines of cocaine, go strippers, shit what else you do in gta, fucking dirt bike to top of mountain and jump off and glide, steal a plane with a horse with no name and 9/11 into home street to say what up to my mates.

See I fucking, well, i didtched all my homies i grew up with. most of them got into hard drugs, my best mate is now blind, blinded by his gf smacking him with a phone into a coma. i fucking seen him in the indian shop the other day, i was in there with him. he didnt know i was there. I didnt talk to him. That cunt bullied the shit out of me when younger, maybe my mum fucked up but this guy took out my butt plug and shoved it somwhere nasty like... clintons pussie? yikes. dude politics is fucking something man, this timeline, putin, trump, brexit, shit is suck tho so much suffering.

so

so much.

If I talk shit for 28000 words then come to this realisation then its worth to me man, its a shit truth tho. life is suffering.

#on lsd, i felt for 30 mins at the peak of the trip in a place of no where. i didnt feel anything inside me, no soul etc.

~I was like ""go get some water"" and then the body was like ""why dude"" and so I just stood bent over in one position for 30 mins my legs in pain but again my brain say ""im in pain bro quick gimme some luba luba from yo moma"" but  I just accepted it and stayed silent, still, present, eckhart tolle id take his dick. buddhas too i tihnk althought probably lot of shit going on in tibet with gangs and that sht he has to support or help  i dont know.

hey cia, mk ultra only read a little bit but you wanted to use them on soldiers in war like nam? cod world at war/black ops 1 story was fucking cool man mason the numbers reminded of mk ultra like shit. good story line. Im mentally ill so I could be getting sent 5g signals to fuck me up oh shit dont say it noo immmmmm gooinnggggggggg.......







hitler? why are you in heaven? Like dude I know you had mother issues like me, you wanted to be artist and you werent good enoughs o shit dude, i seen ur paintings and they were good i thought, keep your head up. I know your dead and shit but we are all fucking one. Im no nazi, no isis, no  anarchist,  shit what am I. Awakened? Spiritually? Do girls dig that sht? Its a pretty painful experience like it aint pretty realising time is eternity and always now and everything else in mind is an illusion, perhaps consciousness itself. I mean as long as I get sex tho right. High give my bros...

chap ... chap ...

Are you Mr Blue? 

why yes and you are?

Im mr going to round house kick you into your mirror cus you knocked my daughter up.

wel sheet the condom just kill it man its no fun get abortion.

Is abortion bad though, like really. I dont think so. I kill life everyday by being alive. organisms die in my bodies defence. whatever idc.

Suicide though, like what the fuck. I mean im doing alright just now i suppose, cant complain (3000 word complaint btw)said to my therapist suicide should be allowed, its not fair on the patient.Why do people have to stay alive, there is nothing in meditation or in the state i felt in lsd that said life is a must. On that LSD dude, I tried to move but either my mind said or I realised ""I dont have to mve"" but I was like dude lets go lets take a piss man and my conscoiusness was like like ""no, you watch this, shut up, learn, just, be"".

So I did that and I grew from it. being in pain and being alright? Pain an illusion? So many less medications. I want my brain back dude. Most people I was competing with in my classes went on to get degrees and are doctors, laywers, sceintists and Im fucking, worked in mcdonalds could keep it down, kfc twice nope, deliver china man food nope, help old women with their shits and food no that was too hard but most rewarding. cex was alright just bully manager was a bint although, w.e. I want to play teemo jungle man. I want to level 2/3/4 gank all lanes with red buff and smite, spam laugh, raise emote and mastery.

I also want to say.Space. Everything. Emotions. People. Just breathe.. All we know for sure is our most ancient know and this is of breath, maybe. shit i need some meds or somethin getting bit dizzy. sht what is it.diazepam i think just 5mg should do.its only 10am//// what the fuck. I mean ill take 5mg of valium sure but kinda sucks seems like a sorta intense w.d.

Pregabalin was interesting, good and bad. good it fucking works mate if you like Phenibut then this will give you some extra resilience that according to Jordan Peterson you would have if you didnt get shat on your whole like mentally. Mums job to raise childs mental. She should of protected me ebtter. Now I play childrens video game, over 6660 hours. 900$ down. free game, how did fiddle even lose. WTF is the toxicity in this game im feeling anxious, I used like 3mg etizolam like 10 hours ago so hey its probably that, i take so valium or some etiz or that drug clonazepam i got to stop spasms in my sleep. 

Dude meditation when you get into it is better than any drug. Its just getting past the point of using drugs to get by man.      Fucking vision if fucking up man like i close my eyes open then room spins. Alcohol does that, maybe gaba drug, prob etiz couple hours to go for pregabalin, shit this sucks.

dude i better not be illt or  osme sht.

i feel like sht, but since that lsd i well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, im fucking nodding dude. i had 3 cups coffe 2 modafinil. Fucking etizolam this is what i mean it can fuck u up 2 weeks use not even every day max dose 8mg a day.

I got etiz for Insomnia! actually relevent! I kept going into work with no sleep staying up 30 hours + before start shift etc. 2 secs my face burning up dont run out of benzos kids.

Cool took  5mg diazepam, you know dude if my post gets deleted ill be pissed, but at least if a mod can read ill will feel better, say something gay like ""chin up bud"" or ""its ok man, Ill come over to your house and give u the giraffe, i know your not gay but you said butthole pleasure (gta vice city, radio right? Listen to gta radio now folks, playing the game tho is kinda, dude it pretty bad)

Im fucking pissed at games nowadays man. Microtransactions and loots, fucking dlcs, season passes, give me a full fucking game like I used to get with the customisation built in and not all about graphics ok man? GTA4 story was great and the airport was so much fun on multiplayer, I watched DansGaming and Forsen on twitch.tv play gta4 again and as an adult and like 10 years old that sht was still releveant and entertaining as fk.

really shows you with gta5. the fuck was that game dude. im driving around with sweet graphics jumping into army base to steal a jet, get out, get jumbo plain fly about, hey cool. The story tho? I like the white mafia guy aigh? He goes to see a therapist or something, probably court ordered right unlike myself *tips Benadryl* or some insomnia meme I dont want cringe shit Im from twitch chat 7 years running dude i know my shit never modded either i suck no ones dick but my own once just the tip it was aight just fleshy and warm.

Oh dude I think that etizolam w.d is going away man. that sht was like getting into a pretty bad lsd trip. fucking vision darting around, like when your really, really  REALLY drunk and your vision keeps fucking going up and down like yoyo and its funny as fuck but scary as hell. Yeh, that shit, bright lights sucked and headache. 

Only reason I got benzo as i was saying, and its Etizolam, was because of working. I have chronic insomnia lads/laddetes/oneness/future hot gamer gf who is turned on by my autism means wtf is wrong with her fucking run it sthe cia knock knock motha fucka I gonna wreck ur house and steal your lidl pc to find you bought a fucking dildo. Hmm. I wonder if sex toys in the uk especially will remain legal.

Auto women are becoming a thing, they have to be banned, absolutely. Im fucking mi5.mi6 and my population dont need the drama and mindless stress and pain that keeps them confused and wagecucking to pay for the worlds shitty karma. I wanted to join raf man as pilot. dad got me a shitty laptop from work for peanuts (very cheap uk slang) and i went to game shop, 3 pc games for 10 pound jismed man. Theme hopsital, flight simulator 98, the sims. Throw in age of empires 2 man I back in the late 90s, friends still on, charlie sheen no melt down yet, no 9/11. 

I typed some sht man but need to tidy and smarten up a bit or some paramedic gonna come. I want a hooker man. I need some pussy. I dont need just really want on biological need level. constant incessant noise in my head (grab her by pussy) oh sht im definitely banned from reddit now no pls not back to 4chan and pol/r9k its fucking exhausting getting by all the shills and tribalism. 

On that, what the fuck are we all thinking. Immigration at level never seen. Total culture shift in 1 generation. Once white dudes stop going to football and get all tribal on peoples ass theres gonna be gangs popping up. I mean there already is drugs gangs from asia and rape/child sht from middle east north africa right? I dont know what to say about that.

Dude insomnia is a killer illness literally. Look at my delerium, well most just excess mumbling autismo (no sure reddit is ok with calling anything stupid anything other than ""stupid"" which is double standard, stupid people arent stupid by choice, its discriminatory and we have a duty to look after stupid people). Some people think of masterrace of high IQ, I mean like, skt want 5 fakers, argentina want 11 messies even in goal that dude run up the post overhead kick from the bar to save penalty.

I said i took 5mg valium right?hmm. I have been up for 3 days, typing like a true autismo right now. My mom even asked if I thought I might be autstic last year, I mean I understand her concern, but that fact she caused the majority of my psychological damage, well her, Chris, Dad wasn't perfect he got scary and sectarian and I want to see him actually, need to get my benzo right can be having fucking shitty lsd trip at 10am 8-9 hours after dropping about 4 mg etizolam, kindling perhaps.

Phenibut is suchan awesome substance, Phenibut, Caffeine, (no order) Modafinil, and Pregabalin dude. I was meditating (just breath concentration focus  meditation on breath no gomba stomp awoooa throat swallowing shit and while I noticed little to no changes over the month, when I stopped, dude I fucking felt psychotic the thoughts just coming in like whot he fuk you think you are my mother? who didnt respect my personal boundaries as a child treating me as a secondary human being rather than an actual person. Fuck man. Life. Its not her fault. She had her own trauma. Now her son is using benzos to try fucking manage mama mia!

Anyway pregs was good to 450mg for a few weeks when i was meditation, my back started to like give up in strength and my body jolted away, this was super intrusive to my meditation and triggered me. I wanted to get back down to 300mg or 150mg but as soon as I started dropping the dosage my sleep went to shit and I already had insomniai so that was fucking fun jesus. Got etiz to make sure, twice a week , i can get some fucking sleep fo im not up for 80 hours working 3./4 shifts. Alas, feel kinda memory fucked after etiz and foggy, might be better just stayin up. Phenibut, coffee, modafinil, paracetamol, ibuprofen, propranolol. Great kit for you to have to do stuff when you get no sleep. Also working twice a week, Phenibut gains no tolerance used twice a week and no more vast majority of people. So you take that befoer you sleep and you wake up ready to go to work regardless of shit mood and sleep.

Gonna smoke some, play some teemo jungle idk man,60-70 hours awake. Add me on reddit         xxxx

"Waking up every other hour, scared it might be apnea but can’t afford sleep study test?","I don’t feel out of breath. Just waking up right after a dream wide awake. I do have slight sweating at night which is weird because it’s usually cold in my room, does this happen to anyone else? It’s pretty annoying and I start to think of the worst outcome when I keep waking up either sweaty or ill wake up mad knowing I can’t even afford to get looked at to see IF something is wrong since I have a dr bill of around $500 I have to pay off first.."
Please help me sleep,"I’m losing my mind. This is the third time this week I’m destined for zero sleep, and these next two weeks are incredibly busy with grad school deadlines. I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve tried every breathing exercise on the planet, drunk gallons of chamomile tea, taken a million “relaxing” showers, the usual basic shit. If my body decides it’s not going to sleep, there’s nothing I can do. The only thing that has ever worked is sometimes I get so upset that I cry so hard that I throw up and then after that sometimes I can get an hour of sleep. But lately I can’t even cry, I just lie motionless for eight hours until it’s time to screw up another day.

Part of my job sometimes involves scuba diving, usually early in the morning. So I can’t use sleep drugs or alcohol to make me sleep, or hit myself in the head with a cast iron pan (if I could I’d probably be an alcoholic by now). I don’t know what to do. Guess at this point my only hope is finding someone with a magic wand but maybe someone knows a secret I don’t."
It always comes back.,"Been sleeping fine for a few months now but I knew it would come back and sure enough it has.  No real rhyme or reason to it.  Went to sleep Monday night and slept fine for 5 hours before I woke up and tossed and turned for awhile.  That left me tried yesterday and being tired is my number 1 culprit for further insomnia.  Nothing worse then when you begin to think about sleep at 10:00 am at work.

&#x200B;

Sure enough, got into bed, and every time I tried to doze off I got that charge of adrenaline in my chest.  1.5 mg of Ativan later I guess I drifted off around 2:30 for about 5 hours.  It wasn't refreshing, and I'm a zombie again, and I have already begun to think about sleep tonight.

&#x200B;

It's a hellish cycle, and it's difficult to break once you are in it.  I know I will break it, as I always do, but it sucks being in the middle."
Long term use with melatonin,My doctor told me long term use of melatonin is fine. But I’ve heard otherwise. What do you guys think? 
Thought this would make us chuckle,"No idea how to cross post, sorry.

I wrote something about my insomnia,"I was...out of it last night and did some writing; I wrote something very brief about my insomnia. 

Sleep, deep dreams, my muse and one true love. Brings me a new day fueled by vigor. I hardly knew thee, our untimely divorce exacerbated by this wretched hissing in my ears. Forever keeping my love and I apart. 

They prescribed me medications to reunite us my love. But ultimately our love is limited, nay, forbidden. For the homeostatic drives keeps us apart, no matter how short those pills reunite us. It seems destiny that we stay apart. Doomed to rot away to the sands of time segregated by this cursed sound barrier.  


It’s a bit silly I know but I just want some feedback on my writing."
I'm so /tired/ of Insomnia,"Get it? *Tired* of Insomnia... ayyyy

But that's the thing though isn't it, I'm *not* tired. Not at all. I'm pretty sure I could go days without feeling sleepy if I let myself. 

I first had trouble sleeping when I was a tween. I was showing signs of aggressions and was starting to get lower grades in schools so my parents took me to a doctor who (after a few tests and scans) discovered I hadn't been falling into deep sleep / getting any REM sleep for a *long* time. It was resolved easily enough when I just stopped drinking any caffeine at all and went on medication for ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression (all of which I was diagnosed with as well at that time), but the doctors said I'd have still some brain damage because of it (which is extra great considering I already had that from a head injury year prior).

As a teen I actually hardly ever had a problem falling asleep, no more than the average person at least, but I would still choose (like the dumbass I was) to only get a few hours of sleep a night. I didn't realize how lucky I was to even have the choice.

It wasn't until I got into college that it really got bad. My anxiety spiked my freshman year which made it really hard to fall asleep. I figured I'd try to take melatonin, but, of course, after only a few days of taking it every night I became dependent on it so I'd need to take more and more to feel anything. I remember there were times that I could have gone days not feeling tired or sleeping if I let myself. After fainting in my dorm in the Spring, my roommate convinced me to see the on campus doctor. To be honest I hardly remember the appointment I was so out of my mind, I just remember her basically telling me what I already knew and offering to give me muscle relaxers and me denying it. However, one thing good did come out the appointment. After that appointment, I ended up skipping my classes for the day and just going home and I got the *best* four hours of straight sleep I'd gotten in months. After that I was finally able to start sleeping again. Until last semester that is.

Last semester was likely my worst semester health wise. I was having a lot of physical problems as well as mental and it eventually lead up to insomnia again. I would wake up every few hours with feelings of guilt and stress and self-loathing and spend another few hours getting myself to fall asleep again. My psychiatrist eventually prescribed me Trazodone which REALLY helped oh my god it was like a miracle drug... until I tried to go off it.

I started having the same issue I had with melatonin, needing to keep taking more to feel sleepy. My anxiety has gone down quite a bit this semester so I figured it wouldn't hurt to see how I went without the medication for a while. Oh boy did I realize what a world of hurt I was in. I do not feel sleepy AT ALL and I've only been sleeping for an hour or two at a time for weeks. I've started to write it all down in a journal and I get, on average, 6 hours of sleep a week, occasionally I'll even get a dream. Even now when I've resorted to taking benadryl and even melatonin (which I *had* sworn off after last year's predicament), I only feel delirious and loopy, not sleepy. I've started to develop eczema and my hair is falling out so this morning I decided f\*ck it I'm going to the pharmacy to pick up my trazodone refill and I'll try to slowly edge my way off of it because obviously going cold turkey isn't working.

Anyway, most people on this subreddit have super similar stories so it's not like this is anything special. I'm very sure I'll be fine eventually. I'm really just damn frustrated that this keeps happening, and I'm sure it'll happen again.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Tl;dr - I need medication to be sane but the medication eventually keeps me from sleeping normally."
Waking up scared and sweaty.,"I'm coming off a pretty big binge. I suffer with alcoholism. I'm on valium to manage withdrawals. But for the past 3 nights I've been waking up after about 20 minutes of sleep with weird scary visions and I'll wake up with my heart racing and full of sweat and shakey. 

I usually drink to help me sleep and control anxiety but it was getting out of hand so I need to stop. 

Anyone else have this? I'm laying here in a cold sweat shaking and trying not to cry. "
Thoughts keeping me awake (help),"It’s 05:44 rn. Can’t sleep. How do y’all cope with thoughts that keep you awake?? Do you just block them out?
Also, how can you have a fixed sleeping schedule no matter what? Like, sleeping and waking up at the same time every day. "
It's 2 am and I can't sleep,"Everyday it's the same cycle! Get to bed by 10pm. Toss and turn until 2am. Sleep? Can't be seen far and wide. Then have to wake up early for work at 8am. Wake up Jared. Overload on coffee, get head ache and acidity. Pass the day at work somehow tired and annoyed. Come home, repeat. I'm so sick of this! "
Reading while waiting for sleep?,"First off. Really insomnia? Really? Your an a-hole.

Asleep at 10. Wide awake at 12:30.

Ok so onto my question.

I'd love to read before bed, or when I wake up (as watching TV isn't really enough to occupy me right now)

But wouldn't bright light mess with my chance of falling back asleep? 

And how do I get enough light to read without severely pissing of my SO who has to wake up early for work and is already enjoying my middle of the night fidgeting? 

Going into another room isn't always possible (as I'm currently in a studio size in-law ""apartment"" with my parents in the main house (while I help them out (and I have less bill stress tbh)). My children, sorry sorry.... My parents, have incredible odd sleep schedules and are generally not conducive to sleep while running amok in the house.


Also, yes yes a reading light, but any other options until I leave my cave and remember to get one while out? Or any specific suggestions on what kind to get? "
Coukdnt sleep all night and jow I'm tired,"I couldn't sleep at all last night. It's 8 am where I live right now and I'm just getting tired. My mom told me to just stay up until 8 pm tonight but I don't know if it's a good idea. I have hallucinations and severe anxiety when I'm sleep deprived.

 Should I just sleep and get stuff done tonight? (Laundry, job hunting, etc.)

Edit: I couldn't sleep all night and now I'm tired. I must really be tired. I didn't notice the misspellings in the title until I posted it haha."
Insomnia is back...,"About 2 years ago I had a bout of insomnia and only slept 8 hours in 96. I thought I was going insane. My doctor prescribed 15mg of tamazepam and it did the job. Now I’ve only slept no more than about 4-4.5 hours since Friday morning (it’s Tuesday). I have leftover meds from the last time (technically expired because it’s been over a year) and now they aren’t helping. I’ve even doubled up to take 30mg and nothing. 

I’m between doctors, meaning I have an appointment as a new patient with a GP NEXT Friday...still a week and a half away. 

I’ve tried physically exhausting myself at the gym, sleepy time tea, OTC stuff, nothing. I’m tired as hell and lay down but the sleep just never comes. Idk what to do. Took the day off work today to try and sleep but it’s 2:30pm now and still nothing. When is the ER an option??"
It feels like I'll never recover unless I'm on stimulants for the rest of my life,"I have the biggest bags under my eyes, I mispell everything, I have no energy, I'm incredibly stupid. I've read endless studies talking about how you can't make up lost sleep, so am I just doomed?"
"Can not fall asleep, too tired to get out of bed",Kill me
"This is a cry for help, please read","I slept only one hour. And the night before that I literally got zero sleep. I'm not talking 1-3 hours of sleep, I mean ZERO. And yet i'm not tired. My eyes feel like they're burning and my whole body aches but i'm not sleepy. I never get the heavy eyes feeling anymore. I think i've been like this for two years already and i'm getting fed up.

I'm not the only one, right? I'm not the only one staying up for 2-3 days with zero sleep? 

I don't know what to do. Nothing helps. None of this natural supplement shit and sleep hygiene or whatever. And I can't take benzos because i'm a really small, very underweight girl and i'm afraid something might happen to me if I take some. I mean i'm literally idk 85-90 lbs at 5'3

Also this night, I had my first ever nightmare..I was with my friends and we were knees deep in SHIT and literally just throwing..shit at ourselves for no fucking reason. What the actual fuck? Later in my nightmare, i'm home and i'm like fucking dying or something, I don't know, it felt like I was dying, I couldn't breathe and I was in tears just begging to my mom to take me to the hospital and she was just sobbing and hugging me

I'm still shaking. Death is my biggest fear and especially death from lack of sleep, which I almost every day worry about.

What do I do if I don't sleep this night as well? Can I go to the urgent care for 3 days no sleep and how can they help me??

Fatal insomnia wiki page,Can someone delete it? Honestly it’s pointless. It’s a fatal rarest disease that is completely random. It’s not doing anything but scaring insomniacs into panic attacks and worsening their sleep problems.
Can’t sleep,I have been on night shift for the last 11 years. I work 4 days and get 3 days off. I can never sleep like a normal person. I have tried and tried but nothing helps it’s 2am now and I still can sleep. Hopefully I can change shifts at work and try and get my sleeping habits back to normal. 
"Ive got Extremely severe Insomnia, please help.","- sorry this is a wee bit long.
I've had insomnia for most of my life. I'll hopefully be going to university soon and I want to try and  fix it before I leave.

I have gone a week and often days and days without any sleep at all. I start to hallucinate and the lot. Really would appreciate ANY recommendations for getting to sleep.

I've been on two rounds of different meds. They stopped working shortly after taking them because when I'm feeling v v down (I have depression so this unfortunately happens often) not sleeping is self inflicted. I get into a routine of no sleep and then passing out in lessons and getting a good half hour or so at school. Sometimes my sleep comes and is okay for a week and all is well.

Just any tips please, it's already ruined my life, I'm surprised I'm still in school. I'm pretty much almost not. Just have to pass these exams.

Thanks :)

My sleep journal of sorts,"I want to try a new sleeping ritual, I haven't slept well in years (I'm 18 now and fifth grade is when I reeaally remember watching my alarm clock tick up until about 1-1:30 every night) My sleep schedule ebbs and flows -- summers I sleep better because I can sleep in -- but now, senior year, I want to try to get into a more habitual nighttime routine and hopefully teach myself how to sleep better for the rest of my life. Here's a list of things I want to try to do for at least a week:
(I'm sure I'll change this list as needed, but for now this feels like a start)


9:30 - take 10mg melatonin and use some herbal mouth spray that supposedly aids sleep.

9:30-10:30 - smoke, play on the internet, do whatever I want (within reason). 

10:30 - brush my teeth (and floss EVERY NIGHT [!] )

10:30-11:00 - read, meditate, draw; basically do anything that isn't on a screen. 

11:00 - lights out. One more spray of the spray stuff (per instructions on bottle), and a quick prayer to the universe (I'm an atheist, but I believe nightly prayer has its benefits)

At some point between 9:30 and 11 - drink a full bottle of water and (if needed) write in my journal



I'll update y'all on my progress, I want to do exactly this^ for one week and see how I like it. Next Sunday I'll see if there is anything I want to add in or stop doing entirely. Wish me luck! :)"
Full moon eclipse and insomnia,"I’m curious, anyone here have an extra difficult time with sleep last night? I didn’t sleep at all :/ but I didn’t realize it was a full moon until morning.

My parents found out about my insomnia,"So my parents tend to unintentionally say extremely inappropriate things about mental illness generally, and as a result I have a hard time talking to them about it. 

But, then they got a bill for my hospital stay (I'm a student, so still on my parents' insurance) that was because of alcohol/adderall/wanting death. I can't talk to them about my illicit drug use, so I told them I was super panicky, I mixed my insomnia meds (gabapentin) with ibuprofen pm (I do this regularly, so it wasn't a total lie), and they talked to me about the dangers of drug mixing, and gave me a couple suggestions on calming panic/getting to sleep. 

Anyway, one of the suggestions was a white noise machine. Have any of you tried those? What did you think? Did something specific make you feel better or was it just completely meh? Thanks! 

Sidenote: I know I should talk to my family about my actual issues, but I've recently had a rediagnosis and am generally not okay with my mental state. I will talk to them eventually. I love them and don't want them to be worried about something they can't control/help.

Nightmares have started ruining my life. Please help.,"So I have no trouble falling asleep. I take Vistaril for anxiety, right before bed which helps. But the past week or so, I’ve had nightmares. Every. Single. Night. They consume every minute that I’m asleep. I feel like I must’ve woken up around 15 times last night alone. 

Now, I recently went under some really stressful stuff, but stress hasn’t ever caused nightmares like this before. It started with nightmares relating to my life, like my dad dying and my husband leaving me/selling the house. But they’ve started getting worse. Last night I was kidnapped and tortured by a serial killer. Every time I woke up, no matter how long I was awake, falling back asleep put me back in the dream, exactly where I left off. 

Aside from the stress, nothing has changed in my life. No new meds, no diet or exercise changes, no schedule changes. 

I’m so tired, but I know that going to sleep is just going to give me nightmares. I’m not above drugging myself or drinking before bed. I just need advice. "

"SEVERE sleep anxiety and insomnia for ~2 weeks, now finally sleeping daily -- what worked for me.","I'm writing this to help anyone who might be going through something similar. **NOTE:** This is not directed towards people who suffer insomnia where their sleep rhythms are extended or delayed and/or simply aren't tired at normal times of day. This is for insomnia sufferers who ARE TIRED who want nothing more than to sleep, but simply can't or have trouble crossing over due to anxiety, fears, and worries related to sleep.

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a 30 year old, bodybuilder, never had problems with sleep outside of NOT being sleepy at the right times and being an occasional night owl. Long story short, did a huge diet switch to keto (which, due to the lack of carbs, causes a large reduction in water weight, and a huge loss in minerals), and eliminated pretty much all vegetables. I went mostly carnivore and planned to slowly introduce foods back in to experiment and see if I had any food intolerances. At the time I had no idea how important electrolyte balance was and wasn't focusing on them. Ultimately I became severely magnesium deficient to the point of developing heart palpitations, unexplained irritability, and severe muscle cramps. At the time, I wasn't working and ostensibly had no major stresses in my life. I saved up a ton of money in my graphic design job in the previous year and was essentially ""coasting"" after being laid off to focus on myself and rebalance mentally. Ironically enough...it lead to the darkest, most traumatic experience I've had thus far in my life (more on this later).

My big mistake was underestimating the stresses I was putting my body through. For starters, the ketogenic metabolic change is a HUGE stress. Imagine eating the standard American diet (high carb) for 30 years and suddenly stopping... Now, I don't wanna get into the science because there are plenty of resources detailing this already, but a massive metabolic shift occurs when switching to low carb, which depletes a lot of minerals and can cause you to feel awful for a few weeks. It's called the ""keto flu"" and is extremely common with first-time keto dieters. I went through this, but on top of that, I kept up with my heavy workout regiment. This was borderline overtraining. The kicker is this: a lifetime of playing high-stress competitive games, working out all my adult life, and barely eating magnesium-rich foods meant I was already low magnesium, but the recent keto change seemed to be the final nail in the coffin that pushed me into severe deficiency and caused more serious symptoms. 

This eventually triggered a panic attack that came out of nowhere. My guess is that the heart palpitations (which I had for about 3-4 weeks) constantly worried me and eventually triggered panic attack symptoms. Normally I'm emotionally resilient, and very stoic. I've had short bouts of depression through most of my adult life, but nothing I'd called ""clinical"". other than that I've had no mental health issues, no anxiety, nothing. And yet somehow...a panic attack snuck up on me. This is when I learned how important minerals were. When it came, I thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die, so it was traumatic. Went to the ER, did an overnight stay, and the typical panic attack rigamaroo where you think you're dying but the doctors say you're 100% fine and that it's all in your head. At the time I resented that, but when I got home, after the doctors found nothing, I started having panic and anxiety symptoms at home, and after a few hours of research, I realized, shit, this is actually a thing. My personality went from masculine, sarcastic, and stoic, to fearful, panicky, constantly ruminating in negative thoughts, worried, needy, emotional, etc. Absolutely NO LIBIDO, NO HUNGER, just constant fear and being way too deep in my own head to enjoy anything. That entire first week was nothing more than severe chronic anxiety. I mean, SEVERE....I was in fight-or-flight from the moment I woke up, 'til the time I fell asleep. The entire week I was getting horrible sleep 1-2 hours at best, then waking up from shortness of breath and elevated heart rates. My heart would start racing every time I went to sleep, or even thought about sleep, and this eventually developed into a form of sleep anxiety where my brain learned to associate sleep with fear.

This is when the real problems started. A full week later, after a week of awful sleep, I was severely deprived, so I attempted to go to sleep, and for 16 hours straight, the same thing kept happening. I'd lay down, heart would start racing, body would go into full panic and fight-or-flight, and I'd be wide awake from the stress hormones, and eventually calm down 15-20 minutes later to be SEVERELY EXHAUSTED, rinse and repeat. This has never happened to me before, and I legitimately thought my brain was broken. I couldn't fall asleep for the life of me. Even lying in bed for 2-3 hours straight, perfectly still, my brain just couldn't shut off. This is when I found out what ACTUAL insomnia was. I desperately wanted sleep more than anything, but couldn't get there no matter how hard I tried, and the worse it became, the more nervousness and anxiety I built up around it...which of course works against you. I used to think I was an insomniac when I stayed up all night playing video games 'til 6am and had to wake at 8am, but NOPE, not even close... now I knew what real insomnia was. The 16 hours ATTEMPTING to sleep eventually drove me crazy, and sent my panic and anxiety into overdrive. I ended up calling 911 begging and pleading with them to find a way to put me to sleep. 

If you told me two weeks prior that I'd be pacing back and forth, sleep deprived, panic-ridden, talking to myself, ruminating, catastrophizing, and slowly becoming suicidal, I would have laughed in your face, yet that's exactly what happened. This taught me that ANYONE could become ""crazy"" under the right circumstances. I was eventually released from the hospital with a trazodone prescription the next morning around 8am (been up for roughly 40 hours now) and eventually ended up passing out around 12pm for about 1-2 hours of awful sleep.

The trauma of everything spiraled into insomnia and severe sleep anxiety for the next few weeks. I lived my life in 30 to 40 hour panic-ridden ""phases"" with maybe 2-3 hours of sleep in between for the entire first week. It was awful. At the same time I decided I needed to beat this, despite feeling like total shit, panicky, fearful, etc. I had enough presence of mind to go on a strict protocol to fix everything and return back to normal ASAP. Below is what worked for me.  


**HOW I GOT BACK TO NORMALCY FAIRLY QUICKLY:** 

**NOTE:** The panic attacked happened December 21st, second ER visit with the insomnia freakout was December 28th and today is January 20th, so it's about a full month later. Chronic anxiety, heart palpitations, and insomnia are pretty much gone. I'm sleeping every night for 5-7 hours, which compared to before is amazing. Even bad sleep is better than no sleep. My life is mostly back to normal and I can function and do my daily activities fine, and after 3 weeks, I can actually laugh again and enjoy life. WOW. It's still a bit fresh so it can still take me up to 2 hours to fall asleep at times, but I eventually always pass out, so I no longer worry about it. I've made big changes however and I'll detail them below.

**1. It is absolutely crucial to make sure your magnesium intake is very high.** If you have anxiety, your appetite probably isn't the greatest, and even if you're eating a healthy diet, you're likely to be magnesium deficient simply due to soil depletion and the fact that none of us really know if our foods are growing in mineral-rich soils. This is why I highly recommend supplementation of this crucial mineral. I use 'Natural Calm', and take 300-600mg daily. Why so much? Because I'm also a bodybuilder and am using what you'd call a ""therapeutic"" dose to recover from the traumatic panic/anxiety episode a few weeks ago caused by a severe deficiency, and many expert think the USDA RDA of 400mg is way too low, ESPECIALLY if you're going through a high stress period. This helped TREMENDOUSLY the first two weeks. You literally can feel a calming sensation take over you, and your thoughts become ""lighter"". Magnesium pushes calcium out of cells and nerve tissue so you're less reactive to stimuli, if that makes sense. The biochemistry is explained, but there's no real way to explain it to most people other than it feels like magic and takes effect very quickly. It felt like my body was so starved for this nutrient that it gobbled it up and put it to work immediately. My palpitations disappeared in a day after I started supplementation. It took a bit longer for everything else (because it's also partly psychological) but it helped tremendously with being clear minded enough to take a more objective look at the anxiety and insomnia.  


Go on Amazon and look at the countless reviews for the various magnesium products and you'll see thousands of people raving about magnesium's positive effect on their mood,  insomnia and anxiety. If you can't supplement, add a few mag-rich foods to your diet. These include bananas, avocados, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, spinach, etc.   


There's boatloads of clinical and anecdotal evidence out there on the associations between magnesium deficiency (which is extremely common) and stress, anxiety, insomnia, sleeplessness, irritability, etc. so don't overlook this mineral when you're having these symptoms. There are numerous lectures, articles, interviews, and talks as well. Hit up YouTube, and do some searching. If you want a comprehensive overview, I'd start with Dr. Carolyn Dean; a well renowned and highly sought after expert on magnesium. Magnesium Deficiency 101 - Dr. Carolyn Dean: [https://youtu.be/3td7\_91UwrU](https://youtu.be/3td7_91UwrU)

&#x200B;

**2. Force yourself to eat at the same times ""daily""** (obviously you're living your days in phases with insomnia, hence the quotes, but try to eat regularly) and try to go to sleep around the same times daily. Absolutely no stimulants for obvious reasons. Yes, you'll be tired, you'll have brain fog, you'll be hallucinating, and getting through the day will be rough, to say the least, but you'll be ruling out any deficiencies, as well as working on your circadian rhythm so that you naturally get tired around the same time daily. With constant eating of nutritional meals, you'll be setting a good nutritional base for your body to produce what it needs to produce in order to relax and eventually fall asleep. Do not trust your hunger because it's impaired right now. You NEED FOOD. Do not allow yourself to degenerate any further nutritionally. You will NOT be hungry, but you can chew and swallow, and as long as you can do that, you can't give up on yourself.   


Also, note that ""relaxing"" isn't just an automatic thing, or a ""lack of"" action. You will need to feed your body the right foods so that neutrotransmitters, and various cofactors involved in the parasympathetic nervous system can become active and in balance with your sympathetic nervous system again so you can rest peacefully and get further and further away from the anxious states. 

&#x200B;

**3. Do all the generic sleep hygiene stuff;** switch devices to yellow light, only go to bed when you're tired so your brain associates sleep with your mattress, restrict your sleep to specific hours, don't obsess about the time or obsessively track hours slept, make sure your room temperature is comfortable, etc. I don't need to expand on this because it's repeated ad nauseum here, but the goal is to stack every possible card in your favor so you can wind down and fall asleep.

&#x200B;

**4. THIS IS VITAL. Do not convince yourself that you have ""insomnia""** or go into bed thinking you're going to have trouble sleeping. Even if you've been professionally diagnosed. Doctors don't care about you the same way you care about yourself, so keep this in mind. You're one of many patients to them so you need to take control of your own health, and sometimes that means completely rejecting their advice and diagnoses. You need to tell yourself that you're simply going through a rough period and sleep might be difficult, but you're fine. I can't stress how important it is to psychologically believe that things are fine and/or will get better. A major component of insomnia for people who suffer from anxiety is the very anxiety around not being able to sleep. The anxiety compounds the issue and it thus becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's one of the many cases in humans where if you believe it's a problem, it WILL be a problem. 

You need to find a way to, over time, decouple the association between sleep and whatever negative delusional spin you're putting on it. Do not predict the future with false and irrelevant evidence from the past. A bad night of sleep, or no sleep the day before does not mean it's going to repeat in the future. This is highly ILLOGICAL, but your brain won't care about this, it will force those thoughts on you. Be aware of your own cognitive behaviors and beat them out with clear, logical thinking. Obviously, this will be difficult since emotional states cause us to think delusionally, and insomnia along with the accompanying sleep deprivation will make it worse, but the big takeaway is to realize that you can't really trust your brain at this time because it isn't functioning properly and is under a lot of stress. This process can take time, be patient with yourself, especially if you think nutrition might be a factor. It's vitally important to remember that YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP. EVERY HUMAN HAS THIS ABILITY unless you have extremely rare genetic disorders or severe nutritional deficiencies that can EASILY be corrected.

You need to realize that it's ENTIRELY NORMAL to have problems falling asleep for days, weeks or even months at a time. Your case is likely NOT UNIQUE, and many millions of people over millenia have suffered and successfully recovered from this disturbance. It is scary because it is happening to YOU, but take comfort in the fact that it is also common and treatable. This is not blind hope, or lying to yourself, these are FACTS THAT YOU NEED TO CONSTANTLY REMIND YOURSELF OF because your brain will already be doing a great job of bringing you down with negative thoughts. You must truly believe that you're going to get better and fix the problem, while taking every possible step you can to move the dial in the right direction towards progress. 

Take comfort in the fact that many people have sleepless periods like this for various reasons. Stress, nutritional deficiencies, terrible diets, anxiety, grieving, depression, breakups, divorces, etc. It's crucial to remember that all psychological stresses will diminish over time and you will return to normalcy. Your brain is constantly adjusting towards homeostasis, so YOU WILL HEAL IN TIME. YOU MUST KNOW THIS. Don't get obsessive over how long your recovery is taking, or set arbitrary goalposts (e.i. ""I should be fine in a week""). Take things one day at a time. 

Also be aware that stress depletes magnesium, which is responsible for reining in ruminating thoughts and relaxing you. Again, I urge anyone with insomnia and/or anxiety to do ample research on magnesium. It is absolutely a life safer. Here's a really good video emphasizing some of the points made above: [https://youtu.be/ZGFVxQiLH8k](https://youtu.be/ZGFVxQiLH8k)

&#x200B;

**5. Last part is to remember that falling asleep is an automatic and passive act.** You can't force it. This is the biggest mistake I made when I first encountered insomnia. You need to simply achieve a relaxed state while drowsy, and your brain will do the rest. Think back on previous times you fell asleep and note how you didn't do anything special. You closed your eyes, perhaps started thinking about the day or fantasizing, and eventually fade out. I had the biggest trouble with this for what seemed like an eternity, but eventually learned to simply stop worrying about getting sleep. Close your eyes, relax, let your thoughts wander to daily stuff; sex, work, social interactions, family, future plans, women, men, wherever your natural fantasies lie, and it eventually happens...you wake up, and the next thing you know it's a couple of hours later. 

&#x200B;

**IN CLOSING** I know this is difficult, and this is probably oversimplified, but it's important to not get frustrated if you don't get instant results. You will get better a little bit at a time. If you slept fine in the past, there's absolutely no reason to believe that you won't sleep fine in the future. There's a reason why cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is so effective, because truly, for many of us, it's in our own heads. The human brain is an amazingly powerful and complex organ, and its power is such that it is also amazing at self sabotage. Keep this in mind when dealing with negative thoughts. I've also found it helpful to not AVOID negative thoughts. Write them out and or follow them through to their endings in your head. At times you realize how hilariously delusional many of your thoughts are, and how unrealistic they are. If you can find humor in them, the fear lessens, and they end up as ""processed"" thoughts. That thought can no longer bother you. Hence why facing your fears and confronting your negative thoughts works so well, because, in truth, the vast majority of our worst fears **NEVER COME TRUE**. At the same time, it's important not to over obsess and be in your head all the time. DO seek out distractions and ways to get your mind off your issues, but not to the point of total and complete avoidance, as avoidance reinforces fears.

Does anyone else's days kind of blend together?,"I have to go to school but for some reason, whenever I wake up from a 2-3 hour sleep, I'll go through the week and eventually, things start to blend together. Like I'll remember something that I think was from yesterday but really, it was last weeks homework that is due in that day. "
CBT-I question: going back to bed,"I’m trying to follow a CBTI sleep restriction program. My total established bed time is 6 hours, from 11pm to 5am. 

Something I’m confused about, and I’d really appreciate any input, is what to do if you wake up earlier than your wake up time, say at 4am in my case, and go out of bed but don’t get sleepy until 5am or later (that is, after the established wake up time)? 

Since in that case I have not slept the total 6 hours, it would make sense to get back to bed when sleepy... but would I be doing something wrong by sleeping beyond the established wake up time?"
A futile attempt,"The other day, I attempted to take short ""cat nap"" while at work for a 24 hr shift.  

I had woken up at 5am, and knew I was not going to be home and in bed until about 11am the next day...so at about 5am the next morning, I went to the staff break room and laid down on the couch.  I was aware of every breath I took for the 45 min I laid there.  It was nice and dark, I had a blanket, and I just laid there.  I sincerely tried...but to no avail.  After 45 min, I just gave up and went back to work for another 5.5 hour before I went home...and slept for almost 24 hours.

Ugh."
Why can I only go to sleep at like 4:30 AM even tho I wake up at 8AM?,"I've had a lot of problems sleeping since I was around 13, I mostly didn't pay attention in class at that time because I would catch up while studying at home, I just slept through most classes and it went just fine.

Now that I'm 17 and I started a course last year, I can't be sleeping at 4am every day to wake up at 8am, there's a huge chance I'll end up shocking myself or fucking something up while working and I can't be having that happen.

So, how can I go to sleep earlier? I go to bed at around 10:30PM, I don't have my phone close to me, but I just end up staring at the ceiling or walking around the house doing nothing because I just can't sleep, what can I do to be able to actually fall asleep when I go to bed?"
i've been up for more than 24 hrs,"I can't rn.  it's 4:30am and I still can't sleep.  Y'all know when you close your eyes and then they say you'll just sleep eventually? nope.  i've been doing that for 5hrs.  just closing my eyes. and trying not to move too so that my body can rest somewhat. breathing calmly,  i've heard like 3 guided meditation sessions and still nada,  ziltch.  I just needed to rant a bit.  sorry. "
No sleep gang report in!!!,"Everybody up right now report in!

2 years,I sleep about 3-4 hrs straight per night on a good night. I wake up for about 3 hours and get sleepy right sround 730-8. I fall asleep for another 2 hours if im off work. Sleep pills and antidepressants have never gotten me more than 5 hours so instopped using them. When i lay in bed my mind is like an ipod that wont turn off. Songs just play in my head non stop. I never had sleep problems until this hit me 2 years ago. It fucking sucks. I lost 3 jobs and a rleationship over this. Just want it to be over so i can live again.
Blue blocking glasses,"Hi,

Posting to see if anyone has purchased the blue blocking glasses to wear in the evening before sleep and, if so, which ones you purchased. I am looking for a pair that doesn't look like I'm about to weld something and that also is good quality in regards to doing what it's meant to do. Any suggestions?

Thank you in advance for any comments.  


ETA: someone on another thread told me I could order an 80% amber tint, like for sunglasses, from Zenni. I'm not sure if this is accurate though?"
Do y'all hate when you wake up in the middle of the night for whatever reason and can't get back to sleep ffs,I woke up with an urge to pee more than 2 hours earlier and since then I just won't fucking fall asleep. Why? God I only slept like 2 hours and a half why am I so wide awake. Will this ever really go away?
Haven't been able to sleep for 2 days now!,Think its caused by anxiety.What should be the best plan of action. Go to doctors get prescribed meds or ride it out? Tried melatonin it did not work.
Why can’t I stay asleep,"I have always had trouble with sleep but I have taken to smoking weed to help me sleep but no matter what I do, I still wake up at the slightest sound. If my husband moves at all I wake up. If one of my kids opens their bedroom door, I wake up, if a car drives by outside, I wake up. I’ve been this way for as long as I can remember and I genuinely cannot remember every having a full nights sleek. I’m going insane. I need help "
Cured my sleep maintenance insomnia,"I used to wake up in the middle of the night after 5 hours, and not be able to fall back asleep.  I've been taking one pill of KSM-66 Ashwagandha right before I fall asleep.  Ashwagandha lowers cortisol significantly, so I believe that is what helps me fall back sleep.  Hopefully the effect lasts!!"
Incurable insomnia,"Ok, this is probably gonna be a long post but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Anyway, in October 2015 I suddenly (almost overnight) developed an insomnia. Well, I like to call it «non restorative sleep» rather than insomnia because most of the time I can fall asleep in moderate amount of time, not real quick, but it doesn't take long either. The problem is that most of the time I do sleep at least 6 to 8 full hours, but in the morning it is nearly impossible to wake up to the point where I try to come up with a reason to not go to work at all costs, but then I get out of bet in the last 15 minutes, brush my teeth, take a quick shower and go to work. Every single morning it feels like I've slept for an hour. The sleep is just totally unrefreshing.

I've tried lots of medications, including zolpidem, zopiclone, alprazolam, bromazepam, quetiapine, mirtazapine, trazodone, chlorprothixene, amitriptyline, gabapentin, vortioxetine, agomelatine, phenibut, buspirone, melatonin, even marijuana. Probably some more which I can't remember. Even quite large doses and/or mixing drugs doesn't help. If I take 200mg of quetiapine (Seroquel) + 10mg of zolpidem (Ambien) or 1mg of alprazolam (Xanax) + 7.5mg of mirtazapine (Remeron), it knocks me out insanely fast, but the feeling in the morning as if I had slept just for a brief moment is still there. Nothing, literally nothing helps. I was even prescribed 50mg of agomelatine although the maximum dose is just 25mg. No effects or side effects. I was prescribed 200mg of gabapentin, took 600mg and it's the same — no effect whatsoever. The drugs which help at least a small amount are alprazolam and zolpidem. When I take those I wake up slightly more refreshed. Everything else is useless.

I tried mindfulness meditation, cognitive-bihavioral therapy, I did blood tests for stuff that can affect sleep, my blood pressure, blood tests and general health are almost excellent. I've tried herbal medicine and various teas. I've changed 6 psychiatrists and everyone of them just prescribes different drugs that don't do shit while charging insane amounts of cash. I don't know what to do.

The important thing is... I do have a 12 year long history of major depressive disorder. But it has never interfered with my sleep before October 2015. I don't even feel \*that\* depressed. What I do have, though, are intrusive thoughts. I worry about everything and almost every night I dream of usual day to day things (about my car breaking down, about some work issues etc., just the usual stuff, no nightmares).

The fuck is wrong with me? Is anyone else in the same boat? It's a nightmare to live like that every single day, my cognitive and motor skills are quite impaired, the fatigue is unbearable and just a general feeling of tiredness is always there."
"if you can't sleep for emotional reasons, try typing your feelings out.","for a couple days now, any time something has me upset, I type it out on r/offmychest or r/rant, without holding ANYTHING back. If you want, you can use a throwaway, becuase trust me, it is soooo much better if you don't hold anything back. Before, I used to just let the emotions fester up and bubble, and I'd just lay awake at night with them resurfacing now and then. Now, after venting before bed every night... I sleep like a baby (sometimes.) It's like the internet equivalent of the support groups the narrator went to in Fight Club, only you don't have to lie."
"Show me the most visually and audibly beautiful short video you have. Something amazing and dreamlike, doesn’t matter the subject. What video do you love for it’s beauty and how it makes you feel? Preferably peaceful. If I can’t sleep and dream I want to see something beautiful.",
The insomniacs wrath,"Any of y’all get super irritated at someone or something that woke you up just as you were falling asleep. Getting to sleep is hard enough and staying asleep doesn’t happen. I’m a super light sleeper when I do fall asleep so pretty much anything can wake me up. Still, I find myself absolutely fuming when someone comes in and accidentally wakes me up or when my cat does something stupid to wake me up. There have even been times I’ve been mad at cars or trains because they woke me up. Don’t like being so mad but can’t they tell this sleepless person is trying to sleep..."
Warmth,Have any of you ever experienced the warmth in your body right as your about to sleep. Your whole body relaxes and it feels like your taking a nap on a hammock outside in the summer breeze ? Everything just gets so peaceful right as you fall into a deep sleep...
Fairly sure i have some sleep issues.,"Just to note: I have a couple breathing issues, including nasal swelling (pretty sure it's a polyps) and asthma, which I feel like could be apart of the issue.

I've been having issues for the past while now. Can never get a good sleep, and I have a very hard time getting up for school in the morning. Alarms have zero affect on me. I'll wake up hours later with the notification ""Missed alarm"" every single morning. I literally have to get dragged out of my bed every morning just to wake up. My mom constantly tells me to sleep earlier since I can't get up. Every time I try to sleep early (I mean like 14 hours before I wake up, which I can never do since I'm only capable of sleeping if I'm actually tired, so I only sleep early if I'm sleep deprived or had a tiring day. Seriously, I sit in bed for straight hours at a time and get no closer to sleeping. I've given up at this point.) I constantly wake up in the middle of the night, and sometimes I can't fall back asleep.

I also shared a room with my brother. He kept telling me that I would stop breathing while I was sleeping occasionally, and I've heard from others that I snore very loudly. I'm guessing sleep apnea but I don't know.

I'm also never well rested, no matter what. If I sleep for 13 hours, 8 hours, or 3 hours I'm still super tired in the morning. And my sleep schedule gets later and later every night, so when my school break hits I'm sleeping at 7 AM and waking up at 4 PM.

It's just been on my chest for a while. I don't know any screentime would affect me, since I use a blue light filter on both my phone and my computer, and have blue light reflecting glasses. This might seem broken or incomplete since I had a lot to say but lost my train of thought a lot. I'm actually tired right now, so I need to sleep."
Pretty sure I have some sleep disorder,"I’m 18 and live in the U.K. I average around 3 hours of sleep every day, pull a few all nights a month this is due to me just not being able to fall asleep. This has been Happening for about 3 years now. I’ve always been able to stay up late but didn’t always have issues when falling asleep. I usually become very sleep deprived to the point to which I’ll sleep for a very large amount of time 10-12 hours as all the lost sleep catches up to me. Being sleep deprived is just normal to me now I’m used to it, although it definitely is affecting my motivation for college and being social. I’m pretty introverted so socialising with friends and sometimes family can be hard when sleep deprived most of the time. I have tried to use substances such as weed and alcohol to sleep but it is never really effective. I would try sleep medication but I would be taking them everyday and idk about that. Ive just decided to embrace it I thought I’d just vent a little to some people that probably understand.

I wish everyone luck in their insomnia troubles."

My insomnia cure cocktail!,"3 hours before bed I take a hot shower and then I do a 1/2 hour of beginner to meduim level YouTube yoga. Followed by a dropper of 500 mg CBD oil, 2 3mg melatonin pills and 40000 UI Serrapeptace pill. Then just as I am laying in bed starting to feel drowsy I do 3 to 5 rounds of Wim Hoff breathing. I have been doing this cocktail for about 4 months now and I haven't had a bad night's rest. That and doing yoga every day has made my body feel a lot stronger and I don't wake up drowsy. With this cocktail I have been getting about 6 1/2 to 9 hours of sleep a night. At my worst with insomnia I got about 12 hours of sleep a month. I took me a lot of trial and error to figure out what worked for me. I hope this post helps someone. 

Edit: I should also mention that at night I supplent with 500 mg of magnesium and I take 500 mg of D3 with k2 in the morning with breakfast. "

Anyone else suffer night terrors when you manage to fall asleep?,"It's been about 10 minutes since I woke up and i can only remember a dog, a big house, and background TV, but I know I was terrified and my best friend woke me up (in the dream). I texted her thanking her but I can't recall how she brought me back anymore. My upstairs (duplex) neighbor had also texted me asking if I was ok because I was screaming. All I remember was being in a big house and not being able to use my arms or legs, I sort of just flopped from a couch to a floor and was terrified that I couldn't call for help. I did use booze to get to sleep because I haven't had a good rest in days and I know it exacerbated the terror. It's like give in and use substances or sleep for a half hour at most, I chose wrong tonight."

self-experimenting with approaches inspired from scholarly articles - for hot / maintenance sleepers,"My searches frequently yield articles suggesting that select manipulation of skin temperature can improve sleep in a myriad of ways. I've tried to reconcile some of these and frankenstein together a strategy with which to experiment. I'll share a few noteworthy links and what I've tried so far.

I've poured over Skin Deep from top to bottom, as it's filled with interesting bits. Concludes that ""*In young and older subjects without sleep complaints, proximal warming resulted in deeper sleep and suppressed wakefulness, whereas distal skin warming enhanced REM sleep and suppressed light sleep*"" - proximal being trunk and limbs (legs, arms, torso), distal being hands and feet. Also, ""*Of note, the sleep-enhancing effects of slight warming cannot simply be attributed to changes in comfort, since we previously demonstrated that the upper limit of the manipulated range is in fact perceived as slightly less comfortable*"". -- https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/131/2/500/407617

This article echoes some things, then begs the question - ""*An important question is whether skin temperature control to promote sleep would be necessary at all? If one examines time lapse videos of sleeping humans, it seems evident that people, during brief arousals from sleep, apply behavioral thermoregulation by kicking away the blankets or duvet to expose limbs to the cooler environment alternating with covering oneself to create a warm microclimate. But what if this behavior is somehow compromised? Or what if there is a deficit in the conscious or unconscious evaluation of the most appropriate temperature. It has never been evaluated systematically whether nocturnal thermoregulatory behavior differs between insomniacs and people without sleep complaints. We have an indication, however, that at least some phenotypes of insomnia may not recognize the most comfortable thermal microclimate that is conductive to sleep [71]. Interestingly, these observations were recently supported by our finding [5] that the severity of their sleep complaints correlated with structural abnormalities in the part of the orbitofrontal cortex that is essential for the evaluation of comfort [27, 73]*"". -- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-011-1042-2

A pretty cut and dry study suggesting that bedding warmer for the lower half of our body than the upper half is more beneficial for sleep onset than bedding warmer for the upper half than lower -- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139408963694 

And finally, in warm environments, we benefit from local skin cooling of our neck and back. It's unclear if this persists in cooler ambient temperature -- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12428

The last one throws me off as one would conclude the back is part of our trunk and thus a proximal area. Maybe the upper back and neck are better off cooler. For my part when I overheat I tend to feel it most in my back, and I overheat easily. But then, excess cool will do the same and in my recent experience I believe leaving the trunk too exposed has backfired. 

Like the first study, I tend to sleep in an environment steadying around 20-21 degrees Celsius. What I've done for a few days straight is as follows:

-just prior to sleep, rinse neck and head in cool water
-stack more sheets on my upper legs, and less on my upper body

The results have been frustratingly wild. On the first night, I felt so cool I quickly gave up and slept with the comforter, though waking hot later than usual, prompting me to wonder if I had lowered my core temp more efficiently, leading me to dissipate less heat into the bed and therefore overheating later. On the 2nd night, I slept for 6 hours straight, before making a small adjustment and falling back asleep. On the 3rd, sleep was mediocre. Last night, it was terrible. However, my first wake up was once again later than usual, about 4-4.5h in. Could not reach comfort after.  

One issue is, as one article suggests, we make microadjustments in our sleep, and in that state it becomes difficult to manage an assortment of bedding appropriately. Sheets fall off, we pull too much over ourselves, it bundles up in the corner, etc. 

I had been running with the idea of specifically targeting my upper legs. This does seem to have some positive impact but I've been so inconsistent with it and can't help but wonder if there's a more efficient way. As a hot sleeper I tend to fold an extra sheet and just use that alone, but it has to be just the right sheet and temperature to work well. I also try pre-warming my feet. There have also been nights where I successfully slept with the comforter several hours at a time and here I wonder how that could be when I usually wake hot. One thing I haven't tried is a gradient from bottom to top, but I expect since we lose plenty of heat through our feet it's best not to cover that too much. The way I imagine it, most people sleep with one sheet and one comforter, then throw off the comforter from their upper half in their sleep. 

I'll continue trying some variation on this. If you have similar experiences or want to try it yourself, please share your results. Do you exhibit efficient self-regulation at night by adjusting covers? How do you tend to layer, then adjust?

"
These are the scariest times...,"It’s those times when your up for like 3 days and still don’t feel tired.

Your anxiety is through the roof and your thoughts get scary.

- Will I pass out and wake up in a hospital with tubes in me?

- Will I die in my sleep?

- Has my Brain somehow lost the ability to sleep?

Of course it always ends the same way. You finally pass out, sleep for like 14 hours and wake up feeling like a million bucks lol. 

But when your sleep deprived it’s so scary. "
Was hoping for more sleep,"This week was rough, I had two nights of no sleep and the others I was getting about 2-4 hours. Thursday night I finally managed to get 8 hours. I woke up yesterday (Friday) feeling great, and thought the insomnia cycle was broken for now, that I'd at least get a few day of real rest before it started again. That's usually how it works for me. But last night I only slept 2 hours if that, and I feel like this week will be a repeat of last. I'm trying to stay positive, at least I can usually manage a couple hours a night. But the stress and lack of sleep is starting to get to me. 

Edit: words are hard"
Has anyone tried Rozerem (ramelteon)?,"I was wondering if anyone has tried Rozerem? It works on the melatonin receptor. 

I'm kind of at the end of my rope with the insomnia. I'm currently on Seroquel which works beautifully for sleep. The only problem is I've put on weight (40 lbs) from it and my cholesterol and triglycerides are through the roof and I now have fatty liver. I've tried to lower my lipids with a low carb diet and taking lots of niacin and niacinaminde. They're improved but still high (triglycerides down from the 400's to the 200's). So, I'm going to ask my doctor to switch me to another sleep medication. 

Any advice is appreciated!"
Ugh. It’s going to be one of those nights.,"I’m so grateful for sleep the last couple of nights. But the insomnia is back tonight. 

There is a crazy windstorm happening outside of my window. The sound of the swirling wind sounds like the swirling thoughts in my head. There is a tree branch tapping on my window. The fallen tree leaves are rustling against the patio door.   Every now and then there is a gust so strong  it rattles the door. That just rattles me more. 

Maybe it’s the wind, maybe it’s my mind.  Either way, I’m losing hope that I will sleep tonight.

My insomnia is getting exponentially worse.,"So I woke up at 10:00 pm last night,some one called me and woke me up(grrrrr) been awake since then. 

 Previously to being woken up I was up for 3 days straight. I just can’t sleep, it’s 9:00 am and I am considering calling in sick. I know anxiety makes insomnia worse and life has been stressful last few months, and I feel like my body is refusing to sleep. It’s like when you are full and some one offers you food? Yeah not going to happen. This is weird. 

* Background I’ve had insomnia all my life but it feels like I’m speeding towards something and I can’t sleep. "
I’ve done everything I can think of,I go to bed at generally the same time. I read for a bit before going to bed so I’m not looking at a screen. I take melatonin an hour before bed. I have a journal where I write things down so I hopefully aren’t thinking about them. I do breathing exercises. I try to control my temperature so I’m not too hot or cold. I got maybe 4-5 hours of sleep last night. And that’s become usual. 
How do you deal with insomnia that’s caused by a fear of insomnia?,"I had a mental breakdown about 8 months ago and ever since have developed chronic insomnia  that is fueled by the fear of insomnia. I’ve been taking Xanax to fight this but I want to get off meds and sleep naturally  again.

Anyone have experience with late waking insomnia?,"For those who aren’t in the loop, late waking insomnia is typically when you wake up earlier than you should and you’re unable to fall back asleep, but you don’t have trouble falling asleep in the first place.

In bed with my best friend Insomnia,"An important day is approaching, the next morning. It is important to leave a good impression. Lights are turned off and blankets tucked in. As the eyes close, an eerie feeling approaches and eventually joins the bed. It begs attention but is being ignored. Bright light is created as an attempt of causing distraction. Time and time again efforts go in vain. Unknowingly the time is almost up, without getting peace of mind. Light shimmers through the curtains, no eyes were closed, the dawn of a new day is here.

What if I took ambien for sleep just for one night and then never again?,
Melatonin making it worse?,"I've been taking 6mg of melatonin for the past week and a half. My problem before I took it was falling asleep but I could stay asleep fine but now I'm taking melatonin I wake up several times in the night and struggle to get back to sleep bit getting to sleep is kinda okay n9w? A bit of a difference but it doesn't make me feel tired, I kinda just have to force myself asleep. My therapist told me that I may have been taking it at the wrong time as for the first few days I took it half an hour before bed and it did nothing so I took it at around 6pm because I figured if I took it earlier I'd fall asleep when I wanted. Last night I didnt take it just to test what it'd do. It's 2:40am currently and I'm wide awake. I don't know why this is happening. Nearly two weeks ago I couldn't get to sleep so was put on medication for it and now suddenly I can't stay asleep? But I'm still wide awake during the day, I yawn a ton throughout the day but I don't feel tired at all? I don't know what to do. I've never called (got my mother to call) my psychiatrist because of a problem with any of my medication but I see her next in 3 weeks and I really don't want to wait that long and have 5 hours sleep every night when this time 2 or three months ago I'd get like 12."
Do I have insomnia,"I average about 4 hours a sleep per night, my high roll for sleep is usually about 6 hours and I get a few all-nighters every Month. It also takes a while for me to sleep and its usually not very restful. Do I genuinely have insomnia or some sleep deprivation or is this just normal? "
LIQUID 10mg Melatonin!,"I plateaued after 8 years of trazadone and didn’t want to turn to other medications. I tried melatonin in pill form up to 10mg in addition to trazadone and still didn’t notice a difference..... until I tried liquid melatonin. It has changed my life. I never believed something natural could help. I’ve actually cut my trazadone mg in half after 8 years because of how much it has helped. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to completely cut out trazadone, but the liquid has helped tremendously. Just a tip! "
I got someone to write a 25 page eBook about insomnia is there someone interested in read it?,I would love to have someone to read the book and to get some feedback.  
Please help,"I used to have really bad insomnia when I was a teenager, but it’s been a while since I’ve had a spell. Tonight it’s back, because my mind won’t stop obsessing over something that recently happened. I feel extremely sad about it, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It invades all of my thoughts. What do you do when you can’t stop thinking about something? How can I get this out of my head?"
Time? What happened to time?,"Fellow insomniacs, when you decide that fighting sleep is a waste of time and you stay up around the clock to try the next night, you ever notice that 7am very quickly becomes 7pm? I hope I'm not the only one."
Quetiapene,"Doc just prescribed me this, but from what I read it sounds pretty sketchy, he assured me it’s fine. Anyone have any experience with this?"
Sudden Insomnia,"I don’t often have insomnia, but there are periods when I can’t properly sleep for weeks. Every time is like a first one, I keep worrying about all the same things. Incurable diseases, life worries, mood swings. Worst is I’m feeling wide awake and my anxiety makes me second guess my own mind, thinking I’m loosing it. I slept 3 hours a night before. I’ve been to ER a few nights ago and they gave me some stuff, so I slept for 6 hours restlessly. 

Later doctor gave me Opamox, Olanzapin and Tenox. It helps, but now I’m worried if there is a worse condition that I’m just patching. I don’t think I’ll be able to be completely okay until I sleep soundly under my own power. It doesn’t help that I have some weird flu as well. 

Anxiety and insomnia feed off each other. Anxiety leads to fear, fear leads to anger(being angry feels better than afraid), anger leads to being alert and awake, being alert and awake leads to suffering. 

Advice, I’ve taken the pills and still can’t sleep. I’m panicked. Please help. I used to outlast my insomnia/panic, but I don’t have the energy anymore."
Going to see my PCP,"I have a routine appointment in the morning. I’ve been taking ambien for years, sometimes melatonin (7 years at least since my husband died) 
But I can only sleep 4-5 hours max on the ambien.
I’m considering asking for the extended release. Anyone have other suggestions?"
Does sleep deprivation make anybody else’s anxiety skyrocket?,"When I’m sleep deprived my already bad anxiety skyrockets to insane levels.

It’s really bad, I think I’m dying and I’m paranoid about everything. It honestly feels like hell on earth when I’m sleep deprived. It’s a extremely scary experience.

And the worse thing about it is it makes it harder to sleep! "
Get knocked out at the wrong times,"My insomnia is making me not be able to sleep on a night at all. The other night I didn't sleep at all. But last night I managed to get maybe 2 hours sleep in the early am. It gets to about afternoon and then I just get overwhelmed with tiredness (unable to shake it off) and woke up at 11pm! My sleep pattern is so out of whack.

Anyone else have a messed up sleep pattern like that?"
Constant 'Jerks' as I'm About to Drift Off,"Hello,

&#x200B;

Recently I have been having sleeping issues. I have no problem becoming sleepy, but as I am about to drift off I get a random quick jerk, almost like a reflex reaction and once I get that jerk I am wide awake, then 5 mins later I feel I'm about to drift off, and boom, I get another one. This will happen all night and I literally have had 2 nights with zero minutes of sleep in the last 5 days, and last night it was happening again so gave in an took some Ativan which put me to sleep, but I definitely don't want to take Ativan.

&#x200B;

These jerks can happen in my chest, arms, legs, back, anywhere, and they only occur once I am about to drift off.

&#x200B;

Anyone have any thoughts what this is? Thanks."
Do I have insomnia?,"I slept 3 hours last night. 4 hours the night before that. I usually average 4.5-5 hours per night, but 2 nights per week I will get less than 4. Occasionally I'll get 0. I haven't gotten more than 6 in 2 years. I feel like absolute shit all the time. Is this chronic insomnia?"
Citalopram and insomnia???,"So started Citalopram to get over my anxiety induced insomnia where I'd sleep for 30 mins to an hour and wake up with vivid dreams each time. 

Now 7 nights in, it just doesn't feel like I'm sleeping at all? Last night just felt like I was half asleep half awake the whole night with no more vivid dreams however both my mum and girlfriend said I was snoring at points during the night. Also everytime I realised I was conscious I'd realise I was also drenched in my own sweat???

Anyone experienced insomnia/worsening insomnia from Citalopram and does it ever go away? 
Positive note though I'm definitely less anxious than I was before but hard to not have 'giving up' thoughts when you're already sleep deprived. "
More than insomnia,"I don't really sleep or eat normally. I eat maybe half a meal a day on average. I don't have body dismorphia. I'm often too depressed to leave bed but I can't sleep until around six in the morning and I still don't sleep well. I don't feel hunger. I suffer from Major Depressive Disorder and Anxiety. I'm on escitalopram for it. 

I feel like I'm living in another dimension compared to my family. My parents are worried but they don't know how to help. I just want to pull my life back together.

Any tips?"
Sleep snowflake,"My husband's new nickname for me. Because I need my eye mask, white noise machine, and get annoyed if he's on his phone while in bed when I'm trying to sleep, because the way he moves around is different than when he is sleeping/going to sleep. Definitely can't stand the sound of typing on a keyboard either. Anyone else this hypersensitive?"
I’m a light sleeper with sensitivity to high frequency sounds. I feel instant pain and irritability when I hear them. How can I cope with this? It’s causing insomnia a lot.,"I can hear at a much higher frequency than other people and I hate it - I can hear whistling even with multiple doors shut, I can hear through cupped earphones that are supposed to cancel out sounds. The sound of my boyfriend snoring keeps me completely sleep deprived which is causing tension in our relationship. Normal earplugs fall out or fail to really seal off the highest frequencies - I can even hear cell phones charge. What is this?

Also: I do have ADHD, Anxiety, PTSD. I am hyper alert and tense all the time. Could this be a contributing factor?Honestly, just want it explained and how to minimize it because I feel like I’m losing my mind and people often do not believe me. 

Thanks!"
Am I the only one?,"So I started staying up all night due to doing work online and overtime I have developed a terrible sleep pattern.

I try to force myself to sleep in the night but I am more wide awake. Now even when I do manage to get some sleep around 4am till 9am I feel groggy and exhausted all day. 

It gets to about 7-8pm (used to be 3-4pm last week) and I just get this overwhelming urge to sleep. The more i fight it the worse it gets. I hit the pillow and I cat nap (mini episodes of micro dreams but still feel awake) and wake up jolted from anxiety because it worries me why im overwhelming out of control tired. Gets to about 11pm I panic and find myself staying up.

Am I the only one here whose going through this sort of insomnia? "
I sleep sooo much better when I go to bed with an empty gut,"This may not apply to everyone as I have IBS, but if I go to the toilet before bed and empty my bowel I sleep a whole lot better. I’m talking deep sleep, waking up refreshed and being able to sleep in if I want.

Unfortunately it’s really hard to get this to happen reliably. I have both constipation and loose stools but generally I’m constipated after dinner and for the rest of the night, and even when I do use the toilet there’s no guarantee I’ll get everything out.

Magnesium citrate has worked very well before to get things moving, but also gives me horrible smelly gas, and sometimes makes my tummy feel uncomfortable.

Coffee helps move things along but of course the caffeine is counter-productive to sleep.

What has worked very well sometimes is eating a good amount of salad with dinner. All that fiber makes me poop a lot very soon afterwards. I’ll feel completely emptied out (sometimes) and sleep like a champ. But fiber can be quite harsh as it goes through my digestive tract, so it’s not ideal.

I’ve always found that having a full gut before bed makes me feel hot, uncomfortable and restless. I’ll sleep like shit. With an empty gut I do not feel hot, uncomfortable and restless.

I’m just wondering if anyone else has noticed this, IBS or not?"
Ambien long term use,"I've always avoided any regular medications but nothing in the world has allowed me to consistently sleep well then Ambien. Despite some horror stories it doesn't seem toxic and for me low dose 5mg works as good as when I started it. 

Anyone around that has used it regularly for years?"
A diatribe on insomnia,"I know I'm preaching to the quire, but I've never felt like anyone, even my own therapist, could understand what it's like for me. What's funny is that she says she has sleeping problems, she made them sound just as bad as mine, but truthfully I don't know how she functions. 

For anyone interested I have what is referred to as terminal or multiple awakenings insomnia. It's a real blast, and sometimes it's even accompanied by nightmares about home break-ins. On most nights however I will just wake up, look at the clock in despair, and then go back to sleep. That's something I'm thankful for, I never have much trouble falling asleep. I used to have a whole different kind of sleeping problem, where I could never fall asleep until the wee hours but now I can fall asleep just fine - it's the staying asleep part that is really troublesome though. I might wake up 2-3 times a night. What's great is that I'll often make 8 hours of sleep by the time I wake up, but it's broken into all these chunks that any benefit of a deep sleep is now evaporated. I'm never sure when to get up anymore because I am always tired, and always wanting to catch a little more sleep. It gets to the point where I'm now getting up at 10 am and feeling groggy as all hell - which doesn't even begin to describe it. My god, the brain fog is the absolute worst of it. I can handle being tired, give me 4 hours straight - I'll take it. Give me 8 hours in blocks and I'm fucked pretty much for the entire day. I feel like my head has been run over a train, not that I know what that's like, but I imagine after that your head would be quite useless - well that is what it's like. You can't even begin to think straight. It's akin to be shitfaced, except your sober, and you feel like your nerves are on fire. Everything is irritating. Every question is nagging, and invasive. You can't drive for shit. Up is down and left is right. You try to watch something, play something, but you feel as dumb as a rock. You become this half-version of yourself who can never really be present in any moment. Holding a conversation is like doing gymnastics and your memory is so poor you have to make 6 references just to remember whose name you were trying to say a moment ago. As a writer it has completely crushed by ability to be creative. It makes writers block look like a bitch because this wall is fucking nigh impenetrable. I'm lucky if so much as a creative blip graces my mind because it's mostly just a black void when I'm like this. There's more of course, I could keep going, but you don't deserve that. 

I'm going to try intentional sleep deprivation again, and then try to wake up at a regular time. Wish me luck."
day 2 off midazolam,it’s my second day off midazolam after being on for 2 and a half weeks. i “slept” 2-3 broken hours last night while using benadryl. tonight i’ve been in bed for 3 hours and i’m literally breaking down from the derealization i had earlier and the anxiety i’ve had all day. I’ve been up 20 hours. Somebody please fucking help me.
Waking up wide awake from Ambien,"Ambien is very effective at making me fall asleep but I wake up 4.5 - 5 hours later. It's not like I wake up to pee and still feel sleepy either... I'm wide awake the moment my eyes open. This happen to anyone else?

&#x200B;

Doc just 'upgraded' me to Ambien CR, will see if that makes a difference. Hoping it will push me to 6 hours, at this point I'd be thrilled with that. (God forbid 7... been a while!)"
It’s chronic,"So yes Hi I have chronic insomnia, often caused by the inability of my brain to shut up. This could be after a really good and productive day like today or after a day with more anxiety stress. Problem is, it also often happens the night before big exams because studied things float around in my mind. After 3 hours of trying and only about 4 hours before my alarm goes off before my exam, I figured this would be a good place to check for advice! Thanks in advance"
"Medical finals exam tomorrow, can any experienced people of this sub offer advice?","I’m on a string of exams currently and my sleep (usually terrible) is at its all time worst. I know a lot of people on here have experience with Zolpidem, so I was wondering if you had any comments on how it might affect cognitive performance the next morning? I’m desperate for a full sleep but even more desperate to graduate after 5 years of work. Literally any advice either anecdotal or evidence based would be so appreciated. Thank you kind people."
Have you tried carbs before hitting the sack?,A lone bagel can help induce speak.
Last night was horrible,"A couple weeks ago my older brother said if I want responsibility, then I need to go sleep early. I have sleep apnea, and have been trying to sleep early, but they make it sound so simple to sleep early. I have stopped having my cellphone next to me completely, and started reading books. The earliest I went to sleep was at 9:00pm, and the latest right now was at 6:00am (New years eve party). My sleep is getting later and later, but I want it to be earlier and earlier. "
could intermittent fasting be causing me sleep issues?,"have you guys tried doing intermittent fasting and it worsened your sleep? I've been doing it for about a year and never linked it to my sleep problem. I know it's not good to sleep with full stomach but maybe being hungry isn't doing me any favor either? 

The whole reason I got into fasting is because I wanted better health and brain function but it dawned on me recently that I haven't had a full, uninterupted 8 hr sleep in....I honestly don't know. Months? Years? I've been averaging around 4-5 hr sleep for the last month. I'm depressed and suicidal all the time. What the hell good is fasting for health if I jump off my balcony one day right? I like certain aspects like how it simplifies my day and I eat less junk food but it can't be worth trading sleep "
Good news! I wore my c-pap all night for the first time!,"Bad news: I AM STILL EXHAUSTED. I still woke up in the night.

&#x200B;

This really really really really really really frustrates me. I was hoping it would fix this. "
It's so frustrating that there is no clear cause for true insomnia,"I have never heard a satisfying explanation for why some people have insomnia and others don't.  Sometimes I have thoughts while lying in bed, but other times I'm totally in a state of meditation yet completely awake and unable to sleep, so how could racing thoughts be the cause?   I also have seen a psychologist and I do not have an anxiety disorder or depression, although I do have anxiety and depression at mild levels.

I kind of relate to this article.  When I had my sleep study, I remember thinking I was awake for much longer than they said I was according to their measurements.  Perhaps this, combined with an obsession and anxiety around sleep itself is what causes insomnia for some people?  Of course, delayed sleep phase could be another cause...or contributing factor, but for me I can still have trouble sleeping no matter how late I stay up.

Here we are again,"Hello darkness my old friend...

My whole life is turned upside down because I can't sleep. Didn't sleep last night. Wide awake and it's nearly 1 already. 😤

Someone distract me 😐"
It's all in my head,"I've never had problems sleeping in my 20 years of existence.

Until one day I tried going to sleep while a bunch of my friends were over partying in my dorm room and they kept me up for hours. I had an assignment due and decided that since I wasn't going to get any sleep I may as well work on that assignment. Living through that next day was horrible I felt like complete shit and for some reason I put tons of pressure on myself to have a good sleep the following night. Despite being super tired and staying up for 30 something hours I couldn't fall asleep due to the pressure I kept putting on myself. I ended up only sleeping a few hours and suddenly I had major anxiety just about going to sleep. This problem has continued on for a couple months and while I sometimes get 8-10 hours of sleep there are many nights where  I lay in bed for 4 hours heart racing putting extreme pressure on my self to fall asleep. It seems as though the more I want it the harder it is to achieve. I feel like if I didn't have these thoughts I could sleep normal again

Additional info: Once I fall asleep I'm fine, if I wake up in the middle of the night to pee I lay back down in bed and fall asleep instantly because I don't have any thoughts provoking my sleep anxiety.

If you guys have any advice for me that would be appreciated."
I just. Can’t. Stay. Asleep.,"Hey everyone. Let me start off by saying I’m not currently diagnosed with insomnia, but I’m really considering seeing my doctor about my sleep issues. All my life, I’ve been known for being a night owl and an early bird. It was all fun and games when I was a kid so I never really saw it as a problem, but as I got older, the lack of sleep really started to have negative effects on my ability to function during the day. 

My first step was changing my bedtime routine. I’ve tried the whole sleep hygiene thing. I’ve tried sleeping in the dark, sleeping with the hallway light on. I’ve tried reading instead of being on my phone before bed, as well as just quiet meditation. I’ve tried going to bed on a full stomach, and going to bed on an empty stomach. Nothing seems to make a difference. My main issue isn’t falling asleep, it’s staying asleep. Most nights I fall asleep within 10-15 minutes, but I just can’t seem to stay asleep most of the time. I usually wake up probably around 5-10 times at night, and a lot of the time I find myself wide awake at 3-4am unable to fall back to sleep at all. 

So far, besides attempting to change my sleeping habits, I’ve tried some otc meds. I’ve tried melatonin. I started at 5mg and made my way up to 20mg. honestly had high hopes for it, but I felt absolutely nothing and my quality of sleep stayed the same. I recently tried diphenhydramine, and not only did I sleep like shit as usual, but it gave me weird dreams when I did sleep. Apparently it’s not meant to be used long term anyway, and my problem is nowhere near temporary. 

Do you think it would be a good idea to talk to my doctor about this? Idk if I should really schedule an appointment over this. I feel like I might just get a lecture about staying off of my phone before bed or something. Maybe this is a dumb question, but are there actual sleep aides (possibly otc) that can just be taken long-term and are more effective than repackaged Benadryl and melatonin? People just looove to recommend essential oils and crap but I’m looking for a way to improve my sleep, not carelessly throw away money lol. "
Went to sleep yesterday without my medication or melatonin,Only got like 6 hours but my god does it feel nice to get some all natural sleep. 
It looks at me and won't let me sleep,"My childhood keeps looking at me. It goes away when I flash my light. Glowing eyes like a lighter. Ironic because it hates the light. It hates her. Childhood go away. Let me sleep, please. Thank you. "
How often do you get less than 4 hours of sleep?,"For me, every other day I seem to get less than 4 hours of sleep. Last night I got maybe 2-3."
Too aware of the process of falling asleep,"Hello,

I've always been a good sleeper, but for the past few weeks i've had the weirdest issue. 

I'm monitoring myself when trying to sleep and when I enter that phase when your thoughts start to become nonsense, i't like i think "" Ah, I'm falling asleep "" and Im jolted awake. Because of this, i've slept 3 hours in 48 hours.

This is causing immense anxiety, I'm feeling like i accidently discovered the thing that will basically ruin my life . I have OCD tendencies and I learnt to control them, but this is the first time a fucking thought is impacting my health for real so all my world is falling apart

Anyone had this ? Will I ever get better ? This is so retarded...

( Sorry for the english, I'm from France )"
How long does it take for brain fog to go away?,"I’ve had bouts of insomnia my whole life, but usually not bad enough to affect my memory. I just recently had a bad one, 3 weeks of averaging 2-3 hours sleep per night. During that time my cognitive abilities dropped and it was hard to remember even simple things like names and old places. I’ve been able to sleep normally again 7-8 hours a night for the past 4 days but my memory is still slow. How long did it take for you to be back to normal?"
Going back on quetiapine for insomnia?,"I used to be on quetiapine for my depression and it didn't do much mood wise but it was really effective in knocking me out, although I don't remember if it helped with helping me stay asleep. Currently I'm on melatonin and it's not doing anything, still can't get to sleep properly and it's messing up with staying asleep. I wake up multiple times throughout the night. Should I ask to go back on quetiapine to help me sleep rather than continuing my melatonin? I see my psych again in 3 weeks though and I don't really wanna only have 4-6 hours of sleep for much longer and waking up even more miserable because I'm exhausted."
"Slept In Late By Accident, How to Adjust?","I’ve been following CBT-i the last few months and generally been sleeping from 3:30AM - 7:30AM, which is a major improvement over what I’ve had for the last 15 years.  This morning I slept in until 11AM and am at a loss at what to do. I’m afraid of being back at square one. I find that my cycle is 20 hours... which sets me at 7:30AM bedtime if I stay up. Any suggestions? OTC medicines/vitamins don’t work unfortunately."
Chronic Insomnia. No success with meds. Has anyone tried L-Tryptophan?,"I barely sleep. It’s awful because I have chronic migraines and the lack of sleep just exacerbates them. 

I’ve tried Ambien to no avail. I’ve been on several anti-psychotics for depression, all of which are supposed to help you sleep, and I never slept more than 2-3 hrs while taking them. I’m currently on a high dosage (300mg) of Trazadone. It puts me to sleep, but I only sleep for about three hours and then I am wide awake the rest of the night. I also take a Beta Blocker, Propanol, at bedtime, along with 4mg of Zanaflex (a muscle relaxer).

I really need to sleep. I’ve heard that L-tryptophan can help. Does anyone have experiences taking it, and what dosage did you take? 

Thanks in advance!"
When did everyone's insomnia set in?,"When I was younger I used to be an amazing sleeper. I wouldn't wake up for anything, not even a fire alarm. And now ever since I think highschool started, I'm now in college, I haven't been able to sleep through the whole night. So I was curious could mine have started from anxiety in highschool. When did you all began going sleepless. And what do you think caused it?"
Anyone feel like insomnia is making your life fly by,"I really hate it, last night was horrible, and I really hate my life, I WANT MY LIFE BACK"
Alcohol contributes to insomnia?,"Last night after work I had two shots of whiskey around 7pm on an empty stomach (had a big lunch, wasn’t feeling hungry) and I couldn’t sleep until 3 am despite taking sleep aid. This is not a normal habit. Now feeling tired. Can alcohol do this?"
No sleep tonight,.
"here we go again. i destroyed my sleep pattern again, and now i am up for 16-25 hours at a time again.","i posted here like three weeks ago when i told y'all i had been staying up for 25 hours and only getting about 3 of sleep. i ended up seeing my doctor and as a short term solution he prescribed me temezepam, it helped me get my sleep on track but he only prescribed about 10 pills as it is a risk of getting hooked on them. after i ran out, i was still sleeping well, was still going to bed at midnight and getting 8-9 hours of sleep. as per usual i extended my stay up time to 3AM, and than it just got deeper and deeper to the point my new sleeping pattern was at 2:00 PM in the arvo. i feel i can not adapt to a night sleeping chedule as i am a night owl, but i prefer waking up in the morning. now as a result i am only getting 2-3 hours of sleep again and it looks i have triggered my own insomnia again. i honestly feel as if i might have delayed sleep phase disorder. do i see my doc and get the valium again or will he not prescribe me?"
"Insomnia is not good, it always forces me to consider my life.",
"Don't have an imsomnia, having sleep trouble and have a few questions - amitriptyline 10mg","Hi, to preface this i'm a young healthy male in third year at university. I eat well, workout and have a good social life. My sleep has been bothering me since I can remember, I can't remember the last time I fell asleep and woke up well rested, it must be over a decade ago. No matter what time I wake up in the morning I fall straight back asleep, I don't really wake up I turn off my alarm half asleep and go back to bed, this process can repeat for hours. 

For example, last night I got in bed at 1:30am and read a book, my alarm was set for 11:15 (I had class at 12:00), I woke up at 14:00 feeling tired, I can't remember my main alarm going off - which is extremely loud and my phone alarms don't even stir me. I'm a very deep sleeper and feel tired most of the time.

The same process repeats itself  a lot and I usually wake up in the afternoon.

In first year at university one of my friends gave me a 'sleeping tablet' (amitriptyline 10mg) the following few days/week after taking this was one of the best I can remember. I can remember feeling tired at 11pm and waking up naturally without an alarm at 7am which doesn't sound like a lot but made me so happy, I also didn't feel tired lying in bed. Upon waking now if I don't get out of bed immediately I fall back asleep but back then I lay in bed on my laptop without being tired. This lasted for a few days and I felt so energetic and ready to take on the day. 

I constantly think about those few days where I felt good and want to do something about it. I searched for sleep and amitriptyline which led me to this sub.

I think amitriptyline is also used for depression however I don't feel depressed, I know if I can get this sleep problem under control nothing will be holding me back.

I wanted to ask if anyone had a similar problem to me and how they solved it? 

Or if anyone has any comments to make i'd appreciate them.

I'm going to book an appointment with a doctor in the next few days."
Waking up and not able to fall asleep again - WTF is this?,"No matter what time I fall asleep, I always wake up at 4-5 am and I can not sleep anymore. I tried various pills and visited a lot of doctors already. Some pills help me better than others, but this waking up remains the same. After this I usually can't fall asleep for another 2-4 hours. In the end I get like 4-5 hours in total. How to stop waking up?

&#x200B;

My nights look like this:

1:00 going to bed

3:00 falling asleep

5:00 waking up

8:00 falling asleep

12:00 waking up"
"Fun, tasty way way to fall asleep","I started taking melatonin gummies after I remembered they existed lolol they taste really good and knock me out.

Citalopram causing strong hypnic jerks?,"So I've been having the typical anxiety induced insomnia where I'd wake up every 30 mins to an hour with really vivid dreams every time. 

My GP put me on Citalopram to help with my anxiety/OCD however fifth night in I just couldn't sleep at all because I've been having some really strong hypnic jerks as I fall asleep. Was this caused by the Citalopram? "
Need advice.,"   I need some serious advice. In the last 3 weeks I've literally only slept 1 night, I feel like I'm going crazy and I'm about to loose it. I've had insomnia for the last 5 months and it's only getting worse. Doctors can't find a solution for me.

    I have an appointment to see my primary care doctor to get a referral for a sleep study next month.
I drive a truck for a living and I just went home for a 3 week vacation. I seen a psychologist while I was home and I even went to see a hypno therapist and nothing is helping.

Waking up at the same time every night...,"Does anyone know why that might be? I fall asleep somewhat easily at a reasonable time but around 4 AM (plus or minus maybe 15 minutes), I wake up... and then I can't get back to sleep until around 6 AM-ish, then I'm up for work at 730 AM. 

It's just so weird that it's around the same time every night. I wake up and think to myself ""i bet it's 4 AM' again""... then i look at the clock, and it's usually around 4, it's so strange.

The only thing I can think of is blood sugar dropping or going up... i don't know anything about blood sugar lol but that's the only thing i can think of that would be clockwork like that."
Weird thing that has worked CONSISTENTLY for me,"It's so weird being able to sleep whenever I want. I started getting insomnia in college, then it got worse in the working world switching from day shift to night shift and back to day. At the worst of it I was sleeping 3-4 hours every 2 days.

&#x200B;

I tried anything that was supposed to help. Trazodone worked pretty well for a good 6 months until I started getting intense heart palpitations. CBN, CBD, Lunesta, Flexeril, NyQuil, and l-Tryptophan would work every now and then. NyQuil was the best, but I'd build up tolerance fast (and was worried about my liver.) But after about two days in a row of using any of these, I would be horribly depressed in the morning. It was more than just a hangover effect. I noticeably felt more hopeless and didn't have the initiative to do much of anything.

&#x200B;

I tried a few more things: magnesium citrate, magnesium chelate, melatonin, Benadryl, blue blocking glasses, magnesium glycinate, epsom salt baths, glycine, l-theanine, valerian-- that didn't do jack shit.

&#x200B;

**So here are the three things that, when combined, work for me:**

**-- Magnesium L-Threonate**

**-- Carrot juice (4+ oz)**

**-- Putting cell phone on airplane mode to reduce EMFs**

&#x200B;

Magnesium l-threonate is the only form of magnesium that works in putting me to sleep. I would advise first-time users to use caution, because I read a thread saying that it makes some people feel like they're on speed!! But for me, it puts me right out. I don't know why.

The threads that inspired me to check it out:

&#x200B;

I take the carrot juice to reduce inflammation and to give a slight blood sugar spike that the body needs to get to sleep. The Magnesium l-threonate works just ok without it, but with it it works consistently in putting me out. 

I'm not sure if putting the cell phone on airplane mode actually helps, but I read some Medium article saying there was a small study in Germany that said it helped sleep. In any case, it helps me turn off all need to contact others during the day. I thought ""well, it can't hurt.""

Let me know if you try this and it works for you. I'm so happy to have found something that works for me consistently. I think the last time I've been able to sleep whenever I wanted was in high school.

What are the best sleeping tablets or supplements?,Is there anything that would literally knock you out in a deep sleep for like 12 hours?
Can't get sleepy at bedtime anymore.," I've been going to bed at 9:30 for about a year now, but I just can't get sleepy at that time anymore. I used to be able to fall asleep at that time, but since I got sick last month, I've been wide awake at bedtime. I'm worried that if I go to bed at 10-10:30, I won't be able to sleep at all, because I'm so used to going to bed at 9:30. "
imagine going to sleep at a healthy hour when you’re tired and the only time you wake up is when you’re rested,hahaha what
I found what works for me; finally.,"So I am a medical marijuana patient and while that helps most of what really knocks me out costs a lot more. 
Well I picked up CBN capsules from my dispensary. Not CBD but CBN. The studies have shown that 5mg of CBN does the same medical effects as 10mg of Valium without the high or addictive qualities and I gotta agree. I haven’t had panic attack and I’ve been sleeping sound af!! 
The pills I take are 5mg of CBN and 5 mg of THC and it doesn’t get me high but it knocks me out. An hour later I’m in bed till morning. And falling back asleep is easy. Anyone who can get access to CBN I highly recommend researching it, talking to your doctor and getting some. I know it’ll be more for people in legal states or medical marijuana card. But I hope it helps someone."
Anyone else have harder time falling asleep eating food after 8pm?,"I go to bed around 11pm, and I noticed if I eat a meal at 8pm or later, my mind is more awake and takes longer for me to fall asleep. Does this happen to anyone else? I went to bed 10:40pm and couldn’t fall asleep until past midnight. Started getting angry that I’ve been in bed not sleeping but remembered to not get frustrated and sleep will come eventually. "

I feel really hopeless and angry,"Im 18 and I have forgotten large chunks of my past due to my long battle with serious insomnia and sleep deprivation.
I have spent this past year forgetting things almost instantly. At one point a small drink and a couple rough nights I could barely speak coherently for the next two days.I feel so much shame, my head is completely mixed up,  and I find myself saying abnoxiously stupid things like opinions which have people laughing because they're based on false premises.I laugh it off but I can't stop thinking about these mistakes...And its making me feel beyond stupid, I often worry that I have brain damage because of this. And the reason I continue is because I keep hoping I'll improve but I always find myself making mistakes and embarrassing myself. "
Traditional sleeping meds don't work and every alternative fails within a few months,"Lifelong insomnia that has only gotten worse with time. I've recently made a bunch of medication changes but 3-6mg Lunesta stopped working after 4 days and 10mg of Ambien never worked at all to get me to sleep (it had some other effects as you can imagine lol). After both of these and many other med failures, my psychiatrist had me do a genetic test to figure out which medications work best for me, and it turns out that every single traditional sleeping medicine they tested with my genetic makeup basically does jack shit: I metabolize all of them ridiculously fast and build huge tolerances almost immediately. Also learned that Morphine doesn't affect me...


However, alternative medications to those have never been successful for more than a few months at a time without needing major dosage changes or complete replacement. Ativan never really helped me sleep and good god I am never taking benzos again, fuck those. Mirtazapine worked alright for about 4 months until it stopped and I had to double the dosage, which ended up causing a lot of problems for me during the day. I take Hydroxyzine for anxiety but it's never been helpful for sleep. I've been on Seroquel (25mg, lowest possible dose) for a few months now but it too has since stopped working. OTC stuff doesn't help, neither does pot. Lifestyle changes haven't really seemed to be effective. I've also been on several other medications for depression & anxiety over the years that have absolutely fucked my brain chemistry even further (if you want some seriously fucked up dreams and like shaking constantly, check out Abilify)

If anyone has any suggestions or advice I'd really appreciate it. Hope everyone enjoys today's sunrise!"
3:20 AM,"Can never sleep, been this way for years. Anybody up and wanna make a new friend? PM me. I’m always down to chat it up. That’s the part that sucks, while us insomniacs are awake all hours of the night ... everyone else is counting sheep and there is never anyone to hold a conversation with. "
Do you have insomnia characterized by vivid dreams and waking up frequently? This is what fixed my insomnia.,"I was inspired by 11ellie7's post because it sounded very similar to my own experience. My Insomnia was caused by a super-sensitized dopamine system resulting from ingesting a micro-dose of adderall. Now if you research this people will deny this can actually happen but when i look at peoples anecdotal reports they sounded very similar to my own. **So I went about fixing my insomnia with having  a sensitized dopamine system in mind**

When this first happened I would be lucky to get 3 hours of very light sleep in a night with vivid dreams. I resorted to taking benadryl to get more rest. This would result in about 5 hours of light sleep with extremely vivid dreams and frequent awakenings. Needless to say I was still exhausted.

*What finally worked for me was...*

**Magnesium Citrate or Glycinate- 400mg**

This one i'm sure you have all tried or are currently taking but when i forget to take this supplement I definitely notice. It's much harder to get to sleep without it as you can get 'restless legs'. I would say try both of these forms of magnesium as some people say citrate worked for them when glycinate didn't and vice versa.

**Noni Fruit Capsules- 1500mg**

This lowers your dopamine.

**L-tryptophan- Varying Dose from 3 grams to 500mg**

This is the most important supplement to my sleep as this converts into serotonin and melatonin. I still struggle with getting the correct dosage as I have needed less and less over time. I assume because my dopamine system is normalizing. When you take too much you will sleep like a rock and wont have a single dream but when you wake up you will feel like you haven't slept all. When you don't take enough you will experience frequent awakenings, you will have trouble getting to sleep and you will have vivid dreams. I started out needing 2.5 grams but right now my sweet spot is at 750mg. I can tell because I am still dreaming but am not waking up in the middle of my sleep. 

**Watching what you eat.**
I wont pretend to know why these foods keep me up but they do...
Soy sauce, smoked food like pulled pork, caffeine (obviously), alcohol and whey protein.

This altogether is what finally let me start feeling rested in the morning. If i miss any one of these supplements I will have problems with my sleep. 

So while you may not have had a bad reaction to adderall like me, you may still have a problem with your dopamine system. I'm curious if this can work for anyone else out there with similar insomnia to mine. 

Note: Im not a doctor im just an idiot who took adderall wrong.

i think ill do an all nighter....,This whole week i have been sleeping at 8 am till like 5 pm i dont know if i have insomnia but i just cant sleep my scedule is all upside down now shall i just pull an all nighter since its 6 am anyways? then sleep at 8-10 pm tomorrow (if i can)

It’s amazing how different you can feel with a solid block of sleep. I always think I am getting better when it does this but it always goes to crap again 😢 my normal sleep pattern because of insomnia now basically for 3 years is waking every 90 mins every night"
I’m not going to get any sleep tonight :(,"I’m basically half asleep, I can’t just get into a deep sleep. Maybe it’s because I messed up my sleep sleep schedule, but I think it might be the insomnia, it has gotten back and it’s making me unable to sleep well and messed up my sleep schedule. 

I have to wake up early and it doesn’t help that I barely get any sleep nowadays. I hate this so much, I just want to sleep peacefully. Sleeping used to be the only thing I enjoyed, now I can barely sleep for a few hours unless it’s on the weekends when I can wake up at 1 PM."
Been lying in bed for 2 hours straight,"Have to get up in less than 5 hours, I tried going to bed at a normal time, I was yawning, feeling like I would finally be able to get a normal sleep like normal human beings.

Hypnic Jerks keeping me up / making me scared to sleep,For the past couple of days I’ve been experiencing hypnic jerks when I try and fall asleep.

The Hum,"My apartment neighbor's bathroom vent fan creates an unbearable hum through the wall, permeating my whole body and waking me up.

Getting barely any sleep,"I was diagnosed with initial insomnia by my psychiatrist and she prescribed melatonin. But I think the melatonin has now affected my ability to stay asleep? Ever since I started it (last week) getting to sleep has been slightly better but not anything super noticeable but now every night I wake up multiple times and it takes hours to get back to sleep. I'm not tired I just have to force myself to not move and keep my eyes shut until I fall asleep. It's really frustrating but I don't want to not take the melatonin because then I'll be up till past midnight (when I usually would be asleep by 10) staring at the ceiling, super miserable. And I'm exhausted all day, yawning all the time. This mixed with my chronic depression is making it near impossible to get into college. I just want to be able to sleep like a normal person. Has anyone else struggled with this and has any solutions?"
Melatonin isn't working for me anymore.,"I've been taking melatonin supplements for about three years now. I used to take the 5 mg ones but I've had to up the dosage to 10 mg recently. My insomnia has gotten so bad that I have to take 5-10 of the 10 mg pills (50-100 mg of melatonin per night... )

I took 10 tonight and I've been tossing and turning for over two hours. 

I use rain and light thunder noises to help, been doing that for the past few months and it helped for a short while. 

I just don't know what to do anymore. Should I just go to the doctor and see what they say, or is there something else I could try before having to pay a visit to the doctors...?

"Help with benzos, please","Hey guys. After suffering through insomnia for about 8 months I found out its mainly because of my anxiety as I had a hyperactive thyroid. So my doc prescribed me 0.25mg/night Xanax and I’ve been taking it for the past three months. I recently came to know about how horrible benzos really are in the long run and I really want to get off the xanax now and find other solutions maybe. I’ve consulted this one homeopathy doctor twice in the past, once for anxiety and once for insomnia and both the times I got relief within 15-20 days. But I can’t see him now as I moved cities a few months back. Am I too deep into the benzos or should I start tapering down on my own already?

(Can’t sleep tonight as my finger hurts like hell and pain killers don’t seem to be working)"
Need some advice (please be helpful),"Good afternoonoon:

I’ve been reading along on this subreddit for a couple of weeks and thought I’d reach out for a little advice.

I’ve had issues sleeping (falling and staying asleep) for as long as I can remember.  I am currently in my mid-30’s.  I suffer from a severe cancer causing chronic blood disorder for which I am on two chemo regimens and have had a brain tumor and multiple strokes.  However my sleep patterns were dysfunctional before that began 10 yrs ago...but that diagnosis made it worse...being in and out of the hospital.

I have an interesting, intense job (despite my health) where I work from home and 1-3 days a week, take phones calls for 24 hrs straight and when needed, drive or fly out to hospitals for urgent consults in a rare specialty.  The next day, I am off and can rest.

The days I do not take call, I can take something to help me sleep, a z-drug and usually a muscle relaxant.  However, these are becoming less effective for me and are only lasting 3-4 hours.  If I take it at 10, I’m up by 2:15 wide awake.  I know by nature I tend to sleep best between 5am-10am but have to do a morning check in for work at 8:45 am.

I cannot take anything to help me sleep on the nights I work in the event I have to go somehere and I cannot fall asleep spontaneously...it can lead to 3 days/nights a week being awake for 24-36 hrs awake.

My doc is aware of this but his answer is that due to my illness, I have high inflammatory markers, which cause people to be stimulated and have a hard time sleeping...his answer is the meds.

These last few weeks, since the meds have been less effective, I have been struggling about what to do and want to see what else I can do to fall asleep without them and get spontaneous cat naps.

I know CBT and sleep hygiene is the best thing for me...but in this scenario, how to I attempt it?

I really need to focus on short bursts of sleep. Should I be waiting all through the night to get to 5am to lay down? Do I do productive things? What do I do for 8 hours between 9pm and 5am?

Any advice would be helpful.

Thanks.

You know how in Minecraft you cannot sleep when monster are nearby ?,Did I just discover the real reason for insomnia ?
"Eczema, and sleep.","I get bad eczema, and often hate the feeling of my skin touching my bed sheets and pillow.

I often go to bed at 10-12pm. But wont get to sleep until 5-6am. I often find my self almost asleep, with my eyes closed I can begin to hear sounds, and see visuals as If I'm dreaming, but I'm definitely still awake.  This make me end up waking up at like 11am-1pm sometimes.  I also find myself itching as im about to fall asleep, so I always jump up and run to put some cream on so I don't tear my skin apart.

How do I fix this? After reading a lot I'm going to try CBT and limiting my time in bed from 10pm-7am, even if I happen to not get to sleep.  The problem is that when I miss out on sleep my skin goes bad, so it can become an endless cycle. So I might use high strengh topical steroids at the same time while doing this? (I've been avoiding steroids for a year now, Due to Steroid withdrawal.)

&#x200B;

I just find my self wasting so much time. My days feel so short and I feel so groggy. This has been going on for about 5weeks now. Consistently.

Racing thoughts,I can't top thinking about all the stuff I've experienced throughout the day when trying to sleep it's so irritating.
Beware of Vitamin D,"So for the past few weeks my insomnia was way worse than usual. I take 8mg of tizanidine 25mg of amitriptyline and 3mg of melatonin and it typically gets me to sleep in a few hours. Recently though it took me 4 hours. I went through everything I was taking and couldn't figure it out. I realized my new calcium supplement contains vitamin D. I looked it up and was surprised it caused insomnia in most people. Also lucid dreaming which I experienced.

So watch out because this stuff is POWERFUL. Look through any multivitamins and other supplements you're taking. They say only take it in the morning but I had to stop taking it all together because I'm so sensitive to it. I know a lot of doctors prescribe vitamin D as an antidepressant aid. Sense most insomniacs have depression/anxiety we should be warned. "
Sleep changes when drinking.,"So, in the past (when my sleep and health were a little more stable not great but stable) when I drank it would always make me super tired and I’d sleep a good 9-10 hours (my normal then was like 6 or 7). For reference, I usually don’t drink more than once a month and don’t let myself go over three drinks if that. Now with some changes in meds and my sleep getting much less stable, (4-5ish hours at most, have a lot of trouble getting to sleep and don’t stay asleep for long) it’s done a complete 180. When I drink, I’m wide awake and get much less sleep if any. Has anyone experienced this and do you have any tricks to help (other than just not drinking) "

Anyone still feel really sleep deprived after a long period of decent sleep hygeinge?,"Ever since middle school I've had terrible sleep hygeine, eventually getting into a ~6 month period of <5 hours a night and no sleep 10% to 30% of the time depending on how bad things were at the time. But recently, for the last month or so, I've actually managed to overcome this by sticking to a schedule and not deviating off of it at all, with consistent electronics curfews, bedtimes and hours I need to be up making breakfast. Ideally the schedule would be getting me around 10 hours of sleep a night but I'm getting about 8 currently. But even after getting decent sleep for weeks I still feel very tired all of the time.

How can I break a negative association?,"I've been dealing with sleeplessness since mid-December. While visiting my in-laws around Christmas, I felt so desperate to be around people (husband works a lot) I asked if I could stay for a week or so. Being alone is awful when you're sleep deprived, in my opinion. They were generous and offered a month.

I ended up staying three weeks. While I was  there I developed a routine; PJs by 8, a certain TV show by 9, in bed by 10, melatonin at 10:30, and audiobook at 10:50. This was aided by the fact that my in-laws went to sleep early as well and are generally very calm/easygoing people. I went from 2 hours a night to 5-6 hours a night. Most nights I'd fall asleep around 11 and wake up anywhere between 4:50 and 5:50 AM. They had extra bedrooms I could switch to and a spacious living room I could sit in if I was awake. They were very welcoming in that they said I could even utilize the downstairs gym to wear myself out. I never needed it though. 

I arrived home earlier today and as soon as I stepped into the apartment, I felt queasy. Once they left, I started crying. I miss them a lot and have wished on many nights that I could just live with them permanently. 

I think I've created a negative association with this apartment. When I walked into the bedroom I felt instant fear. How can I break this association?"

Excessive response to 1 night no sleep,"Every night I take weed and ketamine (prescription not recreational) to fall asleep. Can’t remember the last time I slept sober. My insomnia now comes up just every few weeks and otherwise I sleep normally (I know I am comparatively lucky) , and I know it’s mostly stress related. But here is the problem:
When I miss one nights sleep or get less than 3 hours, I am completely unable to function the next day in a few ways. I am unable to follow even basic conversation, I can’t safely drive, and the worst of all for me is that I become extremely suicidal. I don’t know why but something about even occasional sleep deprivation makes me suicidal and have panic attacks. 

Has anyone dealt with this type of emotional response? "

"Thoughts I found comforting, for my fellow insomniacs.","Thought I would share a few revelations that have personally helped turn everything around in my struggles with insomnia. I hope these are useful for you.

To start, I’ll give you an analogy. Trying to get sleepy is a lot like trying to get hungry or thirsty: the body wants what it wants. 

Lets break this analogy down further: say someone’s saying “Ugh I can NOT get thirsty.” You’d imagine the helpful suggestions would be “have you tried taking a spoonful of salt?” Similarly for hunger: “have you tried looking at pictures of food?” 

Sure, you can take pills for all these things. And what those would do is just hijack the brain’s system to force-command these urges.

But the real point in this analogy here lies in how essential (and inevitable) these urges are 99.9999% of the time. In other words: you WILL fall asleep. It’s a guarantee.

Worried about being in that 00.0001%? I, too, was worried I would never sleep again. I was so worried, in fact, that I ended up not sleeping a wink one night and then having a full (and busy) day at work the next day.

And you know what happened? I was fine. Sure, I was delirious and loopy as hell, but the effect also felt like being drunk. I somehow did an even better job engaging with coworkers and getting my work done because I was too spaced out to overthink it. And then, racing home with a pounding heart and freezing cold wind tunnels, I found myself crashing for 12 hours.

I faced my worst-case scenario for the day and saw there was nothing to be afraid of. And now, instead of performing a million rituals before going to bed and taking every pill and supplement under the sun, I’m just going to trust my body to do its thing, and get comfortable in the meantime.

Got that pounding heart? Those racing thoughts? You can do something about them. The breathing exercises really do help.

And here’s that other ingredient that helped me: trust your body. Trust your brain. It’s gotten you this far (shitty brain memes notwithstanding) and is not just going to up and peace out on you.

Hope this helps."

When I started drinking alcohol I started getting 7 to 8 hours, and for the first time in my life I was able to snooze. That was a huge accomplishment for me since I usecto literally sleep 4 to 5 hours and jog for an hour and maybe sleep. 

 Now I've been cutting down drinking and I average 6 hours of sleep, but I can never get that last hour in. 6 doesn't feel right while 7 is perfect. I can squeeze a nap in and feel good, but that will frequently make me go to bed later and then a bad cycle starts so I avoid napping. 

The most recent time I was getting 7 hours and not drinking was when I worked at a call center. It was the only time I didn't have to workout or drink to sleep mindlessly. It's like maybe I needed to talk more... any recommendations or similarities? I almost feel bad because a lot of you suffer more than me but I hope my experience helps. 

Edit: I drink coffee. Oddly enough too I use to avoid coffee when I'd try to nap in my youth and it wouldn't work - I'd be up wide eyed. Now in my adulthood almost immediately can sleep after having a cup."
Catch 22,"I take prescribed Vistaril to sleep. I sleep. I feel tired and can’t get out of bed early the next day. Sleep more. 

Oh okay but I have things to do early tomorrow morning. I can’t be sleep pill hungover. 

I don’t take prescribed Vistaril. Don’t sleep. Crash and burn later. 

Wash, rinse, repeat. "
Miss the time when I was a kid and never thought twice about sleep.,This shit feels like a curse.
What is the severity of my sleeping disorder,"I have had problems with sleeping whole life

As an example in the last 7 days I have had 11hours total
I was up from Friday to Wedneday with 3hrs of sleep mid day Saturday
I was up from to 10 am Wednesday morning with no sleep
I slept for roughly 7hrs on Wednesday and one light nap for an hour at around 11pm and then I've been up since

It is not always this bad and my sleeping patterns are far from consistent

Some consistencies:
If I fall asleep before midnight I never sleep more than 2hrs

I sleep walk and talk 

I frequently will stay up for 48 hours without even a slight feeling of sleepiness

I experience auditory hallucinations after a few days of no sleep

Everytime I sleep I have crazy dreams 

After a week or 2 of minimal sleep I usually go into a weekend long sleep

When I'm tired my body feels weak but there is no ""sleepy"" feeling and the weakness usually takes  a few hours to get over

I haven't had consistent sleep since elementary school and for a 2 month stretch during the summer of 2018

Notes:
I rarely drink caffeine
Dont use drugs or alcohol 
Have seen sleep specialists with no success
Have tried medication with no success (melatonin aswell)

Some of these claims may seem ridiculous but this is my life and honestly it's a painful struggle and I've tried and I'm trying everything to over come it as I know it can be detrimental to physical and mental health.

Ask any questions below and please list any suggestions or help

Thanks"
Might be sleep apnea,"my sister recorded my sleeping I legit stop breathing for 2 minutes, this is probably the cause of my problems. Gonna see a sleep doctor lmao, hopefully, this is the end of this suffering. "
Do I have Insomia? please help,"I go through periods where I can’t sleep. I will typically be on my phone or laptop and then try to fall asleep, usually I will drift off then wake up and be up for 2/3 hours before falling asleep only to wake up 3 hours later and then not able to get back to sleep and I will start stressing over the fact i wont get enough hours of sleep for the next day ahead. This becomes severely frustrating and i get very uncomfortable in my bed and start rearranging my pillows and nothing seems to work, i keep them checking the time on my phone.

Is this classic insomia or is it something to do with looking at a screen, i usually have periods of it being bad and then most weeks i sleep like a baby. Please help x"
When your sleeping pills gave up on you,"Bought nytol. Been taking it every now and then. Ram out last month. Got it again but it ain't working, my body got used to it. I guess it's time to looking for something new"

16yo and having trouble recently,"So, I never in my life had problems to fall asleep, yeah sometimes I had a bad day and it was hard to sleep but nothing important, I would make up for it the next day.

 But in the past few days i'm having trouble sleeping, like I can fall asleep on a click just lay down, close my eyes and puff, sleeping but even tho I'm tired as f\* I can't seem to sleep over 3/4h and I wake up tired, I don't know what this may be, if it's just a week were I'm more stress (school and stuff) or that's something I got from my dad because he always had trouble sleeping...  
But it's a fact that in the last few days I've been stressing out for a few things over my private life probably it's because of that.

I hope you can help me.  
Thanks."
Resource: Activity which I use to help me fall asleep,"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8S_0Hkn0xI

I often suffer from communicating to myself in my head when I lay my head down and I stumbled upon this technique of speaking e x t r e  m e l y slowly--thinking the same thoughts, just making them come out very slowly in my head or mind. I continue to talk and say the same things (sometime negative or concerned or something similar) but I just force it to come out very slowly in a very dramatic manner--just like slow motion in a movie--very exaggerated. I don't know how but yes if I practice this, it causes me to tumble into sleep in a matter of a short time and I hardly remember the process of falling asleep after that. Whereas before I would toss and turn and think about the fact that I haven't fallen asleep yet.

The second exercise in this video I don't use as frequently because I don't suffer from imagining scenes that keep me awake as much as I suffer from ideas and words spoken in my head from concerns or dresses, etc.

Just to give context to the severity of my sleeplessness: My insomnia and apnea lasted several years and was very acute. I even occasionally abused over the counter medicines (NyQuil, Advil PM, Diphenhydramine--the antihistamine ingredient in Benadryl). I tried changing my diet one way and then another, exercising, not exercising, alcohol, marijuana, sex, sleeping outside, all sorts of peculiar stuff--anything to help at all without having to go to the doctor (didn't have access to healthcare at the time).

I find heavy, exhausting, mixed exercise routines (like burpees, jumping jacks, push ups then pull ups) in a drill-like routine helpful but--just like others people--I find it impractical to require myself to exercise every day just to be able to fall asleep easily.

Reminder: This technique isn't meant to be used in replace of doctor's orders or prescriptions, but someone else may find this technique useful in calming themselves down when thinking continually and nervously during bedtime.

Happy sleeping."
14 and can't sleep well,"Hi, I'm 14 and I'm writing this at 1 in the morning.

The past few days have been really hard for me. I wasn't able to sleep well. I usually lie on my bed, and wait, and wait, and wait but I cant fall asleep. I try changing positions, opening my window, adding another pillow, etc , etc, but nothing helps.

I usually go to sleep around 11 PM. 

I really miss the times I was a child and slept from 9pm to 8am...

I usually stay up until around 3~4 am, when I'm finally able to fall asleep. 

Can someone please help? Any advice on falling asleep faster? Keep in mind that I'm a teenager."
Another one of those nights,"Every night I put the tv on to distract my mind until i fall asleep. It has been working for half a year but suddenly it isn’t anymore. My mind goes everywhere, usually negative making me unable to sleep. 

Idk what i want with this post , talk to me or maybe advice? 
"
Anyone else's insomnia constantly changing?,"Some nights I can fall asleep within an hour but wake up at 3am and can't go back to sleep. Some nights I don't fall asleep at all until 4am. Some nights I fall asleep easily but wake up every 30 minutes.

If it was consistent I feel like it would be easier to address, but it seems I'm just an overall mess."
Chronic insomnia.,"Tried all OTC and most Rx meds, lifestyle changes, etc. Feeling like this will never get better. "
Tios for someone new to sleep struggles,"Hi all, I'm seeking guidance and advice from anyone with experience dealing with insomnia. A little back story, I'm a VFX Artist working in London and achieved my first permanent contract the begining of last year (yay) unfortunately, we moved around October and I now work all day in a darkened basement with the lights off, I believe this to be the cause  of my insomnia. The only true daylight I get is the 5 ish minute walk I take to the gym every lunchtime ( about the only thing that makes me happy at the  moment) 

I lay in bed for HOURS and then I'm exhausted all day, it's affecting my mood, my workouts and my work which I love. Anyone have any advice they could share? Please? "
What would a doctor prescrive for insomnia?,"I usually get 3 or 4 hours sleep (5am-9am) it takes me around 2-3 hours to get to sleep and i know about eating healthy exercising will help. But these last 2 nights i havent slept at all

Ive been off work for a few months and need to get back into a good sleeping pattern for work as i work 12 hour days and would need to wake up at 4am and i usually can only get to sleep later than that. I drive alot for work and use power tools so i need to be alert. 

Im also finally free from heavily using xanax everyday and i dont really want to start that again because it sucks. 

Should i go see a doctor? Would that help? Would i need to tell him about my past struggles? I have a feeling whatever i get prescribed ill bevome depeandant/addicted too."
Is there a support sub for people battling their insomnia in any organized way?,"I think of it like this. When people want to use reddit for support and info about losing weight, they can go to r/loseit.  If they are following a certain diet, usually theres a sub for it for people doing the same thing.

Is there any sub like that (following an organized, structured plan) for battling insomnia?

For instance, I'm currently losing weight and getting fitter, and I get a lot from reading other peoples' experiences, posting NSVs (non-scale victories), getting info about how my body works.  

I also really enjoy the auto threads that pop up every day, where once a week there is an open thread on a topic we all are likely to have in common - helps me see what's working and what's not for other people.

I've had trouble sleeping my whole life and I'd love to find an online support community that's actually trying to make and keep changes!"
What medicines have you taken for insomnia and how do you rate each of them?,"Ratings out of 10 based on effectiveness, side-effects and cost.

Melatonin: 6/10. It’s prescription only in my country and very expensive. Loses its effectiveness but no side effects)

Imovane (Zopiclone): 7/10. Very effective and no hangover effects. But also extremely addictive and tolerance develops quickly. Persistent bad taste in mouth the next day is a horrible side effect too.

Benadryl (diphenhydramine): 6/10. Reasonably effective and cheap. Dry mouth side effects and hard to get in my country.

Phenergan (Promethazine): 7/10. More effective than Benadryl and better for anxiety as well. OTC in my country. Relatively cheap.

Temazepam: 7/10. Cheap and effective. Same as Imovane but cheaper in my country and no taste disturbances. Also addictive and tolerance develops quickly.

Elavil (Amitriptyline): 5/10. Very cheap but doesn’t always put me to sleep. Lots of side effects especially with long term use.

Remeron (Mirtazapine): 9/10. Has always been effective for me and is very cheap. Increased appetite and weight gain with long term use and can make you sleep 10+ hours. Didn’t give it a full 10/10 due to side effects.

Belsomra (Suvorexant): 3/10. Very expensive in my country and doesn’t seem to really work. But better than nothing at all.

Doxylamine: 5/10. Similar to Benadryl but less effective and longer lasting."
Is ringing in my ears a side effect of no/poor sleep?,I've been getting terrible sleep for a long while now and usually when I wake up or am about to go to bed I have this ringing in my ears. Is that a normal side effect from not getting much rest? Thank you for the help Reddit.
Tips on being a normal human,"I’m a full time college student, only 21 years old and I have horrible insomnia and tinnitus. Mines the type where I can usually fall asleep but wake up every hour or so. Any tips for this? I’m trying to be a normal person and engage with my friends but I’m so tired all the time. I have no idea how I’m going to pass my classes and it’s terrible. I feel like I’m too young for this "
Always had OCD/Anxiety but now genuinely terrified I've somehow got Sporadic Fatal Insomnia? Or is it just typical insomnia symptoms?,"I've always been a stressy person and last December was when life and university took a toll on my mental health. This resulted in a single night without sleep. I thought this was just because of stress, so I went home from uni and saw my girlfriend. For three nights I slept like a baby. I came back to uni, I ended up with 3 sleepless night plus one good night then 3 more sleepiness nights. 

The thing is they're not completely sleepless(?), as they're more like interrupted one hour sleeps with really vivid dreams but I'd spend most of the night awake meaning in the morning I'd feel like complete shit. 

I'm now currently back home, and it's been a month now. So far there's been approximately two 7 nights of good sleep with really shit sleep in-between the two. 
But for the past few nights it's been the same thing, I wake up every hour (doesn't even feel like I'm asleep) with either really vivid dreams or just feeling like I had my eyes closed for an hour (like I'm stuck at stage 1) and I'm genuinely terrified that I won't get any more deep sleep because it's sFI as I feel like I've got the other symptoms such as shakiness and trembling in my limbs. Or does this seem like typical symptoms of anxiety powered insomnia? "
I've been awake 27 hours and Anxiety is destroying me :(,"I have currently been awake for 27 hours and I have a massive headache and I feel extremely on edge and Anxious. I wasn't able to sleep last night as I got home quite late and then had a firealarm drill as soon as I got into bed. By the time it was all over it was 6am and I hadn't slept (I had been up since 9am the day before). I have tried for the last 8 hours (its now 1:30pm) to desperately get some sleep because  my Anxiety is really putting on the verge of tears with this. However I am unable to fall asleep which is increasing my Anxiety. It's already starting to get dark here and I am so fearful that I will not be able to sleep tonight either.

How do you guys deal with this? This insomnia is bad enough but my GAD is really pushing me over the edge here. I know in my head that I need to try and remain calm and tell myself that sleep will come eventually but I am seriously finding it hard to do this. My Anxiety keeps telling me with each hour that goes by 'you've been awake 26 hours, now 27 hours' etc

This is absolute hell.

Any help on how to deal with this would be very much appreciated"
Replacing Sleep Med Failure,"I posted a while ago about me lowering my dose of Seroquel from 150mg to 0 in 3 months. I went down to 100mg and constantly have the falling sensation, but only if I take Seroquel that night. If I take 2 NyQuil pills (30mg DXM, APAP 325mg, and Doxylamine succinate 12.5mg) and Benadryl (50mg of DPH) I can fall asleep easy. If I continue to do this will I develop an addiction? I was told DPH wasn't addictive, so I could stop the NyQuil. I do not want to start a dependence on a pill. Thanks! :)"
I haven't slept more than 4-5 hours in a year.,"Last night I got 2. Tonight I'll probably get none. I lay down so tired and exhuasted, but I never fall asleep. I usually average 3-4 hours, but it's been bad lately. Worse than usual. It's killing me. Why can't I fall asleep????
Before all this started I could sleep 8-14 hour no problem. Pass out Instantly. Now, if I got 8 hours, I could probably do a backflip."
How do I identify insomnia?,"I have difficulty falling asleep on most nights but some nights I'm able to sleep well. I probably try sleeping for about 3 hours until I give up and I end up sleeping at around 5am... this is the case 6 days a week. I don't want to overreact and say that I have insomnia but there have been streaks of up to a month where I'm unable to sleep even if I feel tired and no matter how hard and long I try I'll never be able to sleep before 5am. I also frequently have nights where I'll fall asleep immediately  (maybe around 10pm) but I'll wake up in the middle of the night (around 2-3am) and won't be able to sleep again until the sun comes up. Even saying this, the nights I do fall asleep I fall asleep very quickly and I have long uninterrupted sleeps. 

I never use my phone when I am trying to sleep and when I wake up in the middle of the night.

Edit: I also rarely take naps during the day and I usually fall asleep at around 5am and wake up in 3-4 hours and in good days I get around 7 hours. "
Insomnia apps/podcasts?,"My husband has insomnia on and off and it drives me potty (no doubt it’s worse for him). He won’t go to the dr, which is fair enough-ish in that dr will probably start by telling him to keep a sleep diary, so he might as well wait until he’s done a few weeks of that. I’ve just discovered the existence of white noise apps etc, can anyone recommend a good one? "
An insomnia related dump,"I first established my insomnia as a kid. My parents fought for years while it was time for me to go to sleep. Then there was bathroom related sleep issues as I got older. I was afraid to get up an use the bathroom because I'd get yelled at. So I'd hold it for as long as I could. Then I think I passed that particular anxiety to my kid. Then as a teenager I was just simply prone to being awake later and later and later. Then I discovered alcohol. That put me out eventually. But affected being normal and awake during the day. 
Then nicotine helped me fall asleep. But both drinking and smoking aren't considered decent visas for a teenager. So nix that, mostly. Laying awake at night became a thing. Like it is now. 
Fast forward a few years and I met my wife, had children and started working in prison. My wife, being bipolar and untreated for decades had the same insomnia issues. Hence, my insomnia became our insomnia. And we both developed a tolerance for alcohol, and over the counter sleep aids. 
Add time, stress and weight gain to get the dreaded sleep apnea. Left, untreated for. Years. Add anxiety to the already anxious mix and throw in a healthy amount of severe clinical depression and you get my nearly current mix.
I get a CPAp. Which helps. But now I'm afraid to fall asleep without it. And I dont want to go to the bedroom and toss and turn and ruin my wife sleep. So now I'm afraid to go to sleep for fear of waking her up and not being able to sleep myself. 
Kids get older, work and family life demand that I function best working graveyard shift. My anxiety gets worse, my alcohol use helps me develop gout and my kids cant just get up and take care of themselves. So I gotta wait to sleep and feel certain I'll get the sleep I need to be able to sleep.
Ambien helps immensely. So did klonapin. I Overdoesed on klonapin and ambien and alcohol last year so my doctor stopped prescribing me the klonapin. 
I convinced her to keep me on the ambien. I overdosed this weekend on ambien and alcohol. Not on purpose, like last time. Not on purpose. So now I expect her to take me off of that too. 
My psych on the other hand has me on seroquel, hydroxazine and a regular anxiety medication. The seroquel makes me fat. And so does being fat makes me fat. 
So I finally get the right amount of A. relaxation. B. Sleep meds and C. The time to adjust to all of it only  overdose this weekend. 
Now I'm afraid to sleep, fall asleep, stay asleep, get enough sleep and still A. Function like a responsible adult. Fuck. Isomnia. "
"ADHD-insomnia and light sleeper, people talking quietly in another room on another floor is enough to keep me up","I've had insomnia all my night, and can mostly manage it. I occasionally have flare-ups where nothing will get me to sleep until like an hour before I've got to be up. But also it doesn't take much outside stimuli to keep me from getting sleep.   

I use pot edibles and a bit of melatonin (low dose) as sleep aids. But if, say, somebody is talking or listening to music and it's just on the edge of my hearing, it's enough to keep me up. If I put earplugs in, the feel of the earplugs is enough to keep me up. If I run white noise, the white noise is enough to keep me up (and doesn't completely cover the voices.) Added a gravol and a nighttime cold pill after three hours of frustration, still not getting to sleep. 

I've tried lavender and 5htp and phenibut and a ton of other things, herbal and prescription. Most just make me restless, prescription sleep stuff makes me feel like shit the next day.       


It's not fair of me to expect what is essentially normal conversation volume on another floor but just happens to carry up the stairs weird to be completely silent all the time.    


Is there anything you folks know of that might help? I'm fucking going nuts here rotating in my bed, it's going on 11pm and I've got to be up for 5."
Not sure if I have insomnia,"I dont want to self diagnose, although I have always had issues sleeping. I'm always at least up until 1-2 am and whenever I do fall asleep before then I'll wake up too early like at 2-3 am. I really need to talk to a doctor but it's incredibly hard for me to do that because of social anxiety and how introverted I am. I also think I might have depression because of personality changes I've been experiencing and idk if that's link to this possible insomnia i have worsening."
Can I take my sublingual CBD oil with Sonata when I get anxiety around bedtime?,"I don’t want to mix a benzo with Sonata cause that could be dangerous, but if I get anxiety can I take my sublingual CBD oil with Sonata? Cause I’m my experience with taking CBD oil and benzos it lessened the effects of the benzo because of the way the CBD oil works on the liver. Idk if it would do the same with Sonata, or if it maybe will heighten the effects. Idk. I just hate that my anxiety is bothering right before I want to sleep. So if anyone knows if CBD oil lessens or strengthens the Sonata please let me know, cause I just want a good nights rest :("
Best behavior when you can't slepp? Lie with eyes closed or do something?,"I'm usually just lie with my eyes closed becuase I'm afraid that if I would do something different then my brain would get active and my chances of fallng asleep would become lower. But is it true? Maybe it is better to read ? Sometimes I want to turn the lights on and grab a book, but I don't do that because I always thought that it is better to avoid any light and lie there in the dark."
Went to grt a haircut and it would seem my sleepless shows,"The other day I went to get a haircut. Once I sat down the lady commented on how tired I looked. It's getting ridiculous at this point, the bags under my eyes have become so large that, ironically, they are the size of sleeping bags"

Insimnia and tinnitus is such a bad combination,Anyone elses ears ringing while they struggle to fall asleep?
Thoughts preventing me from sleeping,"I have narrowed down what prevents me from sleeping. I seem to have gotten into a loop of thoughts that prevent me from sleeping I even think about it during the day. When I’m trying to sleep, I start relaxing and dozing off but then I think are you asleep? And then I wake myself up. Or sometimes it’s like a bolt of energy and all the muscles in my body jerk. I’m currently on lexapro during the day and Geodon at night. The Geodon knocks me the fuck out. I can always count on about 4 hours of sleep from it. I just wanted to know if any of you have experienced the same recurring intrusive thoughts at night and if so how did you stop them?"
"I just don’t know what to do, nothing seems to work","I have never been a great sleeper, but since getting tinnitus it has been even worse. My sleep hygiene isn’t always the best, but I doubt that alone explains it. 

I tend to fall asleep and wake up one or more times at night. I am unsure if it is sleep apnea, though I doubt it given I have lost 26 pounds over the last year. 

I have tried everything: benzodiazepines, Gabapentin, melatonin, Belsomra, weed, Valerian Root, CBD oil, hydroxozine, amitriptyline, Benadryl, etc. 

Some of those produce better results than others but even nights like tonight where I take 2-4 of those together they still don’t help me stay asleep.

I am starting to exercise more but I’m unsure if and when it might start helping. I think I need anesthesia at this point..."
Im not tired when I should be.,One problem I have with sleeplessness is when I'm tired. Let's start with when I try to sleep at night. Usually I doesn't work out too well. Just right now actually I've been trying to sleep for two hours to no avail. I'll eventually pass out and get little sleep. Then in the morning I wake up miserable and tired. Throughout the day I can't stay awake I'm my classes. I pass out and miss out on lecture notes or I fall asleep at work or whatever. I'm dead tired throughout the day. Then the second I try to go to sleep when I want to I'm not tired anymore. Anyone else have this issue? Please help. I really don't want to fail my classes and lose my job due to my sleep problems.

How do can I learn to sleep 8 hours?,"Hey everyone I'm new to this sub Reddit and have recently become desperate. Over the past couple years my bedroom transformed from a quiet place of rest and relaxation to a battle field for good sleep. I usually lose. Anyways I have two main problems with sleep. 1: falling asleep is always a pain and can take up to a couple hours. And 2: I can't make it throughout the night without waking up 4-5 times. This is usually my average. Some nights I wake up every half hour or so. And I have tried just about every drug or medicine in the book. So I come here asking for advice, how do I fall asleep more reliably? And how do I stay asleep. Thank you for the help and have a good night's sleep."
SUCCESS STORY: I cured my chronic insomnia. And you will too.,"I wanna tell you my success story. And I did it COMPLETELY DRUG-FREE. Before that I want to mention 2 very important things:

1. I had extreme chronic insomnia for 2 months (1.5 hrs sleep/wk), I really believe this method that I’m about to describe would work for over 95% of you. I wouldnt make a statement like that lightly.
2. When I first started it all looked so hopeless - few success stories. I thought I was screwed. I came to realise, this is only because of 3 reasons: 1) people are too strict with their schedules (A 24 hour schedule is the worst idea ever for a chronic) and make it unnecessarily hard on themselves 2) doctors are too quick to prescribe drugs that at best mask the problem 3) those who succeed rarely share their experience.

So once you try this method and succeed PLEASE report back on here, so others have some insight and hope.

MY JOURNEY:

(***TLDR version of the cure at the bottom of this post if you're impatient)***

***Cause***: Moved to new apartment - lot of construction work in the day and lot of noise in night from parties. I barely managed to sleep the first few nights, and after the 4th night couldn't sleep whatsoever. Thereafter, I shifted to a quiet dark nice apartment. But the sleep did not return.

***Month 1 and Month 2***: I was sleeping 1.5 hours a week. Brutal. Tossing and turning almost all the time every night never falling to sleep. Chronic insomnia (both onset and maintenance). Became highly anxious, terrified and depressed which made things worse.

Last 2 weeks of Month 2: I tried many things (meditation, breathing CBT etc, didnt work) but a few things helped. These steps helped me get from 0 to 1 hour of sleep per night:

I decided to completely eliminate my anxiety, stress and depression in the day (without drugs). NO DRUGS NEEDED. I succeeded at doing this by:

\-----------------------------ANXIETY SOLUTIONS---------------------------

1. Cancelled all my jobs (jobless) but I’m a freelancer so easy for me (could get back on the horse any time).
2. I found watching 6 whole hours of comedy before my “bedtime” **very very helpful.** If I felt down in the day I would watch comedy then too. Impossible to laugh and be anxious simultaneously.
3. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT: I trained myself to never think of the insomnia in the day. Any time a thought about sleep or insomnia entered my mind, I switched my focus to something else.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Still only 1 hour a night of very light sleep. In fact I would wonder if I even slept that hour.**

***Month 3:*** Another former chronic insomniac advised me to try stay awake for 36 hours and crash to bed as it cured his insomnia. But he was also additionally using Gabapentin drug, which was not an option for me. *My first thought when I heard this was “Yeah yeah. I’ve gone an entire week without sleep before. No use”.* **But then I thought to myself “maybe it matters if you’re wide awake vs awake but with your eyes closed”**. So I decided I was going to try the 36 hour thing , but with my eyes wide open. Could only last for 27 hours.

It worked! Or so I thought.

I slept a full 6 hours the first night. Next few nights went to bed at the same time hoping i was cured. Bad news: 2 hours on the second night and 1 hour a night thereafter. But, this was the first time in months I got REAL sleep. Previously even the rare “sleep” I had gotten was sh\*t\*y ultra-light sleep. This new sleep felt like I had been knocked out cold and woke up as if I came out of a coma. Very satisfying.

***But the experience showed me one thing: If I stayed awake long enough, eventually I would crash. I could live with having to stay awake for 27 hours then sleep 6 (33 hour cycle).*** It would certainly be miles better than my current state of sleepless living. More importantly, I realised that if this worked, I could reduce the awake time gradually week by week and end up in a normal 24 hour cycle. And that’s exactly what happened and cured my insomnia.

I knew 27 hours awake was overkill. After some trial and error, I settled on the following pattern for the next 10 days:

\------STEP 2 TEN DAY PERIOD----------------------

* Staying wide awake for 21 hours FROM THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT OF BED. No naps, no lying down. No you cant count the last sleepless hours in bed.
* Getting 3-4 hours of amazing deep sleep and then unfortunately, automatically waking up
* Going back to bed and getting a broken light sleep here and there over the course of next 3-4 hours.

\---------------------------------------------------

From the very moment I started this, I felt amazing every day. Zombie insomnia was instantly gone!! I was 98% back to normal in the daytime. Felt just as sharp, alert and active as my pre-insomnia days. FROM DAY 1!!

The quality of the two legs of sleep kept getting deeper and deeper everyday. After those 10 days,  I reduced my awake time by 0.5 hours every 5 days. Now I’ve settled on 18 hours awake + 6 hours of sleep (24 hours total!). I go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time on a normal human cycle. Not had a sleepless night since I started. cured!

So what should YOU do given my experience? My suggestion would be the following (LEGAL DISCLAIMER: I’m not a doctor or expert, nor I do not claim to be  on the internet, so consult one before trying anything I say)

**TLDR Summary:**

**STEP 1: Stay fully wide awake (eyes open, not in bed) for 36 hours. Sleep as long as you are able after that. It may be 2 hours or it may be 11 hours. Dont worry about that. Doesn't matter much in the long run.**

**STEP 2: Thereafter, for 10 days do what I did as discussed in the “STEP 2 10 DAY PERIOD” section above. Also, do not skip STEP 1. Its important, dont ask me why.**

**STEP 3: Reduce awake time by 0.5 hours each week until you are down to a normal day cycle.**

**While doing this:**

1. **Eliminate any source of stress and keep the anxiety/depression low. see my tips (see anxiety solutions section above).**
2. **Sleep in a noise free, light free (pitch dark room) and avoid foods that might cause indigestion/gas.**

Best of luck to you all! Remember you to report back when you succeed!

Do any of you usually dream when insomniac?,"So I went to bed last night at 9:20 and turned off the light at 10 pm, having woken up at 9 am on that day. In hopes of being productive I set my alarm to 6:30, closed my eyes and tried to sleep. 

This was one of the weirdest nights I had.
My feet were freezing, I rolled around for an hour looking for a comfortable position, and then a million thoughts came to my mind, followed by the weirdest dreams. I must have fallen asleep somewhere around midnight, perhaps, and ""woke up"" feeling so hot that I had to take off my socks and roll up my sleeves (it's winter here and my room is very cold). After cooling off and trying to fall back asleep... the alarm rung... After beeping for half an hour (?) I turned it off and slept, trusting I wouldn't stay in bed late, and between waking up and dreaming I finally got up from bed at 8 am, feeling energized. This time it did feel like a sleeping. 

Checking the sleep cycle app, I woke up at about 5 am. The weirdest parts are that even when I manage to sleep 8 hours straight I never wake up this energized, it took me no effort to raise from bed. I also usually remember the dream I had right before waking up but this time I remember clearly most of the dreams throughout the night, like I was never really asleep. 
How can this be???
Have any of you ever had a similar experience?

Favorite sleep aids?,"I'm looking for some new sleep aids to try, preferably ones that have no hangover the next day. What are your favorites? Here are ones I've tried and my hangover rating: 

* **Melatonin**: (no hangover) Up to 10 mg, both immediate release and long acting. 
* **L-theanine**: (no hangover) Up to 1G. A little bit of a calm feeling for the first couple of hours the next day...doesn't impact cognitive function for me so I wouldn't call this a hangover. 
* **Magnesium Glycinate** (no hangover): Up to 1 G. A little relaxed the next day, wouldn't really call this a hangover. 
* **Benadryl** (moderate hangover): Up to 50 mg. Feel mild cognitive impairment for most of the next day, also get mood impairment (crabby and irritable). Don't like to use unless absolutely necessary.
* **Kava** (mild hangover)**:** A bit spacey for the first few hours of the next day.
* **Unisom** (doxylamine succinate) (moderate hangover): Up to 1 tablet, mild drowsiness/cognitive impairment for most of the next day. No moodiness unlike Benadryl which is strange since this is also a gen-1 antihistamine. 
* **Trazadone** (severe hangover): Up to 50 mg..this stuff knocks me out and knocks me out bad...definitely the big guns. However, I'm borderline non-functional the next day..very spacey and poor working memory. Mood is great though. 
* **Ambien** (severe hangover): Up to 20 mg...I have a love-hate relationship with Ambien. Things are very enjoyable if I stay up on it, but I always feel like shit the entire next day both energy wise and mood wise...I basically feel like I haven't slept, even if I got 8 hours. I'd rather get 4 hours of sleep than take this stuff and get 8 hours, that's how crappy it makes me feel.
* **Lunesta** (moderate hangover): I've only taken this a few times but I definitely remember feeling a bit spacey the next day. Not as bad as Ambien since I wasn't crabby but still didn't really feel rested. 

My favorite sleep stack now is 10 mg melatonin ER, 400 mg L-theanine, and 500 mg magnesium. Sometimes it's not enough though so I'd love to hear about ways I can tweak my stack. "
