Does sleep deprivation make anybody else‚Äôs anxiety skyrocket?,"When I‚Äôm sleep deprived my already bad anxiety skyrockets to insane levels.

It‚Äôs really bad, I think I‚Äôm dying and I‚Äôm paranoid about everything. It honestly feels like hell on earth when I‚Äôm sleep deprived. It‚Äôs a extremely scary experience.

And the worse thing about it is it makes it harder to sleep! "
Has anyone else start to resent people who can sleep at the drop of a hat?,"Lucky me, out of all 6 of my siblings...I‚Äôm the one that inherited mother‚Äôs alluring insomnia/anxiety combo.

Gave up on sleeping and I feel great.,"Rolled around for 8 hours in bed. Proceeded to the jump out of bed. Took a cold shower, brushed my teeth, drank pre workout, cooked myself a nice breakfast and exercised. Fuck my brain. If it doesn't want to sleep then I'm not giving it jack shit. I've had enough of letting my insomnia make me depressed and anxious. I realize this post is probably not very meaningful but I just wanted to write something down for the sake of doing so. "
How the fuck do normal people just shut their brains off at night?,"The minute my head hits the pillow my mind starts racing...I'll think of everything from sports, to family, to current events, etc. If I lay in bed long enough, I start getting anxious thoughts about my past and my life problems and my heart starts beating and I feel hot or empty.

Just shut the fuck up brain, I just want to find some peace of my mind and rest. It's incredible how some people can just lay down and be out in 10-15 minutes."

"Phones should have an extra low brightness setting for insomniacs, cuz after looking at that shit for hours laying in bed I swear it looks brighter","Yeah sooo I‚Äôve been laying in bed for 5 hours with no luck, and this will be my second all nighter in a row. Love insomnia

Edit: if you have an iPhone, night mode will not further dim the screen, but it will ‚Äúwarm‚Äù the colors, which helps. One thing I use to actually lower the screen brightness which I think many people don‚Äôt know about is go to settings > general > accessibility > enable zoom. After that, double tap your screen with three fingers, and a menu should pop up. Press full screen zoom, zoom out, then go to filters and select low light.

Edit2: going into settings > general > accessibility > display accommodations > reduce white point 
will also significantly lower brightness

I had all my little rituals down pretty good for awhile, not sure what went wrong but this week has really gone sideways and last night I just wanted to go to bed early and rest.  Totally boomeranged; I slept about two hours and then my brain decided that since it was nice and quiet it'd be a great time to open the file drawers of ""shit I've forgotten about, feel guilty about, or generally bugs me if I think about it.""

anyone else get crazy anxiety when they cant sleep?,been having some bad insomnia lately and i just get so anxious to the point where im grinding my teeth and i want to scream because i cant fall asleep. i will just close my eyes and lay there for hours and nothing. my mind just wont shut up. its extremely frustrating not to mention im already anxious because i have shit to do the next day and by 3 i know theres no way im sleeping all night.

Weighted Blankets,"Another reddit user inspired me to try weighted blankets to help cure my insomnia. I weigh 130 and ordered a 15 lb blanket (needs to be at least 10% of your body weight). I'm amazed at how well it's working. Usually when I wake up in the middle of the night after 1-2 hours sleep, I lay there anxiety-ridden and never fall back asleep. The weighted blanket calms me down so that drifting back off isn't a problem.

Considering I've previously spent hundreds on insomnia cures to no avail, the $165 sticker shock on something that actually works (for me at least) seems small. I just now realize how much I sound like an infomercial, but I'm happy to say I've been actually sleeping. "
"I solved what was Causing my Insomnia, it was an Incalculable Blessing in Disguise.","I'm a healthy, fit 28 year old male, I exercise regularly.

&#x200B;

For months, I have been having intense insomnia, where I would go a week without Rem sleep. 

I tried EVERYTHING, exercise, Herbs, melatonin, CBT, Oils, Ambien, FUCKING EVERYTHING. 

Nothing worked, my condition kept deteriorating. 

&#x200B;

Out of desperation, I went to a sleep disorder clinic, who was like, ""What the hell? a kid your age should NOT be having this much trouble, you need a full sleep study."" 

&#x200B;

They preformed a full sleep study, and I had an unusual form of sleep apnea. 

I was stunned, because I thought only old fat guys got it. 

&#x200B;

That is untill I started reading about the condition, and my blood began to chill. 

  
This disorder frequently affects men, who snore, and it puts extreme stress on their cardiovascular systems.

Without treatment, its normal for men with this disorder to die suddenly, in their sleep, of heart attacks, in their mid 40's. 

  
That's exactly how my father died in 2005, he was 45.

His death was unexpected, and it left a permanent scare. 

I always feared that I would meet his same fate. 

&#x200B;

I think that because of insomnia, I might actually continue living. Because if it wasn't for insomnia manifesting itself in my late 20's, I would have never been diagnosed.

"If you feel you're about to lose it, read this","Hi. I'm /u/GrayZOX. You probably don't know me, considering I don't really post that much (and when I do, it's usually on /r/OCD, another great subreddit). 

I'm only 19, but the past 6 years of my life have been absolute hell. I've been wracked with debilitating OCD issues, a slew of general anxiety issues, and bouts of insomnia that come at the worst times. I've felt pretty constantly isolated from my family, friends, and fellow human beings because of all of it. 

I'm posting here on /r/insomnia because I'm currently having sleep troubles myself. I've gotten probably 3-3.5 hours total in the past few days. I have a massive exam tomorrow that I've been trying to study for, but chances are that I won't do that great, and one of my grades for this semester will be in jeopardy. 

What I want to say is this: whatever you're going through is only temporary. Be positive. Smile. Try your best at whatever you're doing to get by. 

I know it's corny and cliche and the like, but it's true. I guess it's the pragmatic side of me, but no matter what you're going through, it will not last forever. Every second of hell you've gone through is one less you will have to go through to recover, and it's another page in the history book. Every sleepless night is one less you have to soldier through. Recovery can happen, it's out there. 

We've all been there. We feel so bad that it's like we're on the edge of the abyss. Hell, we probably wouldn't care if we fell into that abyss and ended it all either. But every second you suffer there is another footstep towards controlling your life, controlling yourself, and making your life the best it can be. 

6 years, man. But I trudge on. Despite my lack of sleep, my crushing anxiety, and the night terrors that I'm dealing with, I cracked a smile in the shower earlier. It's amazing what a bit of positivity can do.

 I'm not dreading tonight, or tomorrow night, or the night after. Sleep will find its way to me, and I'll be ready for it. I'll continue the CBT plan that I'm rolling with, try my best to comfort myself and relax, and maybe I'll be able to get some restful hours in. Maybe not, though. Maybe I won't get any in at all. Which is cool, because sleep will find me when it wants to. 

Through hell and back countless times, and I still haven't had nearly enough yet to give up. I hope this was a bit of inspiration to all of you; we're all soldiers, and we're mentally much stronger than we could ever imagine."
Anyone else feels suicidal when the insomnia is so bad? Wondering if this is a normal thing,"i keep getting negative thoughts and i wish id die on the spot. I noticed it alwaaays happens when im tired and sleep deprived. I don‚Äôt wish death because of my bad insomnia I just simply get negative thoughts about life in general. Id never act on it though because i know they‚Äôll go away after i sleep.

When i reach 16-18  hrs of being awake this starts happening and that happens everyday since all of my days are more than 16 waking hours.

Some days are okay because I‚Äôd sleep after 18 hours so id get these annoying though for an hour of two. 

Some days are horrible because i might stay awake for 24-72 hours. 

This usually happens when im alone and everyone is sleeping. 



When i sleep and wake up i think to myself ‚Äúwhat the hell was I thinking!‚Äù  "
This is silly but it‚Äôs 4 am and I‚Äôm crying because I can‚Äôt sleep,"I feel really dumb for crying over such a petty reason but I have work in three hours and I work until 9pm. Now I don‚Äôt want to sound pessimistic but it feels like this day won‚Äôt be a good one. Again. Wow.

I can't stop fucking thinking,My brain does not shut the fuck up. One minute I'm thinking about everything I've seen on the internet today. One minute I'm thinking about how my life is ruined because I've lost so much sleep that I'm going insane. Then I'm thinking about how I'll never recover and I should just kill myself. Then I just get angry and upset and emotional. I should be in an institution.

""Dude, just count to 1000 while laying down, you'll never get there before you pass out.""

""Sex before bed knocks me out""

""Drink some hot milk and have some melatonin!""


Everytime someone tells me this stuff I'm just like...  Man, do you honestly think I haven't tried a multitude of different things?  I've tried many many things.

Sleep hygiene is not an effective treatment for insomnia,"I spend a lot of my time teaching medical students and new doctors. And I've been trying to convince them to stop telling everyone with insomnia to fix their ""sleep hygiene."" It's an uphill battle, but I'm gonna keep saying it because it's important. I wrote a blog post about it here: https://slumbercamp.co/sleep-hygiene-is-not-effective/ 

Of course it may be part of a balanced diet of treatments that work, but it's too often offered as a standalone intervention. I'm curious, how many doctors have told you that your insomnia is a sleep hygiene problem?"

90 days of GOOD sleep thanks to daily meditation,"I made a post about this during my first month and just wanted to follow up now that it's been a little longer. I'm grateful to have experienced a stretch of legit good sleep thanks to committing to 60 minutes of meditation everyday.

&#x200B;

I don't do it all at once. I use the timer on my phone (airplane mode/silent) and do 15 here, 15/20 min there until I hit my daily quota. My brain finally shuts off like a normal person now. And even if I have trouble dozing off I don't stress or suffer like I used to.

&#x200B;

EDIT NOTE: For me the dosage of time meditating made a difference. I'd tried 10-20 min a day before and it didn't work well enough to stick with it. This time I decided to go a little more extreme and commit to 60 minutes. I know it sounds like a lot but hey we're in misery here so there's nothing better to do. 

&#x200B;

I've been dealing with BAD insomnia for 8-9 years. I'd become totally dependent on ambien and klonopin to get any sleep and I'd still wake up hours too early and feel like crap or have that medication sleep hangover. These last 3 months have been amazing. Now I'm at the spot where I have to be careful about slipping out of this positive habit. I've done these kinds of things before with cleaning up my diet and exercising. I put off meditating two days ago and ended up falling asleep without having meditated that day. While it's great news that I slept without it, meditating is hard work and I felt the little kid in my mind go, ""Hey maybe you're cured and don't need to do all that sitting with your eyes closed."" But that's the trap, I gotta keep doing what got me here.

&#x200B;

I should note that I did two vipassana meditation courses way back in 2005 so that may have helped me know how to guide myself while sitting. I basically sit on a pillow on the ground with something soft under my legs. Close my eyes and focus my attention to the breath going in and out of my nostrils. My mind wanders and I bring it back to the breath. I also try to relax my brain. You'll see what I mean when you try it. I can actually feel my brain ease up when I notice it, sort of like how we clinch our teeth when we're anxious without noticing.

&#x200B;

I hope this helps some of you guys. Insomnia is hell. Hang in there and keep trying stuff. Remember a little improvement over time is a lot of improvement."
"fuck it, i‚Äôm going to enjoy the sunrise","it‚Äôs 4:30. usually by now i‚Äôm just blankly starting at my wall or whatever else and when i see the rays of the sun through my window it‚Äôs just another numb ‚Äúoh well there‚Äôs another night gone‚Äù.

Getting good results with a weighted blanket!,"I have suffered from insomnia for 30+ years, but have just begun to sleep with a weighted blanket on me. It has greatly helped me fall asleep, stay asleep and sleep more peacefully.

It holds the sleeper down and very still, like when a parent holds their baby as the baby falls asleep. This stifles involuntary or even voluntary movements. I think psychologically it also tells the brain to be still, as well as the body.

They come in various weights. The one I have is a bit too heavy, actually. When I put it entirely on top of me (three nights ago), I felt suffocated. However, I now just put half of it over me, or just a diagonal edge of it, and it works great. I feel so much clearer headed, less irritated, forgetful and groggy.

I would recommend for anyone who can afford one to try it.

Does anyone else's days kind of blend together?,"I have to go to school but for some reason, whenever I wake up from a 2-3 hour sleep, I'll go through the week and eventually, things start to blend together.

Sudden realization...,
Anybody find it easier to sleep when it‚Äôs chilly?,I like to crack a window and let the winter air hit me. It kinda relaxes me more. Of course I have the covers on but it still feels good and makes it easier to sleep.

Anyone else find it very difficult to speak when you‚Äôre sleep deprived?,"I can hardly muster up the effort to open my mouth and attempt words when I haven‚Äôt slept. It feels like it requires quadruple the effort. And making eye contact is difficult for me too when my eyes feel so heavy.

Insomnia can ruin your life,"sleep. The only thing I can think of. Bedtime anxiety; counting how many hours of sleep you get if you manage to fall asleep in time. But you don't. Waiting for sleep, panicking, because sleep just won't come,  counting how much sleep debt one lifetime can handle. Pills. Blodshot eyes, wrinkles, hair loss, hunger attacks, cravings, weight loss, heartburn, caffeine, addiction. Cancer. Reading shit about cancer. Articles and papers on how important sleep is for your body. God damn it, I could write an entire book about it myself.

No energy for anything. Wondering whether those mornings where you wake up like newborn after 10 hours of sleep will ever come again.

Socializing. Explaining to people 10 times why you're leaving early and trying to go to bed in time.

Forgetting how sleep works. Worrying, overthinking, destroying relationships, depression, losing yourself, depersonalization.
Cancelling flights, plans, dreams. No energy for anything. No sex. All you want is sleep. Deep, blissful, refreshing sleep - just like babies do. With a babie's mind. No guilt, no regret, no mistakes, no pain.


Fuck insomnia. Forever.

"
Have you ever tried melatonin?,If you say this to sentence to me I'll punch you in the dick
Why did we have to be cursed with this shit? It can absolutely ruin your life yet is not taken seriously at all...,"It's similar to not being able to stomach food or water, every time you eat or drink you throw it up, it's a neccessary bodily function that doesn't work in our bodies. Lots of people apparently deal with insomnia but i highly doubt it, i think most people exaggerate, they think a bad night or two a week is insomnia, a bad night every night is insomnia, 3-4 hours everynight, living everyday like a corpse just going through the motions, no sense of humour anymore, nothing worth smiling for, incapable of logical thought and an abysmal memory, pounding headaches and blurred vision. It is used as a method of torture, yet we have to endure it daily, our bodies are torturing us daily, starving us of one of the most basic human needs.

Yet it is never taken seriously. No one ever understands just how horrific it can be, ancient egyptian hieroglyphs record a lament for ""three hells"" one of which is to lie in your bed and not sleep. I have slept 3 hours a night for 3 days now, 9 hours of sleep in 3 days... around the same amount a normal person would get in one day. But if we bring it up we are looked at with disdain for being dramatic and neurotic because ""everybody is tired"" it is something people can't comprehend because they can just lie down and fall asleep. Insomnia ruined my year last year and i spent time talking to mental health professionals, took antidepressants and even started to hallucinate as i was so sleep deprived. I work a physical job as a bricklayer 40 hours a week. I have considered suicide, i have asked myself what kind of quality of life i can have with this illness, can i endure this for the rest of my life? The answer is absolutely not, it has sapped every bit of happiness from my life and if i am still dealing with it for years to come, i am certain that suicide will be the only answer.

Why are we not taken seriously? Why do we just have to ""get on with it"" even though insomnia is such a crippling affliction? I don't know what to do. I don't know how i can endure this torture any longer."
Has anyone else experieced this?,"I am laying in bed now, and when I am looking at my phone, reading or watching youtube, I feel really sleepy, like I am about to pass out. Then I put my phone away, turn of the light and now I am completely awake, just laying in bed.

You don't have it,"Fatal insomnia,  something most of us have worried about, including myself,  I went for days with out sleep and I just want to set something straight. A prion disease is rare, fatal familial insomnia is the rarest prion disease affecting only 100 families worldwide,  and if your family doesn't have it you CANT get it. Sporadic fatal insomnia is the rarest form of a already rare disease, with just 10 cases worldwide! If you don't have the gene you don't even have a 1 in 500 million chance of having this condition,  just let that sink in,  you may not be able to sleep, but you are not dying. Fatal insomnia is a brain condition which affects sleep, not a sleep condition which affects the brain.  Stay strong and I hope everybody can sleep easier after reading this üíï"

I have always worked jobs that start late in the day,  and lately I've been substitute teaching because of the flexibility.  If I can't sleep I simply don't work that day and nobody cares.  

BUT I'VE STARTED A FULL TIME JOB AND I FINALLY DID IT! Of course the first few weeks were awful though lol.  

I'm just so happy.  

I credit EVERYTHING to exercise.  Yoga with Adrienne on youtube every day and gym a few times a week.  Just feeling so good about focusing on my health and having better habits about using my energy the right way have made all the difference.  

I hope this isn't just a fluke!

Edit: not going to kill myself.  Just freaking out. 

Edit/update #2: 
Thank you all so much for the incredible support.  I feel much less alone now and have restored hope that I'll get better.  The urgent care facility was unwilling to help me and said they don't treat insomnia so I set up an appointment to establish a primary care doctor and discuss my insomnia.  Unfortunately i have to wait ten days. I'm going to be adamant about getting both prescription sleep meds to tie me over and getting referred to a sleep specialist and or psychiatrist to determine the underlying issue.  Thank you all for taking me seriously! I wish you health and deep sleep <3"
Why I can't sleep (Xpost from r/heavymind),
How I feel right about now...,
"Insomnia, you are a wretched disease and I hate you.",No rest for the wicked.
How I cured my insomnia with one simple trick (unironically),"My insomnia has been especially bad these past few months, with me often only sleeping for a few hours per night and sometimes going 2 or 3 days without sleeping at all. As a result, I've been doing a lot of experimentation and I've finally found something that works.

Everybody has different reasons for their insomnia, but mine was mainly that I would go to bed and my brain would be in overdrive. I just wouldn't be able to stop thinking about a million things at once. My brain was very easily stimulated, with activities like brushing my teeth and washing my face dooming my ability to sleep. I also liked to watch television in the evenings and did not wish to stop doing that, but that was another source of stimulation. So what was I supposed to do?

Well, I have not stopped doing any of those things. I watch TV from 9-11PM, and then go upstairs and do whatever I need to do; brush my teeth, wash my face, put pyjamas on, etc. Once that is done, I come downstairs, dim the lights, sit on the sofa and just... think.

I just sit back and let my brain do whatever it wants. That is the trick; to let it take control and cycle through whatever it wants to process until it has purged and tired itself out. After an hour or so of thinking, I go upstairs and can sleep almost immediately.

I have been doing this every day for a week and I've slept for 10 hours each time. I go to sleep at 1 AM and naturally wake up at 7, and because I have nothing to do, I go back to sleep and wake up at about 10 AM. I know that it is bad to oversleep, but I am just used to not sleeping at all, so I'm relishing in my newfound ability.

(I use this in conjunction with other classic insomnia practices, like exercise and using my bedroom exclusively for sleeping. I also used to be kept awake by a need to urinate; I've solved this by drinking regularly throughout the day, including the evenings, and having my final drink at about 11. This means that I go to the toilet a couple of times during the 'thinking hour' and do not need to do so when I go to bed.)"
‚ÄòIf I can fall asleep in two minutes that gives me exactly 4 hours of sleep. Let‚Äôs try‚Äô,"Never fails an hour or two later ‚Äòokay I‚Äôll probably be fine with two hours of sleep.‚Äô 

‚ÄòOkay let‚Äôs just call it a 90 minute nap and maybe we‚Äôll take one later during the day and that‚Äôs enough‚Äô 
"
Wouldn't it make more sense for this subreddit to have a black background theme?,Just saying...
Exactly.,
Crossing the 48th hour without sleep (x-post from /r/funny),
"I used to have chronic mild insomnia, and going to bed gave me anxiety. Here's the exercise I learnt that triggers sleep reliably for me.","I now take about half an hour to fall asleep on a bad day. That's good enough for me, given what I was used to, and I'm optimistically confident that I'll fall asleep faster in time.

I used to have chronic mild insomnia: I used to take an hour or more to fall asleep each night. Waking up in the middle of the night was crap because I would take ages to fall asleep again and I would only fall asleep by the time I needed to get out of bed. 

The following routine worked for me. I don't have any chemical imbalances (that I know of) and I guess I fall into the category of people who ""forgot how to fall sleep"". I used to be terrified of the dark so I deliberately tried to stay awake every night as a kid, watching the lights of the car headlamps stretching across the wall. It was kind of lonely. That's probably how the insomnia started. Since I started the following routine, I've been 2 years free from chronic insomnia. 

1. Focus: I find it easy to fall asleep in front of the TV, but the moment I move to the bed I'm completely awake again. So annoying! I can fall asleep in boring lectures, but I can't in bed. Focus leads to sleep. I focus on the feeling of my blanket .

2. Focus on whether my posture is comfortable and adjust accordingly. Start from toes and go all the way up to the top  e.g. Are my feet in a comfortable position? If not, move them. Knees, hips, elbows, is hair in my face?

3. Relax my face. Relax my forehead, eyebrows, inner corners of my eyes, relax nostrils, corners of my mouth, lips should be slightly apart, tongue, jaw, cheeks

4. Full breathing. Very key. This technique can be googled. 

5. Start to focus more on the out breath than the in breath.

6. Feel how my body is becoming more heavy. More and more heavy...

7. Focus on the full breathing.

8. Focus on the out breath.

9. Feel my body getting more heavy...


There are other things that would help minimise insomnia, like relaxation exercises in the middle of the day. But I work full time plus I'm lazy, so I skipped all the advice about not using phones before sleep or doing more sport. The above routine alone works for me. That said, maybe those techniques could help others.

Reddit has been amazing and opened my world. It's saved my ass in times like when I left a massive mark on the ceiling and got advice on how to fix it before my SO got home (magic eraser peeps!) and opened my mind to other ideas (r/philosophy). I love reddit and I owe reddit. This is probably the only topic where I have something real to contribute, so any questions please feel free to fire away.

Edit: forgot to mention the routine I've listed is one cycle. If I'm not asleep yet, I repeat the cycle from the start. I do as many cycles as it takes until I've dozed off."
"I slept for 9 hours straight last night, after two weeks of barely any sleep at all","Had severe stress-induced insomnia for two weeks, but last night I finally slept like a baby.

when people think that my insomnia is like theirs for belittlement,"""Mate, we're engineering students. Everyone here is sleep deprived"" ""your sleep problems don't prevent you from studying""
Not. The same. Thing.
I've had serious sleep problems everyday for years, even before I started my degree.  When I say 'I'm sleep deprived' I don't mean that I have only slept a couple of hours less than ideal, that I can catch up on weekends, or that the onset of insomnia only comes during exam times. I have literally gone on an average of 3hrs of sleep for weeks, and no more than 5 hours for years. I have a crippling headache on both sides of my head everyday, for nearly the whole day, in fact it's the first thing I notice when I wake up. /Rantover"

"If you have a problem just turning your brain off at night, I have a little hack that I‚Äôve used since I was little that does the trick.","Ok so it sounds too simple that it almost may not work but I promise it does the trick for me every time!

1. Make sure you are sleepy, don‚Äôt force yourself to bed if you are wired up..there‚Äôs no use of just laying there. This shouldn‚Äôt be difficult anyways if you have sleeping probs tho obviously lol.

2. Lie down and just play your day out in your head. Be super detailed from when you woke up in the morning to the present (if you even make it through the whole day without knocking out first). Seriously be as detailed as possible!! Ex: i first woke up to your alarm at 10 am, then the dog ran downstairs and you pet it  for 10 minutes and took them out, then came back inside and brushed your teeth...

Be as detailed as possible and use your imagination to play it out in your mind, just focussss on your day, don‚Äôt even think about sleeping.  Don‚Äôt stress yourself trying to remember things either!! Just play your exact day through your head. This may not keep you asleep but for anyone w problems just falling asleep initially this works wonders (:

Also, if you wake up in the middle of the night just go do something for a minute (preferably nothing w electronic bc i heard this actually disturbs your sleep more) & distract yourself then come back to bed and do this exercise again."
I SLEPT 6 HOURS LAST NIGHT WOOOOOOOOOOOOO,"Finally I needed that, no waking up, no tossing or turning, and best of all no Meds! Dream on my friends these are the nights we live for lol"
I‚Äôm participating in a behavioral health program which claims to have a 85% success rate with insomnia. I‚Äôll post info/tips as I learn. Here‚Äôs one that I‚Äôve found helpful so far.,"Don‚Äôt go to bed early. Even if you need to wake early, stay up until your eyes struggle to stay open. I typically go to bed at 9/930 and have a TERRIBLE time trying to sleep. Since my first meeting with this program, I‚Äôve been staying up and reading until about 11:30 and I‚Äôve had a much easier time passing out once I lay down in bed. 

The logic behind it is my natural sleep cycle is ‚Äústubborn‚Äù ‚Äî meaning it‚Äôs not changing to a 9pm to 5am no matter how hard I try. Accepting that I don‚Äôt naturally get tired until 1130 or so really helps stave off the sleep anxiety."
Anyone else wake up 3-4 times a night?,"I‚Äôm honestly convincing myself I have some sort of hidden disease/sickness that is causing me to wake up during the night WIDE AWAKE, and it‚Äôs causing more stress for me because when I wake up during the night I‚Äôm thinking something is wrong with me AND I‚Äôm frustrated I woke up. Does anyone else wake up multiple times a night and have no idea why. I swear it felt like I woke up almost at the be beginning of a panic attack, I‚Äôve never felt that before. It was like my body and mind just thought it was perfect time to start freaking out as soon as I opened my eyes. "
I'm so fucking miserable,"I don't know if this is allowed but I just need to rant

I cannot stand living like this

I'm never rested, I never feel okay, I'm constantly operating on 3 hours of sleep, often less

I can never schedule something early in the mornings because without fail half the time I'll stay up until like an hour before and half to cancel because I need to sleep in

I don't even feel alive. Like I just feel like I'm ambling through the day on the minimal amount of energy I've saved.

I honestly don't think I can go much longer like this. I'm just... I'm not interested in living the rest of my life with this. If someone told me that there was no hope for change... I don't know. I worry that i'd just kill myself. Because I don't feel alive already, what's even the point.

And nobody understands. They just think I'm using my phone, or bad at sleeping, the only way I can get anyone to understand is by just breaking down. I have to yell or cry to get someone to realize that this is torture. Living torture.

I just needed to rant. I need something to change. "
"Change this sub's desription to ""Maybe tonight it will be better!""",

Insomnia feels so lonely.,"I have insomnia and it scares the hell out of me.

Hi, I just wanted something to rant and get my thoughts out of my head.

About 5 months ago I went to the hospital for some minor heart palpitations. Nothing serious but I thought I was going to die. Went home totally fine, except when I tried to sleep I couldn't. I spent the next four nights with what seemed like no sleep, Everytime I felt like I was falling asleep I would wake up. I spent four nights in this hell.

I went to a sleep doctor and was diagnosed with sleep apnea, got a CPAP machine to help sleep... Except I still don't sleep well.

Every night I wake up at 4 am, then 6am, if I actually fall asleep before 10. Some nights I just lay in bed and look out my window. I've done every suggestion I found in the internet for better sleep hygiene.

Now, I'm an introvert so I don't mind being by myself most of the time but at 4am, It is the most lonely feeling I have ever felt. Even though I know people are out there working or having the same problems as I do. It just feel so damn lonely.

That's it. If anyone looks at the moon at 4am, know that there is another person looking at it with you."
"LPT: Crank up the AC 30 minutes before going to sleep, and when you slip under the covers the warmth will be so relaxing, you'll be asleep in minutes.",
Wait till you have kids!,"Going through a bad bout atm and running on 2/3 hours a night for over a week, feeling so down and done with everything. 

Go to work last night and somebody asks why I‚Äôm being so quite so I explained I have trouble sleeping and the first thing they say is ‚Äòwait till you have kids then you‚Äôll know what being tired is‚Äô and it isn‚Äôt the first time someone has said this to me and it just feels like suck a slap in the face, especially considering she told me she slept 10 hours a few days ago like, is your kid really effecting your sleep that much? Doesn‚Äôt sound like. 

Has anybody else had this? Is it just me that finds it infuriating? It just feels so rude and inconsiderate, don‚Äôt ask me what‚Äôs wrong if you‚Äôre going to play it off like it‚Äôs nothing. 

Sorry just needed to rant and get that off my chest because it‚Äôs been bugging me all night"
Having trouble sleeping? I used to have it really bad in 2018. These are the things that I tried,"We all suffer from Insomnia for different reasons.

In 2013-2014 I had to sedate myself with several sleeping pills because all I would do is lay in bed thinking about these horrible people I had to deal with at work. The day I got let go - I slept like a baby that night.

I have been on sleeping pills for 15 years due to chronic pain. Last year I went without any sleep aid until August when my Insomnia became severe. They put me on multiple medications (anti-depressants) because these AD's had 'sleepiness' as a side effect. Amitryptline (sp? ) is the only one of these which had an effective sedative sleep aid. This year I am back taking 3.5 - 7 mg of zopiclone every few days when I really need to be asleep at a specific time.

&#x200B;

Moving along.

In order to get better sleep you need to build yourself a system, and then repeat it every night, and eventually your body will understand that you are building a sleep routine which will eventually put you to sleep after practice.

&#x200B;

There are several things that you can do.

\- buy red light bulbs and put them on a couple of your lamps. After a certain time, turn all your lights off, and turn the lamps with the red bulbs on. What you are doing is simulating sunset, which is supposed to send a signal to the brain.

\- drink camomille tea it offers a calming effect, and it tastes good.

\- meditate or practice breathing techniques

\- make a list of things to do tomorrow, or if your head is active, write brief notes

\- take scullcap vitamin as well as Magnesium glycinate

\- look into CBD products, or even THC edibles- listen to hypnotic sleep stories Interglatic space travel by Lina Grace is on youtube.

(I encourage you to download it to your phone and not listen via youtube as you will get wake up by advertisements)

Finally, while you are in bed. If your mind is going just count every inhale as 1, and every exhale as 2, stop when you get to 10, and start at 1. You mind cannot count and think endlessly at the same time.

Re-Edited for better formatting:  
Blue light is a factor. Which is why they say not to look at your devices late at night.   
Windows 10 latest april 2018 edition users:   
Right click on the desktop and go to Display Properties.   
Turn on Night Light, and go to Night light settings

Adjust your color temperature and schedule time.   
Phone users I believe you also have something similar.   
This will reduce the blue light that is emitted from the display (will not change color of your screen during gaming sessions for those gamers wondering - you know why you can't sleep. ;) )

I'm on the fence about exactly how much it effects us. But I can say that I am a little concerned/curious if there is a correlation between our minds being more active than normal due to all the staring into the phone as much as we do.

&#x200B;

Or perhaps it is the north pole moving which is preventing us from sleeping.

Anyone feel like insomnia is making your life fly by,"I really hate it, last night was horrible, and I really hate my life, I WANT MY LIFE BACK"
When you're up so long you get hungry,"You're finally on the cusp of maybe falling asleep.....and here comes the stomach growling. Do you ignore it? Do you lay there and use every ounce of determination to force sleep and pray it comes before your stomach hurts? Do you just eat and risk getting energy so you're even more awake?!  

Its 4am. I give it another hour and then I  give up and will just make coffee and food. I hope I dont nap too long later and ruin tomorrow night :/  "
Sleeping advice from non-insomniacs,‚ÄúJust close your eyes and lay still‚Äù
It‚Äôs 2 am.,"I‚Äôm sure many of you can relate to this feeling. You already know that so many times a week you will sleepy terribly and very late. So you take sleep aids if you own any, lay in bed listening to relaxing music, wondering when you‚Äôll drift off. You might start to drift off no luck, you stay awake. Great. You try again. There you go again, so close and then, nope, sorry. By the time 4 am rolls around, you‚Äôre debating if you should keep trying or just get up for the day so you don‚Äôt over sleep. You wish there was some magic sleep button your could press whenever you wanted. If only things worked that way. If only. Hope you guys get some shut eye tonight."
I cured my insomnia,"I‚Äôve had insomnia on and off for years but it‚Äôs gotten a lot worse this year where I lost the equivalent of at least two months sleep. I felt like I was in a fog a lot of the time and it was a struggle to get by.

My doctor told me to take a hot bath or shower right before bed, and this helped me get to sleep but not stay asleep.
I started taking vitamin d3 in the morning (do not take it at night, it‚Äôll keep you awake), and have been sleeping a solid 8 hours ever since.

The strange thing is, is like my body is in shock from finally being able to rest. I got sick about a week into it, and then also got super emotional like everything that happened during my insomnia days flooded through me to finally be faced. I feel like I‚Äôve just woken up and taken a look at my life with clear eyes. Has anyone else experienced anything similar when your insomnia stops? 
"
Accepting it is one of the best things you can do,"The more you fight it and the more worked up you get the worse it's going to be for you. When my insomnia first hit I used to toss and turn in agony, get up every 20 minutes because I was pissed, and borderline cry. 4 weeks later (of this episode) I just lay there peacefully with my eyes closed and hope for the best. I noticed that I've gotten a lot more sleep (by a lot I mean like 2 hours)."
Melatonin is a joke,I‚Äôve tried taking melatonin and it worked the first two times I slept pretty well then it‚Äôs like my body adjusted and got used to it. I took more and more every night but nothing. I usually end up feeling zoned out the next day but that‚Äôs nothin new. (Driving is actually scary. Too zoned out) Anyone have any tricks to falling asleep? 
My weighted blanket has been a complete success.. I'm so thankful I decided to give it a shot- Insomnia sufferer of 13 years,"I'm 28F and I was diagnised with insomnia and anxiety when I was 15.  I had a prescription for Xanax but got way too dependant. I couldn't even leave the house without them. That stuff was amazing. Someone could tell me the house was on fire and I'd be totally fine with it.  So I stopped thus beginning a long cycle of unhealthy methods of sleeping. From 15-18 it was the xanax, 18-now sleeping with the TV/phone (Netflix, Hulu) on helped me snooze but I never felt rested. Sometimes it was just annoying and then I couldnt sleep at all. I'd stare at the popcorn ceiling and pick out shapes and pictures. I'd get tired of the same shape so I'd go lay on the other side of the room and stare at the ceiling over there. After recovering from a cold where I was taking flu medicine I just started regularly taking flu medicine.. lots. Every night. They never seemed to put enough in a box of Nyquil so I bought big, cheap bottles of Benadryl. For the last 2 years or so it's just been me and my Benadryl. A few month back I started noticing that it wasn't really working as well.  Sometimes it would hype me up! That never happened before.  Still some nights it would work and I'd sleep well. I started to have even more anxiety about night/bedtime/sleep. Would it work tonight? 

I longed to fall asleep naturally, under tge covers, as easily as everyone else did. In February while browsing online and saw an ad ona sidebar with information on weighted blankets. Interesting. They were pricy but I was desperate. I broke down and bought one for $120. It's 12lbs and I could've cried the first morning after I had it. No pills, no night time tea,  It was amazing. it's not hot, it's not confining. I still move freely but more so changing positions to sleep not from being uncomfortable. I love this blanket and I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new. Even when I need to recuperate from work I come home and get under my blanket.  I immediately feel relaxed and the whole day washes away. I still have nights accompanied by sleepless, of course,  it just comes with the diagnosis, but even then I'm relaxed about it. I'm able to lay and relax instead of my eyes wide open and my mind racing.  Even that makes a huge 
 differences.

I would tell anyone who's looking for something new to try it. 

Be well everyone! 

TL;DR
my 12lbs weighted blanket changed my life.  "

God bless understanding professors,"I just thought I'd share my happiness: 
My first class of the day is at 7:30. Of course this is something horrible minding the fact that I fall asleep around 5 am. This causes my frequent oversleeping, sometimes when I make it to school, the class is already over. But I can only miss it twice through the whole semester or I fail the subject.

So today I talked to the professor after class and told him about my struggle. He was very understanding and offered some extra work for me in exchange for the missed classes, so I could still successfully complete the subject.

This was a huge deal for me because most people don't really think insomnia is that big of a deal and I was scared he would take me for a lazy student who just doesn't feel like coming to school in the morning. It's great when people understand and cooperate!"

No obligations: I sleep like a stone.

On the other hand, if I have an interview the next morning, or the first day on the job, my body goes into panic mode and I simply forget how to shut off. Maybe it's lack of confidence in my sleeping ability, or trauma from past insomnia episodes.

Gamers Fighting Depression,"Hey there, Im Juzzy, Creator of GFD (Gamers Fighting Depression) /r/gfd , so what are we and what do we do?

Gamers Fighting Depression (or GFD) is a community of gamers coming together to help each other fight through the hardships of life. We've been through a lot together and will fight until each and every one of us has made it out of our dark times.

None of us are professionals but we all have suffered mental illness in one form or another, be it depression, bipolar, ptsd, anxiety etc.

Our goal isn't to fix the world because its not possible, at least alone we cannot do it, but what we can do is create an amazing environment for our members and for everyone to know they aren't alone in their fight and support and help is just around the corner and to take GFD into a world outside the internet and become a fully fledged Non for profit organization, its a big goal but we're all passionate about this fight and its a goal we hope to achieve together.

So far we besides the Reddit page which is at 6k subscribers, we currently run 3 Kik groups

    GFD chat 1 (General chat group)
    GFD chat 2 (General Chat Group but with a smaller base)
    GFD Support (The support group)

We also host a Minecraft server Address : GFD.cantium-games.com

Plus two VoIP server (Discord and Mumble) and IRC Channel.

Plus a recently created twitter account! : https://twitter.com/__GFD__

People offen say gaming can sink them more into depression to which its true and to which we agree, gaming can easily make u more depressed but you gotta look at it the like most things in life, it has potential to make you more depressed just as it has the potential to also pull you out of depression, the thing we're trying to do is not focus on gaming as a way to beat depression but rather helping people who have fallen into that bracket of being depressed communicate and talk to other gamers who are also depressed.

We thank you for reading this and even if you think its not a good thing or its amazing we love to hear feedback, no one has to be alone in their fight.

"""Just Close Your Eyes, You're Not Even Trying""",I'm so tired of watching people effortlessly pass out two seconds after their head hits a pillow and being told I don't even try as I lay in bed for hours upon hours staring at a ceiling. 
There is hope!,"Hi fellow former or current insomniacs,

My insomnia has gotten so much better/practically nonexistent recently and it's giving me lots of hope. I want to share some of the recent findings with you guys hoping that you may find some use in it!

My history with insomnia: Never been a good sleeper, but in the last 2-3 years it has gotten really bad. I'd get about 2-4 hours sleep per night. Usually I'd fall asleep only to then wake up after 1-2 hours and then either not get back to sleep at all or get back to sleep only a short time before the alarm went off - mixing that with a really physically demanding job has made me grow lots of gray hairs (and I'm 32!) and has sucked a lot of joy out of my life. This has been my situation until just a few weeks ago.

 What changed?

I went to a 7 day Zen retreat. No speaking, no phones, no reading and other distractions. Just lots of sitting meditation, walking meditation and working chores, as well as the occasional consultation with the monk who ran the whole thing (non-profit by the way!)

I was pretty anxious about not being able to sleep during the retreat and then having to be alert all day from 6a.m. until 10pm. (definitely not my normal schedule, too). I asked the monk about sleeping issues, and he said ""When you go to sleep, JUST SLEEP!"".

I thought to myself, ""oh great, here we go, great advice from a non-insomniac...as if it were so easy"". It kind of sparked a lot of rejection/almost anger in me. Similar to a lot of things I've read on this subreddit when people get offended by non-insomniacs naive advice (""Just try camomile"" haha)

However, as the days went on, I really got the point of it. In this tradition's teachings it actually applies to pretty much everything: ""When you wash the dishes, just wash the dishes"", ""when you chop wood, just chop wood"", etc etc...""NO DELUDED THINKING!"" he would often say. When I asked what kind of thinking counted as ""deluded"", he said ""pretty much ALL thinking, since most of it comes from your EGO"".

In those 7 days I started to see how scattered my mind actually is. And I was shocked! I mean, I realized that I can barely go for a second without my thoughts wandering off, or thinking about anything but what is happening RIGHT NOW! Not what's happening in my EGO (anything that is about me, myself and I. what I like/dislike about this and that thing/person/situation), but just what is happening in your general awareness. It took several days of not having any distractions to really see the busy nature of my mind, and how eagerly it wants to judge things or situations (such as for example lack of sleep, or fatigue during the day) as either positive or negative rather than just letting them be what they are.

Here's the practical implications: A few days into the retreat, I started having the best nights of sleep ever. Incredible. Many hours of deep sleep, and that was in a tent, on an uncomfortable camping mattress!! I woke up happy and refreshed, full of joy. I'm now back in my apartment, sleeping on a real bed, and here are some of the insights I have to offer from taking on the new mindset in my busy life and seeing some of the roadblocks to good sleep. Although they are from my experience, I feel like they may apply to a lot of you guys too. I've been on a steady road of recovery from insomnia, so the ""advice"" I'm giving out here, I'm giving to myself too because they include some of the pitfalls I still step into occasionally:

1.  BE HERE NOW! This is a 24/7 practice and it's tough cause we've been increasingly ""programmed"" to not just ""be here"" but rather be everywhere all the time and think about 1000 things. Getting into a habit of being fully present in the moment, no matter what it is, creates a less cluttered mind, hence better sleep.  If today you feel really shitty cause you have no energy, and you have to do some annoying task, just be present with it. Don't fight it, don't hate it, don't internally or externally whine about it, don't resent it, don't wish you were somewhere else, but just DO it, just be there. it's just an experience. Not all experiences have to be good, not all days have to be full of energy, nothing is ever exactly the way you wanted it to be and that's ok..

2. Routine helps. I know you've heard this one before, but do your best to give your body some kind of timeframe for sleep. However: Don't obsess about it, cause that just causes stress and more useless thinking about your insomnia that will get you nowhere! 

3. Stop telling people (perhaps with the exception of this subreddit and your doctor) that you suffer from insomnia. You're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and making it part of your identity. It doesn't help when you become known as the guy/girl who doesn't sleep well. People will ask you ""how's your sleep"" all the time, and you'll be thinking about it all the time, rather than relaxing your mind about the whole topic and letting sleep eventually just come naturally.

4. Follow the often-mentioned guidelines for good sleep religiously but non-obsessively. Just do it without questioning at least for a while and relax in the process: Enough exercise, good diet (more complex carbohydrates, less protein in the evening), less sugar, less caffeine, learn to meditate (plenty of apps, books, teachers for this these days) but mainly: NO SCREENS A FEW HOURS BEFORE BED! Your phone is both feeding your busy mind and exercising a habit of HEADINESS rather than being in your body/ learning to relax. Maybe change your attitude as to WHY you're doing these things. Cause it's not all about sleeping, it's just as much about not destroying yourself, living a better life, staying healthy, not wasting the miracle that is the fact that you're alive on staring into an LED screen for most of it. Maybe it helps not making Sleep the ultimate target but rather a natural side-effect of this new lifestyle.

5. Eliminate WORRY! catch yourself when you do worry, and let it go. Switch to a more beneficial mode, such as gratitude for whatever is good in your life right now.  If not, you just perpetuate the cycle. This applies of course to laying in bed and worrying about not being able to sleep, or not having enough energy for the upcoming work day. Everybody's different, so find YOUR way of changing your attitude in those moments. Just don't do anything stimulating such as using your phone. Personally I've just gotten into a habit of meditating whenever I can't sleep. I could imagine that journaling could help for some people too, or going to another room to stretch a bit and relax your body. Sometimes I'll sleep for 2 hours, then meditate for 30-50 mins during which I can often clearly see how busy my mind is - it's like ""HA! no wonder I woke up! so much unprocessed data""- which I can then let go, thought by thought, feeling by feeling, until I just relax again and sleep. Your body/mind is waking you up for a reason. Whether that's a physical or mental cause, maybe before you get annoyed/frustrated, just LISTEN to your body/mind and take it as a pointer towards improvements on the way to a better future. After a few weeks of this, my mind is now not so busy, unless I've really screwed up during the day, which is usually due to point 1 (not being present).

6. Finally: Forget it all! This is probably the most challenging and your ego may fight it(and me?) a lot: Forget all you've ever heard about sleep. Forget your opinions on how many hours you should get, whether or not it's ok to wake up during the night, forget about the newest scientific findings for sleep, the newest supplements, the best sleep-hacks (although some of them are useful, they are short term fixes, so don't get attached/addicted!),  forget how much other people sleep, forget the word INSOMNIA. So maybe you've lost your way a bit, just come back to natural sleep little by little. Let it happen. I believe that the more you can learn to mentally and emotionally LET GO during your daily life, the better your sleep will be in the long run. Don't expect immediate results, but also don't exclude that possibility. Nobody said it was easy, nobody said it was hard. You may sleep really well tonight!

Ok, hope this helps some of you find better sleep eventually! Please be kind and patient with yourself, and don't beat yourself up about your insomnia!

Some final thoughts:

Don't buy in to your self-created limits too much (I can never sleep, I'm going to be like this all my life, if I don't take X mg of melatonin I can't sleep, etc etc). Tame your opinions on sleep, calm down your thinking, and then maaaybe you can actually JUST SLEEP one of these days. It could be tonight, or in the very near future.

Some of you are going to find this idea really challenging, but: It is completely possible for your insomnia to evaporate from one day to another. I think it depends on how attached you have become to it. Some people can actually just let go. Others may need to do something in order to let go of it (for example if you have a severe trauma, or a physical issue, then you would go see a doctor/therapist and have it sorted out and have them help you let it go). If you read this and you become angry, saying ""BULLSHIT, I've had 15 years of insomnia and NOTHING helped"", then I believe that's your attachment right there. It's like you've married your insomnia, it's a terrible abusive marriage, but you keep on holding on to it, blaming everyone else for a situation you are in some ways perpetuating or allowing to rule your life rather than getting to the root cause of the problem and finally just moving on.

No matter what the original causes, I think all of us here on this sub have in varying degrees developed something like a HABIT of insomnia. Let's keep supporting eachother to QUIT that habit. Relapses are normal, maybe we can also just accept that and find a better attitude towards those sleepless nights.

I wish us all increasingly more restful, deep sleep in the days months years to come!"
‚ÄúSleep Hygiene‚Äù,"Something that makes me so frustrated about having insomnia is when people give advice about your sleeping habits and before bed activities like ok listen Linda I put lavender oil on my wrists and temples. I drink chamomile lavender tea. I put my phone away hours before bed! I keep my sleeping space cozy and tidy and all that biz. And if I‚Äôm in bed by 10:30, I‚Äôll be asleep by 2:30 and awake by 5. When people insist it‚Äôs just your sleep hygiene or whatever it‚Äôs so frustrating because it feels like your fault for not being able to go to sleep and even now with medicine, (100mg trazodone) it takes me a while, and sometimes if I‚Äôve had a good streak while on my meds and my sleep is getting better, I‚Äôll go without them one night and I realize that without them I won‚Äôt sleep at all. 
When I first went to see doctors about my insomnia I didn‚Äôt even feel believed and it felt awful. 
Can anyone else relate to any of this?"
sleeping during the day is so much better,"i've always enjoyed taking naps during the day. recently as my insomnia worsened, i've found it much easier to sleep during the day rather than at night. it's like in the dark all my demons want to come out to play. my mind starts racing and i have anxiety attacks. i see the hours going by and freak out because i'm not sleeping yet. it feels like the quality of my sleep during the day is better, i feel well rested and energetic. the only thing that's been helping me and putting me to sleep is medication."
OMG!!! I SLEPT FOR 7 HOURSSS!!!!!,No pills. No weed. Nothing. Just slept like a human. I woke up only once and for about an hour. and then drifted back into a peaceful sleep. And now i'm ready to take on the day. Refreshed. Maybe i'm not a vampire after all. 
x-post /comics insomnia,
Do any of you have a FEAR of sleeping?,"I know it sounds crazy, but every night as I‚Äôm struggling to sleep I get scared. Of what? I‚Äôm not sure. Maybe that I won‚Äôt wake up? Maybe because I‚Äôm 100% alone? Either way, I think this is how my insomnia started. And once I‚Äôm asleep and wake up briefly, I‚Äôm craving to go back to sleep. So...I love sleep, but fear it? Am I just losing my mind here as I try to fall asleep right now? >.< "
When I finally feel myself drifting to sleep after a long wait I get so excited that I wake myself right back up FML,
This meme was bought to you by insomnia‚Ñ¢,
That moment right when you‚Äôre finally beginning to fall asleep....,....and you get so excited about finally falling asleep that you wake yourself up. Every time!!!

7 weeks of insomnia getting worse feeling like ending my life,"I'm about to lose my job, which would mean my health insurance, which would mean I cannot ever get better. I feel like taking my life. In mid december I had the worst flu of my life, it lasted 3 weeks to recover. This is when I started to get bad anxiety thinking it will never go away. After the flu, I quit cold turkey 2 substances I was abusing (kratom and phenibut) which give rebound anxiety and insomnia as withdrawal effects, that was 7 weeks ago. My sleep started to get worse and worse. My boss told me my productivity level was too low as I was not performing. I called out a lot, I am one more strike from getting fired with also adds fuel to the anxiety fire. At first I had regular insomnia, then it turned into this weird thing where my body would fall asleep easily but i'd be awaken by a jerk or a jolt, followed by me breathing fast and heart race. This would go on all night. I tried getting meds from a doctor, he claimed I was an addict and thought I was still taking the kratom. He would not give me sleeping meds. He did give me lexapro but after 3 days of taking it it has made my restlessness and insomnia worse, so I am quitting. I don't know what to do at this point. I have to go to work tomorrow and work all day, I've been sleeping 3 - 4 hours a night if that. I'm dead tired but cannot sleep and wired with anxiety. THis has been almost 2 months of this I don't know how much longer I can ""live"" like this. I have tried every supplement money can buy, every OTC sleep aid, salt baths, stretching, breathing, even had to take a benzo a few times and still nothing."
How do I stop resenting my husband/friends who sleep just fine?,"Ah! It just makes me insane crazy when my husband goes off to bed promptly at nine pm, and I‚Äôm up battling insomnia night after night. And my friend who had a touch of sleeplessness and Ambien fixes it.

I am so jealous and so mad! It‚Äôs so childish to feel this way, but I can‚Äôt help it.

"I created my own technique to fall asleep, and it's working! Hoping this helps others!","I have tried many, many things to help me fall asleep at a reasonable hour regularly. I came up with this idea and it has been showing really positive results for me! I feel like I have taken control of my sleep! Let's do this:

Hypnagogia is the experience of the transitional state between¬†wakefulness¬†to¬†sleep. During this transition, the mind can create a wide variety of¬†sensory¬†hallucination, the most common being visual and auditory, but can also be tactile and nonsensical thoughts.

For the sake of this technique, we will only be focusing on sight and sound.

Visual experiences can range from bright flashes, random speckles, lines or geometrical patterns, to a nonsensical recreations of physical reality, similar to what you experience in a dream.

Auditory experiences vary in intensity from faint impressions like white noise (babies sleeping to white noise might be helping them reach the hypnagogic¬†state), to loud noises, like knocking, crashing and bangs, to sentences being spoken or someone saying your name.

 

The Technique

This technique involves tricking the mind into believing it has entered the¬†hypnagogic¬†state of¬†consciousness, so it can take the next step and allow the body and mind to enter sleep mode.

To trick the mind, you must simply create the experience of Hypnagogia inside your mind. The easiest to recreate is the visual experiences.¬†

The first step is to close your eyes, and completely relax your eyes and eyelids.

Next, visualise the moving patterns you would see in a kaleidoscope. Rather than with bright colours, make the geometric patterns grey and dull. Mine appear more like dark swirling clouds. Focus only on this visual disregarding the minds random thoughts, just as you would focus on one thing only during a meditation.

Once you can visualise this, the next step is to allow yourself to step into the scene happening inside your mind. Leave your physical body behind and feel yourself in your non-physical body inside your mind.

This alone should be enough to create a momentary shift in your reality that feels much closer to sleep.¬†

The final aspect you can add is the sounds, or rather lack of sounds. Focus your hearing on the scene you have created in your mind. You should experience silence or a very low dull hum. This will help you fully immerse into your kaleidoscope scene.¬†

Try this every night, and work on holding the visual for longer periods of time. For the first week you might only be able to hold this in your mind for a few seconds before your mind interrupts you. That will be long enough to fall asleep if you keep trying, although it may take 20 attempts.¬†Keep trying when the distractions come up.

Once you have began to pay attention to the hypnagogic state, you should start discover different visuals that you experience naturally as you fall asleep, and you can recreate these as they may work better for you.

Would love to hear anyone else's experiences/results after trying this!"
Insimnia and tinnitus is such a bad combination,Anyone elses ears ringing while they struggle to fall asleep?
1 Hour of meditation DAILY really working,"Hello, fellow insomnia sufferers. I just wanted to share what's been helping me. I've dealt with chronic insomnia for about 7 years, maybe more. It sucks. For me it's a brain buzz. It doesn't matter how exhausted I'd be I'd have that dreaded brain buzz. It's tied to anxiety but I've never really cracked the case. I did talk therapy for 10 years. Therapy was good for my overall mental health and helped me accomplish many goals but I never had that a-ha moment where my sleep issues resolved. Over the last couple years I've gotten more and more dependent on ambien and benzos to get some sleep. Although they'd put me to sleep I'd still have issues with waking up too early and feeling like crap. They'd usually only get me 4-6 hours when I'd need 8-9 hours. 

&#x200B;

Before I had insomnia, back in 2005, I did two Vipassana meditation courses where you go on a silent 10-day retreat and do a somewhat guided meditation for 1-hour increments, 9 hours a day. It was super hard but I did it. I still remember how good I slept. It didn't matter if I was thinking about all of my life's problems I would lay down and zonk out beautifully. I remember that on the end of the last night they let everyone talk again. Everyone has a lot to say. I was standing in the hallway talking to a guy and although I was enjoying the new freedom of talking I vividly remember feeling this intense ""MUST SLEEP NOW"" feeling come over me and I had to excuse myself to lay down quick. Those are the kinds of moments I would envy in my friends who never had insomnia. Healthy brains seem to just shut down at night.

&#x200B;

Anywho, I just wanted to share that I recently moved cross country and decided to turn over some new leaves. One goal has been to wean myself on sleeping pills and give meditation a fair shot again. I'd dabbled in 20 minutes a day over the years but would fall off the wagon after some sleepless nights or whatever. Three weeks ago I committed to 60 minutes a day. I break it up into whatever timing works for my day. 20/20/20, 30/30, 10/15/20/15. I put in ear plugs, sit on a pillow on the ground, and focus on the sensation of the air entering and exiting my nostrils. My mind naturally wanders and I nudge it back to focusing on the breath. 

&#x200B;

It's been working beautifully. I have not felt the need to reach for the ambien once during October. I can feel the brain buzz going way down. I know it's early to call it a victory but honestly I've been taking ambien almost every night for as long as I can remember. I'd get anxiety that I would not get any sleep if I didn't take a pill. Meditation is hard work but it's been paying off. As most of us insomniacs do, I evaluate the quality of my day by how much energy I have and how refreshed I feel. This month has been 3x better than August and September. I've dozed off naturally and stayed asleep most nights. I've had a few times where I wake up in the middle but I have not had that DREAD feeling. I stay calm and kinda meditate in bed on my back. I usually fall back asleep. But will note that there was one night where I did not get great sleep but I still felt pretty damn good the next day. It felt like the time I'd invested in my brain had stored up and I was able to run on reserves. 

&#x200B;

Just thought I'd pass it along. Hope this helps some folks. "
"Sure, I'm fine, don't I seem fine?","You know what else sucks about insomnia?  It's not an ""illness"";  nobody wants to hear how tired you are or  how you don't know how you're going to get through the remaining 5 hours of your work day, so you TRY to act like you are fine but really you are SO TIRED and the tiredness messes with your mental outlook as well. 

&#x200B;

But you're not \*sick\* so suck it up buttercup and act like you're fine.  I'M NOT FINE.  I do everything I can to sleep; I take care of myself, practice sleep hygiene, meditate, all of it.  It's NOT my fault and it's actually disabling!

How do people fall asleep within minutes of laying down?? It's 4am and I've been laying down for 3 hours trying to sleep. Gave up and browsed Reddit.,"My dad can sit on the couch and immediately start snoring in deep sleep. And I'm over here laying down for bed and laying there for hours trying to fall asleep.
I've always had a problem falling asleep. But I was recently in a very very very bad car accident (last November), and I'm on prescription lyrica, methocarbamal, Percocets, hydrocodone, and some anti depressant that is supposed to boost the lyrica for my nerve damage, and a lot of other crap that I have no idea what they do. 
Sometimes I take a hydrocodone and then a tramadol to help make me somewhat sleepy since my tolerance has made nearly every drug useless.

Any safe tips to help me actually fall asleep without worrying if I'll wake up the next day or not?"
Sharing my success story after 8 months of debilitating insomnia.,"It all began on December 26th, 2013. I had spent 7 nights at home for the Christmas holiday and it was my first night back in my own bed. It should have been a good night's sleep but instead I lay awake all night. That's odd, I thought. The next night was the same. After 5 nights in a row of no sleep I could barely function. I called in sick to work. This was the beginning of 8 months of pure suffering.

I've always been a poor sleeper. I'm unable to sleep in hotel rooms when traveling. I have always had extreme anxiety about sleep. I would walk to the bedroom like a death row prisoner on his way to the gas chamber. I truly feared the bedroom that much. If there was an event of any significance the following day it would be virtually guaranteed that I would not sleep. 

I have stood downstairs in my house in the pitch darkness, my wife sleeping peacefully upstairs, and shed tears of pure frustration and anger. What other people take for granted became an absolute nightmare for me. After a sleepless night I would drive to work in a zombie state dreading the long day ahead. I began to avoid social functions because I was too tired to hold conversations. I would schedule my personal life around sleep often waiting until the last minute to commit to plans depending on how well I had slept the previous night. I felt completely helpless and trapped. I suffered terribly.

Finally after 8 months of this I broke down and scheduled an appointment with a sleep psychologist. I was extremely skeptical that this would work. How could it help to just talk about sleep? Would the doctor have me attempt lame breathing exercises? Trust me when I say I would never have scheduled this appointment if I hadn't been suffering so badly. I finally broke down and put it on my calendar.

The first thing the doctor had me do was begin to fill out a daily sleep log. Each day I'd enter what time I got in bed, what time I turned off the lights, how long it took to fall asleep, how many times I awoke during the night, what time I woke in the morning, and what time I actually got out of bed. I'd also rate how I felt each day on a scale from ""feeling terrible"" to ""adequate"". This log began to reveal all the things I was doing wrong and helped put me on the path to success.

The first thing we implemented was sleep restriction. It turned out that I was spending too much time in bed attempting to sleep. If I had a bad night I would attempt to make up for it by going to bed early the next night or sleeping in the next morning. This was the worst possible thing I could have done. I learned that I could increase my sleepiness by reducing the time I spent in bed. I had been getting in bed around 10:00 PM and rising at 7:30 AM. I immediately changed my sleep schedule. I would go to bed at 12:00AM and rise at 6:15AM. This was a major lifestyle change for me. However, after just a few days of this I found myself feeling tired when it was time to go to bed. Getting up early was difficult for me and for the first few weeks I still felt very tired. But soon I found myself nodding off at night. I hadn't experienced that in months. By forcing myself to get up early I began to feel tired and ready for bed at night. This was a major step forward.

The next breakthrough technique I learned was called stimulus control. Before beginning this program I had mistakenly thought this referred to controlling stimulus like television or other bright screens before bed. Actually stimulus control refers to controlling the negative stimulus that reinforces sleep anxiety: the bedroom. I learned that the worst thing I can do is lay in bed awake. This was creating negative associations with the bedroom. It was actually the quiet bedroom that I was afraid of and not sleep itself. The program dictated that if I did not fall asleep in 30 minutes I was to get up, go downstairs, and read a book or do some other activity until I felt tired. I was not to return to bed until I actually felt tired. I began to view laying awake in bed as corrupting the bedroom and creating a toxic environment. If I wasn't sleeping I wasn't staying in the bedroom. 

The first few times I tried stimulus control it was very difficult. It was hard to leave the nice warm bed and go downstairs. It was difficult to force myself to read a book when I felt so tired in the middle of the night. But I was doing something active about my insomnia. Hell, if I was going to be up all night at least I was in control now. I was choosing to be up all night. I was not letting my insomnia control my life. This was a very empowering perspective. Each night if I had not fallen asleep in 30 minutes I would get up, go downstairs, and read until I felt tired. On a few occasions this meant reading all night until the sun came up and I went to work. The day would be long and difficult but when I got home I would not go to bed early. I would wait until my normal bedtime at 12:00 AM. Slowly, surely, the combination of sleep restriction and stimulus control really began to work. I strung 2 nights together with good sleep. I strung 3 nights together with good sleep. It was nothing short of a miracle.

The last major breakthrough I had was cognitive. It was a new way of looking at my insomnia. I would not let my insomnia bully me. I would stop avoiding social engagements and other events if I hadn't slept. I would force myself to participate in life even if I had not slept the night before. I would feel crummy. I would have a headache. But I would face my fears and usually things would go alright. I'm still working on this today. When I have important work events or social events the next day I become very fearful that I won't sleep well. But I know I will show up and I will do my best. I know it won't be that bad. I know there are ER doctors out there saving lives on very little sleep. I know that I will function. This helps reduce my fear of sleep. I tell myself it's not the end of the world if I don't sleep.

Yesterday was my last meeting with the sleep psychologist. I am now on my own and doing well. I still have bad nights every now and then but I feel empowered with my new tools and behaviors. Everyone's sleep issues are different and this might not work for everyone but I wanted to share my experience and what worked for me. I cannot explain in words how much I suffered during my 8 months of terrible insomnia before I finally broke down and sought professional help. I hope I never have to revisit those dark days.

If anyone has any questions or would like to know more about my experiences I would be happy to discuss in more detail."
"Seriously, fuck these people",
Daylight savings set me back.,"I was starting to get a few hours of sleep a night, but the anxiety and panic of ‚Äúspringing forward‚Äù and losing an hour of sleep made me unable to sleep Saturday night. Now I‚Äôm back to feeling anxious and sick and unable to sleep. 

I forgot how defeating and isolating I felt when everyone I know is asleep and I‚Äôm awake, crying and unable to sleep. I think I‚Äôve given up on trying to sleep tonight. I think I might start antidepressants soon. "
Anyone get psuedosleep,"You lay there in bed trying to sleep and time just seems to fly. You check your phone after tossing and turning for a few hours and your alarm is going to go off in a few minutes. Or you sleep and have dreams that you're laying in bed trying to sleep. I thought I got an automated call in the middle of the night saying I got a ticket for speeding on a toll road the other night (toll roads have those scanner things) and hung up angry, checked a few days later and never received that call. I was just laying in bed trying to sleep when that happened. I get this with a lot of the little sleep I get. It's a piss in the face. Anyone else?"

Feeling disadvantaged?,"Does anyone else feel like it's unfair? All my friends and family go to bed, are out like 10 minutes later and wake up after 8 hrs. While I can't remember a single night of sleeping through. Waking up refreshed or fit. Not dreading sleeping because I know I'm going to wake up just as exhausted.
Maybe I just need to vent because I spent most of my life trying to get my struggle acknowledged just to be told im embellishing. 
But to all you insomniacs out there, do you also feel the oure jealousy, sometimes even hate towards the others? People don't even value something I'd sacrifice so much to have.

I fucking need help,"I'm pretty sure I had insomnia ever since high school, but it wasn't so bad to the point where I felt like I needed help. I'm 23 years old now, and it has just been getting worse. A few days ago, I went to Disneyland. I woke up at 6 AM to meet up with my friends. We were at Disneyland until 10 PM constantly walking around. When I got back home, I thought that I would sleep well that night, but I ended up sleeping at 7 AM. My sleeping schedule has been so fucked that I don't even really have one anymore. I used to be a runner, and I noticed that exercising just makes me more hyper at night. The only thing that has been helping is melatonin, but I don't want to rely on it forever... :/

edit: Thanks for the unnecessary downvote."
DAE reliably wake up after only a few hours if they manage to fall asleep too early?,"Went to bed at about 9PM trying to get my sleep schedule back on track and woke up at 1AM, unable to get back to sleep. Happens every damn time."
Stress is causing me not to sleep.,"I stay up all night thinking about what I need to do the next day. It‚Äôs torture. Then the next day comes and I don‚Äôt get anything done because I‚Äôm too tired, which causes me to stress out again that night. It‚Äôs this constant cycle of sleeplessness and anxiety that just never fucking ends."
"Please, read this article on The Guardian about insomnia: it's astonishing.","I got insomniac nine years ago and the problem never went away, despite all the efforts I put to solve it: medicines, psychotherapy, meditation, herbs and everything else.

But this article made me hopeful again, because it seems they found an effective therapy to cure insomnia once and for good. Please read it and tell me what you think.

Anyone else have insomnia caused by loneliness? (specifically being single?),"Being lonely has this false perception around it that if you simply spend more time with friends/family then you'll feel less lonely. However I believe there are different types of loneliness. Loneliness is really a subjective feeling since it depends on what you're lonely about. For me, i've had trouble sleeping the past 2.5 years ever since myself and ex split up. I never knew what loneliness felt like prior to the relationship because i realize that without having had a relationship before it i had no other experience to compare being lonely with. It's horrible and it's really hard to magically ignore it when you're trying to sleep."
Can we start an advice thread with input from people who have beaten insomnia?,"I keep seeing posts about people hopelessly lost or asking for help, but not many offering advice. I know that's technically what I'm doing here, but perhaps a lot of advice in one thread could help others in the sub who are suffering from insomnia."
Insomnia is the worst and it impairs both my mental and physical health extremely,"I'm not particularly looking for any advice, just venting.

So I recently got a new job and moved to a new place. The past two years have been the worst of my life regarding sleep. Constantly on the move, almost never in the same bed two nights in a row, sleep deprivation, periods of okayish Ambien-induced sleep or ""unconsciousness"" as I prefer to call it, followed by periods of trying to get off of it.

I now have quite a decent job but every sleepless night leaves me exhausted, I sometimes can't even look at myself in the mirror because I feel like I look like shit, my skin doesn't look well and I have bags under my eyes, sometimes I don't even know who I am, just like that dude from Fight Club. I relate to a lot of the stuff mentioned in that movie.

I ""wake up"" aggressive, tired and desperate, then it gets better over the day but as soon as I get closer to going to bed it becomes worse and worse.

Insomnia is one hell of a condition because it is able to cause so much mental and physical damage.

"
do you sometimes question whether you actually fell asleep or not?,"After a few days of not being able to sleep, I finally got around 7-8 of sleep. (or at least I think I did?) I'm fairly sure I actually fell asleep but the recent episode of insomnia has me questioning if I actually was able to sleep or not. Does this happen to you?"
Insomnia is a systemic problem and must be treated that way,"Every year, a new study documenting a rise in insomnia sufferers. 1 in 4 develop it per year. 30% of Americans suffer from it. 10% experience it chronically. Lost productivity cost us $63 billion a year. It‚Äôs a major factor in motor vehicle crashes.

But we need to stop looking at each sufferer as if they exist in a vacuum. We live in a time where, for the first time, younger generations will make less than their parents. Jobs are demanding more of us but giving less in return. Studies have shown that if Americans were paid for emails and phone calls they took while ‚Äúoff work,‚Äù they‚Äôd actually need to be reimbursed in the thousands. Younger generations have been found by studies to be ‚Äúwork martyrs.‚Äù That is, they don‚Äôt take sick days or vacations because they‚Äôre so worried about proving themselves and trying to avoid getting fired. Less and less space is given to self-care. And we‚Äôre all addicted to technology because the technology trains us to become dependent on it so we continue investing money in it. And all of this stress and chaos leads to a hyper vigilance that prevents us from falling asleep. Try to address it, and we‚Äôre failed by a lack of adequate healthcare. I have begged doctors for a lost decade of my life to help me with this problem, only for them to tell me medications are addictive and move on without a solution. It did not matter that I told them I started missing classes or work because I could not operate a vehicle. It did not matter that I told them I was injuring myself because my balance and reflexes become impaired. It did not matter that I told them I was only guaranteed sleep on Friday night because I had nothing scheduled on Saturday, and that I often went through weeks with only one decent night‚Äôs sleep. I‚Äôd just receive a dismissive ‚Äúdeep breaths‚Äù or ‚Äúturn off your devices before bed‚Äù or ‚Äúhave a warm glass of milk,‚Äù as if things so minuscule could begin to combat any of those sweeping sources of stress I mentioned earlier.

The consequences of long-term sleep deprivation are real and severe and research backs that up. Yet doctors ignore complaints of insomnia. Probably because they don‚Äôt know how to cure it. Probably because they‚Äôre focused on the individual.

My question is, how do we shift the focus from the individual to the culture? How do we start transforming a society where we‚Äôre all supposed to be emotionless robots pouring all of our energy into our increasingly demanding work?"
36 hours with no sleep and i still can't fall asleep and have to get up for work in 5 hours.,"don't know what to do. i'm absolutely exhausted. my head hurts, my eyes hurt. been laying in bed since 9pm and it is 1am now. "
Honestly fuck adderall.,"I‚Äôm prescribed for my ADD. When it kicks in, its the greatest thing ever, totally helps me function and focus like a normal person. And then i climb into bed for the night and remember why i have a love hate relationship with it. Im restless maybe 2- 3 nights a week. It is currently 4:26AM (MST). Kill me. At least tomorrow is a day off from school."
How do you deal with insomnia that‚Äôs caused by a fear of insomnia?,"I had a mental breakdown about 8 months ago and ever since have developed chronic insomnia  that is fueled by the fear of insomnia. I‚Äôve been taking Xanax to fight this but I want to get off meds and sleep naturally  again.

It‚Äôs just the THOUGHT and WORRY that I might not be able to sleep that keeps me up. Anybody have experience with this?"
Does anyone else get a vibrating sensation in the body when sleep deprived?,I am going on 30 hours of no sleep and the familiar feeling of low serotonin is accompanied by a vibrating sensation in my entire body. It reminds me of the feeling you get from a nicotine buzz. I get it everytime I go a night without sleep and I never acknowledged it until today.
Can‚Äôt sleep because of death anxiety.,"I‚Äôm still young, but for some reason I get so paranoid that I‚Äôm going to die in my sleep. This is part of the reason of why I stay up all night. I feel more comforted sleeping in the day than I do at night, which I know is stupid because it makes no difference."
I have insomnia but I also have a bright future,"One day, I won't need any bullshit drug ,medicine,hormone ,plants whatsoever .

One day, I won't have nasty headache in my forehead and furtherly, I will forget how was it.

One day, I will start to sleep like my past, times that I  even didn't know that people may have trouble while sleeping ; times that I didn't know there is a thing like insomnia.

One day, I will have the power to manipulate my bad feelings-thoughts in order to break the cycle .

And one day, I will start to sleep like a child ,like a baby . "
Better at falling asleep when not in a bed,I find when I'm on the couch or even in an tiny airplane seat I'm weirdly much more able to fall asleep than when I'm in my very cozy bed. Can anyone related? I'm thinking I might associate lying in bed with sleeplessness
I finally slept in,It‚Äôs been almost a decade since I‚Äôve been able to sleep in. I usually get up at 5 am every day with no chance of going back to sleep. I was pretty late today but this is a big W for me. 
"When I complain about my insomnia & sleep anxiety, no one ever takes me seriously.","I always hear ‚Äújust close your eyes and you‚Äôll eventually fall asleep‚Äù or ‚Äúit‚Äôs simple, just make sure to not use any electronics‚Äù like they don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve tried everything in the book. 

Insomnia to me is much more than just not being able to sleep well. Insomnia is laying in bed miserable for hours with the worst anxiety stomachache of my life and knowing tomorrow is going to suck because I‚Äôll be exhausted. Insomnia is having to call off work because I haven‚Äôt slept in days. Insomnia is being so anxious to lay in bed at the end of the night because I‚Äôm not prepared to go through this again. 

I‚Äôm writing this coming off about 20 minutes of sleep all night. I‚Äôm exhausted and I‚Äôm tired of being told that this is a simple fix."
A simple exercise that helps me fall back asleep.,"Came across this while reading Choose Yourself by James Altucher. It helps me to get back to sleep when i'm worrying at night. Hope some of you can benefit from it too!

Here‚Äôs an exercise for those who typically wake up anxious and paranoid at three in the morning: instead of counting sheep to get back to sleep, count all the things you are grateful for. Even the negative parts of your life. Figure out why you should be grateful for them. Try to get up to one hundred."
Sunrise Appreciation Thread,"It‚Äôs the only good part of insomnia. Seeing the world wake up is cool. Even better, it‚Äôs a sign that the night is finally over and you can stop tossing and turning and go on with your day. It makes insomnia slightly less awful."
"If you are young and feel this overwhelming activity in your mind, you are not alone. And it is a long journey","32 male here.  And 1:20 am.  I own my own company.  I must meet a client at 8 a.m.  i will. And I will do amazing. Tired or not. 

I have suffered insomnia for over a decade.  I have learned to embrace it when it strikes.  It usually comes in week-long intervals. With months in between strikes.  It is part of me. You must stay mentally strong.  You will not be able to support loved ones with a week mind."
"Finally tried sleep restriction therapy. Finally something that works for my insomnia. If you're suffering and haven't tried this, at least look into it.",
"I don't know why, but i feel like im scared to go to sleep.",
I finally found something which helps me sleep! It's a dark screen video with the sounds of the ocean...,"I thought I would share something which has been helping me a lot recently. It's a ""Dark Screen"" video on youtube, with sounds of the ocean. It's a video with no video, which sounds a bit ridiculous, but it is actually really convenient...

I go to youtube and play the video. As the screen is black my phone doesn't emit any light even when it's playing. There is a wonderful relaxing sound of the ocean waves with no other background noise (I don't know where they recorded this but there are no cars, planes people, nothing apart from the sound of waves breaking on a sandy beach).

Here's the vid I use, https://youtu.be/\_28E4C881J4 there are other dark screen videos on youtube, but I love the sound of this one, and the best thing about this is that when this video plays there is no advertising, or pop-ups, or any of those other things which can instantly ruin the moment and set you right back to square one!  


I put this on my phone, close my eyes and listen to the waves. I then use a technique I read about a while back which is a kind of meditation, where you relax your body in a very concentrated way, starting with your feet, and progressively working your way up your boady, relaxing your muscles in one area at a time until you reach your head.  


Once I've done that I have fully wound down, and I concentrate on listening to the waves. I try to visualise them in my head and this helps me not think about anything else (Which is the biggest problem I had in the past, I couldn't switch off and lay away thinking for hours). This really helps me so I thought I would share it with you in case it helps anyone else.

"I‚Äôm crying in bed at 5:30 am, third day on a row where I just don‚Äôt sleep","I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I can‚Äôt shut my brain off. I didn‚Äôt want to take sleeping pills again but I wish I had one. I work as if nothing happened the next day, but I have crippling insomnia. Whenever I do sleep it‚Äôs just 4 hours at best. I have a bunch of weird but common symptoms and whenever I ask doctors they have me do some hormonal and blood tests and nothing shows up. Slightly high TSH hormone, and extremely low vitamin d and b12,m. They want me to do the alcat test ( I feel like I‚Äôm being scammed out of $1,000 usd honestly) and I don‚Äôt know what to do next 

I read that a guy finally ended it after not sleeping for days and it hit pretty close to home. Why can‚Äôt I be a normal fucking human? "
I don‚Äôt know why but during my insomnia I get this really powerful urge to just go outside and run.,"When I can‚Äôt sleep, sometimes all I want to do is grab my clothes and go out for a run. Is that insane? "
Suicide seems very rational considering I‚Äôm not compatible with society,"I‚Äôm not sure why the universe would fuck up and create something incapable of functioning properly. I‚Äôm seeing my inability to sleep get worse every day, and my mental health is in rapid decline. Doctors can‚Äôt help me, the one medication that used to work no longer does anything. I‚Äôve stood out in the yard at 7am staring into the sun for an hour completely naked and read until bedtime without looking at a screen. Nothing works, I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt hold a job and I can‚Äôt  seem tonight do anything with my life. I want to check myself into a mental hospital but I know it wouldn‚Äôt help. Suicide doesn‚Äôt seem like the most logical option at this point, but it‚Äôs unfortunate that I‚Äôve wasted this much of my life without anything to show for it"
To all insomniacs,"I wish you some rest tonight. Life sucks enough as it is and not sleeping, well that just absolutely worsens it. May you achieve even a few hours of sleep. god knows you all deserve it. Keep fighting the good fight, good days do eventually come, just don‚Äôt give up. Best of luck to you all"
"Doctor told me to just ""get over"" my insomnia","I couldn't believe it. She literally just deadpans to me ""I just think you need to fix your sleep schedule""

I found myself having to explain that if it hasn't been fixable in 20 years, for not only me, but my mother and my grandfather, it's not exactly a matter of willpower...

Yes, I can ""go to bed"" and cut out all caffeine. Doesn't change the fact that I will just be awake all night some nights and nighttime is always my most productive artistic time.

I couldn't believe a doctor could make such a logical error. Her contract is getting sliced off the clinic budget so she's been progressively bitchier every week since then. Anyone else meet a doctor like this?

I wasn't even seeing her for insomnia just a general checkup and I just mentioned offhand that I hadn't slept last night which lead to the discussion. 

Edit:

Thanks for all the comments, guys. I'm sure they'll help a lot of people."
It's so true,
Does anybody here get stress headaches and migraines due to lack of sleep? Trying to prevent these seems to cause anxiety and prevent sleep more.,
Sleepiness,Does anyone else feel like sleepiness comes in waves and there's a small window of opportunity to fall asleep? I feel like sleepiness doesn't last that long once it hits me. So therefore my plan is to go to sleep immediately the moment I start to feel sleepy.
"Me: should definitely get some sleep, need to be up and functioning in 5 hours. Brain: yea but what about all that overwhelming stuff?....","Me: what will happen will happen. It‚Äôs okay. 

Brain: let me play you every possibility of what might happen. Then you can panic now about every outcome and ya know we can go from there. 

Me: ......here we go.....

Brain: omg how fun let me also mix in random deaths into the possibilities just for added dramatics 

Me: can‚Äôt wait. "
Loneliness is the root of my depression.,"Even when I‚Äôm with people, I still feel alone. It‚Äôs like there‚Äôs this empty void inside of me that will never be filled, no matter how hard I try."
"After 4 years of insomnia, I have narrowed it down to where I can get a consistent 8 hours of sleep every night without drugs.","In order of impact:


1) Lack of wakefulness during the day (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) Being sedentary, sucked into the phone or working on the computer all day without being outside and moving will make it more difficult to get a full 8 hours of sleep. As soon as you feel tired or sleepy get moving. Get a standing desk, do stretches, jumping jacks, go for walks every few hours. I'm not talking exercise but that's important too (see #2). The less tired/sleepy you are during the day the more you'll sleep at night. You only have so much melatonin in a 24 hour period to use so use it all at night. If I don't actively try to move I can expect frequent awakenings and a mistaken feeling of restfulness after 4-6 hours.


2) Lack of exercise (‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ) If I don't exercise for 1-2 days my anxiety can be stronger. Expect jumping, intrusive thoughts when laying down to sleep. Just about to drift off and then BAM, intrusive thought. My solution to this is simple. I get out of bed and do 5 minutes of intense exercise. Push ups, planks, squats, etc. Once my heart rate comes back down after about 20 minutes I drift off with zero intrusive thoughts. But normally all I need is 20 minutes of light cardio daily to reduce anxiety.


3) Stress (‚òÖ‚òÖ) Often caffeine induced for me. When I have the inability to concentrate on tasks I know I have overloaded on the caffeine. I'll have jumping, darting thoughts and can expect difficulty falling asleep. Meditate or just take a break and relax after work creating a wider gap between work and relax time. I am now a decaf coffee drinker.


4) Flour for dinner (‚òÖ‚òÖ) For me eating wheat at dinner (pasta, bread, etc) can create bloating and discomfort which causes restlessness and a lot of tossing and turning.


Other then that I practice good sleep hygiene which I am sure everyone on /r/insomnia is aware about and if you aren't this is something you should read about first. I've also read this book and it is spot on:

Journaling has been really helpful for my sleep anxiety/racing thoughts,"I‚Äôve never been a fan of journaling, or even blogging. Never even kept a diary.

I‚Äôve had a rough week in terms of sleep for the last two weeks, at it‚Äôs worst, 72 hours of no sleep and still awake even after taking 35mg of melatonin and three diphenhydramine pills.

For the past few days though, my sleep has been decent, without even the need for sleep aids.

Writing down a to do list and addressing all your anxieties was really helpful.

I write down everything that i have to do or think or worry about for the next few days, so my mind has less to worry about. I write down all my thoughts, worries, and anxieties, everything.. until i have nothing left.

After doing so, when i lie down, My mind is mostly quiet, since i‚Äôve already exhausted everything. It really helps curb down all the anxiety and stress that i never noticed i‚Äôve built up.

Anxiety and stress makes your body release high amounts of adrenalin and cortisol, and weirdly so, more when you‚Äôre sleep deprived, which makes it impossible to sleep.

It sounds weird and futile, especially when you‚Äôre desperate already and all you really want is something to finally knock you out.. But it has been really helping lately.

hopefully it helps you too."
No problem falling asleep but wake up 5hrs later tired but can‚Äôt get back to sleep. But if I do fall asleep again even for 1/2 hr I feel refreshed. Any one have this issue and found a cure?,
I've recently discovered that having a small amount of pressure on my chest (i.e. a pillow) helps me to fall asleep. Does anyone know why that is?,"I realized recently that when I sleep on my stomach, I can fall asleep in a relatively normal amount of time, where as when I lay on my back (which is more comfortable), it takes several hours. Because sleeping on my stomach is so uncomfortable, I've started sleeping with a pillow on my chest, to simulate that same feeling while laying on my back, and it seems to work. I'm just curious if anyone else has had a similar experience or knows why this works."
These are the scariest times...,"It‚Äôs those times when your up for like 3 days and still don‚Äôt feel tired.

Your anxiety is through the roof and your thoughts get scary.

- Will I pass out and wake up in a hospital with tubes in me?

- Will I die in my sleep?

- Has my Brain somehow lost the ability to sleep?

Of course it always ends the same way. You finally pass out, sleep for like 14 hours and wake up feeling like a million bucks lol. 

But when your sleep deprived it‚Äôs so scary. "
In bed with my best friend Insomnia,"An important day is approaching, the next morning. It is important to leave a good impression. Lights are turned off and blankets tucked in. As the eyes close, an eerie feeling approaches and eventually joins the bed. It begs attention but is being ignored. Bright light is created as an attempt of causing distraction. Time and time again efforts go in vain. Unknowingly the time is almost up, without getting peace of mind. Light shimmers through the curtains, no eyes were closed, the dawn of a new day is here.

** I decided to summarise my night from yesterday. And I‚Äôm practicing my writing skills.  "
Confirmed: Grains and processed foods DO cause my insomnia,"Once I pulled grains and processed foods out of my diet, I started to sleep fine.   
Over the holidays, I ate some of both..and today, a lot more..and now I'm unable to sleep. 

**Diet has more to do with this than you think. Stay disciplined, do what you need to do.**

**These next few days are going to be long and hard.** "
Anyone else feel physically irritable all the time?,"It's not even my mood sometimes, my skin and muscles just feel irritated. I've never felt like this before insomnia started, even when I got very little sleep because I was studying or something."
"If you aren't tired, don't even bother attempting to sleep.","The only outcome is you get frustrated tossing and turning in the dark, and you make your bed a place of stress and restlessness. Sleep cannot be forced if your body isn't telling you to do it, so just chill out and read a book or watch some tv, pet your dog, anything but lying in bed for hours.

 Worrying about insomnia won't help, when you are worried ask yourself: ""can i do something about this?"" If the answer is yes, then why are you worried? If the answer is no, then again why are you worried?"
DAE have no issue falling asleep in other places but their bed?,"I can usually fall asleep on a train, bus, in class. I find I fall asleep during non-nocturnal hours in literally any sitting position, only to wake up to an unimpressed professor or I'm at my stop. Yet I stay up all night (hence the unrequired naps)"
"Feeling tired all day, but when I get to bed I still cannot fall asleep after an hour?!","I literally dream about going to bed all day long, but when I actually do, I feel no signs of falling asleep even after an hour.

It's like my tiredness is not connected to my ability of falling asleep. I just lay in the bed, 10-20-30-60 minutes, nothing.

Also, the more tired I am, the harder I find it to fall asleep.

Nothing makes me more envious than hearing stories about how some people fell asleep in mere seconds. To me, that's impossible, not even in my dreams.

Anyone with the same shit?"
I hate not knowing whether I slept or not,"So I know for a fact that I was up till about 645 am. I then switched rooms, and never heard my mom or dad leave for work. I then woke up around 9. Went back to closing my eyes, and ‚Äúwoke up‚Äù around 11 with drool all over my pillow. But I still can‚Äôt tell if I slept. Ughh this is so frustrating "
"After 4 months of being on a waiting list, I‚Äôm currently sitting in my sleep study!","I finally found a really amazing doctor who took my sleep issues seriously. He put me in a sleep study to see what my problem might be. So for one full night i get to sleep in a hotel room with a bunch of wires and sensors connected to my body *wooooo yay* 

It‚Äôs going to be strange knowing people are watching me sleep, but i hope this is a step into me developing better sleep habits. wish me luck!! "
Why is it so easy to fall asleep during the day but so hard to do so at night?,"It's always been like this for me. Get up at 6am, no napping during the day, feel sleepy at 10 pm,get to bed and.... Nothing. I toss and turn, unable to fall asleep for hours. I get way too little sleep and wake up tired the next morning only to repeat the same thing in the evening. Then on another day I get up at 10 am and decide to take a nap at 2pm. I get to bed and fall asleep pretty much instantly. What explains the difference in the time it takes to fall asleep when I'm tired in both situations and the bed I sleep in doesn't change? It's really frustrating and makes me wish I could have a job with just night shifts. I've always been bad at sleeping during the night. Is there anything I can do to turn it around?"
Oh my GOD,"Uhhhhh why..... can‚Äôt.... I ..... go .... to ....sleeeeeeep
Probs would help if i wasn‚Äôt on reddit but oh well"
"SEVERE sleep anxiety and insomnia for ~2 weeks, now finally sleeping daily -- what worked for me.","I'm writing this to help anyone who might be going through something similar. **NOTE:** This is not directed towards people who suffer insomnia where their sleep rhythms are extended or delayed and/or simply aren't tired at normal times of day. This is for insomnia sufferers who ARE TIRED who want nothing more than to sleep, but simply can't or have trouble crossing over due to anxiety, fears, and worries related to sleep.

&#x200B;

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a 30 year old, bodybuilder, never had problems with sleep outside of NOT being sleepy at the right times and being an occasional night owl. Long story short, did a huge diet switch to keto (which, due to the lack of carbs, causes a large reduction in water weight, and a huge loss in minerals), and eliminated pretty much all vegetables. I went mostly carnivore and planned to slowly introduce foods back in to experiment and see if I had any food intolerances. At the time I had no idea how important electrolyte balance was and wasn't focusing on them. Ultimately I became severely magnesium deficient to the point of developing heart palpitations, unexplained irritability, and severe muscle cramps. At the time, I wasn't working and ostensibly had no major stresses in my life. I saved up a ton of money in my graphic design job in the previous year and was essentially ""coasting"" after being laid off to focus on myself and rebalance mentally. Ironically enough...it lead to the darkest, most traumatic experience I've had thus far in my life (more on this later).

My big mistake was underestimating the stresses I was putting my body through. For starters, the ketogenic metabolic change is a HUGE stress. Imagine eating the standard American diet (high carb) for 30 years and suddenly stopping... Now, I don't wanna get into the science because there are plenty of resources detailing this already, but a massive metabolic shift occurs when switching to low carb, which depletes a lot of minerals and can cause you to feel awful for a few weeks. It's called the ""keto flu"" and is extremely common with first-time keto dieters. I went through this, but on top of that, I kept up with my heavy workout regiment. This was borderline overtraining. The kicker is this: a lifetime of playing high-stress competitive games, working out all my adult life, and barely eating magnesium-rich foods meant I was already low magnesium, but the recent keto change seemed to be the final nail in the coffin that pushed me into severe deficiency and caused more serious symptoms. 

This eventually triggered a panic attack that came out of nowhere. My guess is that the heart palpitations (which I had for about 3-4 weeks) constantly worried me and eventually triggered panic attack symptoms. Normally I'm emotionally resilient, and very stoic. I've had short bouts of depression through most of my adult life, but nothing I'd called ""clinical"". other than that I've had no mental health issues, no anxiety, nothing. And yet somehow...a panic attack snuck up on me. This is when I learned how important minerals were. When it came, I thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die, so it was traumatic. Went to the ER, did an overnight stay, and the typical panic attack rigamaroo where you think you're dying but the doctors say you're 100% fine and that it's all in your head. At the time I resented that, but when I got home, after the doctors found nothing, I started having panic and anxiety symptoms at home, and after a few hours of research, I realized, shit, this is actually a thing. My personality went from masculine, sarcastic, and stoic, to fearful, panicky, constantly ruminating in negative thoughts, worried, needy, emotional, etc. Absolutely NO LIBIDO, NO HUNGER, just constant fear and being way too deep in my own head to enjoy anything. That entire first week was nothing more than severe chronic anxiety. I mean, SEVERE....I was in fight-or-flight from the moment I woke up, 'til the time I fell asleep. The entire week I was getting horrible sleep 1-2 hours at best, then waking up from shortness of breath and elevated heart rates. My heart would start racing every time I went to sleep, or even thought about sleep, and this eventually developed into a form of sleep anxiety where my brain learned to associate sleep with fear.

This is when the real problems started. A full week later, after a week of awful sleep, I was severely deprived, so I attempted to go to sleep, and for 16 hours straight, the same thing kept happening. I'd lay down, heart would start racing, body would go into full panic and fight-or-flight, and I'd be wide awake from the stress hormones, and eventually calm down 15-20 minutes later to be SEVERELY EXHAUSTED, rinse and repeat. This has never happened to me before, and I legitimately thought my brain was broken. I couldn't fall asleep for the life of me. Even lying in bed for 2-3 hours straight, perfectly still, my brain just couldn't shut off. This is when I found out what ACTUAL insomnia was. I desperately wanted sleep more than anything, but couldn't get there no matter how hard I tried, and the worse it became, the more nervousness and anxiety I built up around it...which of course works against you. I used to think I was an insomniac when I stayed up all night playing video games 'til 6am and had to wake at 8am, but NOPE, not even close... now I knew what real insomnia was. The 16 hours ATTEMPTING to sleep eventually drove me crazy, and sent my panic and anxiety into overdrive. I ended up calling 911 begging and pleading with them to find a way to put me to sleep. 

If you told me two weeks prior that I'd be pacing back and forth, sleep deprived, panic-ridden, talking to myself, ruminating, catastrophizing, and slowly becoming suicidal, I would have laughed in your face, yet that's exactly what happened. This taught me that ANYONE could become ""crazy"" under the right circumstances. I was eventually released from the hospital with a trazodone prescription the next morning around 8am (been up for roughly 40 hours now) and eventually ended up passing out around 12pm for about 1-2 hours of awful sleep.

The trauma of everything spiraled into insomnia and severe sleep anxiety for the next few weeks. I lived my life in 30 to 40 hour panic-ridden ""phases"" with maybe 2-3 hours of sleep in between for the entire first week. It was awful. At the same time I decided I needed to beat this, despite feeling like total shit, panicky, fearful, etc. I had enough presence of mind to go on a strict protocol to fix everything and return back to normal ASAP. Below is what worked for me.  


**HOW I GOT BACK TO NORMALCY FAIRLY QUICKLY:** 

**NOTE:** The panic attacked happened December 21st, second ER visit with the insomnia freakout was December 28th and today is January 20th, so it's about a full month later. Chronic anxiety, heart palpitations, and insomnia are pretty much gone. I'm sleeping every night for 5-7 hours, which compared to before is amazing. Even bad sleep is better than no sleep. My life is mostly back to normal and I can function and do my daily activities fine, and after 3 weeks, I can actually laugh again and enjoy life. WOW. It's still a bit fresh so it can still take me up to 2 hours to fall asleep at times, but I eventually always pass out, so I no longer worry about it. I've made big changes however and I'll detail them below.

**1. It is absolutely crucial to make sure your magnesium intake is very high.** If you have anxiety, your appetite probably isn't the greatest, and even if you're eating a healthy diet, you're likely to be magnesium deficient simply due to soil depletion and the fact that none of us really know if our foods are growing in mineral-rich soils. This is why I highly recommend supplementation of this crucial mineral. I use 'Natural Calm', and take 300-600mg daily. Why so much? Because I'm also a bodybuilder and am using what you'd call a ""therapeutic"" dose to recover from the traumatic panic/anxiety episode a few weeks ago caused by a severe deficiency, and many expert think the USDA RDA of 400mg is way too low, ESPECIALLY if you're going through a high stress period. This helped TREMENDOUSLY the first two weeks. You literally can feel a calming sensation take over you, and your thoughts become ""lighter"". Magnesium pushes calcium out of cells and nerve tissue so you're less reactive to stimuli, if that makes sense. The biochemistry is explained, but there's no real way to explain it to most people other than it feels like magic and takes effect very quickly. It felt like my body was so starved for this nutrient that it gobbled it up and put it to work immediately. My palpitations disappeared in a day after I started supplementation. It took a bit longer for everything else (because it's also partly psychological) but it helped tremendously with being clear minded enough to take a more objective look at the anxiety and insomnia.  


Go on Amazon and look at the countless reviews for the various magnesium products and you'll see thousands of people raving about magnesium's positive effect on their mood,  insomnia and anxiety. If you can't supplement, add a few mag-rich foods to your diet. These include bananas, avocados, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, spinach, etc.   


There's boatloads of clinical and anecdotal evidence out there on the associations between magnesium deficiency (which is extremely common) and stress, anxiety, insomnia, sleeplessness, irritability, etc. so don't overlook this mineral when you're having these symptoms. There are numerous lectures, articles, interviews, and talks as well. Hit up YouTube, and do some searching. If you want a comprehensive overview, I'd start with Dr. Carolyn Dean; a well renowned and highly sought after expert on magnesium. Magnesium Deficiency 101 - Dr. Carolyn Dean: [https://youtu.be/3td7\_91UwrU](https://youtu.be/3td7_91UwrU)

&#x200B;

**2. Force yourself to eat at the same times ""daily""** (obviously you're living your days in phases with insomnia, hence the quotes, but try to eat regularly) and try to go to sleep around the same times daily. Absolutely no stimulants for obvious reasons. Yes, you'll be tired, you'll have brain fog, you'll be hallucinating, and getting through the day will be rough, to say the least, but you'll be ruling out any deficiencies, as well as working on your circadian rhythm so that you naturally get tired around the same time daily. With constant eating of nutritional meals, you'll be setting a good nutritional base for your body to produce what it needs to produce in order to relax and eventually fall asleep. Do not trust your hunger because it's impaired right now. You NEED FOOD. Do not allow yourself to degenerate any further nutritionally. You will NOT be hungry, but you can chew and swallow, and as long as you can do that, you can't give up on yourself.   


Also, note that ""relaxing"" isn't just an automatic thing, or a ""lack of"" action. You will need to feed your body the right foods so that neutrotransmitters, and various cofactors involved in the parasympathetic nervous system can become active and in balance with your sympathetic nervous system again so you can rest peacefully and get further and further away from the anxious states. 

&#x200B;

**3. Do all the generic sleep hygiene stuff;** switch devices to yellow light, only go to bed when you're tired so your brain associates sleep with your mattress, restrict your sleep to specific hours, don't obsess about the time or obsessively track hours slept, make sure your room temperature is comfortable, etc. I don't need to expand on this because it's repeated ad nauseum here, but the goal is to stack every possible card in your favor so you can wind down and fall asleep.

&#x200B;

**4. THIS IS VITAL. Do not convince yourself that you have ""insomnia""** or go into bed thinking you're going to have trouble sleeping. Even if you've been professionally diagnosed. Doctors don't care about you the same way you care about yourself, so keep this in mind. You're one of many patients to them so you need to take control of your own health, and sometimes that means completely rejecting their advice and diagnoses. You need to tell yourself that you're simply going through a rough period and sleep might be difficult, but you're fine. I can't stress how important it is to psychologically believe that things are fine and/or will get better. A major component of insomnia for people who suffer from anxiety is the very anxiety around not being able to sleep. The anxiety compounds the issue and it thus becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's one of the many cases in humans where if you believe it's a problem, it WILL be a problem. 

You need to find a way to, over time, decouple the association between sleep and whatever negative delusional spin you're putting on it. Do not predict the future with false and irrelevant evidence from the past. A bad night of sleep, or no sleep the day before does not mean it's going to repeat in the future. This is highly ILLOGICAL, but your brain won't care about this, it will force those thoughts on you. Be aware of your own cognitive behaviors and beat them out with clear, logical thinking. Obviously, this will be difficult since emotional states cause us to think delusionally, and insomnia along with the accompanying sleep deprivation will make it worse, but the big takeaway is to realize that you can't really trust your brain at this time because it isn't functioning properly and is under a lot of stress. This process can take time, be patient with yourself, especially if you think nutrition might be a factor. It's vitally important to remember that YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP. EVERY HUMAN HAS THIS ABILITY unless you have extremely rare genetic disorders or severe nutritional deficiencies that can EASILY be corrected.

You need to realize that it's ENTIRELY NORMAL to have problems falling asleep for days, weeks or even months at a time. Your case is likely NOT UNIQUE, and many millions of people over millenia have suffered and successfully recovered from this disturbance. It is scary because it is happening to YOU, but take comfort in the fact that it is also common and treatable. This is not blind hope, or lying to yourself, these are FACTS THAT YOU NEED TO CONSTANTLY REMIND YOURSELF OF because your brain will already be doing a great job of bringing you down with negative thoughts. You must truly believe that you're going to get better and fix the problem, while taking every possible step you can to move the dial in the right direction towards progress. 

Take comfort in the fact that many people have sleepless periods like this for various reasons. Stress, nutritional deficiencies, terrible diets, anxiety, grieving, depression, breakups, divorces, etc. It's crucial to remember that all psychological stresses will diminish over time and you will return to normalcy. Your brain is constantly adjusting towards homeostasis, so YOU WILL HEAL IN TIME. YOU MUST KNOW THIS. Don't get obsessive over how long your recovery is taking, or set arbitrary goalposts (e.i. ""I should be fine in a week""). Take things one day at a time. 

Also be aware that stress depletes magnesium, which is responsible for reining in ruminating thoughts and relaxing you. Again, I urge anyone with insomnia and/or anxiety to do ample research on magnesium. It is absolutely a life safer. Here's a really good video emphasizing some of the points made above: [https://youtu.be/ZGFVxQiLH8k](https://youtu.be/ZGFVxQiLH8k)

&#x200B;

**5. Last part is to remember that falling asleep is an automatic and passive act.** You can't force it. This is the biggest mistake I made when I first encountered insomnia. You need to simply achieve a relaxed state while drowsy, and your brain will do the rest. Think back on previous times you fell asleep and note how you didn't do anything special. You closed your eyes, perhaps started thinking about the day or fantasizing, and eventually fade out. I had the biggest trouble with this for what seemed like an eternity, but eventually learned to simply stop worrying about getting sleep. Close your eyes, relax, let your thoughts wander to daily stuff; sex, work, social interactions, family, future plans, women, men, wherever your natural fantasies lie, and it eventually happens...you wake up, and the next thing you know it's a couple of hours later. 

&#x200B;

**IN CLOSING** I know this is difficult, and this is probably oversimplified, but it's important to not get frustrated if you don't get instant results. You will get better a little bit at a time. If you slept fine in the past, there's absolutely no reason to believe that you won't sleep fine in the future. There's a reason why cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is so effective, because truly, for many of us, it's in our own heads. The human brain is an amazingly powerful and complex organ, and its power is such that it is also amazing at self sabotage. Keep this in mind when dealing with negative thoughts. I've also found it helpful to not AVOID negative thoughts. Write them out and or follow them through to their endings in your head. At times you realize how hilariously delusional many of your thoughts are, and how unrealistic they are. If you can find humor in them, the fear lessens, and they end up as ""processed"" thoughts. That thought can no longer bother you. Hence why facing your fears and confronting your negative thoughts works so well, because, in truth, the vast majority of our worst fears **NEVER COME TRUE**. At the same time, it's important not to over obsess and be in your head all the time. DO seek out distractions and ways to get your mind off your issues, but not to the point of total and complete avoidance, as avoidance reinforces fears.

Key is to get into get aiming to relax not sleep,I beat my insomnia recently with this tactic but slipped up tonight and it's 4.30am without sleeping. Luckily it's holiday so I'll get like 5 hours but it's extra bad for me because I'm a male going to gym to try and get gains and I NEED THE SLEEP
I actually slept all night and a couple hours this morning. I was so stressed out.,Wish this was the norm.
"anyone else have Flux installed and laugh/cry when the notification is like ""You will wake up in 3 hours.""",
Can ANYONE relate? 3-4 hours per night.,I'm going insane. Only been getting 3-4 hours per night. Can't afford health insurance. In a state that did not expand Medicaid so that's out of the question. Someone help me please. Just let me know if you can relate so I know I'm not alone.

"Anybody else experience the ""I was inches from sleep, but the next moment I'm suddenly wide awake"" thing?","Delayed sleep onset is my manifestation of insomnia, so it almost always takes me 2-4 or more hours to fall asleep. More nights than not now, once I finally am near sleep, my brain suddenly flips on and in an instant I'm wide awake. It's so frustrating to be that near sleep and then lose it. Does this happen to anyone else?"
Considering suicide,"I've tried almost everything, nothing works even slightly. I'm going to have a sleep study done. If no good comes out of that, I think I'm going to kill myself in a year by the age of 35. My life has practically ended due to insomnia. I've lost friends, romantic interests, money/job, family relations, etc. I'm only alive at the moment in hopes that my insomnia will go away, but it doesn't seem like it will. "
"After nearly a lifetime of insomnia issues, I've gotten it to where it's actually manageable. I'll share my methods and try to say things about each that you haven't already heard many times before","Ok, so. Sleep issues were destroying my life to the point where it was devastating to my daily life for years. I've been practicing methods that have more or less worked fine for me for the last couple years. Hopefully what I say will be useful to someone. I'm not going to give you the ""stay away from coffee and turn electronics off!"" kind of runaround. If you're here and reading this, chances are, you need better advice than that BS.

In order of most helpful:

**What's actually happening:** This research paper (reddit messes up the link, http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(11)01045-2 ) really pinpoints what the problem is. If you're more educated, try reading the paper. But [here's a news article on it if you can't understand it](http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2012/01/27/study-of-fruit-fly-sleep-reveals-a-genetic-basis-of-insomnia/). Basically, the insomnia mutation gene has been isolated. The researchers themselves wanted to stay on point with it (because most researchers studying insomnia get sidetracked by something else), and the most important things to know are 1) insomnia is caused by an inability to *stimulate* certain neuron activities responsible for inducing sleep (ie. feeling ""sleepy,"" as opposed to exhausted) and 2) the behavior of this mutation causes a pattern of alternating one night oversleep and and one night undersleep for normal sleep conditions. I used to record my hours sleeping and the graph I made had the exact same pattern.

**The goal:** The idea to get a manage on your sleep patterns (I said MANAGE, they won't be perfect) is to wake up at the same time each day. There was a great video that pinpoints the solution, but I can't find it now. It was a male ASMR video from someone who's been through it before. Anyway, consistent with what my sleep therapist said, the idea is that the time of waking up is more important than the time going to sleep/ staying asleep. To accomplish waking up consistently, you need to set a time where you get out of bed and start your day *no matter what*. If you just finally fell asleep right before that, say, 8am mark, then you HAVE to get up anyway. If you have a sleepless night, this will also be your cut off for when you give up and you can start moving on. Now, this isn't easily. You will probably push your body to extremes the first week that you do this, and it will be absolutely brutal on you, but after the first week or two it will get better. Overall, the process takes about 3 months of patience. Here are some tools to help:

**Sunboxes for bolting down wake up time:** Wake up time, regardless of how much you sleep right now is top priority. This is probably the most effective long term aid. No medications, no side effects. [These can be pretty expensive](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=sunbox) but they're worth it. You need at least 10,000 lux. If you don't already know, the lamps hit the right bandwidth of frequencies at a high enough intensity to reset your circadian rhythm by using light to simulate a Springtime sunrise. The best way to use this is to have [a mechanical timer](http://www.amazon.com/Instapark-Heavy-duty-Mechanical-Grounded-Polarized/dp/B00O3H03LW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1438605752&sr=8-2&keywords=mechanical+timer+outlet) attached to it and use it on your nightstand pointed straight at you. If you're actually asleep by the time it turns on, the light is powerful enough to shine through your eyelids and will actually light up your dreams (Fucking ridiculous, I know). This is your cue to wake up. I'd say after 3-4 weeks of constant use, your body will consistently wake up 20 minutes before it turns on. I found that after 3 days without using it, I'll fall off the schedule, though. So you need to use it everyday. Expose yourself to it for 2 hours to start. Eventually you can get it down to 30 minutes a day after a few months of use.

**Using melatonin properly to assist in actually falling sleep**: Most people don't think this works because they haven't used it daily for several months in a row. Next step, after bolting down wake up time, is to actually get to sleep. The time you fall asleep matters less, but it's still very important. Melatonin is my preferred sleep aid on the ground that it has no side effects for long term use (we're talking about the next 30 years, not a few months). The most important thing about this is to realize that the role is to stimulate those neuron activities that induce sleepiness. I set an alarm for 9pm and took it the same time every single day. I'd say, give it 3-4 weeks of consistent use before it actually starts inducing sleepiness. This is important. Most fellow insomniacs give up on it after a short time because it doesn't work, but you need to use it consistently for several weeks before your body will recognize the cue. 10mg is a good dose to start. 

**Electronics / stimulation may actually be a good thing**: I've heard the ""read a book and stay away from the computer"" BS enough times to want to shoot someone for saying it. I've found the opposite to be true. I need noise. I usually fall asleep with my phone next to my pillow playing a video that I'm content to falling asleep to. This allows you to point your focus at something arbitrary instead of letting your thoughts roam free. Over the years, I've watched several different kinds of videos. Documentaries are good, so are those 90s FBI crime shows on Discovery (no special effects, no ""futuristic"" sounds, monotone, meant for sleep), mellow let's plays of quieter games, ASMR videos, etc. Basically, first try nothing without a plot. Remember, this stimulation needs to be ok to fall asleep to at any given point. It doesn't have to be a video, that's just what works for me. But the idea is to pinpoint your focus until you drift off. 

I WILL say this, though. Avoid reddit. I've noticed that this website has very similar effects as pulling slot machines. You pull the lever (click next page) and mentally scramble around the findings in hopes of something really good, quickly moving onto the next. I can almost FEEL that dopamine rush form extended reddit use. That's the wrong type of stimulation for sleep. You need something stimulating in a different sense.

**Have emergency, non-medication sleep aids**: Say you've been trying to sleep for hours and you're starting to feel restless. If you try to focus on something, your thoughts will diverge. So I've had a few tools to help me realign that focus when that happens. You really have to just let your fucking thoughts go. Whatever you're thinking about, don't finish that thought. It WILL lead to more. Anyway, idoser's [insomnia track](http://www.i-doser.com/index.html) (can't find a specific link( worked well for me. Along with [this hypnosis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm4wWHL9YU). Use headphones for both if you want to use those. Focus completely on the audio. If your thoughts get sidetracked, recognize it, pull the brakes, and focus again on the sound. The ""emergency aids"" serve a dual purpose. They're reliable enough for me to fall asleep to a good percentage of the time when I can't otherwise, but equally as important, *they serve as a way to confirm that you'll have a sleepless night*. It doesn't have to be those two things I mentioned, **but you want something that, if ineffective, you know you won't fall asleep that particular night**. That way you can at least get up and do your taxes or something instead of wasting time.

**As far as medications are concerned**: These usually do more harm than good, I've found. I'm sure everyone on here has heard of ambien and what it can make you do. Although these heavy duty aids can work sometimes, I've been able to avoid them for years now. The only medications I use currently are DOXYLAMINE OTC sleep aids (ie. the slightly more expensive one, the other chemical in the US isn't powerful enough). [These are the ones I use](http://www.unisom.com/our-products/unisom-sleeptabs/). About these, if you've been good on the above methods, these SHOULD work *when you start using them*. Save these for down the line, after a few months of the sunbox and melatonin. I'd say avoid prescriptions because we're looking for long term (30+ years of use) solutions. Keeping side effects at minimum is super important. That's why I suggest using only sunbox and melatonin as default. The thing about these is that the rebound insomnia hits VERY hard. So you have no limit yourself to a set time (no more than 10 days). Start with half a pill. By the end of your period, you'll probably need a full one or 1.5 to get you to sleep. Regardless of whether or not it actually helped, stop after that cut off time. The insomnia you get after stopping those is actually harder to deal with than normal, imo. Expect to feel like crap the next morning if these actually work for you, so don't take them if you're doing something social-orientated. You might feel a need to take a nap the next day if these work, avoid that urge.

**Smaller tips**:

* As far as nighttime / morning routines are concerned, they don't need to be extravagant. For night, I pee, brush my teeth, and smoke a cig. That's enough for me. For morning, I'll read the news on my phone in bed and brush my teeth. That's really it. 

* That ""after 20 minutes of not falling asleep"" rule is good, but obviously change 20 minutes to around 80. The idea behind that is to break association of laying down + not sleeping. That can be an absolute killer. When I'm in full control over my sleep, the only times I ever lie down are when I'm about to sleep, and it would take me about 30-40 minutes to do so, a significant improvement over 4-5 hours or none at all.

* For staying asleep, the rule on your diet habits (eating signals your body to wake up) applies well. If you eat something from the fridge because you're up at night, that'll mess you up probably. It's better to deal with temporary starvation than to risk messing it up. But generally, if I wake up in the middle of the night after 3 hours and can't fall back asleep, I just accept it and start the next day on a bad start. There's nothing you can really do as a long term solution. These things will happen, and you have to just deal with it.

* Daylight savings can mess you up. Every year, it screws up my bolted down schedule. So I have to prepare for the shift weeks in advance. That little hour can diverge into weeks of a messed up cycle if I don't prepare for it by going to sleep 1-2 hours earlier weeks before.

* For loneliness, I recommend Skype with people around the world. Or tinychat too. Something more than just text online. You need to use your voice / gestures.

And that's it I guess. That's all I got. This has worked well for me for several years now. Again, **this won't make every night successful, but it will allow you to manage your sleeping issues to where they cause the least possible amount of damage in your life**. I still get sleepless nights. I still have trouble falling asleep some nights. These problems will always be there, but if I get one sleepless night every 3 weeks, then that's really not that bad. I can deal with that. I also focused more on LONG TERM solutions. Taking ambien every night for 30 years is too damaging in terms of side effects. I only use the OTC sleep aids every few months when my schedule starts to drift forward too much. Melatonin is pretty safe. You can eventually drop the doe to 6mg after a few months. The important thing to keep in mind at all times is that this requires patience. If you're an insomniac, you will probably always be an insomniac. Yes, the sunbox might not do anything for you in the first month or two, but after an extended period of time, it'll start to show its effect. I know it's frustrating that you can't sleep RIGHT NOW and that's probably what you're most concerned about, but you need to give it time. For me, I'd say it took 3 months for the initial stabilization and bolting down of my sleep schedule and a total of 6 months before I was able to consistently follow through with sleeping and staying asleep for MOST nights. 

I've been doing well for years. Passed a certain point, maintenance becomes an easy habit. 

Good luck. Hope this was useful for someone out there."
Insomnia make me want to kill myself and sleep forever,"I have insomnia since im 8yo, because of ptsd, and im always trying to figure out if i remember somthing or if it was a dream. I working 30 hours a week and im so fucking tired i feel like i cant do shit, i dont want to live like this, but i know that if i try to kill myself im gonna fuck it up and end up disable for the rest of my life "
Anyone else turn into an erratic dickwad when their brain wont shut the fuck up?,"When I get minimal sleep, which is pretty much every day, I have random bouts every few days or so where I get so fucking angry and want to slam my head through a knife. I remember back when I used to get decent rest I would be a much better person for myself and others but sleep deprivation has turned me into a fucking lunatic."
Almost killed myself at work today,"I do electrical work it requires a lot of focus and since I haven't slept all week it's been hard for me. I was splicing wires together and got hit with 480volts and luckily fell off a ladder. At those kind of voltages you lose control over your muscles and you can get stuck and not able to move so I'm thankful I fell. It's all thanks to my insomnia, I think it's about time to get some help."
I fell asleep at 6am ans got up at 2pm which is a tiny success for me!,"Not neccessary insomniac, but I couldn't fell asleep in the evening. Ever.
 Which led me to the point to only fall asleep around 11am. 
Which is horrible for my life and gave me neck pain and migraine which brought me to the point to be inable to do anything and be depressed.
After another episode of 1 month of weird sleep patterns like 3-4h twice a day, today I'm finally back to what for me is a time that allows to me be active during the day.

I know it's not much and lots of you have bigger troubles, like, not sleeping for DAYS.

But for me it is a small success and the first step to be able to function, do my things, meet friends and slowly going back to normal.

Just wanted to share my little happiness.

Best of sleep to everyone

Finally last night I slept well. Meditation with sleep mask on.,"I was so ecstatic this morning because I could sleep last night. It was such big deal to me. I have been meditating with my sleep mask on before I go to bed. As soon as I feel sleepy, I go to bed. 

I am going to try again tonight. Wish me luck."
When people act like insomnia is just me not being responsible going to bed on time and setting an alarm to get up..,"That really [grinds my gears.](https://mamg.makeameme.org/when-somebody-thinks-5aea75.jpg)

It has got jack to do with responsibility. I can get up at 6am every morning, spend most of the day potato brained and zombie like (perma jet lag), and then when it is bed time I can't get to sleep. Even if my sleep hygiene is good. Insomnia doesn't follow your rules. if all I had to do was ""be responsible and get up at a consistent time"" this problem would have been solved 30 years ago, and it wouldn't even be a medical condition!

It's even worse when the person being such a moron is a medical professional, especially in the field of sleep disorders - you should know better!!

I know what I am supposed to be doing and I am following all the rules. It means exactly zilch to my insomnia, that's life, sometimes sh-- just happens that way. 

I just needed to get that frustration off my chest. Sick of hearing it form people who don't know wtf they are talking about.


edit:
>I'm confused. If you're following all of the doctor's advice, then how are you still posting on reddit? The number one thing they tell you is to avoid lit screens as much as possible. 

 ***well I'd better quit my job then and go Amish then! Can't be near any lit screens!*** ^\(the ^rule ^is ^to ^get ^away ^from ^those ^screens ^several ^hrs ^before ^bed, ^not ^cut ^them ^out ^of ^life ^entirely\)

This here is the problem. Someone is always making assumptions about when and why people in this situation are awake. And those assumptions are almost always factually WRONG. I'm normally away from lit screens starting several hours before bed. I do a 10 mile run so I am getting proper exercise. I go to bed in total darkness. I get up at the a consistent time, even on days off I don't need to be up (no sleeping in). But if the topic comes up, I see the same reaction you just had. When I put forth that I too have insomnia and they are just plain wrong about everyone else just being lazy or undisciplined they can't wrap their heads around it and insist people like me just must be doing it to ourselves.

> Many people would rather bitch and complain about not sleeping than actually take the steps they need to fix the problem. It's like going on a diet, you need to develop new habits and avoid old ones to succeed and a lot of people aren't willing to do that.

Sometimes people bitch and complain because nobody is willing to believe that they've done the steps and the problem still isn't gone. It is infuriating. And when I run into someone who's problem is they want to stay up till 3am dicking with facebook on their cellphone I want to smack them for making those of us with a real problem be constantly dismissed.

"What's your go-to response for the ""just drink tea"" folks?","I have come so far in fighting my insomnia. I get upset when I have days of sleepness but I also have to recognize that getting good sleep is now the norm for me while I used to hardly ever sleep at all. First, I dealt with a fear of sleeping due to childhood abuse and putting down my guard equating to more abuse. Then, I had a very stressful job and academic experience that rarely gave me time to sleep. Now, my life is much less stressful and I am going to therapy.

I know I still have a lot to overcome in dealing with the roots that caused my insomnia. I am a very open person about my past and my current struggles, which I feel is beneficial for me although it does provide more opportunities for responses that might not necessarily be helpful.

But it is really frustrating encountering the ""just drink tea"" folks. Yes, some holistic approaches and focusing on routine might be helpful. But it's hard to keep a routine if I might be up till 5 am struggling to sleep one night and doing much better another night. I *wish* just drinking a cup of chamomile tea and going to bed at the same time each night were a guaranteed recipe for good sleep.

What's your go-to response for people who say comments like this?"
anyone have chronic head aches from insomnia that keep you awake?,"I am somewhat on an endless cycle of sleep issues. It started from stress I think and then that caused me to have bad anxiety. Now I am currently having headaches everyday on the back left side of my head. Before i was getting head tingles and headaches from the anxiety.

It just sucks because I got anxiety from insomnia and now it gives me headaches which makes my sleep worse.

It feels as when I am tired I will get a headache in my left side. Then as I feel myself about to dream I will have a sharp pain and my brain will stop tying to sleep and feels anxious about the pain. Its truly an endless cycle. Any tips welcome."
These videos actually work,"https://youtu.be/RJKVSfst3j8
These boring bed time stories are the only thing on YouTube that actually put me to sleep.  It's just videos of a guy rambling on and telling pointless stories. Sometimes he just reads Trader Joe flyers and gives his opinion on each item. It's actually kind of funny at times. 

I used to listen to white noise or rain sounds but they never worked. With these, I'm asleep in under 30-45 min."
I hate people who talks really loud next to sleeping person,I have trouble falling asleep and its not easy to fall back to sleep once i wake up its making me wanna murder them... sucks to live in 1 room small apartment with 4 people 
When you can‚Äôt sleep because of insomnia but your eyes are too dry from lack of sleep to keep them open so you just lay there dying of boredom and frustration,Especially in the summer with the fan on in my room. My eyes are burning so badly I can hardly look at my phone.
Does anyone else only feel tired or are only able to go to sleep right when it‚Äôs time to get ready to start the day or leave the house?,"It seems that the only time I am ever able to fall asleep, if I am able to, is right when I have to start getting ready for the day."
Surprising insomnia help after a lifetime of sleep problems,"Can we celebrate a triumph? 

I've had sleeping problems my entire life. My parents say I didn't sleep well as a toddler after surviving meningitis. Now in my 30s, I found I had a severe vitamin D deficiency that led to taking this massive prescription dose twice a week. I noticed early on that those two days a week I would be completely fatigued, so I started taking the pills at night. Two nights a week I'd actually sleep all the way through. 

Now I take 5000iu a night along with a calcium, zinc, and magnesium vitamin which helps with absorption. Voila! I haven't slept this well, this consistently my whole life. Who knows why I have such a chronic case of insomnia, but at this point I'm counting my blessings and not asking questions. "
Will Die,"I will be killing myself, haven't slept in 7 months. Nothing works. "
Does anybody else get good sleep every other night?,"So I am under a lot of stress which prevents me from sleeping, but only every other night. Let me explain.

So on a given night I might get 3-4 hours of sleep and the next day I am completely fried  and can't resist sleep no matter how stressed I am so I sleep 7 hours. The next day I am rested enough to stay up worrying so I only get 3-4 hours of sleep. This cycle continues for years. Is anyone else experience something like this, I don't see much info on google about it. Its like insomnia, but only every other day."
Thinking about surrendering and going back on weed,"Everytime I decide to take a break from weed I'm reminded of how shitty my default state is.

What's the point of living clean if I'm dead? "

I tried this stupid CBT fix for anxiety and it worked pretty well last night.,"I‚Äôm trying a modified Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia without therapist (not recommended) to advance my sleep phase for a new job I‚Äôm starting. Like probably all of you, I dread nighttime for how elusive good sleep can be. The anxiety about my sleep (and life) just makes it worse. 

I tried this stupid thing suggested by my CBT-I coach app - ‚Äúschedule‚Äù time to worry and just remind myself that I‚Äôll worry then, whenever ruminations crop back up. So I told myself no less than 100 times last night, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll worry about that at 9am tomorrow.‚Äù By the 70th time I could shut down the thoughts immediately. 

I had a really good night with only ~30 mins tossing in the first hourish. Huge victory for me. Woke up like 5 mins before my hellishly early alarm, pretty fuckin refreshed. 

I posted a couple days ago without specifying that I am treating delayed sleep wake phase, NOT typical insomnia, so many of my methods - strict light control, melatonin, rigid wake time - might not work for a lot of you. I had a rough night the other day but tracking my progress overall I‚Äôve advanced my sleep from 2-3am to ~11-12 on a consistent basis, averaging over 6 hrs sleep this week. Go me!"
You people are my only friends,"Ever make a post on any other sub around this time and wonder why you are getting no responses and then remember ‚Äúoh right, 
 only the insomniacs talk to me at this hour while the rest of the world is sound asleep. Those assholes.‚Äù "
Fuck,Some nights I feel like I might just fucking die from insomnia.
Anyone else had it since childhood?,"Literally in my entire life, even as a kid i would make up games to play while i lay in bed, even as a kid sleep seemed foreign to me, like i couldnt understand it. Its like i never learned how to sleep, i feel like insomnia was seared into my brain in childhood and i cant reverse it. Can anyone else relate? Ive never known what its like to fall asleep in under an hour and it aggravates me that i cant be normal."
Anyone else find it much easier to sleep during the day than sleep at night?,"In order for me to fall asleep at night, I need to be absolutely exhausted. I can't go to bed when I'm only kinda sleepy or even very sleepy. I need to be so tired I can barely keep my eyes open. For some reason, laying in the dark at night and being unable to fall asleep gives me intense anxiety. It's been a very long time since I've gone to bed before being 100% certain I could fall asleep within 15-20 minutes. I avoid that situation as much as possible.

Up until earlier this year I was typically falling asleep around 4AM, but lately I find myself still awake until the sun comes up. Once the skies start to lighten up a little and I can hear the world outside starting to wake up, it's much easier to fall asleep. 

It's like I'm afraid of the dark, but not. I'm actually fine in a dark room, I don't think any monsters or ghosts or murderers are going to get me. Falling asleep at night just feels really dark and foreboding and oppressive and claustrophobic. It also doesn't help that most of my panic attacks occur at night, in bed, so I associate laying in the dark with anxiety and the feeling of impending doom.

I can avoid all that uncomfortableness by staying up until I can no longer keep my eyes open, but that makes keeping a normal human schedule hard. And I much prefer being awake during the day than being awake all night. The last couple months, two-thirds of my life has been taking place in darkness and that really sucks. 

Trying to reset my sleep schedule never works, either. Today I woke up at 9AM after just three hours of sleep and it's now almost 3AM and I can tell I'm going to be up all night again. 

I'm thinking of trying melatonin or - this is embarrassing - but keeping a small light on in my room at night. Never in a million years did I think I'd be scared of the dark as an adult."

Cant sleep,
The One Good Thing About My Insomnia,"I have insomnia (obviously), and as many of you know, it kinda sucks. Its bad for my health, and it takes down my operational levels 2 notches, but it does have a few perks. I have more time to learn shit, though these days I spend my time meditating.

But I realized that my lack of sleep was beneficial to many of my peers. I go to a school that is crazy stressful, both academically and socially, and even though no one says anything or shows anything, it really does take a huge toll on many students. Now, since I was almost always up, I usually just had facebook open whilst I taught myself all sorts of things. And since there was almost no one online regularly at 4 am, I became the guy who people talked to as a last ditch effort before they attempted suicide. 
In the last 2 years, I have talked 37 people out of suicide at least 53 times. I used to bitch and moan about how I hated not being able to sleep, but nothing puts things in perspective quite like wondering if you'd have seen one of those kids in the hall if you weren't awake when they needed someone to talk to.

I know it's not super relevant to the sub-reddit, but one of the girls I talked out of suicide last year just messaged me thanking me for being awake when she really needed someone to talk to.  "
Anyone wake up a little moist?,"I don‚Äôt want to say I was SOAKED but I was a little sweaty for some reason, and it wasn‚Äôt even warm in my room. My whole body felt wet. I have an appointment for a sleep doctor on April 4th to see if I have sleep apnea. Can apnea cause that? I honestly don‚Äôt know why it happens. "
Does anyone sleep through the whole day?,"I‚Äôve been having issues where I can‚Äôt sleep until 4am, wake up at 3pm. 
I power through the week, then lose control of my life and am stuck sleeping in bed most of my weekend. 
Have any of you experienced this? Is it because you were tired, crazy schedules etc? 
Trying to fix, but not sure if I need to fix my sleep times first or be more consistent on the amount of sleep. "
Does your insomnia come in waves?,"I work full time as a bartender with my shifts being 5hrs-9hrs and having 2 or 3 days off each week. I'll get one week up to sometimes 3 weeks that I can sleep fine or at least better. Still have to force myself to keep my eyes closes but eventually I drift off. Then I'll get a week or 2 where I get tired halfway through my shifts, but it wears off and I'm wide awake when I get home and can't sleep at all. Tried OTC sleep aids but they didn't help.

Does anyone else get these waves? Any tips or ideas to get better sleep? "
"Does anyone feel like they are at their ""best"" when they haven't slept in awhile?","I know this probably makes no sense, but lately I've felt like I had the most energy/was the most creative when I've been awake for at least 18 hours. 

It's very subtle but once I sort of ""notice"" in a sense that I'm feeling that type of way, I have an intense amount of energy and become very awake. It feels manic almost at times. Does anyone experience this from time to time? I work overnight 12 hour shifts and I only noticed this from being SO AWAKE after getting at it ALL NIGHT, instead of having that energy after a good night of sleep, I get it right before I need to lay back down for another night of sleep.

Also, in case anyone asks since it definitely sounds like I'm on drugs, all I ever do is smoke marijuana. I'd deem my use to be fairly heavy, but I go to work completely sober, so the two do not feel related to me. I also do not consume any caffeine while at work/any time I feel this way. 

"
Why is insomnia sometimes seen as a choice?,"Whenever reading about the effects of long-term sleep deprivation, there is sometimes an implication that insomnia is a conscious choice as a condition that we subject ourselves to. This particularly applies to (some) ""advice"" given in online discussion boards (ie: ""The body and brain need sleep. Your cognitive functions and general health will suffer."") Yes, this is an obvious consequence. However, this does not provide any viable solution to our problems. It's almost as if some people view sleep deprivation caused by insomnia as something akin to smoking, drug abuse, or obesity, in which the individual has considerable control over their condition. How can anyone willingly go through with this shit? What benefits could it possibly provide?

Hope that made sense. My brain feels almost completely fried."
Anyone else not even bother to try sleeping some nights?,My insomnia is to the point where  the best I can do is catch an hour or two per every 5 I try sleeping.... So with that being said I'm not always too thrilled to go to bed so some nights.. days like today I just say F\*\*\* it and occupy my time that I'd be awake anyways. The consequence is obviously the fatigue.. oh the fatigue and the irritability/whatnot but it's kind of like picking a battle. I just wanna know if there's anyone else to this level or someone who's been here because I'm at a loss.. but as far as I'm concerned I'm on short time anyways but I would like a better standard of living 
First time in almost a year I got total of 6.5 hours without drugs or food,"LONG ASS POST. PART 1

I can't believe it, really...

Wanna share my story, and then some HOW-TOs for you. 

**This is a long post...not for the person who isn't really looking for true help.** 

 ***Just for people who are real curious to find anything that could help.*** 

\----------------------------

It started with cold showers.

 I started taking cold showers in the morning and realized I'm pretty tired by the end of the day...but then last night I took ANOTHER cold shower 2 hours before bed...**and waited until 10 minutes AFTER the time I had laid down the night before (9:50).**

.

 **I can tell you..I was SO READY to get in bed.** ***I was almost panicking because of how tired I felt*****, and I was keeping myself from getting in bed.  Felt so good to have to FIGHT to keep myself from getting in bed.** 

.

 **That entire anticipation helped, I'm sure. Once the time hit, I bolted into bed, shut off the light, and was almost laughing because of how good it felt. In fact, I said to myself...""even if I don't fall asleep, it feels so fucking good to be in bed"".** 

.

And then...I **don't even remember falling asleep. At all. I've been having trouble falling asleep for almost a year**

.

I woke up once with slight panic, and then managed to put myself back to sleep really quickly (barely remember it)

.

Woke up one more time, same thing..

.

But then I woke up at 5:15 AM and instinctively HOPPED out of bed. 

**So from 10:00 or so all the way through 5:15 I had sleep, interrupted briefly two times. NOT BAD AT ALL**

.

Here's what I did in detail to get there...A lot of it incorporates CBTI-I which I started reading about the other day. Was surprised at how well it's helping. Other stuff, I came up with on my own

.

I. HOW I AM GETTING OVER THE FEAR OF LAYING DOWN AND TRYING TO SLEEP

1. Memory is powerful. So I had this idea the other day. What if I practiced that *moment* I am approaching the bed, get in the bed, lay down, and shut off the light? **What if I literally rehearsed it with my body and did everything I could to envision what it would be like to feel peaceful, calm, and ready to sleep? Sort of like acting. So I did. I first sat down on a chair, envisioned my bed in my mind, and pictured laying down. Feelings of dread, anxiety, etc. rose up even just imagining it. And then I pictured what it would be like to feel peace and calm about going to bed. How?** ***I recalled any of the times as a kid when I was just jump in bed and plop right to sleep without thinking about it. I asked myself questions like ""What if I saw my bed and approached my bed as a place of comfort, peace, and rest?""***
2. Next, I **literally rehearsed the action. I started at my bedroom door, approached my bed, flipped open the covers, got in bed and pretend to shut off the light, lay down my head and pass out**. I didn't lay down my head for more than 3 seconds or so...don't wanna train the body to not fall asleep, haha. **All the while, I focused on pretending I was calm and peaceful. I pictured that I had a LONG day and my bones were aching...and that my body was going to collapse as soon as I hit the bed.** 
3. Don't overdo this practice...DO NOT use this practice to *relieve* your anxiety..or else you'll start getting compulsive about it**. Limit your practice to rehearsing 3-5 times, with the sole intent of training your body and mind to** ***consider*** **a positive outcome about sleep. The goal isn't to feel better about your insomnia. It is to train yourself to approach sleeping with a different mindset.** 
4. This sounds weird, but another thing I'm doing throughout the day is approaching my bed, putting my hand on it, and saying out loud, ""This is for peaceful rest"". Sort of like a meditation of sorts. Re associating the bed with rest and peace
5. **I'm staying out of bed and not even touching it throughout the day (other than the occasional ""peace and rest"" mantra"") No laying down on it briefly. No sitting on it to put on my shoes. Nothing. Bed is the holy shrine for sleep and sex. Nothing more or less**. You'll be surprised how this mindset can make a difference over time.  
(See below for next part)"
Lack of sleep makes me more suicidal and depressed,"When I have a good sleep, I feel very well, no suicidal thoughts.

But when fatigue comes and cannot sleep, then I transform myself into a suicidal person. I become depressed, I don't care about nothing and no one, my memory and thinking is numb. And for what? I start to panic myself when I want to fall asleep. My brain is messed up.

If I didn't have this condition, probably I would sleep 7 hours continously like before. But now I have to wake up in the middle of the night, because my brain wants too, and then go back while I am sedated on Xanax and Zolpidem. Without medication, I am destroyed. And I have nights when I take medication and I can't fucking sleep. 

I am 22 and I want my sleep back."
I'm so sick of seeing the sun rise and i still haven't slept,"4:15 and i have to take my sister to school in 4 hours, then the next day i'm up at 6:15 for work. Fuck insomnia, no one deserves this shit."

Found a 21st century cure for insomnia... it's called Blade Runner 2049 and I have never felt so relaxed,"It's got some diurnal-ass background noise veritably vibrating your tense muscles into a restful state. Thank you, Blade Runner and sleep tight my good dudes "
The horrible feeling of 'waking up' in the morning when you haven't fallen asleep at all...,"That was me 5 minutes ago. I really don't know what's going on. I've had my thyroid tested and all that but I just feel so wide-awake at night. I take doxylamine, melatonin, valerian, and an antihistamine when it gets really bad. But I just lie there and I get this gnawing feeling inside of me (acid reflux) and my reflux pills don't do shit, but I'm maxed out. I was tossing and turning for 7 hours in bed, just wishing I could *pretend* to sleep and maybe cheat myself into sleeping, but I can't. I've tried waking up, midnight snack, hot drink, do something fun, weed, alcohol, exercise...nothing helps. 

I'm going back to the doc later but I doubt it will help. Yes, I use f.lux. Yes, I've tried meditation. Yes, I've seen a nutritionist and took magnesium and GABA. Yes, I've tried acupuncture. Yes, I've tried (insert sleepy herb here). In fact you can [see all my desperate posts to this subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/search?q=llosa&restrict_sr=on). I really wonder what the fuck is going on here. I just can't sleep. 

I started off like many of you. One night I slept at 2.30 am instead of 11. I thought that was bad (ha fucking ha). Then it was 3.30. Then it was 5.30. Then 6am sleep became common. Then I thought I had delayed sleep phase syndrome and tried to reset my circadian rhythm by staying up. It worked for awhile, then it came back. CBT didn't help me either - you just can't tell me at 7am, after I've been trying to sleep for hours, after I haven't had a full night's sleep all week, that I should focus on my happy place. I don't have a fucking happy place any more because I can't fucking sleep.

If anyone reading this has any idea what I'm missing out on, please let me know. At this point I'm willing to try everything. My happiest memory was going into surgery and being anaesthetised. As I started going under, I thought: Why can't I fall asleep like this? 

I don't have any 'pressure' that makes me need to get up early. In fact, I don't even mind sleeping late. The problem is, **I can't sleep at all.**"
"Does anyone else here have sensitive skin? Dry, itchy, sensitive to touch ect. Or just physically sensitive in general?","I feel uncomfortable like all the time. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs strictly because of lack of sleep or not, however I do feel a lot more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù the next day when I do rest well...which is unfortunately very rare.

Overall I feel dehydrated (even though I drink plenty of cold water every day), dry mouth, dry skin, itchy, tingling, sensitive to any kind of touch. I suspect caffeine may be partly responsible for this because apparently it‚Äôs dehydrating. But then again I‚Äôve heard people say it‚Äôs not really that dehydrating at all. Then I‚Äôve thought maybe it‚Äôs my salt intake, but then I‚Äôve heard salt actually prevents you being dehydrated.

So frustrating trying to work this all out with conflicting advice. Ugh."
Not letting last night insomnia ruin the day,"I had a pretty good streak before last night of six hours a night which is a win for many of us. It‚Äôs totally my fault for drinking coffee and milk tea after getting comfy. But you know what? I‚Äôm bouncing back today and eating healthy, chamomile tea and no sugars today and just doing my best at work. I was diagnosed with sleep apnea recently and though I‚Äôm pretty good about working  out I am above my BMI so I‚Äôm gonna work it all today. Battling on all fronts cause the war is not over.

Does insomnia make you suicidal?,"Every day after I don't sleep I just desperately want to die.  Going about the motions of being alive is so fucking terrible. And every time I seek help from a doctor they dismiss me like its no big deal and i get suggestions about sleep hygiene. I fucking  spend 2 hours a night winding down and my life is entirely ruled by promoting tiredness. 

People fucking suggesting shit to me like they know better about insomnia.  Bitch I hope you get sliced in to little pieces from the bottom up and fed to yourself.  I fucking hate people.  And I don't want to live. 

But I don't feel like this when I've slept.  Does this happen to you too?"

3 years chronic insomnia I slept last night?,"Ok guys back story had a mental breakdown October 2015, did not sleep more than an hour a night for 10 days, ended up with psychosis. Constant anxiety and ptsd for 3 years waking up every hour sweating etc. Then last night something happened! I slept 6 hours and woke up once? 

The first time I have slept the night and either not woke up or woke up very little in 3 years. 

Is this maybe just a flook or is this maybe the start of recovery? "
How can I stop getting stressed before bed?,"For the past couple of months, I have had this terrible sleeping problem. It started when I missed one night of sleep, and got worse from there. The problem is that late at night, I get stressed out from the fear that I won't sleep, and ironically, that ultimately causes me to not sleep. I've tried everything to calm myself down to the point of where I'm taking prescription medication and nothing works. If I try to distract myself or meditate, I just get more stressed because it the back of my head, I know I'm just doing it to calm myself. I need a solution because it's happening almost every night now."
Does anyone here not even feel sleepy?,"Before my insomnia started about a month ago, if I got anything less than 7 hours of sleep, the next day I would be yawning all day, feel sleepy and wanted to take naps at every opportunity.

&#x200B;

Now, after experiencing insomnia for the first time in my life, I've been operating on about 3h of solid sleep a night on average and I don't even yawn anymore the next day. Naps don't even cross my mind. I just go about my day feeling slightly dizzy and out of sorts. Not sure how long I can operate like this before something bad happens but isn't it weird? It's like your brain doesn't know what sleep is anymore."
"Personal list of what‚Äôs worked and what I‚Äôve tried, hope it helps someone find their own insomnia tool kit.","I should clarify, I have the type of insomnia that keeps you from staying asleep. I fall asleep quickly 95% of the time, but I‚Äôve struggled for yeeeears with tossing and turning all night, Body discomfort, racing mind, waking up between 1-3am every night, etc. I am also female and have noticed my insomnia cycles with my menstruation cycle. It gets worse around ovulation and menstruation, every month. Fucking yay. Ladies, track your period cycle and your insomnia and see if they correlate too.

Here‚Äôs what I have tried and learned. 

Racing mind and general sense of unsettledness or unease has been a long term struggle and the most deeply effecting.  I have tried weekly counseling/therapy, journaling, meditation, self talk, and self awareness practices. Honestly, this is the hardest and most powerful aspect for me. It‚Äôs taken years. It has helped. I‚Äôm still working on it.  What I have learned is that I didn‚Äôt know myself and wasn‚Äôt comfortable in my own skin or mind. Learning who I am, thought work, and honesty have helped me address the unease and racing mind. Things that helped most: journaling and counseling, the Unfck Your Brain podcast about managing your mind, and numerous books on these topics.  Also really supportive family and partner. Meditation has also been beneficial. If I find I am waking up from repeating thoughts, I use self talk in the form of ‚Äúokay, you‚Äôre concerned about XYZ and that‚Äôs important, thank you for bringing it up. But how is not the time to work that out. We will address this tomorrow, right now we will sleep.‚Äù Sometimes that helps.  I am a generally less sensitive and ruminating person now, and that has helped with the anxious thoughts. 
Medication and a good doctor. I finally have a doc I trust and like, and she‚Äôs tested me for so much more than any other doc I‚Äôve told I have insomnia to. Tests showed I was severely deficient in vitamin D, B, thyroid hormone, and testosterone. All of these have an effect on fatigue, body aches, and insomnia. I had never been tested for any of these previously, nor did I know they were linked to insomnia. I‚Äôm now on a thyroid med, Wellbutrin (for anxiety), and take Vitamin A/D/K, B complex, iodine (I don‚Äôt eat iodized salt or other iodine rich foods), high potency turmeric (for carpal tunnel inflammation, also a contributing factor to low quality sleep), and omegas (also for decreasing inflammation).  I also have temazapam as an Rx sleep aid, as needed. I try to take it only when it‚Äôs been multiple nights without sleep, which is 1-4 times a month usually. The thyroid meds helped IMMENSELY with fatigue during the day and with the body aches. I noticed better sleep with all of these, moreso with the thyroid and Wellbutrin, and getting the carpal tunnel under control, than with the supplements.  Before the turmeric supplement I would wear wrist braces at night to keep my hands from going numb and waking me up. Those helped somewhat.
Cooler room temp, stand up fan, and Chilipad mattress topper for temperature control. Our bedroom stays 3+ degrees warmer than the rest of the house because of shitty duct planning and a too small AC unit for square footage, and central Texas hell-inspired summer temps keep our AC unit at max capacity just to stay under 78 degrees some days. I sleep best at 68 degrees and below. 68 being my absolute max in order to not wake up sweating in the night. That‚Äôs impossible during the summer in our house. The Chilipad is the only thing I‚Äôve found that helps me stay cool through the night, and it was hella expensive for a mattress topper. But goddammit it HAS helped. 
A new mattress. We went with Tuft and Needle memory foam type mattress and it made a huge difference in physical comfort. I wake up less from body discomfort in the middle of the night. I also wake up with little or no soreness, very solid improvement. Thyroid med and mattress combined for a really noticeable improvement here.
Being okay with waking up at 3am every night.  I used to get so frustrated and angry when I couldn‚Äôt sleep through the night. Now I am at ease with the fact that I will almost always wake up around 3am. And that‚Äôs okay. I wake up, I go for a potty break, come back to bed. No more frustration. That‚Äôs just my cycle now. I don‚Äôt ruminate on it anymore. If I have multiple wake ups during a night, I try to be calm about it, go out to the couch and read a Dr Seuss book or sit and pet my dogs for a few minutes, then go back to bed. Occasionally changing where I‚Äôm sleeping has helped. If I keep waking while in my bed, I‚Äôll go sleep on the couch or guest room for a couple hours if I can, sometimes coming back to my bed after an hour or two. Don‚Äôt know why, but changing the sleeping surface has helped some nights.
A hot epsom salt bath, or contrast hot and cold water submersion in the evening.  I am lucky to work in a facility with athletic water submersion tanks so I can do contrast therapy occasionally. A hot salt bath sometimes helps too.

Things that I‚Äôve tried and didn‚Äôt work: 
Melatonin. Fell asleep harder but woke up even more awake throughout the night. Hated it.
Magnesium powder supplement. Didn‚Äôt notice an effect.
Bed time teas. Didn‚Äôt notice an effect, still drink tea at night though cause I like tea and the bed time ritual.
Acupuncture. Could only afford a few times a month consistently, didn‚Äôt notice a difference in sleep but it helped with other things that are unrelated.
Fan. No difference.
Reading fictional/light stories before bed/no screens. No difference, or it effected what my dreams were. 
Eye mask/ear plugs. Mild positive influence.
Apple cider vinegar and raw honey drink before bed. Maybe mild positive influence. Haven‚Äôt done it consistently long term to be sure.
Wrist braces. Occasional positive influence.
Herbal tinctures for sleep and anxiety. Mild positive influence or no effect. Varied, and haven‚Äôt used them in 1-2 years since being on Rx meds. 
Red wine. This shit wrecks my sleep if I drink it anytime even close to sleepy time. Liquor has little or no effect but red wine before bed is asking for a sleepless night. 

Well, there you have it. My personal exploration of anti-insomnia approaches. It‚Äôs been a long and exhausting road, and I still cycle through tough bouts of insomnia that leave me irritable, exhausted, and unable to cope with waking life some mornings. But I am far better off that where I was years ago, and my post-insomnia meltdowns are far fewer, with less anxiety and more pleasant mornings than not.   Hope something here helps or gives someone a new approach to try.

[UPDATE] I went to a sleep study a couple months ago. And got my results today. I have Periodic limb movement disorder,"FINALLY SOMEONE FIGURED IT THE FUCK OUT. 


My sleeping has been degrading over the last couple years and has gotten to a point where I‚Äôd only get maybe 2-4 hours of sleep. I‚Äôd wake up almost every hour on the hour. I started falling asleep while driving, falling a sleep at work. It is a disaster.


I live in a huge town that houses one of the best hospitals in the country, so just about every building in my city is either a lab, or a doctors office etc. It‚Äôs a gift and a curse because i have so many doctors available to me, but a curse because either they charged too much or they didn‚Äôt accept my state insurance. I finally found a doctor but he was so booked i could only schedule an appointment every 3 months. So I just buckled down and waited. I took the sleep study 3 months ago and am just getting the results back TODAY. 


Apparently PLMD, stems from lack of iron, which makes sense because i‚Äôve been anemic nearly all my life. 

However, he still needed to confirm this through blood work so i‚Äôm waiting for his call next week. If he‚Äôs correct which i think he is, he‚Äôs going to prescribe iron pills, and if that doesn‚Äôt work, he‚Äôs going to start another line of pills who‚Äôs dosage would increase every week until I was comfortable. 



It‚Äôs the first glimmer of home i‚Äôve had in years that I could actually fix this problem. "
I stayed awake all night with sleeping pills only to accidentally fall asleep on the couch after drinking coffee,"I took sleeping pills and then laid in bed awake all night. I gave up at 5 and went to watch netflix. I took my Adhd meds and had coffee (which I very rarely drink as it makes me antsy with my Adhd meds) around 8 to wake me up and protect the semblance of a natural sleep cycle I had left. At 10:30 after being exposed to plenty of stimulants and sunlight I laid back on a loveseat and rested my eyes (note: I'm like 6'. This was not comfortable) and next thing I knew it was 1 pm and my boyfriend was coming in the door from work


I give up Lmao. I can't fall asleep in a bed at night with sleeping pills but I can accidentally drift off on a tiny loveseat during the day after coffee?? "
I used to wake up several times per night. One meal changed it.,"This totally sounds like ""one weird trick as discovered..."" but bear with me.

I've been having lot of stress because of work lately, and this combined with having to take methylphenidate for my ADHD seems to have disrupted my sleep cycle. I hadn't had a solid good night's sleep (where I have slept undisturbed from start to finish) for about 3 months.

Until about a week ago.

I discovered this by accident - I was fooling around in the kitchen because I craved for something sweet before bed. I took a ripe banana, sliced it open, stuck bits of 70% chocolate inside of it and microwaved it until soft inside. I had some leftover whipped cream, so I put few tablespoons on top. Decadent and delicious, just like me (hah).

Went to bed... and then, black. Next thing I notice it's morning and I've slept 9 hrs. Without waking up a single time. NINE FUCKING HOURS. I've been happy to get about six hours previously, with about 2-3 short wakeful periods in between. 

I went reading about it and turns out all three - banana, dark chocolate and fatty dairy - contain tryptophan, which is an amino acid that is precursor to both serotonin and melatonin. Exposure to blue light makes the difference which it will convert to - take tryptophan during night (or warm lighting), it'll turn to melatonin.

I went shopping and bought more ingredients, and repeated this every evening. Same results - long, interrupted sleep, finally waking up feeling refreshed. Not the most weight-loss friendly meal but oh well, I'm ready to consume some extra calories for good sleep.

Could be related to blood sugar issues. Not sure. This works for me - hopefully it will help someone else, too.

"
I slept for 15 hours yesterday.,"I'm not sure if this will help anyone else but I just had an amazingly restful sleep last night so It worked for me. Before I went to bed I took two supplements that were pretty inexpensive : 5-HTP and GABA.

Don't know what's in 'em or how they work but I can vouch for their effectiveness. Good luck everyone!"
"""Fuck It"" :My sleep recipe (I'm a pro)","I told a insomniac friend about my method and it worked for him. Thought I would share here. 


So I usually fall asleep within a minute or 2 of hitting the pillow. My last gf would get so mad bc she would lie awake for an hour or so listening to me snore. Could be partly chemical, but my approach is:""Ahhh Fuck It"". Fuck everything about everything. All worries, fuck them. Fuck if I even fall asleep or not. If i don't, I'm just gonna lay comfortably here and not give a shit about anything. Doesn't matter if you fall asleep or not. Just focus on being restful and not giving a fuck. If you fall asleep fine. If not, that's fine too. 

Sleep is about giving up. Fuck it. Exhale and say ""fuck it""

Goodnight"
I love when I read these and I know I won't be sleeping for the next 8 hours.,
Anyone else ever have insomnia the night before a doctors appointment and it screws up your blood pressure readings.,"Yeah, thats the freaking worst."
I sleep sooo much better when I go to bed with an empty gut,"This may not apply to everyone as I have IBS, but if I go to the toilet before bed and empty my bowel I sleep a whole lot better. I‚Äôm talking deep sleep, waking up refreshed and being able to sleep in if I want.

Unfortunately it‚Äôs really hard to get this to happen reliably. I have both constipation and loose stools but generally I‚Äôm constipated after dinner and for the rest of the night, and even when I do use the toilet there‚Äôs no guarantee I‚Äôll get everything out.

Magnesium citrate has worked very well before to get things moving, but also gives me horrible smelly gas, and sometimes makes my tummy feel uncomfortable.

Coffee helps move things along but of course the caffeine is counter-productive to sleep.

What has worked very well sometimes is eating a good amount of salad with dinner. All that fiber makes me poop a lot very soon afterwards. I‚Äôll feel completely emptied out (sometimes) and sleep like a champ. But fiber can be quite harsh as it goes through my digestive tract, so it‚Äôs not ideal.

I‚Äôve always found that having a full gut before bed makes me feel hot, uncomfortable and restless. I‚Äôll sleep like shit. With an empty gut I do not feel hot, uncomfortable and restless.

I‚Äôm just wondering if anyone else has noticed this, IBS or not?"

I now find it hard to walk properly and have recently had random shaky legs. I've started losing memory and don't even remember if I slept or not cause I never get out of bed refreshed.

"If you have time in the morning, here's something that works for me.","Despite the gym and heavy ass workouts, my sleep has been slipping a little lately. Went back to what helped me in the past - 10 km walks in the morning. 5k one way, 5k back. I may have the shittiest headache in the morning, but these walks make me right. When I have particularly insane stress levels, such as now, I won't sleep if I don't do it. And it resets and uses up energy early in the morning, so when you get it done before 9am,you'll be plenty ready for bed in 13 hours. It sucks that I need that, 10k takes me bloody 1,5 hours. But hey, I still have 12 hrs for myself. Gym alone is not enough, and sometimes deadlifts way wire me up. Not a silver bullet, but definitely have this in your arsenal. I don't know if less than exactly 10k would work, its probably down to your fitness level as well! "

A few tips how to beat insomnia,"I suffered from insomnia before but I overcame it and there is some things I learned that might help you.

Don't try to sleep - that's not how sleep works. It just happens naturally when you are relaxed and you really don't have to do anything, it happens automatically. When most people go to bed they don't think about sleep at all and that's something I had to learn to do, not focusing on it. Easier said than done but that's the solution in my opinion. Anxiety over sleep is the most common cause of insomnia. What I usually do when I go to bed is to just think about interesting things like what happened during the day. You don't even remeber the moment you fall asleep. The key is to relax and avoid creating tension over sleep. You can for example tell yourself that you don't have to sleep etc to release tension. That's one of the reasons it's easier to sleep during the day beacuse there is no expectations. Anyways I hope this helps maybe a little bit. Sleeping in a cold room is also good at least for me. "
Can days without sleep cause you to act like you are on drugs?,"My mum does sometimes does deal with sleep issues but it's almost as if she just doesn't want to sleep, because even though she keeps falling asleep it's like she's trying to keep herself awake. Anyway, it's like she is on drugs. She's groggy throughout the day (obviously because of the lack of sleep) but she acts like a completely different person too. Last night she was polishing a doll box, (I'm not too sure why, but she seems to clean more when she's sleep deprived too), so I quickly warned her not to do that because it could damage it, and she got really angry at me and started saying I was picking on her even though I was just trying to help but an argument started anyway. Even when I tell her that she's needing to get to sleep when I see her awake, she gets really angry also and says again that I'm picking on her. It's really stressful because I feel like she wants to stay awake since she's doing things that's keeping her awake when she's about to fall asleep."
"I notice when I'm falling asleep, and the noticing wakes me up. [Update, Solved]","A few days ago (Thursday) I posted this after a week of insomnia: https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/8y9vcj/i_notice_when_im_falling_asleep_and_the_noticing/

After one more terrible night (Thursday night) I've had two good nights of sleep in a row (Friday & Saturday night) so I think I've solved the problem. Here's what worked for me:

1. I went to bed late (1 AM) on Thursday night and set my alarm early (6:30 AM) Friday morning. Thursday was another insomnia night and Friday I was a sleep-deprived mess, but this built up a lot of sleepiness for Friday night which helped me re-boot my routine. I went to bed at my usual 10:30 PM Friday night.

6. I cranked the AC and ran a dehumidifyer all day to make the bedroom cold and dry (well, less humid). I pineapple'd my long hair before bed to get it off my neck. (Sleeping with long hair down is like sleeping with a scarf on.) I also continued my regular usual sleep-hygeine stuff like white noise, pitch-black bedroom, etc.

3. I listened to Jon Kabat-Zinn's guided meditation to distract myself so I wouldn't notice the sensation of falling asleep. His voice is so mellow and soft that it didn't wake me up during that fragile falling-asleep phase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4gZgnCy5ew  I've used this both nights and it's been working really well -- I'm falling asleep within 10 minutes like I used to. I think this has been the biggest help.

5. I went back to my old routine. During Insomnia Week I changed my routine: in the name of sleep hygiene I stopped having my usual one drink with dinner and stopped watching a re-run of old TV before bed. I started doing those things again.

Thanks everyone for the advice and thanks to the mods for this subreddit. There's so much great information here that helped me figure out the above steps. I hope I help you too.

*Sweet Dreams*!"
"Spend an hour doing this, it might work for you.","During a particularly bad bout of insomnia recently, I sat down and did some journalling because it was the only thing I could do with my mind to shut it up. So I wrote down all my feelings about sleep (as well as all the other things bothering me), and gradually I discovered that I kind of hated sleep and had come to think of it as a battle, and as something that brought me huge amounts of stress. I thought back to my pre-insomnia days (literally years ago), and remembered how sleep used to be something I enjoyed giving to myself. 

Then I spent about an hour writing down all the good beliefs I wanted to have about sleep instead. I recently studied this for a book I'm ghostwriting, so I knew that every statement had to be in the present tense, positive, and as though it was already a reality. I realised I needed to think of sleep in the same way as food - absolutely necessary, yet also something you give to yourself, and let yourself enjoy.

Long story short, I have been able to get back to sleep for three days in a row now which, for me, is HUGE achievement. I don't know if it will last, but it has certainly been a welcome relief. "
Anyone else‚Äôs mind race at night?,"I feel like I wake up 2 to 3 times every night with racing thoughts of just random things, or unconsciously start talking to myself and it keeps me up longer than I want to be. Anyone else have this problem?"
"The more important it is that I get enough sleep, the harder it is for me to sleep","On nights where I have nothing special to do the next day and can get up as late as I want, I typically don't have trouble falling asleep. Even if I go to bed early. But when I have to get up early, I cannot fall asleep! Doesn't matter when I go to bed. Before jury duty I had to wake up at 7 am and this stressed me out so much that I got literally one hour of sleep. Anyone else? It doesn't help to tell myself to stop thinking about the next day...the longer I lie there sleepless, the less I can think about anything else than how tired I will be the next day. "
"This sleep routine has saved me many nights, please give it a shot.","I am 28 years old I have been suffering from chronic insomnia for the past four years or so. I used to sleep like log, but changes in my mental health fucked me up and overtime I lost my ability to sleep properly. I have major problems falling asleep and staying asleep. It is still normal for me to stay up a whole night or wake up 10 times a night.

As it is with many cases of insomnia I developed anxiety about sleep and the simple act of going to bed elevates my heartrate. Trust me I have tried many medications and life changes: meditation, elimanating blue light, diet changes, melatonin, serequel, ambien, valerian, benzos, I excersise regularly, sleep hygiene, yoga etc..

I have been working with psychiatrists and doctors. I have been very active in trying to find a solution that works for me.

Right now I have discovered the most consistent help for me has come from a simple combination: Writing a daily journal, listening to audiobooks, using medication only in emergency, and immediately getting the fuck out of bed when I cant sleep.

Let me break down these four things:

Audiobooks, Listening to audiobooks in bed is so much more superior than reading, because you wont be falling a sleep if the lights are on. Find yourself an audiobook that is interesting enough to keep you following the story BUT just boring enough that it wont get you excited. I suffer from racing thoughts caused by my general anxiety and anxiety about sleep, audiobooks help me focus on something completely and I have miracolously fallen asleep many times while listening to them. But I must stress again that dont get a book that is too exciting as this wont help you, it will only make the situation worse.

Writing a daily journal: Write down all your successes and failures about sleeping. I cant tell you how many times I have been on the verge of panic at 4am and reading my journal has really calmed me down. I have many entries where I have written ""Cant sleep on the verge of mental breakdown"" only to go the next page and see ""Slept five hours, all is relatively well"". Thats why writing a sleep journal is important, because it helps you keep things in the right perspective when you are feeling desperate.

Getting out of bed: All of us insomniacs know that feeling, you are in bed and you just know that this is going to be one of those nights. I personally notice this by how my thought patterns start getting fucked up and I cant focus my thoughts on anything anymore. GET OUT OF BED! Go to a completely different room, dont lie down just sit on the sofa or something. Do not start playing your favourite computer game because this will just add more fuel to the fire. Just listen to your audiobook, read or write.
I am not lying when I say that I barely have a single night when I dont get out of bed for a while, this helps so much. I usually go to bed at around 10 or 11pm listen to my audiobook for 10-20minutes and get out of bed for 10 minutes and then go back. Repeat until I fall asleep.

Medication is important, but as we all know they should be used very conservatively to avoid dependency. Right now I will pop an ambien maybe 1-3 times a month. Ambien works best for me, but everyone is different, talk to your doctor and get a prescription for something that works for you. The simple fact of having them around will help you calm down since you know that you will always have a backup.

Also like all sleep hygiene guides tell you: Do NOT use the bed for anything else but sleep and sex."
"Remember when you're so fucking tired that your brain is spontaneously shutting down and you can't sleep? Yeah, fuck that.",
I got 5 and 1/2 hours of sleep last night! Success!,"I took one melatonin tab, used my computer for only 15 minutes, and fell asleep. It took a while, and I woke up at about 5:00 am next morning, but it worked! I finally feel half-refreshed!"
"I slept normally last night. It may not sound like a big deal, but it was.","I slept normally last night. It may not sound like a big deal, but it was. I went for a long walk sometime around 4AM last night. I don‚Äôt know how long I walked. An hour maybe. When I got home, I wrote a little bit and spent some time on my computer. I think I watched a game of LoL. Then I went to the couch. I realized I was tired. So I turned off all the lights, went to bed, and relatively quickly‚Ä¶.I went to sleep. It might have been 6AM, I don't know. 

And I woke up at 11AM, and here I am, at 1130, ready to face the day.

I remember when I used to work overnights, I needed a 24 hour clock because I couldn‚Äôt tell the difference between 8AM and 8PM from a light perspective in the summer, and waking up and not knowing by the time whether it was day or not was alarming, and never stopped being alarming. Not knowing if I had slept intensely for half an hour, and would have plenty of energy for a full day, or whether I had slept intensely for 12, and would need to rush to work - to wake up, check a clock, and just not know - was so disorienting the first couple of times it happened that I just set my clock to 24 hours and kept it that way. When people would ask me why I set my clock like that, I‚Äôd just tell them the truth.

Looking back, Anton used to do that. Looking back, he used to treat time as I do now. As less than a suggestion. As something that was only relevant in the sense that you knew the world would judge you for not allowing time to treat you the way it treated them. To acknowledge how weird and abnormal it is to allow sunrise to be the reminder that you need to go to bed, and not sunset, or 11PM, or 12AM, or 1AM, like a normal person. Finally passing out at 1PM will never not feel like the act of an insane person. 

But last night, I finally slept like a normal person. Maybe I am becoming one."
Insomnia bc of depression and not wanting to wake up in the morning?,"I have never been very good at going to sleep at night (there are many stories of me as a child bugging my parents in the early hours of the morning because I couldn't sleep), but the past few years it has gotten really bad. I always take some sort of sleep aid, but lately I've been noticing a shift in my thinking that is related to my depression: I fear falling asleep because that means I'll have to deal with the pain of waking up. 

Waking up every morning and just living everyday has been getting harder and harder to manage, and I notice myself not wanting to sleep at night now because well... if I don't sleep then I don't have to wake up. I'll already have done that from the day before, so it is one less struggle. Even though I know sleep makes things much easier to do, my mind still falls into this pattern. 

This is a relatively new realization for me - do any other insomniacs with depression relate? Do you have any advice for getting back to wanting to sleep? Even if I'm unable to actually do it - at least having the desire may help. "
"I have finally been able to sleep for a full week without interruption, however every time I sleep I wake up more tired then when I last slept.","So, after a long while of suffering from shitty sleep and waking up throughout the night, I have finally gotten it under control for a bit, and actually slept for 12 hours straight the other day. If you want to know what helped me, I started going on walks before bed, stopped keeping my brain so active 3 hours before bed (where that were possible), stopped mindlessly browsing the internet, and listened to [Ethoslab's early mineraft lets plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHngf-CKCzk&list=PL1523184A958895EF) who has a voice more relaxing and soothing than Bob Ross himself. He's a great entertainer as well. Edit: should also mention that this took a while to work, but the routine is what helped the most. Sleeping in a different bed also helped because I believe I started associating my overthinking with my other bed. Double Edit: Taking vitamin d in the morning was also a big help.

However, I've run into another problem, which is that I feel miserably tired in the morning, every single morning, and this only goes away to a certain extent throughout the day. I'll kind of feel like I'm in a constant dream-like state, and when I want something, say a laptop that is right in front of me, I will find myself staring at it for a couple seconds before actually grabbing it. Or sometimes I'll just be wandering around aimlessly, not knowing where to go or what to do, however I still function just enough despite this to live a semi-normal life with my mothers help.

I also get that feeling you get when you're in a dream where you feel that you want to run or hit something, but can't because you're too weak. I will feel this constantly.

Perhaps the most weird thing, is that I caught myself half asleep one night, moving my arm around, and grabbed a cup of water that was on my night stand and knocked it over on to me. I only fully ""woke"" up when the cold water reached me and I sat there in bewonderment at what the hell just happened. I've had memories of me thinking incoherent things to myself throughout the night too and will mix up my dreams with reality.

I had a sleep study done six months ago and was told I had no condition, so I honestly don't know what could be causing this, although I didn't have these symptoms then. I actually felt better when I wasn't able to sleep than I do right now, not that that makes it okay to not sleep, but it is very worrying.

If anybody has any ideas, I would be happy to hear them or if you know of any other subs I could post in for help I'd appreciate it."
Anyone else hungry all the time?,"I can eat and be hungry again within a couple of hours even if I make sure to eat plenty of protein and fat. I don‚Äôt know whether it has to do more with lack of sleep or my IBS. Maybe both. Sometimes after eating I feel hungry again immediately. 

I think I‚Äôm also eating out of boredom sometimes from having to be awake for so long.

This is a big contrast to how I used to be when I‚Äôd sleep in until the afternoon if I wanted to. I was much skinnier back then too. Now I‚Äôm overeating all the time and overweight.

The frustrating thing is overeating also makes it harder for me to sleep, so it‚Äôs kind of a cycle. I don‚Äôt know how to control my appetite though, I can‚Äôt just sleep in and skip breakfast. Trying to ignore the hunger is just about impossible."
It's so frustrating that there is no clear cause for true insomnia,"I have never heard a satisfying explanation for why some people have insomnia and others don't.  Sometimes I have thoughts while lying in bed, but other times I'm totally in a state of meditation yet completely awake and unable to sleep, so how could racing thoughts be the cause?   I also have seen a psychologist and I do not have an anxiety disorder or depression, although I do have anxiety and depression at mild levels.

I kind of relate to this article.  When I had my sleep study, I remember thinking I was awake for much longer than they said I was according to their measurements.  Perhaps this, combined with an obsession and anxiety around sleep itself is what causes insomnia for some people?  Of course, delayed sleep phase could be another cause...or contributing factor, but for me I can still have trouble sleeping no matter how late I stay up.

Success: Finally sleeping after help from genetic testing,"I'm not a regular member of this community, but I wanted to catalogue my insomnia recovery for others who may find it helpful.

I carry ADORA2A (T:T). This is not a very uncommon genetic variation, but it has been correlated with caffeine sensitivity causing insomnia, anxiety, and panic attacks. What they have found is that individuals with the gene variation who use caffiene (even as little as a cup of coffee a day) have issues processing emotional stimuli resulting in high anxiety. They have also found that caffiene aslo induces insomnia. 

The caffiene acts as an amplifier, which is why it took so long for me to figure out what was going on. Some nights I slept fine, but if something was stressing me I couldn't sleep. I would wake up at 2 am heart racing and I couldn't get it to stop. I thought I was just anxious because our new baby was waking us up crying in the middle of the night, but why could my wife fall right back to sleep and I couldn't? Even on nights she didn't wake us up I was imagining heariwasher cry. 

I also only started using caffeine regularly since having kids.

Well I did my genetic testing through 23andMe and found research on ADORA2A and thought I would give quiting caffiene a try - all though I thought it was a little ridiculous a cup of coffee at 9 am would wake me up with panic attacks 15 hrs later. Well I have been cold turkey for almost a week and I have slept every single night - even if the baby cries or something goes wrong at work.

It has been a little rough coming off caffiene, but after about 3 days my headache was gone. 

It's wonderful laying down at night and getting rest. I woke up the other day and I was actually awake... insane.

At least a third of population carries T:T variation of ADORA2A. So if my symptoms sound similiar to yours, try quiting caffiene for a couple weeks and see if things approve.

Is anyone else here depressed?,I feel like me just thinking about how much I hate myself all night maybe isn't helping my sleep schedule a whole lot
I've reached a point where everything becomes hilarious. ,I nearly lost it over the name Bryan. I don't even know right now. Random giggles keep surprising me. 
Stupid Snow Moon,Does anyone else have even more trouble sleeping than usual during a full moon? I usually feel it the day of plus the day before and the day after. 
Has anyone elses body developed a sort of..shut down function after a sleepless night?,"I've been an insomniac since about the 5th grade ish? So maybe 11/12 I forget how old 5th grade is (Just turned 17) and over the last year it seems like my body has sort of developed a conk out funtion after I don't sleep. It's one of two things: either I get comfy and pass out randomly (only if I haven't sleep at least two days), or more commonly I'll start getting sick. My head will start to hurt, and progress into being unable to be around light, and start feeling feverish and ill before getting the urge to lay on the cold floor. I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this?"

Am i even falling asleep?,"I've always had trouble with sleep, but its usually oversleeping/staying up all night on my phone. 
3 days ago i started having weird experiences, i would close my eyes, relax and let my thoughts go wherever they want and it feels like im about to fall asleep, but then after a while i would realize ""wait ive been doing this for a while now why am i not asleep?"" i would open my eyes, check the time and realize 1-2 hours have passed. 

That absolutely shocks me. I usually have trouble recalling the thing i was thinking about right before i got up (which hints that i wasn't completely awake) but i feel like i was in some kind of pre-sleep trance state with my eyes closed and no sense of time. Then i would repeat this as many times as i can hoping i would feel rested tomorrow, sometimes i can even recall a dream (which confirms that im getting sleep) but either way i always wake up every 1-2.5 hours. 

Ive experienced this before about a year ago, it lasted about 2 weeks and it seemed to be caused stress and anxiety. 

Is this what insomnia feels like? What can i do?"
3 hours Max of sleep and I have a long day of work,"I don't know why but I just couldn't sleep, I kept getting up multiple times, my stomach does a strange noise and then I go back to sleep for like... 30 mins max and repeat....Woke up at around 4.30 and spend all morning watching better call saul whilst playing a card game on the side before heading to work. I FEEL LIKE SHIT. I took two coffees already but even so my body doesn't feel as tired (thanks to the coffee) my eyes just hurt to keep open. 8 Hours of this.. KMN"
7:16 am,It‚Äôs 7:16 am and I still can‚Äôt sleep.
When you finally get to sleep and somebody wakes you up,"So I finally passed out last night and my partner hit my foot with his arm slightly, which brought me out of my sleep like 2 hours later. UGH. It is extremely difficult to have insomnia and have someone who just DOESN'T GET IT on top of that. So frustrating."
"I'm honestly sick of the anxiety, I just want proper sleep","Right now I'm feeling exhausted. Tried to stay up late to fix my sleep schedule, I go to bed super exhausted afraid that since I stayed up so late I'll not be able to sleep as easy, and whatdo you know, 3 hours later I wake up still as exhausted and super nervous for no good reason. I'm afraid this whole gt 4-6 hours of sleep is going to continue for another month and I dont want that at all, I just want to be able to sleep well like the old days. No worrying ever damned time I go to sleep. I wish i could find a way to fully convince myself that everything will be okay and to just stop worrying and sleep, so I don't keep either waking up early or getting none at all. If possible I'd like to stay off meds, I don't wanna form a dependency on them."
Last night slept well with new tricks,"Last night I slept so well that I almost said hallelujah when I woke up. I have been reading a book and the author is a Harvard researcher and has very useful insights. Now I using sleep restriction, relaxation response, light therapy and using blue light blocking glasses a few hours before I sleep. I hope my experience may help my fellow insomniacs.  I have also stopped using Ambien for a few weeks now."
Tip that made bedtime less stressful for me: hope it helps you!,"I have a huge issue with falling asleep and staying asleep, typically getting about 3 hours a night if I‚Äôm lucky. I get very anxious about not being able to sleep which in turn, keeps me awake. 

However, I recently discovered something that has lessened my sleep anxiety! My boyfriend and I now call it ‚Äútime for relaxing.‚Äù The other day when I was freaking out about not sleeping he told me, ‚Äúyou know, we never get time to just do nothing. So if you don‚Äôt fall asleep, who cares. Just enjoy your hours to lay there, do nothing absolutely nothing, and relax.

Saying and hearing ‚Äúhave a good time relaxing!‚Äù Instead of ‚Äúgood night, hope you sleep well!‚Äù has helped lessened my sleep anxiety immensely. It hasn‚Äôt drastically altered my sleep patterns yet, but I‚Äôm still hoping to see improvements. I highly recommend calling it relaxing time instead of sleeping time therefore your body doesn‚Äôt stress about the need for sleep.

I‚Äôm not sure if this will work for you, but thought I‚Äôd share :) Hope you all have a good time relaxing tonight!"
im so tired of the ridicule,if I could fucking sleep I would!! Why does my family think I'm doing this on purpose??
Only solution,
I want to throw up when I don't sleep,"I'm not sure if this is the right place to post this but it's a start. 

So, I dont believe I have insomnia. I have a couple bad nights for no reason , but they're not constant enough to be considered something. However, I will occasionally have clusters of bad nights that cause me to because heavily nauseated in the morning.

As a description of the ""nauseated"" feeling I get, I feel a lump in my throat, like a trapped gas. I'll be constantly feeling like I'm about to throw up, to no avail. I'll tend to burp up stomach acid. If I end up throwing up, it'll be a mucus, not actual stomach acid, due to it not burning up my throat. Then my airways close up and I almost suffocate but that isn't special to this scenario. 

Is this a thing that commonly happens? I haven't met anyone or read anything that described this. If it isn't a specific thing, is there anything I can do to not end up feeling like this? Any help for figuring out what's going on is appreciated."
What do you guys do when you can‚Äôt fall asleep?,"1) read a book

2) browse the internet

3) do homework

4) contemplate on life until the alarm tells you to gtfo."
It's crazy how your brain flips a switch and you can't sleep for days,It's just crazy how you can go from sleeping like a baby to sleepless nights. I'm still trying to figure out what's causing mine.
Hallucinations,Well I am officially freaked out. I closed my eyes to try to sleep and when I opened them I saw a tiny guy with a shovel on my desk he stayed there and looked at me for a solid 5 seconds before I looked away and when I looked back there was nothing there. Anyone else experience hallucinations when sleep deprived?
How many people have died from insomnia?,"It's pretty clear that's where I'm heading, as I have now gone 72 hours without sleeping and have lost the ability to feel ""sleepy."" I feel tired and weak, but not sleepy. I feel too tired to sleep, actually.

I can't even get close to sleeping. I have tried every position. And now when I lie in position for a while and try to go to phase 1 of sleeping, I get a sensation in my stomach or esophagus (not sure which) and it just blocks me from getting any further.

Is there some kind of cancer that causes this? "
How many of you check the time during the night?,"Hi fellow troubled sleepers.

Just wanted to do a quick poll - how many of you check the time during the night?

that means checking to see what time it is, or how much time has passed, at any point from the moment you go to bed until the moment you have to get out of bed.

I stopped doing this and my sleep improved.

I realized that time is only useful during the day

From the moment I get into bed until the moment I get out, there is no reason to check (saying get out because sometimes there's nothing to wake up from...)  
the time or anything to do with the clock is truly pointless during the night  
(of course other than to torture my mind and fuel my insomnia even further counting down the hours ;) )

just sharing with you all as it's not something that usually crops up in the boring ""how to sleep well"" lists"
Does anyone insomnia come in episodes?,"I can sleep for weeks just fine then all of a sudden boom I'm up for days straight no matter how tired I am my brain won't shut down and I start to lose my mind. I've had an episodes last a week-to a month (that was hell). I'm going through one now I'm on my second week, wish me luck."

My insomnia turns me into a sobbing blubbering mess,I‚Äôm really not sure how much I slept last night. I know I was up a bunch of times though. I can tell I didn‚Äôt sleep because I can‚Äôt stop crying and feeling like I‚Äôm falling apart. 
Anxiety over not sleeping,"Hello,

I keep having a really hard time falling asleep as in its taking me HOURS and when I finally go, I still wake up at 3 am so I might be getting 2-3 hours a night. 

When I wake up I begin to feel extremely anxious and I cry a lot because I know I have to go to work and function on such little sleep.

I was prescribed trazadone but it doesn‚Äôt work, just makes me groggy and feel worse the next day.

I take Gabapentin and it used to help me sleep and now I think it‚Äôs giving me headaches which also doesn‚Äôt help me go back to sleep.

Melatonin doesn‚Äôt work. 

I don‚Äôt know what to do. I am starting to feel really depressed bc I am too tired to do anything and the future just seems so bleak. Sometimes I don‚Äôt even want to keep going if this is what my life is like.

Thank you for listening."
Does anyone else sleep well during the first 4/5 hours of sleep (Deep sleep) but then constantly wake up during REM,"for example, I go to bed at 11 PM and sleep nonstop until my first awakening at 4 AM, then everything from 4 AM to 7 AM is this weird state of constantly waking up and falling back asleep

the funny thing is, it happens because I have very intense dreams that wake me up from the intensity. i fall back asleep, then start having this brain-power-intensive dream about running away from the cops or getting a computer virus, and wake up because of it, repeat about 5 times.

I can't have a good long dream, because dreams always wake me up. because of this deprivation of REM sleep I mentally feel unwell. it feels like a hand pressing down inside my skull, pressurized feeling, mild psychosis (hallucinating the bedroom door opening in my peripheral vision), weird thoughts such as gender identity confusion and attachment to the incel community"
"Today, I'm grateful.","I woke up at 7:49a and had a total of 7 hours of sleep accounted for with only waking up 5 times. This is a first - since last November. 
No one knows I struggle with this problem except my for two people and they have been extremely supportive. 
Today is a great day, emotionally, because I have this small hope. Things get better."
My insomnia has basically been cured after changing my blanket to a heavy microfiber one,"It is _amazing_ what a difference an insanely comfy blanket can make. Almost immediately, and without expecting it (the blanket was a gift), my nights are consistently getting 2-4 more hours of consecutive sleep, from 3-5 to about 7.

Try it! The worst that can happen is no change :) The heavier and softer, the better."

"if you can't sleep for emotional reasons, try typing your feelings out.","for a couple days now, any time something has me upset, I type it out on r/offmychest or r/rant, without holding ANYTHING back. If you want, you can use a throwaway, becuase trust me, it is soooo much better if you don't hold anything back. Before, I used to just let the emotions fester up and bubble, and I'd just lay awake at night with them resurfacing now and then. Now, after venting before bed every night... I sleep like a baby (sometimes.) It's like the internet equivalent of the support groups the narrator went to in Fight Club, only you don't have to lie."
Is it normal to feel suicidal from insomnia?,"Hey my sleepless friends, recently I have been not sleeping at all two days a week, and on the nights I do I only get 1-4 hours. Basically it really really sucks, I haven't felt even slightly happy in 3 months, and I am seriously considering getting permanent sleep soon. Is it normal? How can I get those thoughts to stop?"

when you have insomnia but thats no the reason your cant sleep (cute),"so i suffer on and off frlm insomnia. i am very tieed right now but cant sleep but my insomnis os not to blame. instead i cant sleep because my cat is sleeping in the middle of my bed and is waaaay to cute and sweet to wake up and move.

How do you know if you've slept?,"There used to be obvious signs for me. Essentially, I would open my eyes and feel like I've been hit by a bus. All kinds of muscle things going on...maybe some numbness. In recent years, tons of stomach cramps...especially if I ate certain foods. Eye crust. Dry nose/boogers. Probably TMJ-type stuff, too. 

That's not how I remember it as a kid, but everything sucks when you're an adult, so whatever.

But since I started having this inability to sleep 7 days ago, there have been a few instances where I think I might have fallen asleep, including 2 hours this morning and then 2 hours again this afternoon. I had a moment where I became aware and went, ""did I sleep?"" But that's about all. No stomach cramps. No muscle crap. No really strong feeling of having slept, but a feeling of, ""well, I can't quite place the past couple of hours in terms of either thinking a lot or tossing and turning, so I guess I was...asleep?"" 

I'm getting this very light sleep, if that's indeed what I'm getting. And that vagueness is worrying me, because I'm wondering if I really haven't gotten any actual sleep at all in 7 days, in which case death is around the corner. "
Something that helped me with heartbreak-induced insomnia,"I don't know if this would be helpful for anyone else having issues with rumination-based (or limerence-based‚ÄîI just learned that word last night‚Äîit explains everything I've been feeling, it's when you have an obsessive thoughts about someone/something that you experience involuntarily)

https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_how_to_fix_a_broken_heart?language=en 

This video changed everything for me. 

He talks about how the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids‚Äîso when we're heartbroken we're essentially going through withdrawal. And your memories are the only thing you can use to get the ""mini-fix"" of methadone that your body craves. 

The biggest takeaway I got from this video is: make a list about every BAD thing about the person or thing making you feel that way, and keep it on your phone. Whenever you try to think about that thing in an idealized way, use the list to remind yourself every negative emotion that made you feel. We have voids in our lives after heartbreak/loss/etc and we need to fill them in different ways to re-establish who we are and what our lives are about. 

Super amazing video‚Äîhighly recommend to anyone else has been having trouble sleeping because of heartbreak/general relationship sadness.  "
"If you think you'll go insane, remember....",You might be right. But I'm there with you. 
Everytime I lay in bed my heart starts racing for some reason,"I also have this unbelievable urge to get up too.
So tire but I don't feel sleepy I hate this so much like seriously what the f is this...


It's like the very aspect of going to sleep scares me and wakes me up and I don't understand it.

edit: Managed to fall asleep by walking around in the house to release some of that weird restlessness and watch something on my phone and trick myself into putting the phone down for a sec seconds because of a commercial.
"
Sleep outside in a tent for better sleep,"I had some issue with falling a sleep, sometimes after lying down, my body gets warmer and it keeps my mind thinking about random things, and I also feel that if I step outside of the house at night and breath in some colder air feels calming, so I set up a tent in my backyard and the heat issue was much better. I am in San Diego so the weather is helping. If you have similar issue, give it a try. "
I notice myself falling asleep and it wakes me up.,"This has been happening to me ever since I started trying to learn mindfulness meditation, which is something people swear by not only as a sleep aid but a life aid.

The way it works is you clear your mind and don't think, and when you notice yourself thinking, you kind of ""let go"" of that thought and go back to nothingness.

This is all well and good, except now I've been trained to notice when I'm thinking, and this has caused me to notice all kinds of other things to, like when I start to fall asleep. Having ADD doesn't help, because your mind is just teeming with a million random thoughts. I don't think actual mindfulness meditation is possible for me, and maybe even damaging since I don't think constantly being acutely aware that I'm thinking is healthy. It's distracting. Sometimes I notice it while I'm mid-sentence in a conversation and get distracted by it. 

I don't know if anyone here has dealt with this, but when I notice I'm falling asleep, become aware of it, it immediately wakes me up.

I'll go through this cycle dozens of times for hours on end on bad nights. Over and over and over again, I'll doze off, realize I'm dozing off and snap myself back awake. I ought to fucking work at NORAD on 24 hour missile watch at this rate.

Has anyone dealt with this, or something like it? Any suggestions? It's been like this for a few years now and I can sort of feel my sanity slipping."
I‚Äôve been robbed of my life. My sleep doc says ‚Äúit‚Äôs just the way it is now.‚Äù,"40 yo F. No history of insomnia until my psych. hospitalization one year ago yesterday. 

My life before insomnia was like so many others, busy with work, friends, hobbies, etc. 

I was very physically active, training for and competing in a few triathlons every year, and a number of 5ks. I swam, biked, ran, lifted weights at minimum five/six days a week. Living in Florida, all of this ideally should be done in the earlier morning hours before the heat and sun. 

Now that I‚Äôm unable to fall asleep until 2-3:30 am and awakening at 9:30-11:00 am, being active outside has ground to a halt, and the saddest part is that I can‚Äôt train with my friends anymore because they‚Äôre up at 5:30-6:00 am whereas I‚Äôve probably only been asleep two hours by then. 

I feel completely cut off from life. ISOLATED. I don‚Äôt even know or understand who I am. I have tried several times to join my friends for evening workouts (done by 6:45 pm) and when I do, I pay a heavy price of tossing and turning ALL night. So, I‚Äôve stopped that too. 

My social circle has shrunk to nearly nothing. I just don‚Äôt fit into my friends‚Äô worlds anymore because of the insomnia. 

I asked my sleep doctor two days ago if there was any hope that I may return to a better sleep schedule and get some of my life back. He didn‚Äôt flat out say no, but he very kindly said this is my new life and I need to make the best of it. 

I don‚Äôt want to be forced to go to a gym to do my workouts (alone) in the middle of the day (when I‚Äôm finally get awake enough) while all of my friends are at work. (I can‚Äôt work right now, so that‚Äôs another huge insecurity I deal with) 

I feel so screwed up, like a fish fighting frantically to swim up a stream that the whole world is swimming down. 

Insomnia has taken my life from me. One that I worked very hard to build, one that made me happy, "
"Fell asleep at 21:00, woke up 23:30. Almost no chance of getting back to sleep for hours. And I have work at 08:00.","So now I'm making complaint posts on Reddit. Because that's what you do in these situations, apparently."
my insomnia is going to cost me my job,"i've been up for 30 hours because of my anxiety and insomnia and i know i'm going to be late to work tomorrow morning which means i'm probably going to be fired on the spot because i've been warned multiple times. i'm really behind on my rent because i recently had a medical emergency and couldn't work for a bit, so if i get fired i will be evicted. 
every night around 11pm i have unbearable anxiety attacks that blur my vision and they last a few hours, so i usually fall asleep around 4am if i fall asleep at all. 
i don't have insurance, i've tried every home remedy there is, even prescription medications haven't helped and because i'm a recovering drug addict, i cant be prescribed any of the things that have actually worked for me in the past, not that i can get a prescription anyway because, like i mentioned, i have no insurance. if i lose my job tomorrow, i will be homeless. i live in an incredibly small town and job opportunities are extremely limited. it's been so bad that my suicidal thoughts are coming back and i don't have much stopping me from just ending it. no family or friends or anything. i didnt have anywhere else to get this out, sorry for the rant. 

EDIT: another issue is that i didnt disclose that i had insomnia or any disabilities until i got talked to about being late. i know youre supposed to, but i was looking for a job for a year and a half and only got hired after i stopped being upfront about it. 

update: i confided in a friend of mine about my plans to hurt myself and they ended up calling the police, which landed me in yellow pod because they thought i was a danger to myself. now i'm stuck with a big medical bill and i'm still no closer to getting any sleep. oh well. "
Is anyone else ever kept up by trying to monitor the exact moment you fall asleep?,"I know that's sort of nonsensical, but the last 3 nights I've developed serious insomnia because when I shut my eyes and start to get that ""falling asleep"" feeling somewhere behind my eyes, I immediately think ""This is it! Here it comes!"" and then I'm awake again. At some point your mind has to switch from awake to sleep, and it's weird to think of that moment. These are very intrusive thoughts that I hope go away quickly.

I'm hoping a combination of zzzquil and sleep meditation will allow me to get some normal sleep tonight."
"Please, don't give unsolicited advice like ""wake up the same time every day!""","You have to fall asleep to wake up, you inconsiderate dummy.

Im not normally an angry person, so I don't even know enough phrases to express how God damned angry dumb, unsolicited advice makes me."
"Suggestions, Comments, & Criticism are Welcome. I made this last night since I wasn't sleeping anyways.",
A pitch black room and this playing. It has been the cure to my lack of sleep,
Do not get me wrong the whole not sleeping thing suck but.....,You just got to love sunrises. Almost makes it worth it. 
The Bedtime Story Method,"Longtime insomniac, here. I've recently hit upon a method for getting to sleep that has been pretty effective for me so far. It may be weird and too idiosyncratic to be helpful to others but I thought I'd share!

Basically what I do is get in bed, turn off the lights, and tell myself a bedtime story, the exact same story every night. At first I used to run through the whole thing and start over but lately I never even make it to the end before falling asleep.

In my case it's a story I made up (sort of a fanfic based on a book I love) but I think it could work just as well with, say, a favorite TV ep you've seen a million times. Just close your eyes and begin ""watching"" the story, the more detailed and immersive the better.

I think it works because it's interesting and enjoyable enough that it pulls me in and distracts me from the hamster wheel of anxious thoughts but familiar enough that it kind of runs itself and I have no need to find out how it ends.

It's probably somewhat akin to mediation. I used to try to use meditation techniques like picturing a beach or a floating balloon or whatever but those never worked to distract me from my thoughts for long. A familiar but enjoyable narrative works better for that. 

Anyway, feel free to try it! Nowadays I get a little sad that I never make it to the end of the story! :P"
Again. 6:37 am no sign of sleep.,"I am so sick of this. 

My doctor's appointment isnt from a week from now but I need help.

I want to sleep and never wake up. I hate this. "
Why does it take me an hour to fall asleep my whole life?,"My whole life I have had this ""problem"", I haven't really considered it a problem until recently. I'm 20 now and sometimes I just want to fall asleep fast, but my body never does. Never in my life have I fallen asleep in under 30 minutes unless I took a pill or was drunk off my ass. What is there to do? I already take too much medication I don't want to add another pill to my daily routine. I exercise almost every day four 2 hours in the gym, I drink my last coffee at 3 PM. 

This is my current routine: Go to bed at around 10pm on weekdays, watch TV for 3-4 hours, try to sleep at 1 AM and only fall asleep around 2AM. Wake up at 10AM. I also have restless leg syndrome but it only bothers me when I'm sitting not in bed. Anyone have any ideas? I tried white noise, it doesn't work I can't sleep with it on."
I'm so /tired/ of Insomnia,"Get it? *Tired* of Insomnia... ayyyy

But that's the thing though isn't it, I'm *not* tired. Not at all. I'm pretty sure I could go days without feeling sleepy if I let myself. 

I first had trouble sleeping when I was a tween. I was showing signs of aggressions and was starting to get lower grades in schools so my parents took me to a doctor who (after a few tests and scans) discovered I hadn't been falling into deep sleep / getting any REM sleep for a *long* time. It was resolved easily enough when I just stopped drinking any caffeine at all and went on medication for ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression (all of which I was diagnosed with as well at that time), but the doctors said I'd have still some brain damage because of it (which is extra great considering I already had that from a head injury year prior).

As a teen I actually hardly ever had a problem falling asleep, no more than the average person at least, but I would still choose (like the dumbass I was) to only get a few hours of sleep a night. I didn't realize how lucky I was to even have the choice.

It wasn't until I got into college that it really got bad. My anxiety spiked my freshman year which made it really hard to fall asleep. I figured I'd try to take melatonin, but, of course, after only a few days of taking it every night I became dependent on it so I'd need to take more and more to feel anything. I remember there were times that I could have gone days not feeling tired or sleeping if I let myself. After fainting in my dorm in the Spring, my roommate convinced me to see the on campus doctor. To be honest I hardly remember the appointment I was so out of my mind, I just remember her basically telling me what I already knew and offering to give me muscle relaxers and me denying it. However, one thing good did come out the appointment. After that appointment, I ended up skipping my classes for the day and just going home and I got the *best* four hours of straight sleep I'd gotten in months. After that I was finally able to start sleeping again. Until last semester that is.

Last semester was likely my worst semester health wise. I was having a lot of physical problems as well as mental and it eventually lead up to insomnia again. I would wake up every few hours with feelings of guilt and stress and self-loathing and spend another few hours getting myself to fall asleep again. My psychiatrist eventually prescribed me Trazodone which REALLY helped oh my god it was like a miracle drug... until I tried to go off it.

I started having the same issue I had with melatonin, needing to keep taking more to feel sleepy. My anxiety has gone down quite a bit this semester so I figured it wouldn't hurt to see how I went without the medication for a while. Oh boy did I realize what a world of hurt I was in. I do not feel sleepy AT ALL and I've only been sleeping for an hour or two at a time for weeks. I've started to write it all down in a journal and I get, on average, 6 hours of sleep a week, occasionally I'll even get a dream. Even now when I've resorted to taking benadryl and even melatonin (which I *had* sworn off after last year's predicament), I only feel delirious and loopy, not sleepy. I've started to develop eczema and my hair is falling out so this morning I decided f\*ck it I'm going to the pharmacy to pick up my trazodone refill and I'll try to slowly edge my way off of it because obviously going cold turkey isn't working.

Anyway, most people on this subreddit have super similar stories so it's not like this is anything special. I'm very sure I'll be fine eventually. I'm really just damn frustrated that this keeps happening, and I'm sure it'll happen again.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

Tl;dr - I need medication to be sane but the medication eventually keeps me from sleeping normally."
"Sleep restriction, radical acceptance, and melatonin/trazodone/L-Theanine combo have helped me","It's been a bit since I've last posted here.

I know this doesn't work for everyone.. and I'm certainly not still completely okay. There are nights where I lay there with my heart beating in my head and ears.. I still wake up once or twice which results in choppy sleep.. But I've definitely improved! And something is better than nothing, in my eyes. No more four days straight with a single minute of sleep at the moment.

After trying so many things, meditation, teas, soothing sleep videos, sleep podcasts, herbs, a huge multitude of pills before I found something that helps, breathing exercises, none of which worked for me, I have found some relief.

I've been doing the Sleepio course, and it's helped considerably. Removing the subconscious association of being in my bed = awake has been so helpful. Though the first nights, it was really rough and fucking shitty. It fucking SUCKS, trust me. I would dread and panic at the thought of the clock hitting the set hour I was supposed to try and go to sleep. But that passes, with the waves of improvement. Sleep restriction and sleep hygiene has been one of the most important elements in my improvement. CBT-I takes work.

Another thing that has helped me is to simply ""let go"".

&#x200B;

What I mean is that I've learnt to be okay with the thought of not sleeping, and I let the thoughts pass without feeding them or giving them any sort of reactions. I put my mind on blank, not thinking about anything in particular, and let my mind run. Don't focus on how scary it is to not sleep and have another sleepless day. Don't focus on how awake or asleep you are. Don't focus on your pounding heart. Don't actively try to sleep, because falling asleep cannot be done at will. Just lay there with a blank mind, letting thoughts come and go without interacting with them. Sleep comes when it does. Easier said than done, right?

That's because this takes practice. It doesn't always help me. But it helps, and it helps a lot when I'm calm and I feel the thoughts coming on. It's not as effective when you're already stressed over not sleeping. In that case what I do is that I get up, not looking at the clock, and do some calming activities in the dark/dim light such as drawing and thinking about things that make me content. Music doesn't help me (I'm bipolar so music usually rouses me and sends me into a hypomanic state) but if that helps you, go right ahead.

&#x200B;

Alongside that, I've been taking a new combo I discovered that drops me dead asleep if done in combination with relaxation and letting go.

This can vary on how hard of a time I'm having while trying to sleep, but here's what I generally take:

***Trazodone 100mg, 10mg Melatonin and 30mg L-Theanine.***

&#x200B;

When I'm having trouble sleeping, I up the Trazodone to 150mg, and if that doesn't work which is rare, I take about 25mg of Quetiapine which is a pretty low dose but the effects are amplified with the Trazodone.

The Trazodone isn't the magic ingredient here as it usually doesn't get me to sleep by itself... It works so much better in combination with something else. The melatonin and L-Theanine have been my saviors. I went two days with no sleep and eventually decided to try them out as a last hope and it worked!

&#x200B;

The unfortunate part about this is that I do feel I've become dependent off pills. I talked to my psychologist and therapist about this and they can both agree that it's fine for now, while I get my body used to sleeping at a specific hour. Hopefully this dependence is temporary. Once I feel I've established solid sleep, I'll start weaning myself off.

&#x200B;

In short, I don't believe there is an ""instant cure"" or ""one simple trick"" to fix or improve insomnia. There are things that take practice, dedication, and patience. That patience you may not have anymore, but if you're like me, you'll try fuckall whatever to get some rest every night. Different strokes for different folks. You might require a different combination of other things to put in practice. What I've suggested here may not work for everyone as I was just voicing my own experience, but I'm just putting it out there!

I hope all of you find some rest tonight."
Is there strong evidence that chronic insomnia causes brain degeneration?,"As a chronic insomniac for about 20 years now I've found that my thinking and memory is terrible and its becoming increasingly difficult to hold down a job with any responsibility and expectation to engage in complex situations and efficiently problem solve in comparison to non-insomiacs. On days where I manage to get more than 4 hours sleep I do feel much more alert however and this gives me hope that I am always just one sleep away from returning back to normal brain functioning. I'm still slower than most however, but i've always had an IQ just above average so I try to tell myself that its just my genetics that limits my ability to grasp ideas/concepts than others with higher intelligence. Recently i've been awake for days at a time and its triggered some of the worst depression/anxiety/social withdrawal/brain fog I have ever been through. How do you fellow insomniacs keep going and function in a society where brain function and intelligence seems increasingly valued and have you found that a good restorative sleep has brought you back to baseline or merely tricked you into thinking that a less dumbed down state is in fact normal? Not even sure if I want to find out the answer to these questions as its more things to worry about as I try to get through the day with this crippling condition."
Can't sleep because I'm afraid of not falling asleep,"I've been battling insomnia for about 8 years now. Some days, I'm able to sleep fine, but whenever I have trouble sleeping one night, I find that the problem continues for many days until I'm able to sleep fine again. It's like I couldn't sleep until I get past that hurdle.

I have tried Melatonin, but it doesn't work for me. Benadryl and NyQuil (I only took this when I had a cold though) knock me out, but I don't want to be reliant on drugs. Recently, I have tried acupuncture plus some herbs that the doctor prescribed and it knocked me out too. I just don't want to be reliant on it either because insurance doesn't cover it and it's $120 per office visit.

I feel like my insomnia is psychological - I'm unable to fall asleep because I am afraid of not falling asleep. I almost dread when it's bed time. What I did notice though is I find comfort if I'm with someone who's a night owl. For example, a friend of mine recently visited and I fell asleep fine knowing she was still up. At a recent company team building, I fell asleep fine in my hotel room knowing that my co-workers were still up partying in the other room. I normally don't sleep well in hotels. My husband is a morning person - sleeps early, gets up early - and this doesn't help. He falls asleep at a drop of a hat and here I am, next to him, feeling pressured that he's already asleep and I'm still up.

I also remember the very day this all started. I was sleeping soundly and my mom who lives overseas just randomly calls me without even checking what time it is over here. I remember getting mad at her because I was having trouble falling back asleep. Since then, I dreaded going to bed. I don't even know how that particular event triggered it.

I don't really want to be taking drugs or sleeping pills. I know what the solution to my problem is - it is to stop trying to worry about sleep, but I can't seem to get out of my own head! It's easy to say to not worry about it, but it seems impossible to do. I feel like I'm going crazy. Please help.

PS - Another thing I noticed is, I'm also unable to complete yawns. Not always, but a lot. It's like I'm so tired and I feel a yawn coming, but I'm unable to complete it. It's like a half yawn because my eyes still get kinda watery."
New mattress makes me fall asleep faster,"So I have insomnia during stressful times but it has been getting better over the past few months. The improvements are mainly due to a change of routine and sleeping habits and recently I noticed a significant change. 
So I'm not sure if it's common or not but many of my sleepless nights were due to physical discomfort, in other words, turning around for hours to find a comfortable position to sleep in.
I got a new mattress a few days ago and guess what, I have been sleeping heavier than usual and don't leave the bed as easily as before. Of course this is not the only factor that kept me awake at night but boy did it help! I never knew it would make such a difference. I feel like I can drift off in less then an hour now! 
What about you guys, do you notice any influence of the comfort level of your bed on your sleep?

To add to that, I've been going to bed at least 8h before my alarm clock to give me a time window to fall asleep and get at least 6h30 of rest. It's been working because I no longer feel anxious about how short my sleep time will be. I don't actually do the maths, I just wake up everyday at 6h30-7h so go to bed at 22h-22h30.
Thoughts? "
"I almost hate those ""not sure if I slept"" nights more than regular ""didn't sleep"" nights.","I didn't get tired until 3 AM, got out of bed at 6 AM because my brother was making coffee and the machine is rather loud. I'm 99% sure I didn't sleep during those three hours but I can't remember hearing his alarm go off or hearing him use the shower, now I have those weird ""did I sleep? Did I forget I heard those things? "" thoughts and have no idea if I actually did get some sleep. Pretty sure some of you know how it feels, do you also get confused if it happens, do you stay positive and think you did sleep, how do deal with it?

Sorry if my english doesn't make sense, I'm a bit out of it. Think its time for some tea"
Can't sleep if I have to get up early the next day,"I'm a student so I don't have a consistent schedule, usually classes or work a few days a week for each. However, if I have to get up early for class or work--like tomorrow--I can't sleep. If I have to get up a bit later like mid-afternoon I'm fine. The ironic thing is that any other day I sleep like the dead for hours (I have lupus and fibromyalgia and I'm in the middle of a flare and have been sleeping for twelve hours a night but it's almost 5 am now). I'm not anxious about going to work or anything so I don't know why this is an issue. Any ideas? Thank you for your time. "
Maybe a miracle to fall a sleep quickly ?,"There are not miracle tip that can help you fall asleep faster for your entire life but my personal tip at the beginning was to think about relaxing places (beach, sun ‚Ä¶) but I realized that I couldn‚Äôt do it by myself. 

But last week, in another sleepless night (again), I found Dreem, a headband where we can apparently find effective audio programs that interact with your body and mind to help you relax and fall asleep faster. Here are the key Technics they found and use to improve the falling asleep stage:

Technique 1/ Ambiance

Serenity, Zen, Spirit, music for relaxation and meditation are among the most common strategies to fall asleep. Beyond popular practice, the effectiveness of soothing sounds to accelerate sleep onset has been demonstrated scientifically. These audio environments work because they produce a sound that masks disruptive noise (ticking of a clock, cracking wood, passing cars in front of the house). The excitability of your brain decreases, you let your body relax and drift into sleep.

Apparently, their technical teams have produced rich, realistic tailored versions of sound environments that are known to be conducive to falling asleep.

Transmitted by bone conduction, these sounds transport you to relaxing places so you can sleep in peace. Working in real-time with your brain activity, Dreem adapts the audio to your stage of sleepiness, until it gradually drowns away.
Technique 2/ Breathing exercises

These two features can make you focus on your body rhythm, help you slow down and gently fall asleep.

They are based on methods of conscious feedback on biological parameters, specifically here, your breathink addition to the EEG sensors, the Dreem headband contains a 3D accelerometer that captures the micro movements of your head caused by breathing and a micro-sensor (pulse oximeter) that measures the concentration of oxygen in the blood.

With these two measures, it estimates your respiratory rate in real time. From there, they have Air, a guided breathing exercise. Here, they manage your respiratory rate to reach an optimal point of falling asleep. Audio programs help you slow down you breathing patterns to bring you to a target frequency, known to favor your personalized sleep onset.
Technique 3/ Words

In my opinion, the most interesting feature. Rumination, anxiety, and daily worries are some of the major causes that lead to difficulty in falling asleep.

For all intents and purposes, this is the time when your thoughts, coherent and often stressful, interfere with the processes of falling asleep.

With Words, they accomplish both, prevent you from going back to your ruminations and also help you fall sleep. They have included 3 specific themes, each composed of several hundred words.

The headband will guide you to focus on the words and request you to picture them in your mind. As time goes by, the propositions randomly explore other words. As you concentrate on mentally picturing the words, you will slowly stop ruminating.

Your thoughts will gradually lose coherence. This is the signal for your brain that you are falling asleep, triggering your sleep switch, and biological processes that actually lead to falling asleep. As you drift into sleep, the words scatter and volume decreases.
"
Little revelation I had this morning,"No one cherishes sleep like insomniacs. When my girlfriend is sleeping peacefully in her bed, or my roomates are trying to take a nap, or anything. I go above and beyond to not disturb them in the slightest.

 Because I know exactly how bad it is when all you want to do is sleep, and you just fucking cant."
"I've had some minor sleeping issues throughout my entire life, recently found this podcast called ""Sleep With Me"" and it hasn't failed me yet.","It is basically a podcast where a very calming guy tells a story that starts off slightly interesting(enough to take your mind off whatever you are thinking about) and slowly gets more and more boring. I have been using it over the last 3  months and have yet to make it through an entire episode. Who knows how it will work for you but I would definitely check it out:

Hope this helps one of you guys at least!"
"After years of insomnia, I think I found something that works (for me, at least).","I've had issues with insomnia for years. Most nights, I toss and turn for about 2-3 hours while my darling bf passes out in 5 minutes. It's been very frustrating. I've tried melatonin (which helps sometimes, other times not), using f.lux to change the color of my screen (which does make me sleepier, but hasn't helped me fall asleep), invested in a good mattress, among other things. But still, I would be left in bed, unable to shut off my brain. And that's the thing: my brain won't stop talking. But last night, I think I struck on something. It's gonna sound weird, but I was out so fast afterward that I don't even remember tossing or turning (which usually I very clearly remember). 

I made myself stop thinking in words. It's something that I've been try to practice (because I thought it might help, but just turning it off is really hard). I imagine a microphone in my mind (a boxing referee's mic, for some reason - go, go, subconscious manifestations), and I turn it off. Last night though, if my brain starts to try to think in words again (which it does), I turned the words into gibberish instead of fighting to silence them. 

So it's like: ""I better not forget to blerb a doo fa blabababa uh."" I just let random sounds fill in the thought. Passed right out. 

So I'm thinking (and you can help me test this theory) that, since most of my life revolves around words and speaking (I've degrees in linguistics, math, I teach, write and run tabletop RPG games for fun - so lots of words, all the time), I most often think in terms of words. It's my most active mental state, because it's what my brain does ALL DAY LONG. Wordless thought and light visualization, on the other hand, are really strange to me. But it seems to have put my mind into a low-power mode by not really accessing my swole-as-fuck language centers. My brain, for the first time in a while, felt restive. 

So for those of you with busy minds that keep you awake, what kind of thinking do you do all day? And does that thinking loom over you at bedtime? 

I'm going to keep trying this - it's the only thing that's come close to working  for me. I hope it can help you too. :)

MamaFrankie"
Who else is awake?,"It's 1:42am and I have to be up at 530 to start getting my kids ready for school. I'm debating on continuing to toss and turn and audibly groan when I see the time next or just get up, make some coffee and play some Farcry......decisions of an insomniac."
Does anyone get scared into not sleeping?,I sound like a massive pussy but whenever I‚Äôm settled and ready to sleep I close my eyes and then boom horror character and now I can‚Äôt sleep.
Cold temperatures?,"I've found that keeping my room at about 60 degrees Fahrenheit (15 Celsius) improves my sleep quality by orders of magnitude.  I get more REM sleep, and I can fall asleep after waking up in the middle of the night.  Anyone else get this effect? "
Anyone hate the medication almost as much as the insomnia,I used to be on seroquil it worked though it was just barley tolerable i got off it recently with a diffrent cocktail for sleep and other underlying mebtal helath issues. But after some outside stressors the insomnia isnt undercontrol anf i don't know which i fear more insomnia or the zombie state that is seroquil.
Waking up almost every hour and at 4am specifically?,"I can‚Äôt for the life of me figure this out. It‚Äôs been stressing me out so much, I even woke up from a nightmare sweating from the neck down. Does anyone else deal with this problem?"
Does anyone else 'insomnia message' people in the middle of the night?,"I'm a lonely person (I work from home) and I'm prone to anxiety and overthinking.  Well I just sent off yet another message to a friend, this time basically whining about the recent decline in our friendship because I woke up thinking about it and then 5ish hours later I'd made a mountain out of a molehill.  I wish I could delete it but what is done is done.

&#x200B;

It's like I feel that if I take action in some way then my brain will relax and let me sleep... but usually I regret it instantly and I instead return to bed and stress out about how stupid I was for sending that message.

Does anyone else do this?   How can I stop myself before I end up totally friendless!!??"
Rear ended someone today on my way to work.,"Fell asleep at the wheel. I was super lucky. My car has one of those automatic braking systems so I barely tapped her. The lady I hit was lovely. She was driving a rusty old van and when she saw there was no damage she said don't worry about it, it happens and she's just glad no one is hurt. Could have been much worse. Falling asleep while driving is becoming more and more common for me. Maybe I should just sleep there instead of my bed! Can't seem to keep my eyes open when I'm in it... One day it's gonna end badly.

I just want to stop being tired all the time."
Lied awake for 9 hours last night/this morning... sick of it,"I'm taking lorazepam, I'm taking OTC sleep aids, yet no matter what I just can't do it...

Can ANYONE help? "
Anyone had it since childhood?,"I've always had trouble sleeping, I can spend hours with my eyes closed in total darkness and still feel awake, I remember having it since I was a child in the first grade, I couldn't sleep for school and I had to use sleeping pills because of it, and even then I still had problems staying asleep, im a very light sleeper, any kind of disturbance can wake me up, like turning on the lights for example, talking to anyone, holding or opening a plastic bag (they tried to be sneaky and eat their bag of chips alone, but this ain't gonna happen), blocking any noise (like standing in front of the fan for example, if the noise was muffled for any reason it can wake me up).

Its currently 5am here and I still can't sleep despite feeling tired as hell, I tried but I just couldn't sleep so i decided to post here, does anyone have a similar experience?"
"Not drinking beer after October to fall asleep anymore, 20 yr habit","So I have tried prescribed sleep aids, melatonin, breathing, meditation......you name it. I found out that mostly beer or getting drunk will make my brain shut off. I have done my habit for almost 20years now. Every time I stop beer or stop pounding beer it‚Äôs the same, up all night or up for 3 days.

I have crazy insomnia and always have and that is why I turned to this sleep aid for so long and I travel for work FYI. However, it is now creeping up as a day thing and is now a problem. So, fuck it! I‚Äôm out! I have a great plan to deal with any withdrawals if any habitual or dependent, but what I don‚Äôt have is a way to beat my boredom.

What do I do when the projects dry up? What do I do at 3am to leave my house and just do something?  What do I do when or if I interfere with my family‚Äôs nighttime life?  What do I do if I start to hear or see things that aren‚Äôt there? 

I was thinking Uber but not smart if I have been up for 36+ 

HELP!!! "
It DID get better,"Hi there. 

I frequent this sub a lot. This is probably the last thing you want to hear but I feel the need to share. I have had severe insomnia for a couple years now. 4-5 nights a week I'd get less than 4 hours and get maximum one 6+night. For the longest time i thought i was broken. Went to doctors. Thought i was hella depressed and anxious. I tried many medications and self medicated.I know this is the last thing you want to hear when youre up at 4am and thinking about getting up at 6 but IT GETS BETTER. I was convinced that I fucked my brain up for good and ruined sleep forever. 

&#x200B;

I think my insomnia was depression and anxiety. I worked on myself. I addressed the things that kept me up (consciously and subconsciously at night). I still have shit thats objectively bad and WOULD HAVE KEPT me up but it no longer does. I also took a trip. I traveled very very far away and the sleep deprivation due to travel and jetlag helped me somehow. I am done abusing sleep medications at night or during the day. 

&#x200B;

Sleeping is a struggle for me. frankly.....being an insomniac was slowly becoming a part of my identity as weird as that sounds. I was accepting the fact that i dont/cant sleep. Id tell my friends about it. Id lurk a subreddit about it. Id take drugs with crazy side effects in order to address this problem.  I DID RELY on mirtazapine, ambien, lunesta, xanax and etizolam to fall asleep. I would have never expected to be able to sleep without even a melatonin. Insomnia is not a part of my identity and I was able to shed it for some reason even if it will only last this month. "
Only thing that helps me,"I‚Äôm only 23 years old but I‚Äôve gone through bouts of insomnia for as long as I can remember. I generally live a very healthy lifestyle, I exercise a lot, have minimal stress, and eat a good diet. There doesn‚Äôt seem to be any real cause of my anxiety, perhaps it is hereditary. Anyway, over the years I have tried many different solutions including melatonin, prescription sleeping pills, meditation and hypnosis apps, and others. However the only cure that seems to do the trick is cannabis. It seems that whenever I smoke before bedtime, I sleep very good. Especially when it is an indica strain. I love weed but I don‚Äôt want to get to the point of having to smoke every single night to be able to sleep. I am a regular user, however I find that when I smoke every single day, my anxiety increases. Ideally I try not to smoke more than 3 or 4 times a week max. However it seems to be the only thing that helps me sleep without fail. Sorry for any typos I am currently typing this at 5 AM (fuck you insomnia)."
"Fatigue, the other F word","Fell asleep in an uber twice this week. Almost fell asleep during the after care program I run at a preschool. Fell down a couple stairs because I forgot to have my eyes open. Forgot I wasn't talking to my husband and told an embarrassing story. Forgot my purse in my house.

It's frustrating that the only times I can sleep is when I shouldn't. Anyone else in the same boat?"
The worst part about sleep aids is that they don't work,And they make me more tired for most of the next day than if I just didn't take anything.
Try not looking at the time,"Lately at around 9 pm I stop looking at all clocks. Smartphone gets put away, I have a piece of tape covering the time on my iPad which I sure as a book reader and there are no other visible clocks near me. 

By the time I bed down I‚Äôm not really sure what time it is. If I wake up in the middle of the night I‚Äôm not sure what time it is.

This eliminates what I call ‚Äúclock obsession‚Äù which I‚Äôve found is a major contributor to my sleep related worries. 

Stop looking at clocks!  I hope this helps. "
I believe thinking too much is causing my insomnia,"It's taken me like 4 or 5 hours to fall asleep this past whole week roughly. I believe it's because I've been thinking too much. I strongly believe that it's not because of anxiety or depression. I actually don't really have anxiety or depression at all generally speaking, and am pretty happy with my life (Sorry if it sounds like I'm bragging, I'm not trying to.) To explain in further detail, I strongly believe that my inability to fall asleep even within 2 or 3 hours is a result of me constantly thinking about things that make me happy such as: my favorite songs, favorite scenes in movies/tv shows, favorite moments while playing games, and many more other things that make me grateful and happy to be alive.) This said, this isn't doing my sleep life any favors. I've read/heard of tips from others that you need to feel bored to be able to fall asleep. The thing is, I can't think of anything for even a solid one minute probably that bores me. My life (again, I don't mean to brag at all, just wanting to say it as it is for me) has been very great for the past two years at least, and so I honestly am thinking that somehow I'm TOO happy to be able to go to sleep. I see sleeping as being un-productive and getting nothing done and I essentially never want the day to end. I just want to keep being awake and doing things every minute and hour. I'm not going to lie when I say that the only things, basically, that make me sad or depressed is when I know I should be asleep because it's like 2 AM, 3 AM, or 4 AM, but I can't, and I don't even want to. The only other thing that makes me sad or depressed, basically, is knowing that delicious food (at least to me) like Lay's Barbecue Chips or McDonald's French Fries or Sour Patch Watermelon or Flamin' Hot Cheetos are unhealthy. I honestly don't really have like any other problems in my life currently, generally speaking. I just want to fix my sleep life. I just want to be able to fall asleep as quickly as possible, like within 5, 10, or 20 minutes. :/

Edit: One more thing that makes me sad or depressed is knowing that some people are being mean to their fellow human beings  right now as I type this. Whether that be physically or emotionally or through some other means. I just want everyone to be kind to everyone at all times. We're all in this thing called life together and we all should strive to make our lives better and our fellow human beings' lives better!"
There is Hope,"Just a reminder to anyone out there who feels hopeless, there is hope.  Don't be thinking that you can't get through this and get back to normal because you can.  I went hard-core sleepless for over a year, multiple nights in a row of no sleep, etc.  You have to know that things change.  If you've always been a good sleeper your whole life but are in a slump right now, just be good to yourself and don't try too hard or go nuts on trying different meds.

Insomnia is an effect of feeling out of control, overwhelmed or uncertain about life.  Job loss...divorce...school problems...new house...health issues, etc.  Having trouble with sleep is not caused from a lack of Ambien or Tylenol Pm...it's an emotional issue, not a chemical issue (talking onset insomnia here).   So doing something over and above what you've always done for sleep is only going to complicate matters...it will feel fake and artificial...lying to yourself and being fake is not a great way to address sleep problems....you can't trick yourself...being fake just creates unnecessary complications, which leads to chaos, which leads to confusion, which leads to more fear.  And the circle begins.

Sleep is what happens when you feel normal, secure, and hopeful about life.  So cling to something, focus on that thing or those things that give you those sensations.  Focusing on your fears or focusing on sleep problems only makes them larger.  Insomnia is not something you fix by focusing on it or addressing it directly.    It's something you fix by focusing on something else, focusing on the things you used to focus on in life.

Your internal fears and anxieties create a tremendous amount of energy.   This internal energy must be neutralized by external energies and stimuli.  This is why many of us get sleepy/ can fall asleep more easily when the tv is on, when people are talking, when kids are playing or when a loud fan is on.   We need that stimulation.  Going to sleep in dead silence is often difficult when we're afraid.  Sometimes I sleep with three fans on and a podcast playing.

So hang in there...be nice to yourself.  Things will turn around if you just be yourself and let things play out organically.  There is hope, even if it seems hopeless sometimes.  Dark clouds will pass...fears can fizzle and insomnia can disappear just as weirdly as it appeared.  your job is to just get out of the way, be normal, focus on something else and let it happen.  Love and good sleep to everyone."
New here. Can't sleep. It's been over 36 hours now.,"Hi. Locomotive engineer here. Work all sorts of weird hours. Something daylight, sometimes midnights. They give me a 2 hour call then keep me there (alert and attentive) for 12 hours. Then rest, then another train the next day.  
I don't like to brag but... I'm good at it. I'm very safety conscience about my job. On the train, I have never so much as nodded.  
Unfortunately years has trained me to fight sleep. When I feel my eyelids begin to get heavy on the train, a shot of adrenaline spikes in my body and I'm awake. The thought of crashing and killing my coworkers or the public terrify me, so the adrenaline is a good thing.  
But then I lay down in my bed. I feel my soft pillow. I begin my breathing exercises. I'm in a forest. The sun is warm with a gentle breeze. Slowly breathing. I relax. I feel myself relax my leg muscles, thighs, butt cheeks, stomach, shoulders. Relaxing. Then I feel sleep... Sleep pulls my legs into the ground. I melt and become one with the forest floor. Only my toes stick up until they, too, sink below. Then my thighs. My legs have become dead branches.. I'mying down using a soft log as a pillow, and my chest sinks. My breathing is slow and my mind has given up. Just tidying up a few minor thoughts. ""Cereal for breakfast. Help kids off to school. Walk the dog. Don't wreck this damn train. Water the law.... Wait, what?!? The train?!? Holy crap! I'm about to fall asleep!! Wake up!! Wake up NOW!!"" and a bolt of adrenaline.  
My record is 58 hours. That's with sleeping pills, zquil, mediation, etc.  
Tonight, I'm not in a forest. Tonight I'm in a horse arena. The horse is Sleep. All I have to do is catch it, pet it, stroke it's nose, and hopefully it will carry me off.  But Sleep is unbroken thus far. I can touch him as he mockingly trots past me, but...  
Two chlomo, a Lunesta, shot of Zquil, and a handful of melatonin. It sounds like the recipe for a suicide victim, but it's the only thing that works.  
Sorry for my ramble. I hope everyone on this sub is sleeping, riding that crazy horse or melted into your forest.  "
One of the things that makes my insomnia worse is that I wake up to pee in the middle of the night and then it takes 1-3 hours for me to fall back to sleep. Any ways I can make it so I stop waking up to pee at night?,"I have an overactive bladder and I pee frequently throughout the day and at least once every night (and sometimes 2-3 times, but once is the norm). My doctor prescribed me oxybutinin but it did not help and she said if I wanted to try something different I would need to see a urologist. My insurance doesn't cover visits to specialists so I wanted to see if anyone could recommend anything for me to try at home or over the counter before I bite the bullet and go see a urologist? My doctor tells me it is normal to wake up to pee once a night and didn't seem very sympathetic, but I do not think it's normal for it to take so long to fall back to sleep and I think if I could cure my nocturia it would help tremendously with my sleeping issues. 

I do have insomnia separate from when I get up to pee, but it definitely makes the problem much worse for me. I've been taking trazadone and I will stay asleep until 3-4 AM now (used to start waking up around 1-2 AM) when I really need to pee. Once I get up to pee it takes anywhere from 1-3 hours to fall back to sleep. My alarm goes off at 6:30 and I frequently fall back to sleep right before my alarm goes off making me exhausted when it's time to get up. I think the trazadone could possibly help me sleep through the night if I wasn't still waking up to pee every night.

Thanks for your help and tips!"
That dread of having to wake up for work again in a few hours.,
Why are the mechanics of sleep so poorly understood?,"In my opinion, insomnia is an area where there is far too much of an over-empahsis on the psychological rather than biological causes. I suddenly developed insomnia 12 years ago and every year I sleep around 3.5 hours for 9 months and 6 hours for 3 months - I always sleep much better in the 3 months of winter when the days are shorter. In that time I've probably seen 60 doctors. Almost every one of them have immediately said stuff like ""its all in your head"", ""you cant sleep because you're telling yourself you cant sleep"" etc. Now that may be the case for some insomniacs, but not for long-term severe chronic insomniacs like myself. I have long since given up worrying about not being able to sleep and the impact that will have on work the next day. That's simply because I've had so much expereince of working full days after 1 or 2 hours sleep. I simply do not worry about it anymore. On top of that i've meditated for 10 years and that too basically gets rid of any traces of anxiety. 

So I find insomnia is unique in terms of being immediately dismissed as a self-inflicted psychological isse. I've read thousands of articles on insomnia and very rarely do these go in to the mechanics of sleep. It's usually a very superficial level about trying to relax, and the assumption is that the very complex mechanics of sleep will just take care of themselves. The most technical an article will get is usually a mention of the role of melatonin in sleep. 

So why are the mechanics of sleep so poorly understood? I have come across some papers which talk sleep at the molecular level, including details about release of neurotransmitters, areas of the brain which show more activity at night etc. But I've never really seen a very technical explanation of how sleep works at the biological level. I know the brain is the most complex structure in the known universe, but doctors know far more about the mechanics of other neurological conditions, such as epilepsy. 

Given that there are more and more articles every week about the explosion in the number of people complaining of insomnia - the waiting list in my city, Dublin, for a sleep test is now 2 years - it seems bizarre that so much is simply dismissed as ""stress"" or ""anxiety"". Think of the cost insomnia is doing to economies worldwide through sick days and work inefficiencies brought on by chronic insomnia.

It seems to me that what's required is a crowd-funded research project to truly understand the mechanics of sleep at the molecular level, and the various disruptions insomnia causes to these mechanics. 

Would a crowd-funded project such as this be of interest to people?"

I've been using Indica marijuana for sleep for over 10 years.  Still works (almost) every time..  What I do is buy 4 different types of Medical MJ (indicia) and mix them together.  I take 2-3 hits before bedtime, and I'm usually sound asleep in 20 minutes.  If I wake up (to pee) I take one or two hits and fall back to sleep in ten minutes.

Undergoing a sleep study saved my life.,"I've been on here for almost a year and finally had a sleep study conducted. I would rarely get passed stage 1 or 2 of sleep and would usually suddenly wake up. When I did make it past those stages, and get through a REM stage, I would usually wake up immediately after a dream. Finally, I was so fed up with not being able to sleep my doctor suggested undergoing a sleep study, and I am beyond thankful he did.

The EEG results displayed that I was experience jolts of EEG that were actually seizures. I was having multiple quick seizures per night. Although this is more common in children, it can be seen in adults and can cause insomnia. If you experience similar symptoms or haven't had a sleep study conducted I highly recommend one. Try out all possibilities!

tl;dr I was having seizures in my sleep that were keeping me from sleeping."

Anticipatory anxiety... Scared of going to bed..,"Today, after four nights of zero sleep (with the exception of a 40 minute nap) I managed to doze off... Eight holy hours.

My insomnia treatment success story,"I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember. Even going to a sleepover party at a friend's house when I was 12 or 13, I would be the very last one awake. My friends would fall asleep long before I did, and then of course in the morning I was very tired.

I had tried everything for insomnia. I gave a very brief trial to sleep medications like Ambien and Lunesta, but they had no effect on me. I was glad not to have a sleep medication addiction, but frustrated that nothing helped.

Things came to a breaking point a few months ago. I was sleeping only 4 hours a night during the week, and then 10 hours on weekends. Every work night I couldn't sleep. My boyfriend told me ""it was all in my head"" (which I knew) but I couldn't change it. I took magnesium and other supplements. My sleep routines were crazy, and if anything was messed up or out of place, my anxiety would go through the roof. I used a blindfold. I used earplugs AND headphones for white noise. Specific pajamas. I tried sleeping on the couch, basement, different beds. I had to start on my right side, switch to my left, and go back to the right. If I didn't sleep I had to go back to the left, then the right. If I still couldn't sleep, I'd lie on my stomach until I felt sleepy then back to my right side.

I was frustrated. Depressed. Dead tired. I thought there was something seriously medically wrong with me. I saw a new doctor, who recommended an online CBT program for sleep. Seriously? CBT for sleep? And why is it so expensive? I asked my boyfriend if I should do it, and his answer was a wholehearted yes. I was furious with him. Ha ha.

I knew about sleep restriction for years but never did it because I knew how awful it would be. Just knowing that I would have to do this I broke down crying multiple times in the first week, and that was just the observation week! I had an incredible amount of anxiety about restricting my sleep. I. did. not. want. to. do. it. I was too tired to restrict my sleep more. Don't make me!

But I did it anyway. I moved my bedtime back 3 hours. I stopped sleeping in on weekends. And I stopped reading in bed -- one of my favorite things to do. And the madness began. I would go to bed, not sleep, get up and go to the couch, and read. Repeat this 2-3 times. I'd finally fall asleep sometime around 1-2 a.m. I would wake up at 5 a.m. and be unable to go back to sleep.

It was hell.

But I kept at it. I had tried everything else, so I figured what did I have to lose this time? I tried to view my later bedtime as ""spare time"" and enjoyed spending it with my boyfriend. I tried to see getting out of bed if I couldn't sleep as more free time to read. I was learning things from the online CBT program, and my boyfriend was very supportive. I logged my sleep each night.

Finally things began to change. In the third week, I finally stopped waking up at 5 a.m. and slept almost to my alarm. I started getting 5.5 hours of sleep every night, but still felt incredibly tired. The next week, I began getting 6-6.5 hours of sleep and sometimes even 7. I actually began to feel refreshed by sleep!

Then the IMPOSSIBLE happened. I would lie down, and almost immediately fall to sleep. This had NEVER happened in my entire life. It had always taken me at least 90 minutes to fall asleep.

My CBT program had said that ""good sleepers don't do anything to go to sleep."" It was happening! I also learned that I do not need 8 hours of sleep and trying to force that to happen just made my insomnia and anxiety worse. I feel great on 6.5-7 hours of sleep. Anything less than 6 and I feel tired. After years of getting 4-5 hours of sleep on most nights this is such a blessing. I am so enjoying the fact that I can lie down and go straight to sleep and sleep through the night.

I did have a setback while on vacation recently. Having to sleep in a new environment and a different bed was difficult, and I didn't sleep much the first night. But I knew that I would begin sleeping well soon. By the third night, I was sleeping much better and was able to enjoy the rest of the vacation.

The most important learnings I took away from insomnia CBT:

- Sleep restriction is #1 treatment for insomnia.

- If you can't sleep within 20 minutes, simply get up and enjoy reading or another low-key activity.

- Use the bed for sleep and sex only. No reading, no cell phones, no TV, no Reddit.

- Consistent wake-up time. No more sleeping in ever.

- Don't go to bed early, and don't go to bed until sleepy, even if it's past your ""bedtime.""

- No naps.

- Resetting your biological clock takes time. Stick with it.

- Good sleepers don't do anything to sleep. 

- I don't need 8 hours of sleep. Trying to force myself to sleep more doesn't work.

TL;DR: I used an online sleep CBT program, and no longer struggle with insomnia on a daily basis.

The world epidemic of sleep disorders is linked to vitamin D deficiency,"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22583560

>**Abstract**

>An observation of sleep improvement with vitamin D supplementation led to a 2 year uncontrolled trial of vitamin D supplementation in 1500 patients with neurologic complaints who also had evidence of abnormal sleep. Most patients had improvement in neurologic symptoms and sleep but only through maintaining a narrow range of 25(OH) vitamin D3 blood levels of 60-80 ng/ml. Comparisons of brain regions associated with sleep-wake regulation and vitamin D target neurons in the diencephalon and several brainstem nuclei suggest direct central effects of vitamin D on sleep. We propose the hypothesis that sleep disorders have become epidemic because of widespread vitamin D deficiency. The therapeutic effects together with the anatomic-functional correspondence warrant further investigation and consideration of vitamin D in the etiology and therapy of sleep disorders.

there is some controversy in regards to what the ideal levels of vitamin-D is. most say below 20 is a problem. some say below 40. There are some reason to believe that the levels recomended here can confer health benefits but they probably  require more attention to co-factors (magnesium, K2 etc) in order to avoid problem.

Anybody else's insomnia fueled by obsessive intrusive thoughts?,"My Bi-Polar disorder and OCD seem to work so well together in creating the perfect insomnia cocktail, keeping me up for nights on end. I am plagued by obsessive intrusive thoughts of dark, sexual nature and night after night I find myself wishing more and more that I could sleep. It is 6:47 AM where I am now, and it is likely I will not sleep for another hour or two. Going to sleep between 7:00 and 9:00 AM every day is surprisingly exhausting in itself, let alone the fact that this prevents normal functionality like holding a job or stable social life. Short of pumping myself full of meds, I am not sure what to do. I am 23 years old now, and this has been a problem since at least age 12. I am 23 and I feel like I am 33. 10 more years of this will feel like 20. Please excuse my sleep deprived rantings.. While the entire world around me rests, I find myself scouring the deepest parts of the internet to avoid the darkest parts of myself, in hopes of finally catching some shut eye tonight."
Just discovered an easy way for me to get to sleep! I hope it'll work for others,"I often have insomnia due to anxiety, fearing whatever social situations i'll have to face the next day. It comes and goes depending on what I'm due to face the next day, and often I won't be able to get to sleep for hours, or at all. it has messed up my work life and my social life many times. Melatonin didn't help. weed would help *sometimes*


I've been smoking weed regularly before bed, and last night I quit cold turkey. The past 2 nights (and subsequent mornings where I've woken up prematurely) I've been able to get to sleep within 10-15 minutes despite my anxieties, by coming up with **inventions!**

For example

* robotic vacuum that can climb stairs

* shower head that dispenses shampoo

* drone for commercial flights

Despite the fact that these are mostly implausible and ridiculous, using all of my brain's power to visualize these things, and how they would work, how I'd market them, what they would look like, etc. takes my mind off absolutely everything else and puts me in to a dreamy state.

This is a huge breakthrough for me, and I hope others who stay up all night worrying can try this too. And just maybe, you'll come up with a million dollar idea (please don't steal mine!)

(**tl;dr,** invent things)

sleep easy my friends"
This is my new technique of falling asleep.,"I‚Äôm new to this sub, but I hope I can offer something productive.
I‚Äôve struggled for years with waking up at night and not getting back to sleep but have recently discovered something about myself and my ability to fall asleep. The technique has been working well for about two months and I‚Äôm wondering if it could work for others.

The key (for me) was changing how I was thinking when lying in bed trying to fall asleep. 

The ‚Äòaha!‚Äô moment for me was one night being on that cusp of sleep where I was thinking about something, remembering a situation, but then immersing myself within a situation and immediately feeling that rush of my brain transitioning to sleep mode. It was then that I realized that when conscious I‚Äôm usually thinking in the 3rd person, sort of like watching myself on TV. When I‚Äôm asleep my brain is utilizing all the motor functions in an imaginary way.

It‚Äôs a little difficult to describe, but deeply imagine you‚Äôre doing something. Imagine all the sensations, textures. Don‚Äôt think, but imagine. Don‚Äôt picture, but experience.
For example things I imagine; Walking on a beach and feeling the sand on my feet and all the muscles I‚Äôm using to balance myself. Running my hand down the back of a large animal (like a horse). Swinging a golf club.

When I wake up at night now it‚Äôs usually just a five minute process of reminding myself to imagine a sensation of something and then I‚Äôm out again. 

I hope this helps someone.

TLDR: As someone who has experience very bad insomnia, I fortunately don't suffer as much anymore as I'm self-employed. Last night it came back because I HAD to be up for a schedule. "
I'm worried my insomnia will ruin my relationship.,"I can't sleep with someone else in the bed. I've never been able to. After being single more than a year, I managed to get a better control over my sleeping patterns and very rarely resorted to my meds. Things have been great. But now that I'm in a new (awesome) relationship, I'm dreading that my insomnia will ruin it. I've been making up excuses for him not to stay over at mine. When I stay over at his, I'm getting 30min-4hrs max rest. Last night I just gave up and slept on his couch. It's sucking the love out of everything.

&#x200B;

If anyone has suggestions on how they overcame the hurdle of sleeping well with a partner in their bed (who sleeps like a log), I would be open to trying it. All the tricks I've learnt that help me sleep on my own have never involved a second person. And now I'm totally lost. 

&#x200B;

Insomnia has been a (minor) part of ending previous relationships (people often take personal offense that you prefer the couch/spare bed). I don't want to mess this one up too."
"I have insomnia and only manage to get about 3-4 hours of sleep per night, the issue is I can not turn off my brain.",
Insomnia in a Nutshell...#2,"**When I stand up, I feel like I'm laying down.**

**When I lay down, I feel like I'm standing up.**

**When I close my eyes, I feel like my eyes are open.**

**When I open my eyes, I feel like my eyes are closed.**"
How do you cope on the days you get zero sleep?,"I wound up calling out of work because I‚Äôm just way too tired. I laid on the couch all day and watched tv. 
I feel so much guilt and shame for calling out of work and laying around. "
I always get tired on the couch...,but the moment I get up to go to my actual bed I can‚Äôt fall sleep.
A solution that has helped me to fall asleep.,"First of all I would like to say that I never had insomnia like a lot of people here, my issue was not being able to fall asleep for about 2 years now, basically It would take me about 2+ hours on average to fall asleep, I was never been able to go to bed at 10 and get a good sleep, which led to a lot of alcohol which did help me, but was never a viable solution, I would drink on average 9-12 beers weekly just so I can sleep, I started abusing melatonin about a year ago, 3mg never helped, 20mg didn't always helped either, so then I started smoking weed on a daily basis before bed for about 2 months which did worked like a charm, but then again it's not a viable solution. What does work very well for me now is basically writing my thoughts everyday before bed time, basically like a personal diary, followed up by a 10-15 minutes of meditation, which is just having a a candle before you, close your eyes and focus on breathing. Even if it seems to you like nothing is truly troubling you throughout the day, you may just not realise it. I know that it's probably not a new thing for a lot of you here, but I swear that it works for me. I realised that my problem was psychological, but I never understood how to get over it. My fear was not being able to fall asleep, which indeed made me roll in bed for hours. It's been about a week now and I'm falling asleep in about 10-15 minutes, which is quite unbelievable for me, I used to have weeks of 2-3 hours of sleep per night and it made me feel like absolute shit and not understanding why this is happening to me. Anyway, now I've completely stopped with alcohol,weed and melatonin and I'm able to fall asleep at 10pm and wake up at 6, quite unrealistic for me but it is happening! I'm sorry if this method isn't new to anyone here, but if you haven't given it a try, maybe you should try it for a couple of days and see how it works for you. I wish to everyone here to find their solution eventually and live like a normal person. Have a great week everyone!"
"I hadn't slept and it's 6am, but my heart feels like it's beating really slow.",I'm pretty sure it's just an anxiety attack but it's freaking me out 
I found something that works to help me sleep,"Edibles. I live in a state where Marijuana is legal, inexpensive, and easy to come by, and I‚Äôve been getting 10 mg thc gummies. One or two of these about an hour before bed and I seem to get a decent night‚Äôs sleep. If I skip it, I don‚Äôt sleep as well or at all. By the time I wake up the effects are gone and I feel rested. 

I‚Äôve been a casual marijuana user for decades, but smoking it doesn‚Äôt seem as effective for sleeping. Some strains even seem to keep me awake when I smoke them. Hope this helps somebody."
I AM IN LIVING HELL!!!!,"I WANT TO SLEEP SO BAD...

"Turns out, doctors dont know everything","So my pdoc had me add melatonin to my night time drug routine to help with my raging insomnia. For the record, I take 12.5 Ambien Cr and 3 Xanax but I still dont sleep. He told me to use it as a sleeping pill and take the highest dose possible right before I go to bed. It did nothing. I was bemoaning this to my pharmacist and she told me I was taking it all wrong.  She said I should not be taking that much, with my insomnia maybe 3 mgs, and to use it 2-3 hours before I go to bed. Not like a sleeping pill.  I did it the right way that night. Lo and behold, it helped. This is the same doc who told me I wouldn't withdraw from immediately stopping 400mgs of thorazine Id taken for years. My pharmacist said oh yes you will! Dont do that! Taper! "
I‚Äôm going to tucking kill myself,My fucking God why can‚Äôt I sleep?! Why is this so fucking hard why is this happening?!!
I slept well last night.,"It was the best ever. Haven't slept that well for around 3 weeks. It was so peaceful. I listened to only the 1st part of Marconi Union's Weightless, and then flexed my whole body while on the bed to tire my muscles. What followed was me actually losing consciousness, falling asleep just past 10. Waking up today i felt accomplished and happy. Just hope i don't have to make it a routine for the rest of my life. Hope you guys are doing well."
I just found this subreddit at 6 a.m. 3 guesses why.,
"Anyone else struggle to stay awake during the day, accidentally take a nap, and wake up feeling up like shit?","Usually takes me 1-2 hours to fall asleep, last night was particularly bad.

We're smarter than the rest...,Can't wake up tired if you never fall asleep..
I'm tired of being TIRED,"Hi everyone! I have had insomnia since I was a small child, and now in my mid twenties, I'm tired of being tired!
    
I explored numerous medications and sleep hygiene without any luck throughout the years. Of course, the only things that seemed to work for me were very bad for me at the same time (addictive medications, alcohol (which actually prevents you from entering deep sleep), or using marijuana, etc...) It didn't really help that every doctor acted like I MUST be doing something counterproductive if I can't sleep at all; drink no caffeine, exercise more, no tv/phone/laptop! Um, if that worked I'd be doing it instead of coming to YOU??
    
I even discovered that I am extremely tolerant to anesthesia and woke up multiple times during two different surgeries - yikes!! If a knock out drug such as THAT can't put me down, am I ever going to get any sleep???
    
I've been on several different meds, and explored a long list of alternative treatments. The meds were ineffective at best (and made me freaking BONKERS at worst). But a couple of the alternatives were surprisingly helpful.
    
Ones that seemed to help were sensory deprivation therapy (aka float therapy), CranioSacral therapy, and Reiki healing (definitely recommend!!). Plus, I got a dog and his schedule for potty-time keeps me on a regular bedtime/wake cycle.
    
I figured I'd vent and share a little information at the same time. If you made it this far, thanks a bunch for reading! <3"
I finally slept,"It has been weeks since I have slept through the entire night and I feel amazing today, just yesterday I was literally on the verge of tears, I was in the grips of giving way to self destruction from only having nights of 2-3 hours of light sleep per night for the last few weeks, finally I slept a whole night and I feel fantastic.   I just wanted to share.  These days are few and far between but these are the days I fight for.  Stay Strong everyone!!"
"If you always have insomnia, you may actually have this disorder","Kind of a PSA ... As a teen, I used to go on insomnia forums and sites and such a lot, and it would have done me an insane amount to good to run across something called ""delayed sleep phase disorder."" Because one I figured out that's what I had, my insomnia stopped being a terrible mystery and started to become something I could actually deal with.

- if your insomnia has been going on for years ...
- if you sleep fine when you can choose your own hours (like on vacation)
- if you can't seem to go to sleep early no matter how much you try ...

Then you may actually have a neurological disorder called ""delayed sleep phase disorder."" It's not a disease so much as a mismatch between your natural sleep rhythms and the hours society likes to keep.

To everyone trying to sleep right now,"Don't stress :) I can't even count how many nights I've been up struggling with insomnia, but one thing that's always made it worse is worrying. I know we've all gotta be up for one thing or another, but try to stay relaxed, it gets better :)"
Who says insomniacs have to be alone? Let's all sleep in the same place tonight.,"Came upon this post by user [babysteve](http://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/26qc5o/advice_on_things_to_think_about_when_trying_to/chujgdr), and it gave me an idea. It may be a bit silly, perhaps even childish, but I actually kind of like it. First, here's what babysteve wrote about how he falls asleep:

> The key for me is to get your mind away from thinking with words. These might not be specifically to do with stress but help me not stress.
My favorite/best working ones that I've discovered recently are creating a safe place in your mind somewhere comfortable that you want to be and adding lots of detail into the visualization and even thinking about the sounds within it. Mine is a cave with a storm happening outside but I'm nice and warm and dry in my cave in front of the fire...with a blanket, and a mattress... and lots of big leafy plants around (i like plants).

This image was so appealing to me, maybe it's because I'm sleep deprived and the cozy comfort of it all is so soothing. The distant sound of wind howling. It's raining outside, but you're lying there safe and secure by the fire. There is something primal about it; something so incredibly natural that I just feel drawn to this particular image and experience.

So I thought: What if we share this imaginary cave? What if... When tonight, all of us insomniacs with our usual stress, and our invasive thoughts, and our obsessions and what not - all imagine tonight that we are lieing down in that same cave? You brush your teeth in the cave, spread out your sleeping bag. Move rocks and logs around to distribute the warmth. Huddle together, while listening to the rain. Those of us who can't sleep through the night, will promise to stoke the fire so everyone else can sleep securely. And if you have to go do a midnight pee, you walk out to the entrance and watch the starry night through the clouds. When you walk back, you thread carefully so you don't disturb babysteve, or dalsgaard, or any of the other insomniacs who are all lying in the cave.

Insomnia can be a lonely experience. Maybe we should join together, and share that space within our minds. We can make an /r/insomnia cave where we can all return to, when we are stressed and can't sleep. It can be as detailed or as simple as you like. So you're officially invited to lie down by the fire tonight! No need to be scared of predators; after all, at least one person is bound to be awake to spot them!

Wonder if people will like it, or if I'm just going nuts because of sleep deprivation again...

EDIT: Also, maybe someone could draw the place, and we could share what we did in the cave and so on. Make it familiar, and something we share. Talk about our struggles finding it, or perhaps tell a story about how we built a piece of furniture to put in the corner of it, to make it more comfortable. Personally, I'll make a huge pile of firewood tonight. The cave is big enough, so I'll store it a good way inside - it will be so big that we won't have to worry about firewood for a long while."
Picture i found that 'almost' depicts my frustration.,
Took me longer than it should have to choose the correct answer.,
Do you use F.lux on your devices?,"If you use your computer late in the day, this app is a must! It reduces eyestrain and *possibly* also the effect a computer screen has on your sleep so you feel sleepy/fall asleep faster.

Has anyone had this success with it yet?

Also it's great because you won't find yourself squinting at the screen anymore = less opportunity for wrinkles to form :)

If you haven't heard of F.lux, check out our review (with commentary from one of the makers of the app): http://blog.sleepio.com/2012/12/09/f-lux-review/"
"At what point in the night do you just say ""Fuck it. I am not sleeping tonight, but I am not lying here thinking the whole time."" and go do something productive? Or at least slightly more engaging than nothing.",It has to be around hour 2-3 of trying to force myself to sleep.
Does stress and depression cause my sleeplessness or does my sleeplessness cause my stress and depression?,"Is it different for different people? I feel like my lack of sleep is the cause of my emotional problems but my mother thinks it's the other way around. 

I've never slept well but lately it's been horrible. I haven't slept at all in 3 days. I am 18 and starting college which could be the source of some stress but my frustration is not directed at that. It seems to be more focused on childhood things that I was positive I had gotten over. Can lack of sleep take your resolved issues and unresolve them? Or were they never resolved and only suppressed? 

Tell me your experiences with this type of thing. I appreciate it. 

Sorry if this post sounds jumbled but I haven't been feeling like I make good sense for about 40 hours."
I think I'm nocturnal,"Welp, for the 2nd night in a row I slept 2 hour and woke up. Sleeping at night is difficult. When I get the oppotunity to sleep during the day I seem to get better quality sleep. Maybe I'm not an insomniac but nocturnal? Either way it sucks. Fuck. "
I wanna here your ‚Äúfun‚Äù stories of over exhaustion,I decided to ask this because I‚Äôve been sleeping very little to not at all the past few weeks and have hit a point where very mundane tasks become extremely difficult. I was cooking for my self and threw a cup of water in to pan with boiling water with out thinking about it and nearly started a house fire as it took me a couple of moments to realize what the hell was happening. Please share any similar stories. Thank youv 
Sometimes the only way I can fall asleep is after eating a lot of carbs.,"Which isn‚Äôt great while I‚Äôm trying to lose ten pounds. But I am just so fucking exhausted...

Does anyone else experience this?"
"Does anyone want have an inane chat with me, about absolutely anything?",
It‚Äôs been a bad night y‚Äôall,"Sometimes, I‚Äôd rather get no sleep than get broken sleep. I slept off and on, for about 30 minutes at a time, for about 3 hours total. I feel worse than when i get no sleep at all. It‚Äôs almost 5am and I‚Äôm pretty sure i won‚Äôt be going back to sleep, so good morning to y‚Äôall! üòÇ"
CBT-i alongside Light Therapy is a very effective combo for Circadian Rythm Disorders...,"Just throwing it out here. I'm the type that would eventually get to sleep after 1-2 hours, but wake up intermittently during the night. I would lie 10 hours in bed in to scramble 7-8 hours of sleep in total... This screws with your circadian rythm and your melatonin and cortisol production will be completely off... For me this is exacerbated by short days during the winter. I tried CBT-i, more specifically sleep restriction, tbh CBT-i is pointless without this component.... It did work but it's excruciating to keep up, if you want to be really strict, and honestly you need to be.

&#x200B;

The combo of restricting your total bedtime to 7 max 8 hours however, did work well when combined with Re-timer glasses I started wearing in the morning as soon as I woke up, for about 30 mins. These glasses are great. They blast any melatonin that's left in your body out, giving the body the signal that it's daytime. As a consequence, you WILL feel tired when night comes. All in all, it complements CBT-i very well and you will get results more quickly, without having to stick to bedtimes of say 5 hours or even less..

&#x200B;

Therefore I greatly recommend this strategy, more than taking melatonin directly...Taking melatonin masks the underlying rythm disfunction. On top of that, the sustained release version can seriously mess things up since slow metabolisers of melatonin will have residual melatonin during daytime. I'm not at all against the use of supplements, but you should get the fundamentals of sleep hygiene in order first. This strategy may also make tapering off a med a lot more doable..

&#x200B;"
"anyone get worked up at the thought of not being able to sleep, when you have to?","I'm not sure if title communicates what I'm asking correctly, so here's an example. 

Say you have somewhere you HAVE to be like work, somewhere where the necessity is so great that it'll cause you anxiety/panic attacks at the thought of not making it there, of something going wrong, etc. And you have to sleep before this event, so that you're coherent and all of that stuff. 

Does anyone else get worked up, and subsequently can't sleep, just because they've been worried all day about whether or not you'll be able to sleep before having to go somewhere important? 

I've been struggling with this a lot lately. Sometimes there isn't much else troubling me other than the thought that the clock is constantly counting down, that after one hour of tossing and turning i now only have 7 hours left to get enough sleep, then 6, then 5, and next thing you know it builds up so much that I've spent 8 hours tossing and turning and end up too tired to even drive somewhere safely. "
Everytime I visit this subreddit I can't sleep at night,It's ridiculous lol. I'll look around on here for ways to fall asleep faster but instead I just get inside my head too much and end up wide awake the entire night.

"If you have trouble falling asleep, try opening your bedroom window just before going to bed. Lowering the temperature of your bedroom will help you fall asleep.","A cool 16-18¬∞C (60-65¬∞F) is thought to be an ideal temperature in a bedroom.

how to (actually) recover from sleep deprivation-induced brain damage?,"The title speaks for itself. For a while now my cognition and memory have been going down the drain.

Basically, all I've heard is ""get more sleep"", ""improve your quality of sleep"", and ""Manage your time well"" as well as shit about sleep schedules and blah blah. Not only did I already know all this, but I've tried it and they don't work well. I'm still an idiot. Is it possible that this damage is irreversible and I should stop trying to fix it? 

I've made a doctors appointment but would like something to try in the meantime."

I just found out that I've had insomnia my whole life...,"Yeah, bit of a ""wait what?!"" moment, since I was under the assumption that insomnia was just full-on not sleeping (which I have experienced before) but its actually a combination of random sleep shit, all of which I have! (for context, I fit every NHS listed symptom: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia )

It's weird though, since I'm used to having it (when I have a good sleep, I wake up in the morning like ""OH MY GOD WHAT THE HELL"") but I'm not sure whether I should even BOTHER doing anything about it now! I was prescribed sleeping tablets at one point, but I read the possible side effects and was just like ""I'll stick with my lack of sleep thanks fam"".

I don't know what the point of this post was, I just found it interesting and weird and wanted to get it out; thanks for reading I guess? xD

Side note: I know that insomnia (especially full-on insomnia) is practially torture, but I just find it sort of interesting how much the term ""insomnia"" actually includes, and I'm also glad that I have a name for my body's inability to actually go to fucking sleep!"
Ear plugs help me stay asleep,"I recently started wearing little foam ear plugs to sleep and I am startled by how much better I'm sleeping. I started wearing them because I was being especially startled awake by noises outside my apartment (just moved to a studio where the door leads to the outdoors).

I still struggle to fall asleep but somehow I hadn't realized that noise was a factor in walking up so much.

I realize this will probably help very few people but I wanted to share and who knows someone else may be helped by this.

P.S: I am looking for alternatives to using foam ear plugs every night. I feel like that might not be ideal for the ears..."
Anyone else only sleep 3-4 hours a night?,"It takes me hours to fall asleep and when I finally do, I wake up every 5 minutes and get like 3 hours of sleep. It‚Äôs driving me insane."
Some very useful tips that many people *might* overlook.,"I have had many cases of Insomnia in the past. It wasn't fun. But over the years I've learned how to almost get rid of it completely, and have figured out ways that might be able to help you get some sleep (without medication). Before I start, I may be saying things that could be obvious, but some could benefit...

The most important thing is: Do. Not. Over. Think. Sleep. If you go into your bed at night thinking ""Oh man, I really need to sleep tonight"" Or ""I'm going to try to sleep tonight,"" you're just going to cause yourself to think too much into sleep itself. Remember, **sleep is supposed to be completely natural**. If you have the intentions to go into bed thinking about sleep, you won't get it. You must let go, pre-occupy yourself with something else. When the feel for sleep comes on, just let it happen.

A big thing to note is the temperature of the room. If it's too hot, you will have a harder time sleeping (at least in my case). Another thing is, don't use your phone at all during the night (unless you have f.luX, a blue light filter). Oh, and absolutely do not eat anything after 8 PM. Only drink water.  If none of the above works, I reccomend completely leaving the room and going somewhere dimly lit and quiet, possibly outside. 

Bottom line is, overthinking and relapsing because you realize that you're already so far into the night are things that CAN be prevented IF you follow what's said here. Of course, though, this won't work for everyone, everytime. But I can assure you that it has greatly helped me in the past with times of hard nights.

Good luck out there, hopefully I didn't already say everything you already knew. If I remember anything else, I'll add it here.

**EDIT**: One big thing that I just remembered is, YOUR DIET. If you have a horrible diet (IE: eating junk foods like fast food all the time and/or smoking/drinking alcohol) you need to gradually change that into something better. Go to the store and buy a juicer, and juice carrots, apples, spinach, and kale, at least 4 days a week. Never drink caffeinated drinks like soda or coffee. Cut back on all things sweet (sugar has been linked to cancer alone, among other things, included insomnia). Your poor diet could be the very reason you cannot sleep at night, and possibly why you have anxiety. **ALSO**. Sorry MODS if this post is not allowed, please PM me and I'll take it down right away.

"DAE resent and get angry at their family/friends simply because they are able to sleep, and you cant?","I've been up since 1am. My insomnia is a constantly cycling problem. 

I find myself annoyed at my boyfriend sleeping in the next room like a baby. I literally resent him for his ability to sleep with no issues. This is not a normal reaction I know, but when I lose sleep I have a hard time managing my emotions. It makes we want to be a brat to him, because he can 'enjoy' a normal life function without constant idiopathic disruption.

DAE ever feel this way? "
"Emotional freedom, this is the cure.","Listen people, I have noticed one thing. Most of us here have some subconscious reason which keeps us up at night. Insomnia happens to almost everybody, but our "" fault "" is that we got caught up with our anxiety and complaints about life. I understood that if you get your shit together in life and have strong psychological set-up, sleep will not interrupt you that much as it does now. It just takes some willpower to let everything go, you are afraid of losing something, you are afraid that you will lose your job or will not get enough sleep as we need to function. It is all natural and for a reason, but we need to change our thinking perspective, we need to fucking let go all of the worries about sleep. Our mistake is that we just strive for sleep, take medicines and drink herbal teas, use some light therapy or put some white-noise stuff in order to sleep. That is the fucking mistake, we WANT to sleep. I don't know how exactly to explain this, but I see many people complaining and hating their lives because of the lack of sleep, and posting stuff like how they lost their jobs or failed exams due to insomnia. Listen, for example you have a pretty good , high wage job and your productiveness declines because of the lack of sleep. At this point, your subconsciousness plays a game with you, it wants you to get fired and live easily, not be involved with your shitty boss or perform heavy daily tasks with great effort. Your subconsciousness wants you to be miserable and just sit at home, watching a football game. The other side of you , it goes against it, it wants to work and make enough money in order to survive. So you get caught up between those two and fucking insomnia kicks in. There is a reason why you stay up all night, and you know that it does not happen suddenly, after you sleep poorly one night, you get less and less sleep for months, and your anxiety increases rapidly. Brain enters the state where it is alert all the time and it prevents you from sleeping. If you are a chronic insomniac, like if you can not sleep since your childhood , you probably do not give much shit at this point , however , I do not think this is the case about most of you. You can reach that mental state where you do not care, where you accept your suffering and exhaustion as normal, do not get stressed or depressed about your lack of sleep. I know how inconvenient it is, I have experienced it for a while and only know I am experiencing improvement in my sleep patterns. Fuck sleep and fuck whatever it causes to your body, mentally and physically. You can also laugh at it and make jokes with your friends about how high you get during the day when you did not sleep the night before. Fuck those news which informs people about "" dangerous consequences "" of insomnia and shit. You do not want to be a whiny bitch, do you? How do you think your problem will be solved with meds? How it is logically possible to enter chemicals in your body in order to satisfy the natural need? Even if you take meds, what are you gonna do without medication? Doesn't your insomnia tend to come back after you give up your medication, as you create not only physical, but psychological bonds with your tradazone for instance? There is no rational danger, you can do your best by not giving a shit no matter how much sleep you get. This is the hardest thing to do, but it is possible and I am living a proof. Just do not let insomnia to destroy your personality. Your  anxiety will not change anything, and you really have a lot of power in order to rule your thoughts.one day I told myself that even sleep deprivation kills me, I will never bitch about it or surf on the internet and "" get help"" . Help is you, as much as you give everything in order to sleep well, you are prone to lose the battle. You will not like my post if you are making an appointment with your doctor about increasing the dosage of your ambien, but still, downvote this post and give a shot to think about what I am saying. Make your sleep issues a slave of yourself, not vice verse. 
Good luck.


TL; DR. Set yourself emotionally free with no complaints and worries about your sleep, I am not telling that it will cure your insomnia instantly, but you will feel much better once you do that."
I got a sleep study and holy shit..,"I've had sleep issues all my life. Falling asleep, staying asleep, sleep quality, all that shit. Done plenty of research, always ruled out the usual stuff. 

Results of my *second* sleep study? 

I have fucking sleep apnea. Like I have *none* of the risk factors. My doctor said my throat looked perfect. No idea why I have it but I definitely do. I woke up like 8 times per hour and my oxygen was like 90%"
Only day off an no sleep. We all know this feeling too well.,
This is how I feel on all of these nights,
"Racing thoughts, noisy brain, not even a spec of light, heavy pillows stacked","Post got deleted for some reason, so reposting:

I've struggled with insomnia since I was a small child (8 years old is when I really stated dreading bedtime). In college it got worse and I wrote this song that would mimic the headspace of racing thoughts and desperate attempts to fool myself into sleeping, but also as a self-deceptive lullaby ( I've found ethereal music with heavy bass and reverb have helped)

So if this is relatable,  or helpful I have written more music to trick the mind into wandering and distracts from noisy thoughts, but this was the first"
Insomnia suddenly getting better,"Hey there!

A couple of weeks ago I started to fall asleep at night without even noticing it, and it's been like that ever since. 

A bit of background: I started having insomnia over four years ago. I was writing my dissertation at the time and working a lot overnight. I work much better at night, but then at 7 am I'd have trouble falling asleep. So I started taking Ambien to sleep on those days. At about that same time, my partner started snoring louder than ever. I mean, it was a nightmare (ironically). He got surgery, but the problem never went away completely and his snoring would still keep me up. After a while I decided to go back to my normal sleeping hours to see if that would make things better. It didn't work. And so, the insomnia became a constant in my life.

Ever since I would only be able to sleep a full nights sleep after taking Ambien. No specific thoughts would keep me up, I was able to really relax up to a point of almost being in trance, but then I would open my eyes, need to pee, feel uncomfortable, too hot, etc. I wasn't kept up by anxiety or worries about my dissertation, for instance. So much so, that after it had been accepted and I was finally done with it, I still wouldn't sleep. 

I didn't understand: how could other people do it? I tried everything from tea, yoga, meditation and mindfulness, acceptance techniques, ASMR, aromatherapy, no blue light, exercise regularly during the day, you name it.

But then, about four weeks ago, I started sleeping naturally again. Just like that. I remember waking up in the morning and thinking ""what the bleep just happened? When did I fall asleep?""

The only thing that had changed recently was that I started CBT again. But it's weird, 'cause I still hadn't had any time to implement the techniques the therapist suggested. And I've been doing nothing special, no meditation, no nothing. Just going to bed.

I still don't know what exactly happened, but hey: I sure hope it stays like that!

Just wanted to share some good news :)"

Becoming dependent on sleep meds... afraid to bring it up to my doctor,"I used to take the ‚Äúas directed‚Äù dosage of otc sleep meds (2). I‚Äôm now needing to take one more to fall asleep at a decent time... afraid to bring it up to my doctor bc I have a shit ton of other ailments that I ‚Äúprioritize‚Äù more. My other meds add to my insomnia but are essential for my everyday well-being. I conk out after 3 and wake up feeling refreshed but don‚Äôt wanna perpetuate the cycle of needing more.


I‚Äôm half just getting it off my chest to see if anyone else has had this experience, half looking for advice.


Tyia friends üíõ


Edit for clarity (my response to a fellow redditor): Haven‚Äôt brought insomnia up to my doctor. I‚Äôm a relatively new patient of hers bc I‚Äôm new to this area, and it just feels tricky to bring up a new problem every time I see her. I feel overbearing and like a hypochondriac... idk. I mean I know people go to the doctor seeking meds for meds sake, rather than for an actual illness... but I‚Äôm afraid of her assuming thats what I‚Äôm doing, if that makes sense."
How many hours do you usually sleep per night? How often do you not sleep at all?,
"Have always had insomnia, my new girlfriend has it as well","My girlfriend has been treated with Zolpidem. Once in a while when I‚Äôm very restless she will give me one and they are life savers. Tonight I was struggling falling asleep so I took 2 Ambien and then drank a little bit of vodka to help speed up the sleep process... I know this is dangerous I have done the research. But I have a huge day tomorrow and need some sleep, even if it isn‚Äôt the most efficient sleep. I took enough to feel it but not enough for it to damage my liver or hurt me permanently. I‚Äôm just praying that there will one day be a real permanent solution to the horrible disease that is insomnia! 

Goodnight all, best of luck with your sleep troubles tonight. Love you all

Do you have insomnia characterized by vivid dreams and waking up frequently? This is what fixed my insomnia.,"I was inspired by 11ellie7's post because it sounded very similar to my own experience. My Insomnia was caused by a super-sensitized dopamine system resulting from ingesting a micro-dose of adderall. Now if you research this people will deny this can actually happen but when i look at peoples anecdotal reports they sounded very similar to my own. **So I went about fixing my insomnia with having  a sensitized dopamine system in mind**

When this first happened I would be lucky to get 3 hours of very light sleep in a night with vivid dreams. I resorted to taking benadryl to get more rest. This would result in about 5 hours of light sleep with extremely vivid dreams and frequent awakenings. Needless to say I was still exhausted.

*What finally worked for me was...*

**Magnesium Citrate or Glycinate- 400mg**

This one i'm sure you have all tried or are currently taking but when i forget to take this supplement I definitely notice. It's much harder to get to sleep without it as you can get 'restless legs'. I would say try both of these forms of magnesium as some people say citrate worked for them when glycinate didn't and vice versa.

**Noni Fruit Capsules- 1500mg**

This lowers your dopamine.

**L-tryptophan- Varying Dose from 3 grams to 500mg**

This is the most important supplement to my sleep as this converts into serotonin and melatonin. I still struggle with getting the correct dosage as I have needed less and less over time. I assume because my dopamine system is normalizing. When you take too much you will sleep like a rock and wont have a single dream but when you wake up you will feel like you haven't slept all. When you don't take enough you will experience frequent awakenings, you will have trouble getting to sleep and you will have vivid dreams. I started out needing 2.5 grams but right now my sweet spot is at 750mg. I can tell because I am still dreaming but am not waking up in the middle of my sleep. 

**Watching what you eat.**
I wont pretend to know why these foods keep me up but they do...
Soy sauce, smoked food like pulled pork, caffeine (obviously), alcohol and whey protein.

This altogether is what finally let me start feeling rested in the morning. If i miss any one of these supplements I will have problems with my sleep. 

So while you may not have had a bad reaction to adderall like me, you may still have a problem with your dopamine system. I'm curious if this can work for anyone else out there with similar insomnia to mine. 

Note: Im not a doctor im just an idiot who took adderall wrong. 

"
Caffeine is amazing,"I havent had any caffeine in a while as I took a break from all drugs about a year ago and havent used it again. But just today, with my anxiety for family christmas due to the fact tat I haven't slept much and will look like a mess, I decided to drink a bunch of tea to try to counteract the drowsyness. And good god I forgot how amazing this stuff is. It's like all my fatigue disappeared in a few minutes. Granted my attention and memory are probably almost as shit as they were before but I feel fine, almost as if I had slept well.

IDK the point of this, just sharing this experience. I particularly reccomend tea if you think caffeine can help your situation, as the theanine helps even out the jitteryness and headaches from the caffeine, which is why I can't stand coffee. I also personally take weekends off so I don't develop a dependence

Edit: Nevermind guys it's an hour after I drank it and I feel like shit again."
Nothing Works,"Now what, no pills work whatsoever, when on them my memory is shot, I am going to get fired at work I know it. Everyone is cheerful, I'm like scrooge, please pray for me. Any pill-less advice would help.

Been awake for 36 hours,"In transition of a new job. It‚Äôs stressing me out so much. Change is scary as hell.

"In awful crisis, need urgent support","Hey, I'm new around here. Mostly because I've never really experienced insomnia chronically before and I've never in my life had an experience like this. 

&#x200B;

This is gonna be a long post but please, I need some sympathy here. I feel so alone. 

&#x200B;

For the past three weeks I had fallen ill with something undiagnosed, went to the ER, bloodwork came back perfectly fine, still felt crappy, (the ""illness"" has kind of vanished after the insomnia started??) I don't feel like ranting about it right now because I'm over that part. 

&#x200B;

BUT

Fast forward, and dealing with how sick I felt digged me deep into a hole of anxiety and despair. With that came: No good sleep. Anxiety took over my rest and this isn't a normal thing for me but it was pretty tame at first. It's fine, I shrugged it off. One day isn't much for me. I go on hypomanic episodes all the time and I willingly stay up a night to work on my projects. It wasn't too bad.

&#x200B;

Second night.. I felt more anxious. I had been anticipating that night for sleep because I felt like complete ass all day long. But racing thoughts were flooding my head and I struggled around, tossing and turning, reaching points where I was almost asleep but waking back up with jolts of panic, gasping. I would get hungry constantly, eat meals, drink teas. Over the course of the night I got so desperate that I tried FOUR different sleeping meds over the course of several hours. I started with NyQuil, then relaxium sleep (natural sleeping pills that worked fine just nights before), benadryl, and finally I got desperate and pulled out the big guns with seroquel, which I don't take regularly because I usually sleep just fine, I had it prescribed to reschedule my sleep. That night would mark my third day with no sleep. 

&#x200B;

Later that day I decided I'd try to go out on a walk, get some sunshine and tire myself out. I had been laying in bed for over a week prior from feeling crappy. Let me just say that it was a terrible idea. My body was just not in shape. I went outside, I felt like I was walking on air. Pulse racing, felt like I wasn't real. My vision was going white. 

I head back home from the walk feeling like ass, panicking. I called my clinic, asked them what they should do, and they told me that if it got too bad, head to the ER. I tried to give the night a shot to see if I got better, and I just kept getting worse. I head off to the ER in a desperate fit for sleep.

&#x200B;

At the ER, I was basically shoved into a small room with a bunch of loud noises and constant activity. Crying babies, doors slamming, vacuum cleaners, etc. I sat in here from around 9 PM to fucking 1 PM of TODAY agonizing. I was going crazy, hallucinating. Seeing streaks, weird ribbons at the corner of my eyes. My eyes were darting around. They refused to let me go because they believed I had gotten to a dangerous state, and they called a crisis group on me to come evaluate me and see if I had to be sent to a psychiatric hospital for all of this. 

They said that because of this, they couldn't induce sleep because I had to be awake for questions... And oh fucking boy was I enjoying the anxiety of being sent to a fucking asylum because I can't SLEEP and I feel like I'm fucking dying, I was experiencing the worst panic I've had in years. It was unreal. The hallucinations, everything. The crisis people took hours to get there.

&#x200B;

And just an hour before they got there....... I crashed. I suddenly felt woozy and I was actually able to snooze peacefully for 40 minutes until they came and woke me up for the questions. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward, because I slept those 30 minutes, I felt temporarily refreshed, so I wasn't freaking out anymore. They basically just said: you're gonna have to wait until tomorrow so we can contact your mental health clinic to schedule an emergency appointment since it's the weekend for your medication. We can't prescribe anything today.

This marks my fourth day with no sleep. I have this funny feeling in my throat and chest that's making me panic, all too familiar. I can't fucking rest. Tomorrow will be my fifth and I'm going fucking crazy at the thought that the meds won't get me to sleep or calm down and I'll reach delirium and be unable to communicate properly anymore. I'm here just feeling super anxious, trying my best to wind down, when I finally feel calm enough to maybe try and rest my eyes I can still feel my heart pounding, choking me, keeping me awake. 

&#x200B;

These four days have been the worst fucking days on my entire life. I feel trapped, scared of what's to come next. And that in itself fuels the cycle. The fear won't let me sleep and sleep is what fixes the fear. 
I'm home now, dreading tomorrow. My fifth day.

&#x200B;

Please, just give me peace of mind..

Update: 
1:22 PM September 10
I slept 8 hours.. Passed out at around 4 this morning. God I'm so glad to finally have some sleep. 
I feel nauseous. Crappy. But anything is better than no sleep. 
I have an appointment for my general doc on the 12th and a visit to my psychiatrist tomorrow. I feel out of it, still. Memory hasn't gotten completely better and I still feel weak. I'm disassociating badly. I don't know if this is normal. I'm putting the consideration of a neurological disorder on the table but I'm not sure yet. If the labs keep coming back normal who knows?? I might also just be really beat up from those past four nightmarish days.

I've lost track of these past few days. I don't remember what happened when. My brain is a deepfried crisp right now."
Best low-cost weighted blanket?,"I‚Äôm pretty broke but decided I need a weighted blanket. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô11 and 165lbs, there are some cheaper weighted blankets online but will they be effective? Does anyone have any recommendations?"

Insomnia is a bitch,Insomnia makes my depression and derealization worse which causes anger which pushes away friends and family. At least I have my dog.
Does any get random insomnia where you keep waking up throughout the night?,"I literally needed my sleep last night so I can be awake and have energy to see my family today, well as soon as I lay down..my mind is racing and I know I‚Äôm not going to get good sleep. I proceed to wake up every 1-2 hours and woke up groggy at 7am. Not sure why that happened, I had no caffeine, no alcohol or drugs. Very random. Does this happen to anyone else??"
Am I the only one who didn't respond to melatonin?,"I took 6mg last night but still couldn't sleep. I'm going through mirtazapine withdrawal so might the withdrawal symptoms, primarily insomnia, have been so powerful as to counter the effects of melatonin? Since with so much evidence it still didn't work, I'm not sure if Valerian root does. Maybe I need to see a psychiatrist for some sedatives."

I almost drifted off riding in the back seat of cars in the sunny Southern California and afternoon.

Birds, why are you singing? Is it because you are as out of step with the world as me?"

Do you have more suicidal thoughts after a bad night?,"From the moment I wake up and throughout the day it's hard not to wish I was dead after a sleepless or nearly sleepless night. I don't feel like I'm seriously close to taking action on it, because I know I'll be back to relative normality after at least one good night sleep, but I just can't help but spend a good portion of my time mulling it over.

It's especially difficult not to think like that when I have to work too."
Does anyone else lie awake for hours unable to sleep but once asleep has the ability to sleep for half the day?,"I take different sleeping aids and although they might help sometimes I dont want to be addicted to anything, but no matter how little sleep I get I stay awake until 4 am every night and wake up at 7 30 to go work feeling like shit. 

However when its the weekend I sleep until 1 pm, I would say its from exhaustion but the pattern continues on vacations and I do not sleep longer than 8 hours.  The cycle continues. "
Why do I get no sleep after staying up for 24 hours?,"I want to stay up for 24 hours to fix my retarded sleep schedule and be back on a normal one.

"I get tired at night, start to fall asleep and then I'll suddenly get a jolt of energy and have to sit up. I'll be up until 6 AM after that, wide awake, with restless arms and legs.

Fuck everything.,"I can't fucking sleep. There's something wrong with whatever piece of fucking worthless meat inside me that makes the hormones/chemicals necessary for sleep. I either stay up for days, exhausted and dead, or clock out in the middle of something important, like... oh, I dunno... driving? Making food with sharp implements? Sitting in class? Making food with heated implements? Drinking? Eating?

I'm so close to just walking into a hospital and screaming my head off until they sedate me. I know that's a dick thing to do to the staff and the people there, but I'm on night number three for the twentieth goddamn time this year and the millionth goddamn time in the last three years and I'm about three seconds away from popping a blood vessel. I have no meds at home besides some bullshit ""natural herbs"" that some asshole gave me that never did anything, and the next doctor's visit is two and a half weeks away. I have work in six hours and school in sixteen hours and I know I'm not going to sleep at any point before those things.

It is taking every fiber of my being not to feed someone their teeth. I hate that this is happening, I hate that not a single fucking doctor - who, y'know, get medical degrees and slog through school for god knows how long for this kind of shit - has managed to proscribe anything that works longer than a week. I hate that the only two things that knock me out reliably are weed and anesthetic - one's expensive and illegal where I live, and the other is fucking never proscribed - and I hate that both of those are so fucking difficult to get my hands on.

I hate that everybody thinks they're a fucking comedic or medical genius when they tell me, ""Just go to sleep."" I hate that my boss thinks I'm a fucking weakling for being unable to wash his shitty dishes for him at his fucking awful restaurant because I haven't gone the fuck to bed in two or three or four or five days. I hate that I can't trust myself to fucking drive because I could clock out and kill somebody. I hate that I'm failing out of school because I can't pull my shit together enough to have enough energy to even make it to class. I hate that I'm a clumsy fucking moron all the time even though I'm about to graduate with a full scholarship to a college I picked out. I hate that I don't have the energy to be around friends, and I hate that I can't fucking control anything about myself past day three. Gotta piss? Better fucking run, because you can't hold it. Gotta shit? Better fucking go, bitch. Someone pissed you off? Better think of something quick, because what little self-control you had left just chucked itself out the window and you're about to tear their fucking balls out through their nose.

Give me something to do. Something I can do besides beating my head against the wall. Literally anything. Any kind of in-browser game, any fucking thing you can think of. I'm about to lose my fucking mind over this mind-bendingly, gut-wrenchingly infuriating bullshit."
Insomnia emergency. 2 hours sleep in 3 days and a half. Am I going to die?,"My insomnia has gotten so bad that I can't even get up anymore. I've lost the will to do anything about it. 

The only way I can sleep is if I stay up and pass out in the morning (8 a.m or so). I've been trying for THREE months to sleep early and wake up normally and it hasn't worked ONCE.

Let me start by saying that the people who live above me are absolute animals. They stay up all night and make a lot of noise, so that's ONE fact.

But even on nights when they are not actively making noise (probably because they passed out drunk), I still cannot sleep.

I get into bed, and I follow all sleep hygiene rules on this planet, and I do meditation for HOURS on end, and I breathe like a monk, and I still cannot sleep.

Sometimes it's the thoughts in my head. Sometimes it's a song that won't go away. I cannot get rid of these thoughts/songs no matter how hard I meditate or breathe. It's impossible.

But even when my mind is blank, and my neighbors aren't making me so mad that i'm smashing my fist through my own wall, I still cannot sleep.

I get into bed, and I IMMEDIATELY begin to have hot flashes. This goes on the entire night. I put the blanket on, I begin to sweat and overheat. I take it off, and i'm shivering. 

I don't know what to do anymore. 

I thought I would post this here and see if anyone can share anything interesting. I'm so fatigued  I can barely stand upright anymore."
Switching to a Gameboy and Kindle has really helped my insomnia,"If I lay in bed with the lights off then my own thoughts will keep me up for hours. To quiet my mind I catch up on some reading on a tablet or play some games on my PS Vita while laying in bed. Of course I've read many articles on insomnia saying that staring at backlit screens before bed contributes to the problem. Of course I could just buy paperbacks but ebooks are way more convenient and better for the environment. 

I dug up my original Kindle and immediately found myself nodding off while reading. It seems the lack of backlight makes a huge difference for me. I went ahead and ordered a Gameboy Advance and a handful of games from eBay for $25.  The Advance is last model without a backlight. Now the same thing is happening when I play it. I'm falling asleep mid game. As a bonus, the old Zelda and Mario games are fantastic. 

Just wanted to throw it out there for anyone else that likes to read or game before bed. Turns out staring at hundreds of tiny lights can make it harder to fall asleep at night. "
A trick for brain chatter at night,"Thought I'd share something that I found a couple months ago works most nights when I get what I call ""radio brain"" where it's like there's a radio tuned into multiple frequencies in my mind, of chatter and music (does anyone get that where you keep hearing a couple lines from a TV show or movie in your head??), and it's just on repeat, around and around and around when I get to bed. I started pretending it was a tape loop I could slow down, so I'm able to listen to it at a slow speed and get some control over it. It's like it helps to slow my entire brain down and I usually start dropping into sleep once I add some deep breathing."
"E.M Cioran, philosopher and author, suffered from severe insomnia all his life. Here are a couple of quotes from him.","Cioran is probably too dark for most people's taste. His insomnia was extremely severe, and some claim that he didn't sleep at all for half a century. He used to walk the streets of Paris every night, wearing a black coat and a serious expression. He had a love/hate relationship with his insomnia, thinking it both a curse and a blessing - he believed it had granted him lots of insight, but also alienated him from life.

Here are a couple of quotes he made about insomnia for those interested:

 - What is that one crucifixion compared to the daily kind any insomniac endures?

 - In the hours without sleep, each moment is so full and so vacant that it suggests itself as a rival of Time.

 - Impossible to spend sleepless nights and accomplish anything: if, in my youth, my parents had not financed my insomnias, I should surely have killed myself.

 - Just as ecstasy purifies you of the particular and the contingent, leaving nothing except light and darkness, so insomnia kills off the multiplicity and diversity of the world, leaving you prey to your private obsessions.

 - What strangely enchanted tunes gush forth during those sleepless nights!

 - The importance of insomnia is so colossal that I am tempted to define man as the animal who cannot sleep. Why call him a rational animal when other animals are equally reasonable? But there is not another animal in the entire creation that wants to sleep yet cannot.

And this is what he looked like:

I can't switch my brain off!,"Hey all, I have been struggling really badly with my insomnia lately. My primary problem is that I can't shut down and go to sleep. I can and do feel tired, but I often just lay in bed thinking and having my mind go everywhere but sleep for a long time.

I've tried OTC sleep aids, but now I just power through them. The messed up part is that in my waking hours, if/when I meditate, I can easily turn my brain off and think of nothing or blank out. For some reason, I am totally incapable of doing this when I am trying to go to sleep. Once I do sleep, I sleep fine and don't wake up, but this is driving me nuts.

I've always had insomnia problems, even as a little kid, but some times are better than others. Recently I have been through some hard times, got broken up with, moved, changed the hours I keep, my sleeping position/situation, etc. Previously when I was with my ex, we slept together and I could sleep perfectly well. I expect part of this is just familiarity, and situation changes. In that situation we typically went to bed at roughly the same time and in the same manner, which probably helped.

Even apart from her though, I've had better times. Last summer I was sleeping fine on my own, keeping late hours but typically waking at appropriate times and I don't recall having problems. Oddly, I can keep any hours and still wake up fine if I have something important to do, and I don't know why. Right now I have no firm things to do, and end up sleeping way too long. I am currently trying to move my alarms across the room to aid in wake up, but so far haven't slept to test it. I am also going to try to tire myself out more, which was something I felt helped in previous times when I slept better. 

The only other thing I can think of is that I changed my typical sleep position, for an unrelated reason. I don't think this is an issue though, because I've changed my sleep position multiple times over my life. 

So any thoughts or advice? Sorry that was so long, but thanks in advance for listening at least!"
A sleepless life.,"My entire life has been a losing battle with sleep. At night, my anxiety is unimaginable. Panic attacks, derealization, self harm, suicidal thoughts. I can‚Äôt take this anymore. I am not healthy in any sense.

Recently I‚Äôve just been staying awake, crying until sunrise and sleeping until noon or later. The day is gone before I know it, having done nothing and gone nowhere, and it‚Äôs nighttime again. Restart the excruciating cycle, cue the debilitating anxiety.

I don‚Äôt want to live like this anymore. I can‚Äôt. 18 years of this is enough. My body and mind can‚Äôt take it. I fucking hate that I have to exist. There‚Äôs nothing I can do. I can‚Äôt get better, and I can‚Äôt die. I‚Äôm stuck. I can never be a fully functioning adult, and I can never be independent. I wish I was never born.

I‚Äòm not planning suicide, don‚Äôt worry. Just needed to get this out, and this is my only option. Thanks for reading.

I didn‚Äôt expect that anyone would actually read this. I really appreciate the support, it means so much to me. Thank you!"
It's selfish but i wish i had insomniac friends,Or foreign ones or someone who would be up at this time of night so it isn't so bOring omg ahah. I used to go and find people online and that was fun for a while but it's so emotionally exhausting I wish I could meet up with someone who cares about me at this time of night so it'd be less frustrating. I wish I had friends in general tbh. The ones I do have don't care v much about me and if they do it's because they feel bad. Idk I just gave myself until next Tuesday to get everything sorted and I'm more of a mess than ever. I haven't even done these essays I have to do but I cant function enough for anything I write to make any literal sense. I fucking hate this. I think I give up I'm just going to take some of the stuff I have left and not care about the hangover lag tomorrow. Im getting so fed up of this I want to sleep but I really don't want to wake up tomorrow.
So stressed about not getting enough sleep that I can't sleep,"I get so anxious trying to get myself to sleep that I end up not getting any actual sleep. The idea of how important it is to get sleep literally prevents me from getting it. I try all sorts of tips and tricks to help myself sleep. I end up just lying in bed thinking ""I need to sleep otherwise I'm going to have another shitty day tomorrow."" 

I just can't stand it. The paradoxical situation I'm in. It gets to the point where I basically just end up keeping myself awake for about 20 to 24 hours and getting about 5 hours sleep max before it starts again.

I seem to even arouse myself from sleep in distress about not being asleep for long enough.

Anyone else relate? Anyone got any tips for dealing with this?"

We come from thousands of years of extreme suffering and strength.

I'll stop talking Jordan Peterson and/or Eckhart Tolle (if you have suffered you have a very low risk and high reward just to research and contemplate their teachings)  to stop focusing on aggresive thougts through no fault of their own. No one really, deeply wants to endure more suffering that they already have, and I'm guilty of bullying a few kids to up my social status when the moment presented its like a cat pouncing if not interested) and their unique moments of pleasure from spotting enemy boats, dolphin diving and nades spammin.  

Got myself some, benzos, some weed,tobacco, and tasty treats. Some alcohol, yet still awake for 3 days last week with anything but an microsleep when I lost awareness in dizziness for a sec. Trying to drag they buses and trucks the ""strongmen"" tv show do in the mind. 

Anyone else feel like that analogy for your brain and ego to admire a little self-wortj?  Not even a little huh, mind to busy. 

Making mistakes at work due to sleep deficit in a chicken fast food retailer Average 3 hour sleep including before theI got the Sat and weeks/months/years before it (avg mind, but a very static sleep chart on my phone so the GP, mental health staff and Docs, nurses and Psychs/therapits xx After those days awake, last weekend, I Drank 2 botlles of white trying to knock myself out to sleep on day 2/3 but not too harsh, Didn't work and sobering up from ""heavy"" alcohol binge to see the sun in the dawn is Achy and bland.

Not putting the counter for fried chicken your just made and dropped in the fried (an automatic rare mistake). Followed by breading chicken incorrectly.  tried  plus ssris ish types but not enough it seems.

Biggest effect for managing the mental illness were srris (would have went in normal day life,worse under stress like work crazy anxiety knife in hands nuts)was vaping weed to treat my anxiety/mood (which yes if you use low or mix with tobacco won't zonk you.

Diet is a riot 5 stones in 3 years, 19 bmi unhealthily thin to borderly obese at 29.



We don't get the care we need and deserve as truely suffering a horrendlously life alterating condition. How has people with severe chronic insomnia i.e 3 hours a night average.

 Went to NHS psychiatrist and got told ""your body will fall asleep when it needs to"". I almost laughed out loud. My type is getting hypnic jerks/myclonus as relaxing and falling asleep, waking after what 1 hour? Expected to treat my Anxiety and Depression and all this shit through behavioural models which had failed through trial and error.

Leaning over to the dark net now getting to grips with benzos and their addictive tendensies. Modafinil and Pregabalin have been the most important off the net, and Phenibut. Tianeptine sulphate not useful enough although a nice high with withdrawal worse that opiates and tianeptine is an antipressants AND opiate.

I've read stuff about benos. Their suffering withdrawals worse than any drug, yes even heroin and crack. Just tried to get a little bit of sleep before long work hours in a kitchen by popping a cheap pill. Still judging their use/wprtj pver negatives, not spent much in w/ds and chronic use/abuse for 2 weeks now.

Got some LSD too, Class A I know but I'm not woried overworked police officers will care, and if they do the cost wouls sick trash for them, and I use it for therapy and mental health issues. hmm. no invites copers.

Note; Just got back from the shop and dude, I was having so many thought patterns I jump around the place like a asslym seeker in EU cpuntries. (are these attempted jokes banned? Soz if are pls no perma. Probably would want to be a comedian in the future yikes comedy so bland literally women comedians would just end up attacking each other and then jump on a political party.

I love women. I love men. I love all. LSD and cannabis let me see women as equals and against the bigger religions views etc. I used LSD to try treat my insomnia and mental conditions, it showed me something I couldn't describe, only at 50uq for me it was potent maybe im sensitive. I seem morphin which freaked me haha but next time maybe ill have more introspection before jumping for some xanax and burying my  head in my pillow like a huffy 8 year old trying to manage the terror this lsd can cause. Perception changes are fucking enormous people. I took weed and realised ""Comedians are usually sad I wonder what they do ! "" I searched Jum Carrey, and found Eckhart Tolle. I disagree that you can just be in the present moment like a choice, I think he is over optimistic in our ""pain bodies"" momentum it carries through the collective unconscious like that first time you fire your bay blade into that shitty pastic arena thing.

I'm not going to fix this post I'd usually just delete this shit now but hey may some Pepega autismo incel tragic son of a bitch like me will enjoy this sht. Also reading with weed might help. Lsd and reading is.... I wouldnt like to do it yet anyway. Lsd made me love everyone and further forgive women in my life who cause me pain like my mother and other relations. We are all one. Naw, Im no psychotic im just 3 days sleep deprived trying to extrapolate a shit tonne of ideas from my head and a general low self esteem in my writing pride because its anonymous anyway I'll just delete it if its faggy (no offense just the happy faggy as in, your a fag because ur not giving that old women your seat. Not the gay. Also I was probably internalised homophobic before lsd, but now im like who gives a shit 

Also that knife shit about going nuts thats no worry no call the popo if i was gonna kill someone id of killed my mother when i was 11/12. What the fuck must she have done to me, I remember the verbal, emotional, psychological abuse but to want kill her the damage she was doing to me might have been worse than some physical kinds.

Fuck her. But I forgive her. Her intention was never to harm me, psychopaths are very low percentage chance, and categorised as illness too and even psychopaths can restrain themselves just like a horny incel that wants to rape. Im not afraid to talk about this sht cus I talked to many mental health professional and the general concensus is 90% of people think completely fucked up things but, anyway, mr/mrs autismo that read this whole thing. 

If ur a  hot grill message me, I'm not going to get catfished im fairly paranoid and extensively edgy as it is, and tbh, if a girl added me on the internet I'd probably block them just like on league of legends because my mind and emotions goes fucking nuts. What to say? Am I being cool? Is she into me? Am I thinking to much? Yes, ok. Focus on breath. I'm cold. Oh dude if this girl is into me it be so hot. Shit im fantasing about a girl who just wants to playt a game with me im so fucking sick. She made a joke with a kiss mark, is she flirting? Do I make a move? Shit shit shit. Fuck this get blocked noob hehe i play teemo jungle next 20 games fucking reeeeeeee.

I'm ok lads. Ok that one really concerned person reading to see if I say something anymore fucked up, who do you think you are dealing with here? If you draw are on diaviant art or something i l ike that sht hit me up.

3 days Ive been up dude. Have to buy my own etizolam, will knock me out whenever I use it thankfully but without it its just awful. Being up for more than 3 days without sleep is a drunken, stumbling, slurring, brain farting, -20IQ, but I probably more chance of getting a grill like this than with 9000 hours sleep how sad. Talking about girls again fucking get out of me man I know ying and yang are cool and all but, shit man, evolution make it hard - literally - to not think about women when a depressed, alone, never gf, over school age, mentally ill, internet diagnoso autismato certified by Dr Nick!  Childless, relationshipless, my therapist says this is actually a good thing for me because id be taking on others problames but (fuck if reddit has a character counter im going to be pissed I dont want to edit this crap im spewing out intuitive Kappa all over the place.

So right, no gf or kids, die alone etc a lot of western scariest thing. But you know, with meditation and Buddhism (not stricktly tied to the institutional buddhism) you can find peace within yourself. I dont want to be 50 getting boners when I go outside to get a fucking apple. Jesus christ, it slike im 14, im on high dosage ssri paroxetine kills sex drive, still get fucking boners reeeeeee. cant fucking use them feelsbadman.

would you ever become gay in a situation like this just for comfort and sexual pleasures etc? Im like 97% straight just and prostate massage froma  cock would be nice based on my own experiment but the smell is not a fucking cinderalla or jasmine its a fucking gragas or santa after running around the world delivering presents when his dog with the red nose is sick. Women smell so nice, heres a spicy story. I was living in halls up at a close uni to mine, and everyone was out on break, so I got super horny tried to enter a girls room and holy sht... the door was open. I walk around hoping to find a nice dildo but I find out something disappointing, its  a pair of panties absolutely drenched in female pheremones. Fuck, im not gay. Gay would be so easier dude i hate women cus of my mom and sister. Trans is just like, its hot porn but , i mean yeah id like to do it irl if she is hot but.... Im not fucking C9 Sneaky that dude makes me uncomfortable he makes me question fucking eternity and space and everything when he dresses like a cute girl and I want to fucking judge him since i got bullied at school and my parents would judge me but damn id probably fuck him.

there it is, Like it may feel nice but the smell of guy, sweat, semen, dude, im a guy and that shit just aint pleasant or... sexually satisfying. 

Anyway insomnia fucks people up man. I see shadows at corners of eyes past 40 hours awake. I dont give a fuck about that shadow people sht its too drama and unstimulating for me. Ive seen fucking hallucinations. I downed this liquid once at a party at uni campus to impress a girl, no idea what was in it, fucking burned my nose drank 500 ml of spirit could have died but yolo haha xd. I spent time in college observing !alphas! and they just reckless smash shit up fucking retarded johnny bravo motherfuckers, Im more of a Tyler Durden myself. Watched that film on lsd the other day, it was great until I seen how it was basically Hollywood dictating what is really from fantasy, trying to pull you in, tell you what is real isnt, pulls you in again. fuck that shit man. 

That dude has insomnia in fight club. I love that sht. Its sort of an ego identity. Im meditating frequently when I can, obviously not right now shit went down at work didnt want to get pushed around like bullies did in high school fuck sake lose a job 10 years after high school still quit a damn good job, because of the kitchen staff were fucking amazing. The stories, the lifestyle, cant fucking remember their names on Facebook and my old phone broke with their numbers.... so mad. So what, I cant remember names, dont judge me. I dont know why i cant remember names. 

A name is like, identity. Human 1, Human 2. Mother, father. Baby, Adult. McDonalds, Burger King. Trump, one sec im gonna hit some weed not hit in like 9 hours dude./ Nah im not taking a hit yet, want to wait till im queuing  up in league with my teemo jungle sheeeet weed dude hahah so cool ahaha. Actually only tried at 25, after everything else failed. and it showed me the spiritual side of life with its perception changes. It fucking saved my life. I fucks with me,.. She, fucks with me. The downs, the paranoids, the anxiety, the weed hangovers, but damn. So what if people become lazy stoners and sit around... guess what, they wont. Sitting around is fucking BORING. As a depressed medically sick note autismo gibs not having my job anymore at kfc sucks ass. I miss it, but I dont miss any sort of letting some bitches and wanks verbally rub their nutsack on my face just to keep happy a bit. I need to find their names dude and get some one on one, the stories of others, not just boring college people. all the same shit, REAL people living at 48 working at fucking kfc in the kitchen. Now thats the guy I want to talk to.

Women. If my dick never got hard for women, I'd probably like less of them. fair statement, would go both ways. I like their... emotions, fuck its hard to differentiate when your dick in your brain spazies out when you try think about a girl man im fucking neutring you dude nah im not chill my .... no, racism is... it can be funny if it isnt bullying, like joking amongst buddies. Taking the shit outta each other. Im watching some korean lol streamer called Rush, and he keeps calling americans fatty burger faces. Now thats funny, im uk and im shit teeth yellow and drink tea, but from scotland too so im a ginger FREEEEEEEEDDOOOOMMMMM  intoxicated drunk Irish singing partners grandad. 

But women,, fuckkk. Guys are funnier dude, I laugh and joke so make dudes. Some women are out of this word funny, but they aint the comedians on tv they are real life Holemies. I added the girl my sister works with right, if thats you then go ahead message me btch but Im not going long term I do not believe in it humans are fleeting energy dancing between chaos and order and chaos and order cannot fucking stay together especially my parents man.

I cant even remember them fighting but im so sure i used to cover my ears with my pillow to hear them stfu. I told my dad about my mums over abusive behaviour, he says stuff like western daddy dad, chin up, look after your mum she doesnt mean it, sticks and stones (I want to puke at that sht, id rather get my arm broken than this suffering of my soul if feels like im not alive or dead but again in the middle, suborbatory or some sht whatever that christmas thing is.

I want some homies to talk to, and hollies. Im white so i dont get black culture too much i dont listen to rap music except nicki minaj she is best rapper. Anyway, Queen were a great band but Coldplay I fucking loved dude. Their first album, sends me away from my pains and merges with the pain of everyone feeling the same frequency of pain and says ""its ok to feel this, we are here together, you are not alone, you can calm down your nervous system"" where as my body now is like fuck you this is my nervous system bitch overclock this son of a gun lets go fucking nuts.

Ofc this is the id that Frued refers to in his psychotherapy works, the id, subconscious and conscious.

My central nervous system is like... fried man. Fucking might as well be a chicken at least id be tastier. Like wtf man i have to take an ssri, a newly invented drug to not kill myself? What would I have done 100 years ago? Fucking, I'd probably have killed myself or alcoholic. My mums Dad was alcoholic, died from liver alcohol damage. My mums brother was a heroin addict, died 6 months after his mum died (my mums mum, my gran, blood relative). My poor mum. My poor uncle. Heroin man, he got into weed at 12 and then into heroin just naw fuck society. I'm on a razors edge between the same fate. Tried Codeine I hate that warm euphorice hazy sht it reminds me of Breaking Bad scene floating and sht and hell naw I prefer benzos but that sht meant to be worse than heroin withdrawal. going to get off them soon when I get back into meditation.

I tried self medicating in Novermber after I asked a Psychiatrist twice for help, twice 2 years ago, plenty of GPs. I respect benzos are dangerous, I havent withdrawn from any yet just some etizolam and vals to help that rollercoaster of xanax (never used) style ups and downs with th short half life.

Met a guy on the bus the day before I quit KFC. was going to hospital with 30 vals for her. He said ""I bet you think im just some annoying cunt hurry the fk up and stfu get out my way"". I looked him dead in the eye (I was on a bit of Etiz tbh so that helped me not freak out) and said ""I see everyone as the same"". His face paused, eyes locked on me, expressionless. I wonder if anyone had ever told this man he is loved. He looked fucked up by drugs. Ive stopped teh description cus as I said internet is  aplace of everyone and maybe drug kings reading this sht like yeah boy i got a new homie to smack up, so hell naw I want to work for Jessie Pinkman tho that crew was sound (Glasgowegian term: Sound = cool = No problemo = Love thy neighbour). Id watch that show again just the drama is fucking booorrrinnggg second time walters wife and my hatred for women man fuck me it gets toastie in my nervous system it wants to fucking flying of the face of the earth to fucking Neptune to cool down a bit. Dude im pretty sober now, this is just insomnia and my autismo mind. Im sorta high IQ, my mom says im pretty. My dad says im smart. My friend says im funny. Some girl says im so big, girls, thats a compliment we want to here man our fucking chimp brain implodes and we feel like Zues pounding the mother earth (my greek mythology sucks sorry if it sucks reference).

I'd like to hug a girl, sure whatever sex is great but not without complications, id like to share silently, explore, meditate, just fucking be without wanting something all the timee. But where are these girls, and where the fuck is my self-esteem dude gimmie dat back dats mine bro. I feel my mom took my self-esteem, crushed my soul with her black heart and death vibes with her postnatal depression, furthter depression, chronic anxiety and just taking that shit out on your kids is shit. 

I got into trouble at school a lot, wait sht, talk about women again. boobs are nice, bagina is nice, butt nice, leg, feet, hand, neck, head, hair, only bit  women i dont like i probably her poops and her brain. But thats not fair just a quick joke man, shes a man-eater look out boy here she comes. What the fuck did she do to me. I've always been shy, sensitive I think, but, just, crushed in confidence. I loved my dad so much I didnt want anything in my life to harm him. My mum..... she told me she bottle fed me cus breast feeding too sore, dont know significance but I understand. Again I forgive my mother for everything her childhood sounds shit, alcholic dad never home, emotionally abusive mom with .. having a fag lads. Dont smoke just during high stress cus i dont get addicted and confident i can quit, quit job at kfc cus bully managers, girls im a steal come get me. Actually dont im scared of you all i know the potential for girls to get into my emotional ""heart"" and wreck it ralph for funsies, well not funsies its fantasy acted out in reality unfortunately of suffering. 

Dude ive had dreams of cutting dead bodies up for art like on Dexter, necrophelia, stupid fucking freudian big fucking black trains cus i went on 4chan al last summer and always blacked pictures fuck that site its funny tho seen a random soldier steal a tank like on gta never for reported to national news dont think but was unreal. he was drunk he was just trollin bro, lighten up usa. fucking, soldiers. I wont say much. I dont know if the deep cia etc really care about da normie or da autismo internetster or just care about his/her paycheck cocaine and probably lighting up a jay. I mean how can a deep state person start a family, its suicicde dude. We all the same family. if earth blows up, we reconnect with the univerese. the tragedy of self-conscoius life ends. something else happens.

If I have a family holy shit id love my kids so much it would hurt me, i might e ven suduko cus of current mental illness in future relapse, or wife is like my mom in which case i fucking take several lines of cocaine, go strippers, shit what else you do in gta, fucking dirt bike to top of mountain and jump off and glide, steal a plane with a horse with no name and 9/11 into home street to say what up to my mates.

See I fucking, well, i didtched all my homies i grew up with. most of them got into hard drugs, my best mate is now blind, blinded by his gf smacking him with a phone into a coma. i fucking seen him in the indian shop the other day, i was in there with him. he didnt know i was there. I didnt talk to him. That cunt bullied the shit out of me when younger, maybe my mum fucked up but this guy took out my butt plug and shoved it somwhere nasty like... clintons pussie? yikes. dude politics is fucking something man, this timeline, putin, trump, brexit, shit is suck tho so much suffering.

If I talk shit for 28000 words then come to this realisation then its worth to me man, its a shit truth tho. life is suffering.

#on lsd, i felt for 30 mins at the peak of the trip in a place of no where. i didnt feel anything inside me, no soul etc.

~I was like ""go get some water"" and then the body was like ""why dude"" and so I just stood bent over in one position for 30 mins my legs in pain but again my brain say ""im in pain bro quick gimme some luba luba from yo moma"" but  I just accepted it and stayed silent, still, present, eckhart tolle id take his dick. buddhas too i tihnk althought probably lot of shit going on in tibet with gangs and that sht he has to support or help  i dont know.

Its a pretty painful experience like it aint pretty realising time is eternity and always now and everything else in mind is an illusion, perhaps consciousness itself. I mean as long as I get sex tho right. High give my bros...

chap ... chap ...

Are you Mr Blue? 

why yes and you are?

Im mr going to round house kick you into your mirror cus you knocked my daughter up.

wel sheet the condom just kill it man its no fun get abortion.

Is abortion bad though, like really. I dont think so. I kill life everyday by being alive. organisms die in my bodies defence. whatever idc.

Suicide though, like what the fuck. I mean im doing alright just now i suppose, cant complain (3000 word complaint btw)said to my therapist suicide should be allowed, its not fair on the patient.Why do people have to stay alive, there is nothing in meditation or in the state i felt in lsd that said life is a must. On that LSD dude, I tried to move but either my mind said or I realised ""I dont have to mve"" but I was like dude lets go lets take a piss man and my conscoiusness was like like ""no, you watch this, shut up, learn, just, be"".

So I did that and I grew from it. being in pain and being alright? Pain an illusion? So many less medications. I want my brain back dude. Most people I was competing with in my classes went on to get degrees and are doctors, laywers, sceintists and Im fucking, worked in mcdonalds could keep it down, kfc twice nope, deliver china man food nope, help old women with their shits and food no that was too hard but most rewarding. cex was alright just bully manager was a bint although, w.e. I want to play teemo jungle man. I want to level 2/3/4 gank all lanes with red buff and smite, spam laugh, raise emote and mastery.

I also want to say.Space. Everything. Emotions. People. Just breathe.. All we know for sure is our most ancient know and this is of breath, maybe. shit i need some meds or somethin getting bit dizzy. sht what is it.diazepam i think just 5mg should do.its only 10am//// what the fuck. I mean ill take 5mg of valium sure but kinda sucks seems like a sorta intense w.d.

Pregabalin was interesting, good and bad. good it fucking works mate if you like Phenibut then this will give you some extra resilience that according to Jordan Peterson you would have if you didnt get shat on your whole like mentally. Mums job to raise childs mental. She should of protected me ebtter. Now I play childrens video game, over 6660 hours. 900$ down. free game, how did fiddle even lose. WTF is the toxicity in this game im feeling anxious, I used like 3mg etizolam like 10 hours ago so hey its probably that, i take so valium or some etiz or that drug clonazepam i got to stop spasms in my sleep. 

Dude meditation when you get into it is better than any drug. Its just getting past the point of using drugs to get by man.      Fucking vision if fucking up man like i close my eyes open then room spins. Alcohol does that, maybe gaba drug, prob etiz couple hours to go for pregabalin, shit this sucks.

dude i better not be illt or  osme sht.

i feel like sht, but since that lsd i well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, im fucking nodding dude. i had 3 cups coffe 2 modafinil. Fucking etizolam this is what i mean it can fuck u up 2 weeks use not even every day max dose 8mg a day.

I got etiz for Insomnia! actually relevent! I kept going into work with no sleep staying up 30 hours + before start shift etc. 2 secs my face burning up dont run out of benzos kids.

Cool took  5mg diazepam, you know dude if my post gets deleted ill be pissed, but at least if a mod can read ill will feel better, say something gay like ""chin up bud"" or ""its ok man, Ill come over to your house and give u the giraffe, i know your not gay but you said butthole pleasure (gta vice city, radio right? Listen to gta radio now folks, playing the game tho is kinda, dude it pretty bad)

Im fucking pissed at games nowadays man. Microtransactions and loots, fucking dlcs, season passes, give me a full fucking game like I used to get with the customisation built in and not all about graphics ok man? GTA4 story was great and the airport was so much fun on multiplayer, I watched DansGaming and Forsen on twitch.tv play gta4 again and as an adult and like 10 years old that sht was still releveant and entertaining as fk.

really shows you with gta5. the fuck was that game dude. im driving around with sweet graphics jumping into army base to steal a jet, get out, get jumbo plain fly about, hey cool. The story tho? I like the white mafia guy aigh? He goes to see a therapist or something, probably court ordered right unlike myself *tips Benadryl* or some insomnia meme I dont want cringe shit Im from twitch chat 7 years running dude i know my shit never modded either i suck no ones dick but my own once just the tip it was aight just fleshy and warm.

Oh dude I think that etizolam w.d is going away man. that sht was like getting into a pretty bad lsd trip. fucking vision darting around, like when your really, really  REALLY drunk and your vision keeps fucking going up and down like yoyo and its funny as fuck but scary as hell. Yeh, that shit, bright lights sucked and headache. 

Only reason I got benzo as i was saying, and its Etizolam, was because of working. I have chronic insomnia lads/laddetes/oneness/future hot gamer gf who is turned on by my autism means wtf is wrong with her fucking run it sthe cia knock knock motha fucka I gonna wreck ur house and steal your lidl pc to find you bought a fucking dildo. Hmm. I wonder if sex toys in the uk especially will remain legal.

Auto women are becoming a thing, they have to be banned, absolutely. Im fucking mi5.mi6 and my population dont need the drama and mindless stress and pain that keeps them confused and wagecucking to pay for the worlds shitty karma. I wanted to join raf man as pilot. dad got me a shitty laptop from work for peanuts (very cheap uk slang) and i went to game shop, 3 pc games for 10 pound jismed man. Theme hopsital, flight simulator 98, the sims. Throw in age of empires 2 man I back in the late 90s, friends still on, charlie sheen no melt down yet, no 9/11. 

I typed some sht man but need to tidy and smarten up a bit or some paramedic gonna come. I want a hooker man. I need some pussy. I dont need just really want on biological need level. constant incessant noise in my head (grab her by pussy) oh sht im definitely banned from reddit now no pls not back to 4chan and pol/r9k its fucking exhausting getting by all the shills and tribalism. 

On that, what the fuck are we all thinking. Immigration at level never seen. Total culture shift in 1 generation. Once white dudes stop going to football and get all tribal on peoples ass theres gonna be gangs popping up. I mean there already is drugs gangs from asia and rape/child sht from middle east north africa right? I dont know what to say about that.

Dude insomnia is a killer illness literally. Look at my delerium, well most just excess mumbling autismo (no sure reddit is ok with calling anything stupid anything other than ""stupid"" which is double standard, stupid people arent stupid by choice, its discriminatory and we have a duty to look after stupid people). Some people think of masterrace of high IQ, I mean like, skt want 5 fakers, argentina want 11 messies even in goal that dude run up the post overhead kick from the bar to save penalty.

I said i took 5mg valium right?hmm. I have been up for 3 days, typing like a true autismo right now. My mom even asked if I thought I might be autstic last year, I mean I understand her concern, but that fact she caused the majority of my psychological damage, well her, Chris, Dad wasn't perfect he got scary and sectarian and I want to see him actually, need to get my benzo right can be having fucking shitty lsd trip at 10am 8-9 hours after dropping about 4 mg etizolam, kindling perhaps.

Phenibut is suchan awesome substance, Phenibut, Caffeine, (no order) Modafinil, and Pregabalin dude. I was meditating (just breath concentration focus  meditation on breath no gomba stomp awoooa throat swallowing shit and while I noticed little to no changes over the month, when I stopped, dude I fucking felt psychotic the thoughts just coming in like whot he fuk you think you are my mother? who didnt respect my personal boundaries as a child treating me as a secondary human being rather than an actual person. Fuck man. Life. Its not her fault. She had her own trauma. Now her son is using benzos to try fucking manage mama mia!

Anyway pregs was good to 450mg for a few weeks when i was meditation, my back started to like give up in strength and my body jolted away, this was super intrusive to my meditation and triggered me. I wanted to get back down to 300mg or 150mg but as soon as I started dropping the dosage my sleep went to shit and I already had insomniai so that was fucking fun jesus. Got etiz to make sure, twice a week , i can get some fucking sleep fo im not up for 80 hours working 3./4 shifts. Alas, feel kinda memory fucked after etiz and foggy, might be better just stayin up. Phenibut, coffee, modafinil, paracetamol, ibuprofen, propranolol. Great kit for you to have to do stuff when you get no sleep. Also working twice a week, Phenibut gains no tolerance used twice a week and no more vast majority of people. So you take that befoer you sleep and you wake up ready to go to work regardless of shit mood and sleep.

Gonna smoke some, play some teemo jungle idk man,60-70 hours awake. Add me on reddit         xxxx

Full moon eclipse and insomnia,"I‚Äôm curious, anyone here have an extra difficult time with sleep last night? I didn‚Äôt sleep at all :/ but I didn‚Äôt realize it was a full moon until morning. I don‚Äôt regularly struggle with insomnia, maybe once a month. I‚Äôm trying to find info about the lunar cycle and it‚Äôs effect on sleep patterns- anyone know about that? "
Waking up at the same time every night...,"Does anyone know why that might be? I fall asleep somewhat easily at a reasonable time but around 4 AM (plus or minus maybe 15 minutes), I wake up... and then I can't get back to sleep until around 6 AM-ish, then I'm up for work at 730 AM. 

It's just so weird that it's around the same time every night. I wake up and think to myself ""i bet it's 4 AM' again""... then i look at the clock, and it's usually around 4, it's so strange.

The only thing I can think of is blood sugar dropping or going up... i don't know anything about blood sugar lol but that's the only thing i can think of that would be clockwork like that."

I just want what they gave Michael Jackson.,[edit] Chill. It‚Äôs literally a joke. I‚Äôve been making this joke since the day he died.
Almost 40 hours,"This never happened before, im 21 years old and for the first time im not gonna be able to sleep for the second night in a row. My girlfriend is soundly asleep next to me and im just staring through the window at 6 am watching the sunrise...what the hell is going on "
Trazodone oversleep,"My doctor prescribed me 25 to 50 mg of trazodone as a sleep aid (I also take effexor for depression/anxiety).

I took my first trazodone pill last night (50 mg) at about 1 am. I was unable to wake up until almost 2 pm today, and even then, I spent all afternoon groggy. It‚Äôs evening now and I still feel like I have no energy to get up.

Did anyone experience extreme sleepiness with trazodone?

I was previously taking clonazepam for anxiety, which helped me to sleep beautifully and I would wake up early and rested. But my doctor didn‚Äôt want to renew the clonazepam and opted for trazodone since it‚Äôs not addictive."
"Does anyone else get to the ""silly thoughts"" part of falling asleep before waking up","i hope this makes sense, i am up since a while now. i am unluckily new to the insomnia club and just wondered. i usually can't calm my mind so when i go to bed, i just start thinking about something. then there is the part where my thoughts just drift off and become ""silly"" nothing i make up in my conscious mind. Usually that's where I'd fall asleep, but that's now the part where i am just rocked back to being aware that i almost fell asleep there. 



is there a name for that? "
what if taking your work space out of your bedroom is not an option?,"I'm sure loads of people deal with this. I have a roommate and I am a music producer so I can't just plop my desk and all my gear into the living room. LOL its kind of a luxury to say ""Have a room for your bed and a room for your work space"""
"Does anyone else have random nights where they sleep quickly and easily, even during the (otherwise) worst periods of insomnia?","I notice that my insomnia tends to be cyclical, which, during the worst periods, tends to involve countless nights of a period of light half-sleep at best. This could last for several days, leaving me exhausted and barely adequately functional. I would describe my sleep hygiene as being average, as I do my best to avoid caffeine later in the day and try to minimize my screen time. Even during my best efforts to improve my sleep hygiene, I notice that my poor sleep is relatively unaffected either way. Sometimes, however, oddly enough - I periodically have nights where I do absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, and yet I fall deeply asleep within 15-20 minutes of hitting the pillow for a good 5-7 hours. 

This perplexes me. My theory is that my mind and body are so desperately in need of sleep that the biological need outweighs whatever underlying factor may be preventing me from falling asleep. This lasts for a night or two, and then the deadly cycle repeats itself. Does this happen to anyone else?"
Self-administered CBT-I with (almost) immediate success,"Warning: long post

I don‚Äôt have any problem staying asleep, I have a massive, sanity-threatening problem falling asleep at a ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù time. So bad I have, at times, broken up my sleep into a few hours at night and a few hours daytime ‚Äúnap.‚Äù I can no longer nap or sleep in and got desperate for a solution. Even considered meds, but I reeeeally don‚Äôt want to go down that road. I know all about sleep hygiene, blue light, read several melatonin studies etc. I always resisted the formulation that my problem is discipline-mediated, but I am rethinking my thinking on my sleep. 

I learned about CBT-I and sleep restriction a few days ago and committed to giving it a try. Downloaded the free CBT-i Coach app, developed by Stanford Medicine for the VA (fucking in love with it). For a couple months before this, I‚Äôd been consistently advancing my wake time, not sleeping in on weekends. I use Alarmy now so I don‚Äôt hit snooze for 2 hours like I used to. But my sleep efficiency (time in bed vs time actually sleeping) has been completely fucked. In my struggles, I developed a Pavlovian association between my bed and misery. CBT-I is helping me break this. 

My average sleep time is creeping up toward 6 hours, which I am thrilled about. My goal is 7, but all things in their time. It‚Äôs only been a few days, so I‚Äôm fully expecting to have some bad nights and set-backs. However, just knowing from experience now that I am capable of falling asleep within minutes of getting in bed has been a game changer. It feels weird to force myself to stay up when I am sleepy, but I am learning what truly sleepy feels like!

Self-talk has been instrumental too. Rather than dread the next sleep-deprived day, I tell myself I have functioned on zero sleep (true) so a few hours deprivation is nothing! I know the more sleep deprived I am, the better my chance of sleeping well, and it‚Äôs all part of the process. 

I am taking ~1mg melatonin 2h before sleep. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs particularly effective, or hasn‚Äôt been in the past, but I am doing it to strengthen the Pavlovian conditioning for sleepiness in my nighttime routine. No night eating, no screens within 2h of bed, reading in dim light to wind down (not in my bed!) plus the usual sleep hygiene stuff. 

Just wanted to share my early success. If you all have experience or tips for the CBT-I method, I‚Äôd love to hear it (support and encouragement only please). 

**Edit**: It is recommended that a CBT-I program be monitored by a qualified professional who can tailor it to your individual needs and be sure you are doing this safely.

Funniest Insomniac conversation,"Here is the funniest (so far and probably forever.) conversation I have had.

Please share yours in the comments

So i was walking down the path with my friend

Me: Y'know, I had the best fucking night last night.

Friend: HELLA YEH I knew you got Laid, who was She. How was it? 

Me:uhhh

Friend: Are you gay? Coz it's fine if you fucked a dude.

Me: No-

Friend: C'mon I'm getting excited tell me!

Me: I HAD 6 HOURS OF SLEEP AFTER 78 HOURS OF BEING AWAKE!

Friend: Oh. You should get Laid."
Anybody else with this problem? (details in post),"I'd say my insomnia is not that bad, when I'm tired (and am lucky) I can fall asleep within 30 minutes. When I'm not, 60-90 minutes.

My problem is that when I'm right on the edge falling asleep, any noise (even just someone opening a kitchen drawer) can disturb me, it somehow throws me off track, I fully wake up, drowsiness is gone, and I won't fall asleep in the next 60-120 (or more) minutes?!

Is this a symptom of insomnia or is everyone like this?"
Do you guys ever go too long without sleeping and then you get too much anxiety to even try falling asleep thinking you won‚Äôt wake up...?,
Does anybody get freezing cold / shivering when sleep deprived?,"This is my biggest issue when I'm sleep deprived (<6 hours)... I feel super cold, my whole body shivering, sweating, even when it's 20-25C or under a hot shower. No amount of clothes can fix it.

I can deal with the tiredness but the extreme cold sometimes makes it impossible for me to even leave home, it's so frustrating..."
Insomnia is like a Chinese Finger Trap,"Insomnia seems to be much like the classic novelty gag, the Chinese Finger Trap.  The more your struggle, the harder you pull your fingers away, the tighter and more trapped you are.  I think insomnia should be dealt with much in the same way as dealing with the Chinese finger trap: by pushing towards it, and leaning into it gently, yet hardly moving....but instinctively we want to freak out, panic and pull away violently.   It's this mindset, ironically, that can keep you trapped.  Read this for an interesting philosophical insight of this novelty item... http://portlandpsychotherapyclinic.com/2013/03/chinese-finger-traps-what-novelty-item-can-teach-us-about-acceptance/

Do you really want to get better and be your old self?   Thinking about how to get better -- how to get out of this -- is not going to help you sleep.  Over-analyzing sleep is not good.  Nor is doing back flips and changing the essence of who you are to appease your fears.  The answer to getting better is to be yourself -- stop pulling so hard.  Stop trying so hard.  There is no need to try to figure anything out, or really ""do"" anything -- virtually all of it is counterproductive...at least it was for me... I had the most insane insomnia ever but I've slept well for many years now.  Yet I still think about insomnia every day...and make no mistake, I'M STILL IN THE TRAP! as we all are -- but I've got wiggle room now...I can breathe...I don't freak out anymore...and I'm sleeping.....  The answer is in the mindset of the Chinese finger trap.  Don't avoid insomnia...don't try to escape it... Move towards it. Make room. Face your fears head on -- make friends with them...be one with them -- go to sleep with them.  One day you'll wake up in the future and notice that they seemed to have fizzled away without you even noticing.

I realize a lot of people here will not like this idea....it's too easy.  it's not sexy.  It's not intellectual.  It's not scientific. Many won't believe it... But it works because it loosens the grip and ends the war.   If any of the quack answers from the world's sleep experts worked then everyone would be cured by now.

It's futile to fight against insomnia.  Digging for answers is a fools game because the answers don't exist.....at least not in my experience.  This is a tough pill to swallow, I admit........But that doesn't mean you can't sleep. I promise you that you can. If I can sleep, anyone can...... Again, stop the war -- be nice to yourself and lean into your insomnia emotionally...become friends with it -- don't run away from it.  It's an unbelievable paradox that goes against all your instincts, yet probably makes perfect sense at the same time. You might be surprised at how being warm, thoughtful, patient and nice to your insomnia problem might help you to remember how to sleep again.   I'm not even kidding.  There's something to it.

  I live this life every day.  I sleep every night.  And if my mind tries to ""pull,"" I have learned to push back in mentally. I don't fight myself intellectually anymore or try to figure things out....This mindset is instinctive to me now...and the thing is, once you become one with your problem and you start sleeping, then you cease to have a problem anymore because you will have learned that there is nothing to be afraid of; insomnia is not something to attack or run away from emotionally...but in fact, it's something to lean in to and be nice to.

I think this will help people with insomnia.,"I recently bought some BCAA supplement powder for recovery after the gym. I decided one night to take 1 scoop before bed and I had the best night sleep of my life. Since then I've done it every night for a week and every night from falling asleep im out until the morning which is unheard of for me. I usually toss and turn all night.
Here is a link to the stuff I bought - https://www.myprotein.com/sports-nutrition/bcaa/10529280.html
Hope this helps."
I'm surprised this sub doesn't have more people on it,"I thought insomnia was a fairly common thing? Like half, if not more of people had it?"
My personal guide to improving sleep,"Hey guys I just thought I'd list a bunch of stuff that I do that helped me from sleeping 5 hours to 7 and a half hours.

1. 3 minutes of meditation 3 times a day. Breathing in and out and closing my eyes and trying to empty my thoughts completely.
2. I use a SAD lamp in the morning to get rid of morning melatonin and keep my day/night cycle in check in the winter.
3. I use a Sunrise alarm clock but i realise these are quite expensive.
4. 1 hour before bed I make my bed, brush my teeth, open the bedroom window a crack to cool the room down and go downstairs.
5. I walk from one side of the room to the other for 20 minutes to tire me out while listening to podcasts on spotify/ firetube.
6. I turn on my Himalayan salt lamp for half an hour while I sit on the couch and let the red light increase my melatonin levels whilst I read/ listen to podcasts.

Good luck! "
Having my life crippled by something so stupid is just absolutely cruel.,"It just doesn't seem to matter what I do. I am miserably and chronically tired by day, yet can lay in bed all night and never fall asleep. I am so sick of this. I'm sick of waking up at 11:30am or later in a stressed, foggy, and anxious state. I know I'm not pleasant to be around like this and that I'm a lazy piece of shit because of how terribly exhausted I am.

That's all."
Sleeping soundly for almost 2 months.,"I was diagnosed with Chronic Insomnia a little under 3 years ago. I've always been a bad / restless sleeper (nightmares, sleepwalking, etc), but I've always managed my ""standard 5 hours"" of sleep. Then a few years ago things took a turn for the worse.

I was regularly going days with zero sleep. Sleep Deprivation Reset Therapy helped when it got bad, but that in itself is its own form of torture and I hated doing it.

I've taken max dosage of every drug available, tried every sleep therapy there is and tried all the ""holistic"" natural shit that you can imagine. Nothing worked well, long, or consistently, leaving me frustrated and at the end of my rope.

Then a buddy of mine with a restless, autistic child recommended a ""weighted blanket"". They're expensive as shit, but at that point I had spent way too much trying to sleep and bit the bullet.

I have not regretted it since. Two months since my initial post on it and here's my follow up.

I'm sleeping soundly EVERY night. I'm averaging 6 to 7 hours, which is ungodly for me, and I rarely ever get up to pee anymore. (No, I'm not wetting the bed. Really.)

I've got a 25 pounder (I really like the heavy, heavy weights), of one of the mid-priced ones (I won't list brand, as I'm sure they're all pretty similar) and it is literally the best thing I have every purchased.

So that's my update. For me, weighted blankets beat out pills, meditation, therapy, and every remedy out there. If you're at the end of YOUR rope, I highly recommend it.

Because I've never slept better.

Anyone else's heart rate increases when trying to sleep?,"Whenever I try to sleep, my heart rate goes up a ton... Like as if I just had a few cups of coffee. I've tried everything ranging from melatonin, to music, to reading, but my heart just feels like it's gonna beat out of my chest, and of course, I can't sleep cause of this. "
Do you ever get so sleep deprived you feel like you're losing your mind?,"Admittedly, I have a lot more going on that just insomnia but normally I can function decently.

The past 3 weeks or so, I've had insane insomnia. I cannot fall asleep until 5 or sometimes even 7 in the morning and then I wake up around 8 or 9 am.

My brain just feels like it isn't working right. I know it literally isn't because of sleep deprivation but sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I can't think. I get easily confused and I can't remember things.

I know I should probably talk to my doctor about this (I have a non-related appt. in August) but I really don't want her to try to give me a prescription for something like Ambien."
Anyone else find it difficult to go to sleep before you're so sleepy you can't think?,"Been having this issue for years and years now. I planned around it in college because I was able to schedule my classes for the afternoon, but now that I'm getting ready to work actual jobs, I feel like it's going to be a huge problem.

Going to bed before I'm 100% can't-keep-my-eyes-open-sleepy is really unpleasant for me. My anxiety increases dramatically. My thoughts race, my heart races, I sit in the dark staring at nothing and thinking about all the things I'm scared of and all the things I'm worried about. I think a lot about death and mortality. I get hot and uncomfortable. It feels like being in a coffin. I don't know why, on paper it sounds like the silliest thing in the world. 

So instead of doing that, I just stay up until I'm incredibly sleepy, so that when I do get in bed I can barely think about anything. In fact, when I'm that sleepy I tend to just think about things that aren't scary - like my favorite movies and video games, girls, traveling the world. Now that I think about it, it almost seems like when I get really sleepy I'm less able to be anxious and I just fall asleep thinking about cool stuff, the way I did back when I was a kid/teen.

Even then, I always keep my phone with me so I can listen to podcasts and/or relaxing music (jazz/instrumental/ambient stuff) in case it takes me a while to fall asleep. When I feel like I'm getting REALLY damn sleepy and can't process what I'm hearing, I pull my earbuds out and fall asleep.

Unfortunately, while this 'works' and I get 8 hours of sleep, my sleep time ends up running from 6 AM to 2 PM. This is not optimal. Even without considering the problems I'd run into with a normal 9 to 5 job, it's still starting to bother me. During my waking hours, the sun is up for 4 hours and I spend the other 12 in the darkness of night. I'm positive this is affecting and compounding my anxiety and depression. I spend a lot of time alone with no one to talk to because everyone else is asleep.

I've tried to 'reset' this sleep schedule quite a few times now. I've woken up at 7 AM after only 2 hours of sleep, hoping that I could be tired enough to sleep by midnight or 2AM at the latest.

But I cannot describe the feelings of dread I get when I get into bed at midnight. It feels like I'm laying down to die. I have no clue why. Even knowing that if I can successfully start falling asleep at midnight, I can start getting up in the morning with the rest of the world and I'd have more time in which to talk to my friends and see the world in daylight and hear birdsong, I still feel incredibly anxious getting in bed that early.

Maybe I'm scared of the night, in a way. Not the dark - I love eating popcorn and reading creepy stories on Reddit in the 4AM gloom. But a small part of me feels like I need to be awake all night. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so maybe in a way I'm trying to wait until the rest of the world 'has my back' before I go to sleep, in case something happens. Which is silly since there are plenty of emergency service people working at 3 in the morning. But who knows. I don't know how my brain works.

I'm going to try yet again to fix my sleep schedule by waking up at 7 and going to bed an hour or two earlier than I do now - which would have me in bed around 4AM. Small steps. It's just so hard to wake up early and so easy to just stay up all night, even if I'm super tired from forcing myself to wake up shortly after sunrise.

Thanks for reading. Advice, anecdotes, shoulder pats appreciated. "
Success story...,"Just wanted to let some people out there know that there really is hope. 

My insomnia started early 2016 and I've only finally managed to cure it 2 months ago. During that years time it progressed from having mild trouble falling asleep some days to staying up until 4am the majority of the week. I tried melatonin, sleep restriction, blue light restriction, all kinds of sleep hygiene, etc. but nothing worked. I pretty much thought that I'd have to deal with it for the rest of my life for a long while until I realized there was a difference between the days that I'd get sleep and the days I wouldn't.

I realized a short while ago that every time I'd drink coffee (no matter the time of day) I'd have a lot of trouble sleeping. It was tough actually diagnosing this since every source I looked at told me that it's really only important to not drink coffee past 5PM or some bullshit. Coincidentally my coffee addiction started early 2016 as well. This coupled with the fact that I already had anxiety when trying to sleep made diagnosing and treating it difficult. Eventually though after I stopped all coffee and soda my caffeine tolerance disappeared and my sleep schedule started to get more regular, although extremely slowly since the anxiety and habit took a while to get rid of.

I still have bad days every now and then if I don't follow a normal sleep schedule (staying up late, sleeping in), but I haven't had real trouble falling asleep for a good two months. My school attendance has gone back to the usual, my headaches are gone, my stomach problems are gone, and I just feel like I'm alive again.

I used to come to this subreddit whenever I couldn't fall asleep and I noticed a lack of success stories, just hoping I can give someone hope out there. Your root cause is probably not as simple as mine but it is definitely worth at least attempting to fix it. Thanks for reading hope this helps"
I seem to have gotten over my insomnia. Here is my story.,"About a year and a half ago, in the middle of yet another sleepless night, I made a throwaway account and posted this rant:  https://redd.it/3wx0vf  I had gotten fired a couple months prior and was just starting a new job.

The job I got fired from started out bad and got worse.  It was a manic place, a so-called ""unicorn"" startup.  I found myself having trouble sleeping.  It was a self-reinforcing cycle:  I couldn't sleep so I couldn't think clearly; I couldn't think clearly so I didn't perform well; I didn't perform well so my boss got upset; my boss was upset so I got stressed out; as my stress increased I had an even harder time sleeping -- on and on.  By the end of it I was getting somewhere between zero and three hours of sleep a night and felt like total shit all the time.  It was bad.

After I got fired I knew I had a problem to solve.  I did of bunch of research on insomnia.  There is a lot advice out there, the vast majority of which didn't help at all.  I talked to my doctor about it.  She didn't really have any useful suggestions.  I tried over-the-counter sleeping pills.  They didn't help.  I tried a lot of things.  Sometimes I would get a little better, sometimes I would get a little worse.  It was hard to tell which adjustments were having what effect.  Do I need to turn off all the lights in my apartment after sunset?  Is aerobic exercise the key?  Or does it just depend on whether I will face a stressful situation the next day?

If you go to a therapist for insomnia, one of the first things they will do is give you a form that looks something like this:  https://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/SleepDiaryv6.pdf  You're supposed to fill it out with a bunch of info every morning:  ""What time did you go to bed?"",  ""What time did you wake up?"", ""How well did you sleep?"", and so on.  These questions help determine what kind of insomnia you have, which will determine how it should be treated.  The sleep diary also helps verify that your treatment is working -- your numbers should be getting better over time.

I decided I could save myself a lot of time by skipping the therapist and just filling out the form on my own.  I figured this data, when combined with the research I was doing on insomnia, would basically amount to the same result as a bunch of therapy sessions.

One problem I ran into was just not getting around to filling out the form.  I would forget, or just not have time, or both.  And paper forms are just so archaic in this modern age.  Eventually I ran across zapier.com.  I setup a ""zap"" which would send me a daily email asking how many hours of sleep I had gotten the previous night.  Another zap would pull my reply into a Google spreadsheet.  This system worked much better than the form because 1) I got a reminder to provide the info every time I checked my inbox and 2) I could reply to the email anytime, anywhere; on my laptop or on my phone.

By the time I implemented this system I had already mostly recovered.  I had learned that one of the most important factors for me is getting 30 minutes of sunlight a day (and I need to remove my glasses when I do it because they filter out UV rays).  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy also helped me get over the performance anxiety that would stress me out so badly.  Both of these techniques came from a book called ""[Say Good Night to Insomnia](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Good-Night-Insomnia-Drug-Free-ebook/dp/B005CW6T8S)"", which I found to be quite helpful.

It's now been about two months since I had a bad night, and I feel like it's safe to say I'm mostly over my sleep problems.  A year and a half after my late night rant, I'm about to start a new job at another unicorn startup.  I expect it to be just as demanding as the earlier one, but this time around I feel much better equipped to deal with the challenge.  I now feel eager to succeed rather than afraid of failure.

Having successfully recovered puts me in a position to help other people do the same.  I spent the last couple of weeks building LogSleep.com.  It makes the data collection and analysis aspect of insomnia treatment easier and more convenient.  Check it out if you're struggling and aren't sure what to do.  It's free.  If it worked for me, maybe it will work for other people too.

As a bonus, here is an annotated graph of my sleep records over the last three months:  http://imgur.com/a/vePGk  (Note that I didn't start recording the data until after I had mostly recovered.)

"If you use computer a lot, you might want to start using F.lux","So i recently started using [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/) for my computer and [twilight](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.lux) for my phone and i can say that i have slept better than before, i used to stay past 1 am frequently, sometimes past 4-5 am, yesterday i went sleeping in 11 pm (first time in years).

These programs filter blue light according what time it is, and sort of mimic sunlight. I understand that these might not help all as much as they did me, but if you use smartphone or computer lot, you probably should use these (or similar program).

Darn you brain.,
Got a hammock. Will let you guys know how it goes.,"I was told and seen some studies that suggest sleeping in a hammock can help alleviate insomnia. So I am trying it.

RESULTS
night 1 - I tried going to bed around midnight. I was awake listening to a audiobook for a hour or two. was able to drop off to sleep around 1:30am. It is now 1:15pm and i got almost 12 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP! if you see my other posts here this is almost unheard of guys. How i feel after i woke up. Lower back is  a tad bit sore as if it had been stretched since i was in a curving position but overall i feel good.when i got out it was like i had a bit of sea legs and was dizzy for a moment but passed quickly.

Night 2: I wasn't able to fall asleep till about 3am last night but didn't wake up will 11am. So i was still able to get 8 hours of sleep it just seems like my circadian rhythm is off. still had a form of sea legs this morning but overall seems to be okay. My back didn't hurt at all either.

Night 3: similar to last night but woke up at 10am

Night 4: Odd sense of not sleeping but knowing that i am/was sleeping. Dreams seem to be very realistic to the point where i can't tell if I was actually sleeping but I am rested the day after. No back pain since day 1. Consistently sleeping but having extreme difficulty getting up in the morning on time. Possibly because it it much more of an effort to get untangled from the hammock thus I just keep hitting snooze. However it has seemed to fix my insomnia for now. I will see how it holds up against periods of extreme stress.

I am not going to fully attribute this glorious night of sleep to the hammock after only one night so ill continue logging my results. But I will say i am very optimistic about this."

"Cannot sleep whatsoever, even when tired","Hi,

Friday night and Saturday night, I was able to sleep. Sunday night, I was tossing and turning all night and began to feel drowsy at 8am today. I had to wake up though because I had to have a blood test. I came home and even though I have so many assignments to do as they are due, I told myself to listen to my body and sleep. It's been 2 fucking hours I've been laying in bed trying to sleep. I hate this so fucking much. I have no energy for anything and it's causing stress. Lack of sleep is destroying."
Insomnia,"Insomnia makes me wanna kill myself but I don't want to kill myself, I take melatonin atleast two days in a row then one night I try to sleep without it, and I worry all day and whenever the time comes its a 50/50 chance of long misery or a great night sleep. 

&#x200B;

Today is the day I am trying without melatonin again, and I am nervous, I was nervous the exact moment I woke up this morning. Insomnia makes me wanna shove 50 mg of melatonin down my throat and sleep for 3 days straight. My friend is all telling me the more I fight it and pull through, insomnia will go away. It has been 7 months of insomnia, I cannot take it any longer, my friend who helps encourage me isn't online as much and I am losing my mind.

Sleep maintenance insomnia; caused by high cortisol?,"So, for the past year I have been experiencing insomnia, I have gone to the doctors and they have brushed me off so now I‚Äôm asking the Internet for help. I experience sleep maintenance insomnia where I wake up constantly every single night. I also wake up in the morning feeling unrefreshed because of a lack of deep sleep. I also experience headaches. I believe that the insomnia and headaches is due to high cortisol. I have tried using magnesium oil, rhodiola, holy basil, ksm-66 ashwagandha to lower cortisol but I have not felt much of a difference. I have felt a difference in headaches when I take the supplement called seriphos which is supposed to lower cortisol, but I have not experienced a help for maintaining sleep. I have also experienced low sex drive, bad cognition, and poor memory.  I‚Äôm a 16 year old male btw, thanks for the help if you can recommend any supplement or anything that can help me sleep and lower cortisol,  I would appreciate it."
How do you get up in the morning?,"Hey everyone.

Same as all of you, I've got major problems falling asleep, staying asleep & actually getting restful sleep. I find the hardest part of the day is getting out of bed. All I want to do is go back to sleep. Not sure if it's because I didn't actually get any REM sleep that night, or I'm too comfortable & it's too cold to get out of bed, but... it's affecting my life. I'm often late to work & spend most of the weekends sleeping in till 2. And I don't stay up all night either. I try to go to bed at 10 pm every night so I can get up for work at 6 am. Melatonin is hit or miss, as I'm sure you know. Strong sleeping pills make it almost impossible to get up in the morning because I'm so groggy. 

&#x200B;

How do you folks get out of bed in the morning after a restless night? (besides a coffee IV drip - I already drink too much coffee)"
Coukdnt sleep all night and jow I'm tired,"I couldn't sleep at all last night. It's 8 am where I live right now and I'm just getting tired. My mom told me to just stay up until 8 pm tonight but I don't know if it's a good idea. I have hallucinations and severe anxiety when I'm sleep deprived.

 Should I just sleep and get stuff done tonight? (Laundry, job hunting, etc.)

Edit: I couldn't sleep all night and now I'm tired. I must really be tired. I didn't notice the misspellings in the title until I posted it haha."
How many hours do you average of sleep per night?,"For me, it's usually around 4 hours. Sometimes less. I maybe have 2 good days per month where I sleep 6-7 hours. I think I've gotten so used to it that I don't even feel tired half the time. I just feel defeated."
3 days no sleep on Christmas day,"Insomnia has sucked the life out of me... I have to fake being happy and enthusiastic because it's Christmas. All I can think is ""Can I go back to bed now?"""
I know it‚Äôs Christmas but I can‚Äôt sleep,"Hi all. 

I‚Äôll start by saying that compared to serious insomnia, my sleep really isn‚Äôt that bad. But I would really like to be able to consistently wake up earlier, and go to bed earlier, so I can get more done and be more productive.

I‚Äôm going To bed between 11 and 1230 usually, but sometimes I toss and turn all night and end up sleeping on the couch. There have been a couple of days where I‚Äôve slept on the ground. Sometimes I can‚Äôt fall sleep until the sun is coming up. It‚Äôs usually anxiety related, and I do take Lexapro and I also take L theanine. I‚Äôve also taken a ashwanda, I‚Äôve tried a Sleepytime tea, I have CBD oil.

I don‚Äôt wake up at the same time every day. I definitely over caffeinated, and sometimes drink coffee too late in the day. I have a hard time falling asleep, sometimes melatonin works and sometimes it doesn‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt want to feel groggy all day.

I don‚Äôt have the best sleep hygiene, or use my phone in my bed. I will often take a bath with magnesium salts before bed. Sometimes I take a magnesium supplement.  I sometimes nap. think ideally I would like to go to sleep around 1030 and wake up around six.

Not in frequently I have to pull over in my car and take a nap in it because I‚Äôm so tired I can‚Äôt function. I did take Adderall for probably about a year off and on, and more recently stopped taking it so that could have something to do with it.  But it was so inconsistent and such a low dose I can‚Äôt imagine it being a crazy impact. 

I know I have a lot of room for improvement, but I‚Äôm wondering what has worked for you guys. Is there something specific that you would recommend I must do? Or that I must cut out?  How did you establish a routine that works for you?

Much love and thanks.

Insomnia Vs night owl?,"So it seems no matter what I do I can‚Äôt fall asleep till it‚Äôs at least 3am. I get my best sleep during breaks where I usually sleep from 3am - 12pm. However whenever I work or have lectures no matter what I do I can‚Äôt fall asleep, I attempt to go to bed at 11 but toss and turn until those 3-5am hours where I can blissfully get some rest but the problem is that real life kicks in and I gotta be up at 6:45am rather than 12pm and it sucks!! Anyone find a way around this? Am I screwed for life? Will my future 9-5 consist of constant sleep deprivation? "

A great podcast recommendation,"Sorry if this has been suggested before, but Sleep With Me is a great podcast that really does a great job at putting you to sleep. 

The host has a creaky, droning voice and he just rambles on and on and on for about an hour and a half. 

On Halloween he recounted the entire plot to Ghostbusters in real time and managed to make it something I could fall asleep to."

Noise Anxiety,"I have a hard time sleeping because I'm so anxious about noise. I live in the 21st floor of a high rise condominium. Whenever I hear random voices in the hallway, or even the faint sound of my neighbor's TV, my heart beats really fast and I can't block it out of my mind. I don't know what to do anymore.

This started back when I rented a unit in a building over a pub. I'd hear the loud bass from the 4th floor. I managed to survive for 3 months but the lack of sleep was killing me. I then moved back to my parent's house, but our neighbor was building a house right in front of ours! It felt like noise was following me EVERYWHERE. 

Is there anyone who goes through the same issue? I haven't been diagnosed with anxiety but I have a feeling this has something to do with it.

Thank you to anyone who might help."
Random Bursts of Energy,Does anyone else here ever try to fall asleep and then have this burst of energy to go on a run or cook stuff or play music or do stuff at hours at like 1 in the goddamn morning? 
It sucks that a win for me is around the third day when my body starts to shut down from pure exhaustion.,"I've always struggled with insomnia and this bout has been particularly bad. I got 4 hours last night and 5 hours today, didn't sleep at all the night before last. I'm laying on the couch barely able to concentrate and I'm pretty sure I'm just gonna shut down in the next couple of hours, so there's something."

Might Help - Set your room to 65 degrees before sleeping,"It's been a long battle and still is.  I went from sleeping 0-3 hours for a very long time destroying my body to slowly being able to sleep 5-6 hours.

Last night, I read that your room should be at 65 degrees when you go to sleep.  I set it to 65 degrees thinking it's freezing and shivering as I went into bed.


I don't even remember checking my phone like I always do.


For the first time in ... a decade?   I slept for 7-8 hours.


May not work for you, but it can be a part of your big puzzle.  Hope it helps!"
Socializing while sleep deprived,"I‚Äôve found that if I socialize  after not sleeping for at least 24 hours, I become way more outgoing and talkative.  I know that inhibitions tend to fly out the window when we don‚Äôt sleep, but It‚Äôs almost scary In a way, it‚Äôs like I become someone else. I also go back and forth between being talkative and reserved in this state. I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else gets like this and what might cause it.  "
Communicating insomnia struggles in the workplace,"I've had insomnia since I was a kid, but it's been particularly bad in the past few years and has resulted in increased depression, anxiety, and physical illness. It's affecting my performance at work, and I struggle trying to communicate this to other people, especially my bosses.

I missed a 9am meeting today because I only slept 1 hour, didn't feel well and thought in the moment that getting another hour of sleep was more important. These are weekly meetings in which I often feel like my presence isn't necessary, so I didn't think it would be a big deal and I gave advance notice. I had my performance review later today and my boss was obviously frustrated and expressed that my sporadic working hours have been a source of frustration. I burst into tears because it frustrates me too, but I also feel like I work very hard regardless, meet deadlines, and produce high quality work, and it was upsetting that this became the focus of my review, and that this was the first time I was hearing this. Things got super awkward and she said that regularity in my hours needed to be fixed, and I said that I didn't know if that it was possible due to ""health issues"", and I left it at that.

Does anyone have experience communicating to employers/colleagues their issues with insomnia? Sometimes I mention that I have trouble sleeping, but I think people either assume its only temporary, that I'm exaggrating, or that I must be doing something wrong to only sleep 1\-2 hours some nights. 

I'm so tired and I feel like I'll never reach my potential as a human. I'm already thinking about quitting this job and finding something that doesn't require a lot of focus. I'm not suicidal, but I'm starting to feel more and more that I'd be better off dead, because I'm a burden and not able to be a full functioning member of society. "

What productive things do you get done instead of sleeping?,"I stopped taking prescription sleep aids two months ago, regained a normal sleep schedule for a few weeks, and have since hopped back on the no sleep train.

"So...my doctor prescribed me DOUBLE the maximum dosage of Xanax for my sleep problems. She said if it doesn‚Äôt work within an hour, mix it with my Ambien and a glass of wine. I‚Äôm absolutely desperate for a sleep solution, but that sounds super scary. Anyone have experience with mixing medications?",
Something FINALLY worked,"My insomnia was literally starting to ruin my life.

You know how it goes. I tried everything from melatonin, to valerian, to Benadryl. No long term solution appeared. No amount of working out, meditation, or supplements was enough to put me down when I wanted to be asleep.

I hadn't been to one of my morning classes in months, and while it is my fault for not just pushing through and going, it's really hard to get out of bed after three hours of sleep. When I would get up and go, I would be so exhausted I wouldn't retain any information and feel horrible for the rest of the day. It's not an excuse (well, I guess by definition it is), but I was always getting to bed by 11-12 depending on when my class was the next day, but I just couldn't fall asleep for hours! It's not like I was intentionally staying up all hours of the night and then complaining about it.

People said I just needed to adjust when I'm going to sleep and fix my sleep clock. Lol. It was never about getting into bed, that was never the problem. The problem was falling asleep.

The key is NOT trying to fall asleep earlier, it's always getting up at the same time! My sleep therapist suggested this to me, but I still just did not have the willpower to get out of bed after barely sleeping. It sounds easy conceptually, but it's much harder in practice. One night I was having trouble sleeping. I tried the 'get up for 15-30 minutes and getting back into bed'. I ate an apple. I drank some milk. Nothing seemed to be working. At some point, I said ""fuck it"" and just decided to stay up the whole night. 

The next day was hell. I felt like I was physically ill. I was so tired I was sick to my stomach. That was the reality of it, though. It's a lot easier to be tired all day than it is to get out of a snuggy warm bed after only a few short hours of sleep. The only thing that kept me going was the idea of my head hitting that pillow.

I finally gave in at around 10:30 and fell asleep within minutes. I had the most refreshing 8 hours I've ever had, and woke up at 7 on the dot. Naturally. Didn't even set an alarm. I felt refreshed and ready to go, how I usually felt after waking up at 12-1. My day felt so much longer and productive. It was amazing! It sucks realizing you've been wasting 5-6 hours of daylight just laying there. I'm so excited to have my life under control again! 

It is SO important to just GET GOING and get the fuck out of bed in the morning. It is impossible to fall asleep at 11 when you're waking up at 12-1. 

Might not work for everyone, and I'm only on like day two of this, but so far things are still working great! If you're at the end of your rope like I was, at least give it a shot. Even with this only being in practice for a few days, I'm just so much happier and more energetic.

I was so distressed, literally looking around online on how to get ghb (roofies) and research chemicals just so I could sleep. So many janky methods and secret tactics people said about falling asleep. Never thought it would be this easy. Granted, staying up 36 + hours was not fun, but a lot more feasible."
Anyone Else Feel Like Garbage During The Day?,"I'm thinking that my insomnia is from late night computer use. Something about the blue lights from the screen make your body's melatonin production go haywire - I' m working on it.

In the meantime - does anyone else feel like I do during the day:

- Hard to concentrate/focus
- Grumpy
- Feeling like pressure on my eyes (hard to describe)
- Feeling like I just can't do anything


I feel sick... but there is so much I want to do - but there is like this terrible force that won't let me do it - I just want to lay down or something.

Anyone else?? I'm just wondering if these awful symptoms are from the insomnia/melatonin deficiency and that they will eventually go away. It all started when i was in college and had to stay up until 3am regularly on the computer to finish work.

I'm not sad or depressed or anything - just feel like GARBAGE!!"

That makes no sense at all. "
Things that have helped with my insomnia,"I've had trouble sleeping for the past 2 - 3 years. There are chunks of my life that I don't remember. Weeks go by and I can't recall simple details that normal people can. My memory is fragmented in parts because of insomnia. 

Some back story is that I worked as an X-ray tech for about 4 years and  took a lot of call during that time. I worked a lot of night shifts, day shifts, swing shifts, nothing steady. After working a 36 hour shift one weekend I broke. I felt like I lost the ability to sleep. It got so bad I felt like killing myself most nights. 

As everyone in this sub knows, it's impossible to describe insomnia to people who don't suffer from it. How can you be exhausted and not sleep? I ended up quitting my job that I worked so hard to get and spent so many years in school for. I went to my doctor for sleeping medication and anti depressants to put me out until I felt I had more energy to focus on getting out of the slump.

Fast forward 6 months. I'd been taking Ambien and Zoloft consistently with decent results. If I took Ambien on an empty stomach it would put me to sleep. Zoloft seemed to help some some negative thoughts in my head. Maybe this was a placebo but I honestly didn't care. At this point  I decided that I was ready to come off the anti depressants. I kept the Ambien prescription just in case. As time went by I started taking less and less. I wish I could say this is where things got better. I wish that after so much time had passed I could say I recovered. I can't. However, this post does have some good to come from what I've learned. 

Present day, I am not taking any medication. I feel like it is just a bandaid to the problem. I decided I wanted to confront the problem head on. I wanted to dissect it and study it. I wanted to see what made it tick and why if fucked me with so much. Some nights I would have given anything for an Ambien. But I didn't. I downloaded a sleep app so I could track when I went to bed and when I woke up. It also tracked how well you slept although I don't know how accurate it is. I felt like I was getting somewhere though. I noticed exercising helped. I noticed drinking alcohol did not. I noticed smoking weed helped. I noticed reading helped. I noticed that going to bed earlier and waking up earlier helped. In the end I noticed some things I could cut out of my life in order to help. 

-I don't get ""drunk"" anymore (I still drink beer and wine regular just not excessively)
-I don't stay up till 2am anymore (unless I can't sleep)
-I read before bed
-I exercise 3 days a week (not even vigorously, it mostly helps psychologically)
-I don't smoke weed (again the bandaid thing)

The last thing I want to write about in this post is the coup de grace. The thing that I feel helped the most. It's talked about a lot in this sub but not in the way that it helped me. I practiced mindfulness and meditation for years. I read several books about these things trying to find salvation, anything to help me sleep. I could do these practices during the day but obviously taking day naps does terrible things for your sleep schedule. Nothing worked until I did it my own way. 

The sad thing about this disease is that no one really understands it unless they have been through it. Pills can knock you out, drugs can take you out of reality. But nothing can cure this besides yourself. When you are laying in bed at night you have to be there for yourself. Your spouse laying next to you is not always going to be supportive. Your friends and family are not always going to be supportive. What's helped me the most in the end has been observing my insomnia as a third party. As I lay I bed unable to drift to sleep I observe. I look at my anxiety, my stress and stare at it. I watch it and follow it as it passes by. It always loops back around though to catch you off guard. It puts the pit back in your chest or stomach just to fuck with you. It doesn't want you to sleep. The truth is that it hates being watched. It hates being looked at and recognized. It's hates when you have support. I don't repeat a mantra, I don't try to keep focused on anything in particular, I'm just observing. When you observe you distance yourself from the stress and anxiety. They are not part of you. 

As I have observed my insomnia I've found that there is another side of my mind beyond stress and anxiety.  That side is support. It's weak and its shy but it's there. This is the part of your mind that will always be there for you. It will always support you. It is there to observe your insomnia. It's there to teach that if you approach insomnia without feelings of anger, discouragement, apathy, and hopelessness that you can overcome it. 

This doesn't always work for me. There are nights where I stare out the window down my street and think how nice it would be to load my shotgun and swallow a buck shot. But I don't. I get a glass of water take a drink and approach my bed once again with the notion that I will do nothing more than observe my insomnia and while observing get a glimpse of that supportive part of my mind. Then I'll find myself drifting off to sleep and sometimes that pit won't form in my stomach. 
"
DAE think their perfect day would be around 36 hours?,"24 hours awake, 12 hours asleep. I just can't fall asleep until I basically pass out!"
A neat little trick that helps me drift off sometimes,"I learned it from the Mentalist, always helps when I'm high: Focus on your breathing, control your breaths and when you breath in count the number one in your head. When you breath out count number two. 

When I close my eyes I visualise things which always drifts my thoughts away, and thus keeps me awake. If you're like me, visualise the numbers as you're counting. 

The hardest part is reminding yourself to do this. You will eventually drift off into a chain of thought on your first few attempts. I learned this a while back and it's been helping me but not 100% ever since. I'm new to the sub and thought I'd start off with a little tip :)"
101 Insomnia Cures - One of these should help you guys....,
"Insomnia is a 24-hour brain condition, like a light switch that is always on",
A surprising remedy,"I read a few weeks ago a (scientific) magazine article about gut flora/intestine bacteria. It described how bacterial balance affects the whole body through hormone production in the brain. Especially stress hormone management can be damaged by a bad gut flora ([a similar article](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/333870/description/Belly_bacteria_boss_the_brain)). The article made a hypothesis that insomnia could be caused by a bacterial balance disruption.


Since I've tried every possible remedy during the past decade for my insomnia from drugs to Yoga, NLP and other natural aids, I thought what the heck, I'd better try out this one too.


So after two weeks of using lactacid supplement, I'm starting to see a positive effect. Instead of feeling tense, not sleepy at all like usually when going to bed, I'm feeling drowsy and sleepy. And falling to sleep is much easier than before.


I can't say for certain whether the lactacid supplement actually works but the results are promising. I sincerely recommend trying."
"Recently developed insomnia. Struggling with keeping time, and Fight Club was surprisingly correct about how it feels.","For about a month I've been sleeping less and less. I'm not sure why, but I just can't seem to sleep. It's gotten to where I'll get three hours (in the afternoon) if I'm lucky. My nights are filled with Reddit and Facebook. I have too much time to click around, and I feel like I've run out of internet to explore. The biggest thing I've had to cope with is time loosing all meaning to me. I know how it feels for time to pass, but it's getting difficult to tell exactly how much that is. Concepts like ""today"" and ""tomorrow"" have become nothing but words. Arbitrary names given to seconds before and after midnight. Just numbers on a clock, it's all the same to me at this point. I can remember events, but I couldn't tell you if they were today or yesterday. Time has slow down and sped up at the same time. I can only assume some of you know what I mean by that. 

I watched Fight Club the other night, and the narrator talked about insomnia. The following is no big spoiler, just an aside about insomnia at the beginning of the movie.

""With insomnia, nothing's real. Everything's far away. Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.""

That's exactly how I feel."
Marijuana: Nature's Sleep Aid,"Life without it:

Up until 5, 6, 7 AM...sleep a few hours. After work, I either take a nap or try to stay awake until a reasonable bedtime. Either option results in the same outcome: Wide Awake at Midnight. 

Life with marijuana:

Oh, it's 9 o'clock, time to smoke a joint, some innocuous form of entertainment follows, 11PM I'm asleep like a baby, wake up refreshed in the morning and ready for the day.


*My question is* HOW DO I FIX MY SLEEP SCHEDULE WITHOUT IT?"
I start a new job today.,"My alarm is going off in two hours. I hope I can get some sleep between now and then.  I wish my head was wired differently.  I want to make a good impression and this is not a good start.

Does crying make you feel better when you can‚Äôt sleep?,"Been suffering with insomnia for more than a month now. Was wondering if crying makes it better? Do you feel more calm or more anxious after doing so? 

Any insight would be helpful "
"4 days without sleep, frustrated and depressed.","I've always had trouble sleeping or staying asleep but the past couple months have been very bad. I usually get 4 hours a night in total, waking up a couple times or eventually knock out at 6am. Melatonin used to help. 

&#x200B;

The last time I slept was on Sunday morning (7am - 11am) and I haven't slept since. Monday night I tried melatonin, didn't work. Tuesday, I tried melatonin again, gave up and drank a lot of alcohol, still doesn't work. Spent all of wednesday tired as fuck, tried to nap and couldn't. 

&#x200B;

I've been so tired, frustrated, randomly breaking down crying. I've always struggled with depression but the lack of sleep is making me down right suicidal. I almost went through with it last night when the alcohol couldn't knock me out. 

&#x200B;

How do you deal with it when it just keeps getting worse? "
My Advice For CBT,"I have been really angry at CBT in the past, because it didn't work for me.

That was because I had a serious sleep disorder, and my Dr's didn't really know how to deal with it. 

&#x200B;

So I'm going to share my advice on CBT. 

It works for people who are otherwise healthy, and who are causing insomnia through bad habits. 

But it can KILL someone, and yes I really mean KILL someone who actually has a physical sleep disorder. 

&#x200B;

CBT focuses on not worrying, it says that anxiety is a wave that will crash over you if you just relax. And this is true for MOST people. However, if the insomnia is a symptom of a serious disease, it CBT will drive them right off a cliff. 

&#x200B;

Thats why I want to share some advice about it. 

\#1. Try it yourself, if it doesn't work go see a Dr. 

\#2. If you Dr sends you into professional CBT, make DAM sure you get screened for physical conditions  that can cause insomnia BEFORE therapy. Those include; Blood thyroid and blood iron disorders, Breathing disorders and allergy/sinus problems, epilepsy and restless leg syndrome. 

\#3. Tell to your Dr if you bed partners have ever said you snore or your limbs jerk. 

\#4. Discuss a contingency strategy with both your Dr. and your therapist. What happens if this doesn't work? Who do we escalate the problem to?

Haven‚Äôt been sleeping and not tired,"So the title explains most of it but basically, I haven‚Äôt been getting much sleep but I‚Äôm just not tired at the end of the day. For the past week I‚Äôve gotten less than 5 hrs a night (usually waking up 1-2 times during that) except for last night where I only got ~2 hrs. After all of that, I woke up this morning wide fucking awake. I had my usual morning cup of coffee (at 8 am) but I didn‚Äôt have anything else and now it‚Äôs 1 am and I‚Äôm just not tired... I know I should be sleepy but I‚Äôm simply not. I‚Äôm a healthy girl in her 20s who exercises regularly and eats healthy. I‚Äôve never been great at sleeping but I‚Äôm finally sick of the compounding exhaustion that I know will hit eventually. "
Mind refreshing strategy,"After I struggle with sleep long enough and lose hope I sometimes decide to deliberately rest my head. I get sleep mask and comfortable headphones, play a good instrumental album (soundtracks, prog, postrock, classic) that is 45-60-90 mins. During that time I cuddle in bed, not move, keep the mask on and try to think happier thoughts and stay resting til the music ends. "
My biggest fear of getting insomnia finally happened.,"Years before I somehow convinced myself that sleep was not important, which allowed me to sleep like a baby.

After seeing some stupid article about insomnia and brain damage, My life is shit now. How the hell am I going to get through the semester of 16 units with an internship??

Why did I have to get this shit during the most important semester of my life? I‚Äôm afraid to get permanent brain damage or some disease. Life fucking sucks. "
Can I have a moment of anyone's time?,"I feel depressed everyday thinking about how i'm probably going to deal with insomnia for my whole life. And because of this I can't really enjoy my life anymore, I just think all day about the terrible night ahead of me. Sometimes I wish I could go back in time to stop myself from staying up really late for months in a row, it is the cause of my entire insomnia and I hate it."
"Anybody willing to chat?... depressed, lonely, suicidal thoughts... just need to chat about nothing and anything with",
Insomnia took a wierd turn,"Im sleeping better but whats wierd is, I text and call people in my sleep. I texted me girlfriend ""Damn its cold out here"" at 1am which really freaks me out. Last night I woke up and checked the time and saw I was on the phone with someone for 2 hours and 4 minutes. I text my girlfriend jibberish often."
Im soo glad tomorrow is a Sunday as I wrote that I realised that‚Äôs today fuck,
Do y'all hate when you wake up in the middle of the night for whatever reason and can't get back to sleep ffs,I woke up with an urge to pee more than 2 hours earlier and since then I just won't fucking fall asleep. Why? God I only slept like 2 hours and a half why am I so wide awake. Will this ever really go away?
Who else has this pattern?,You sleep fine for a night but then proceed to stay up all night the next night or only get 1-2 hours of sleep because of anxiety or whatever and then feel like crap all day and then get maybe 6 hours the next night. I hate this insomnia shit man.
"Slept way too long all weekend, decided not to sleep tonight","Like 12 hours Fri and Sat nights

fuck I want a nap but i have to get up in like 2 hours anyway and I have a class from 8-9, 12-1, 5-6

Probs gonna die of a heart attack at 26

why do I do this

momy"
I only sleep well 2 to 3 nights a week,"I have insomnia but it is bad more during the week.by the weekend the lack of sleep causes me to sleep 10 hours a night  for 2 or 3 nights.i have tried for decades to go to bed the same time every night & wake up the same time.but it hasn't ever worked for me.been put on multiple sleep medicines none have really worked.one worked but I had tremors that affected my hands legs  & feet & couldn't stand up or do much without almost falling & I would have fallen but  I held on to things like the kitchen counter .so after a week I was taken off 50 mg of that medicine & put on 25 mg & the 25 mg made the tremors stop but only made me groggy but didn't really help my sleep. I'd rather have insomnia then have problems standing up & my legs going out on me. And no it's not soda because I mostly drink water.but I'm bi polar, have pain issues & have epilepsy.so all 3 dr's says contribute to my insomnia.but I think the depression part is the main issue. It sure isn't the seizures.yes I have had seizures that woke me up but I have actually slept better after the seizures that have woken me up at 4 am"
When I finally fall asleep I feel like I am not!,"I had not realized I have had sleeping problems until now. I have never needed too many hours and if I sleep even 15 minutes during the day, I was not able to sleep at night. Because of my husband work, we moved, and I had to quit and I realized I have huge sleeping problems! I suppose that I do not waste enough energy as I used to do. I am working on that, but something has started to happen and it is that when I finally fall asleep, it is like a part of me is sleeping but another part not. I dream a lot, but the part that says I am not sleep tells me all the time that is a dream and make me fell aware about what is going on around me in the ‚Äúawake life‚Äù if this make sense. The point is that I do not rest at all! And I would think the next day I will feel tired, which I feel, and fall sleep easier, but nooooo! It is the same! Has some one has experienced this? I can not talk this deep with my husband because he has never experienced insomnia, and does not make sense for him. Advices?? Please! "
[RANT] I cannot fucking sleep.,"I‚Äôm getting so frustrated I could cry. 

I am balls deep in what I‚Äôll call an insomnia episode (like I always sleep shitty but there will periods of time where it‚Äôs especially bad, if that makes sense) and I can‚Äôt FUCKING SLEEP. 

It‚Äôs nearly 2pm here and I haven‚Äôt slept from last night yet. The past several days have been the same. I might get some off and on naps here and there if I‚Äôm lucky. 

When I have managed to fall asleep this past week, I cannot STAY ASLEEP. It‚Äôs been like 2 hour naps with waking up 3+ times between before I give up trying. 

I‚Äôm sorry for whining, I know I‚Äôm fortunate to have gotten some kind of little sleep lately, but I‚Äôm really struggling and beyond frustrated. I feel like I have tried everything and I just want some damn sleep. 

I wonder what it‚Äôs like to feel well rested ü§î"
No motivation to leave my bed in the morning,"Hi. So, i do have trouble with insomnias, but that's not what's been on my mind lately. What is on my mind is the fact that when i wake up, i just can't leave my bed and go to classes, like i should do. Instead i just stay in my bed for hours after i wake up, not sleeping or doing anything at all, just laying in my bed with my eyes opened. I think that the main reasons for that to happen are two: the first one is that i've been depresses for quite some time, so it's hard for me to find motivation to do even the simple things, like cooking, leaving my house, and i even find it difficult to just wake the f*** up and go to college it seems. The other reason is because i'm straight up lazy. Nothing more, nothing less, just lazyness. So that's why i'm here in this sub. I know that this is really dumb and that is not directly about insomnia, but for the lack of a better subreddit for this subject i'm making a post it here. And maybe there is/was someone in the same situation than me. If that's the case, could you give some advice?"
2am vs 6am,"So just about every night this week I have woken up between 1-3, wide awake. I've attempted to fall back asleep each time to no avail. I usually toss and turn for 1.5-2 hours and then give up. It is almost an indescribable feeling. I feel so mentally alert and my mind is so active. I want to know why. Because, I generally fall back asleep around 5am - 1 hour before I have to get up. At 6am, when I have to get up I am so exhausted all I want to do is lay in bed, I struggle to get up. That is the infuriating part. It is 3:53 as I write this, I have been up since 2, and feel like I could run a marathon.

Does anyone share this problem?

Note: I fell asleep tonight around 10pm, so I slept for almost 4 solid hours. Could this potentially be why I am not exhausted? I've read that 4 hour cycles are the most efficient ways of sleeping."
Finally 7straight hours of sleep,I have not slept that long in years. Fact is I sleep in 1-2 hours at a time then I‚Äôm up for many hours. I m always tired.  Tried as many medications as you could possible name.  Last night I tried cbd oil.  Wow!  Question is will it continue to allow me much needed sleep.?  I‚Äôll let you know.....to be continued.
Does anyone else get bursts of light in their vision from lack of sleep?,"Just curious if I need to be more worried...the less sleep I get, the more I notice bursts of light in my vision. It doesn't hurt but it's scary and kind of alarming. I do have a history of migraines, so maybe it's connected more than I thought? I've had my eyes checked and everything was fine. 

Just curious if anyone else goes through this with their insomnia. "
"Accidentally sleeping at 9 pm, waking up at 12 am and now I can't sleep","Now I'm fucked up. At least I have fall break and I do not bother too much about it, but somehow I'm still tired and cannot sleep because I wake up in a panic attack for the nth time."
I‚Äôm not a good friend because of insomnia,"My friend needs a ride on Monday for a medical procedure and has to be there at 9:30 am, which would mean a 7:30 am wake up time for me. I simply cannot do it. If I force myself to do anything earlier than 11 am, I feel physically sick the whole day. This saddens me deeply that I can‚Äôt be there for my friend. "
why does it seem impossible to get a simple sleeping pill ?,"i have been suffering from acute insomnia for the past 4 years. everytime i have a bad night where i dont sleep i get into this cycle where i get anxiety about not getting sleep which results in many sleepless nights, my previous doctor gave me sonata which would get me back into my sleeping cycle, unfortunately the dr retired. every new doctor i visited about my sleeping problem just give me the usual trazodone or some antihistamine. i explain to them that a tiny supply of sonata ambien etc will
help me tremendously but they are just too scared. any advice ?"
Rant about weed being illegal,"I've tried pretty much anything to beat insomnia, and the only thing that consistently worked for me was cannabis. Thankfully, I live in Toronto where I can cure myself easily. I'm now traveling and of course I have jetlag induced insomnia again. I know the cure but just because some  rich greedy bastards dictate the world that it's 'bad' my precious time with family that I haven't seen in years is being ruined. I hope whoever causes this to suffer as much as all those who are like me. Rant over."
Sleep Diary #3: My family thinks I‚Äôm crazy for the lengths I go to fix my sleep.,"Undiagnosed delayed sleep wake phase disorder, but seeing as it gets diagnosed by self report, it‚Äôs definitely what I have. When I have to keep a morning schedule, it‚Äôs indistinguishable from sleep onset insomnia. Been dealing with this for 15 years. I recently got a day job that starts soon so I embarked on an intense mission to fix it. 

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing for the last ~~9~~ **10** days:
- Get up at 6am without exception. I use Alarmy app and now I do not hit snooze. Ever. 
- Expose myself to at least 30 mins of bright light within an hour of waking. Local weather does not often cooperate so I got a phototherapy lamp I just started using. 
- After ~5 pm I switch to dim light mode. This means closing shades and wearing a pair of blue spectrum blocking safety glasses over sunglasses. When the sun goes down I can ditch the sunglasses and just wear the blue blockers, keeping indoor lights dim as possible. 
- about 2h before desired bedtime, I take ~0.3-0.5mg melatonin (instant release). I was taking over 1mg but it caused early waking. I can‚Äôt find less than 3mg in store so I‚Äôm cutting the tablets into eighths, hence the range of dose estimated. 
- Screens go off not long after I take the melatonin. I read a book to wind down. 
- No eating after about 8 pm. 
- I‚Äôve been delaying bed time until I am very sleepy, which has been happening earlier each night just about. I‚Äôm now at a 10:30pm get in bed time for the last 3 days. 
- sleep hygiene - dark room as cool as I can get it. I sleep with a fan blowing on me, good for cooling and white noise. I don‚Äôt even spend time in the room, let alone the bed, until I‚Äôm going to sleep. 
- No caffeine after 12pm, but I usually have my last cup around 10am at the latest. 
- Tracking sleep with a diary using the free CBT-I Coach app. Also gives tips to deal with anxiety and structure my routine. 

I think that about covers it. So now for the results:

My **past week*** average time in bed has been 7.2 hours, sleeping 6.6h, sleep efficiency over 90%. I have woken at least once on 5 nights, but I‚Äôve been able to fall back asleep within a few minutes most of those nights. Twice recently I slept over 7 hours and felt great. My charts show a definite progressive increase in sleep time, with some hiccups. Maybe this doesn‚Äôt sound great to you guys, but I was coming from a 2-3am (or later!) bedtime 95% of the last decade and a half. I‚Äôve felt tired most of this past couple weeks, but I‚Äôm really happy with my progress and I no longer seriously fear I will lose my sanity at my new job. Posting here has helped me keep up hope, so thank you all for bearing with me. 

***Edit**: my sleep log app was giving averages for the past 7 days only. I mistakenly thought it was a running average. For the entire 10 day period, my averages are: time in bed 7.05h, time asleep 6.35h, sleep efficiency 90.1%"
"""Normal sleep"" for 2-3 hours, wake up, then really light sleep and vivid dreams till I have to get up...","...and I'm exhausted the whole next day. This started to happen when I ""fixed"" my sleep schedule by going bed earlier. Feels like I don't sleep a wink at nights, I'm so tired. :("
How I cured my own middle insomnia (take 2),"*(Disclosure. I am not a doctor. This is how I found a way to cure my illness. I hope there is something useful in it for you but none of this should be taken as medical advice.)*

In between caring for a sleepless toddler, a stressful job and a mutating side project, something broke. Don‚Äôt get me wrong things were braking along the way. I put on 20kgs, I had severe reflux and suffered chronically low mood. But when things improved on the home-front and the reciprocal improvement on the health front did not present I knew something wasn‚Äôt right.

Most marked of the continued ailments was an in-ability to sleep for more than 4 hours and, more often, no more than 3. I would not wake up in a panic, stressed about the days events, I didn‚Äôt wake up short of breath. I would just gently rouse from sleep and seemed to lack the ability to un-rouse from waking.

Gradually though, over the course of 3 years I would grow to understand the code that would unlock the curse of this midnight albatross. It wasn‚Äôt a conventional cure. Exercise, for example, which I anticipated as the obvious remedy was like poison for my sleep. The harder I trained the worse I slept. So I was left to put out a fire without water and no concept of fire extinguishers. This is how I did it.

## A failure of ‚Äúobvious‚Äù remedies: Initial miss-steps

## Exercise Elixir or¬†Poison?

The most crushing blow to solving my sleep was the realisation that exercise, which I assumed as the most obvious elixir was actually a type of poison. Running, swimming, interval training, BJJ, bike riding all seemed to make sleep worse. The more intense the exercise the shorter my sleep duration and the more assertive my wakefulness and sustained inability to get back to sleep. This sucked. I love to exercise.

## Magnesium and Natural ‚Äúsleep¬†aids‚Äù

Magnesium is often touted as a sleep aid so I tried it with a variety of chelates. None seemed to increase the length of my initial sleep. They allowed me to doze after initial waking but I would have a headache and fuzzy thinking by the time it came to wake up.

The same result seemed to derive from natural sleep aids. Valerian, Passion flower, bachs remedy, tart cherry, ashwaghanda K-66, hops all would help me doze after waking but I would have the same lethargy/headache and fuzzy thinking by the time I came to rise. I was getting sleep purely for the sake of getting sleep. Refreshment for the next waking period did not seem to be included.

## Heat

At some point I heard Rhonda Patricks podcast on Sauna and heat exposure. I would subsequently try this with increasing sleep length in mind. Perhaps unsurprisingly this had the same effect as exercise with similar pronounced wakening and reduced ability to get back to sleep.

## Fiber

It took me A LONG time to really connect the dots between fiber intake and reflux. Reflux was an accompanying sympom of my sleeplessness. It‚Äôs hard to say how related the reflux was to my midnight waking, but it definetly contributed to occaisions where I couldn‚Äôt fall asleep and was a condition that made life significantly more miserable.

I knew about FODMAPS and the elimination diet and yes I should have had a more earnest attempt at these diets eariler. It took my until I came across the book by Norm Robillard the Fast Tract Diet for my awareness of the fiber to really hit home. If you‚Äôre suffering indegestion or reflux I can‚Äôt recommend Dr Robilliard‚Äôs book highly enough, it‚Äôs supported by research and Robilliard is coming from the position of someone who suffered from and alleviated himself of the condition. When I read it I significantly reduced my fiber intake and the resultant improvement in my reflux were immediate.

## So what made the difference?

My resolution of sleep was solved in what turned out to be a series of 5 steps outlined in chronological order below.

1. 23&me Nutrahacker recommendations NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract, Creatine
2. Alpha Lipoic Acid
3. Quercetin, Green Tea Extract & Aspirin & natural sleep remedies (Valarian ect)
4. Lifestyle interventions
5. Strategic exercise: Mitochondrial Density Training

If I were to apply what you could call Shylocks Razor to the problem, where, the cheapest and most efficient steps should be taken first it would probably look more like the steps below.

1. Alpha Lipoic Acid
2. Lifestyle interventions
3. Quercetin, Green Tea Extract & Aspirin, natural sleep remedies (Valarian ect)
4. 23&Me Nutrahacker recommendations NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract, Creatine
5. Strategic exercise: Mitochondrial Density Training

Note that it is likely that these supplements have a synergistic effect meaning they work much more effectively as a group than as independent supplements. This is likely due to the fact that insomnia is an illness of multiple failre points which need to be remedied independently. It may thus be important to take the supplements as a group of supplements rather than on their own.

It‚Äôs important to reiterate that this is only what has worked for me. I think if you follow a similar methodology to me you will also find a solution but the actual supplements you end up taking are likely to be different, particulary those recommended by 23&Me, to what I have taken. This will be due to differences in biology form person to person.

## 1. 23&me Nutrahacker recommendations NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract,¬†Creatine

Somewhere in mid 2016 I discovered[ Nutrahacker.com](http://nutrahacker.com/). This site is one of several ‚Äúrecommendation engines‚Äù that makes nutritional supplement recommendations based on your 23&Me chromosome data. These recommendation engines are quite nacent and as a result they‚Äôre considered pseudo scientific. Regardless of this, for me Nutrahacker was a candle in the darkness.

The key benefit that Nutrahacker provided was clarity on what I needed to avoid. Specifically B6 and Magnesium. These supplements are consistently recommended as beneficial to sleep yet for me when I‚Äôve taken them in supplement form, my reaction has always been adverse from hypervigilance and aggressiveness (B6) and anxiety and sub-par digestive outcomes (magnesium). The fact that Nutrahacker supported my previously held assumptions did give me greater faith in the recommendations.

They also provided recommendation I what I should take which I‚Äôve discussed below.

## Recommendations that I took¬†up

## Broccoli Seed¬†Extract.

Broccoli sprout extract made all things digestion better from reflux to expulsion. Taking Broccoli on it‚Äôs own didn‚Äôt seem to have a massive impact on sleep but because my digestion seemed to work much better I persisted with it.

## Creatine

Creatine was a sneaky one. Why would I need a bodybuilding supplement? Sometimes you‚Äôve got to have faith. After taking creatine my low mood improved substantially. As far as helping with sleep, it seemed to make a big difference when I took it with zinc. Why? Who knows but it worked.

## Zinc

I‚Äôd taken zinc in the past and not noticed any improvement in sleep. I didn‚Äôt really notice an improvement in much actually so stopped taking it. Then randomly on the same night I took Creatine boom a great nights sleep. The effect has been repeated for several months now as of the time of writing this.

## NAC

For me, NAC is a wonderful supplement. It helped tremendously with my reflux and it just seems to make everything a little smoother.

## B Vitamins

I take B Vitamins in the form of vegemite which is an Australian yeast spread every morning. It has a savoury taste and for those uninitiated is pretty disgusting. I don‚Äôt know if the B Vitamins make a huge difference but I like Vegemite so B Vitamin intake is easy.

## 2. ALA (Alpha Lipoic¬†Acid)

The Nutrahacker recommendations made me realise that my liver was likely a key player in my inability to sleep. This was supported by a blood test that showed elevated liver enzymes. There is also a consistent theme in Chinese medicine that waking up in the middle of the night is caused by liver dysfunction.

My solution for this? Look at what supplements are good for the liver. Alpha Lipoic Acid was cheap and well researched so I tried it. The results were immediate. I felt better upon waking after taking this supplement like I had a deeper sleep. My appetite also seemed to work on a much more even keel after taking supplement. This added benefit was a pleasant surprise.

There are other supplements with evidence suggesting benefit to the liver. Under a dr‚Äôs supervision I would assume that these would be worth trialing. Note that at this stage I have not trialed any of the below.

St Mary‚Äôs Thistle

TUDCA

I now take ALA around 20 minutes before every meal. Most suggest it is best taken on an empty stomach.

## 3. Quercetin & Green Tea Extract &¬†Aspirin

One of the most noticeable symptoms of my lack of sleep was that my feet became hot at night. In fact my whole body temperature seemed elevated. I know that the deeper someones sleep the cooler their body temperature. Perhaps if I could lower my body temperature I could entice myself back to sleep.

I tried a cold water bottle on my feet. I tried a cold cloth on the back of my neck to know effect. A cursive google search also did not seem to reveal a great deal about supplements to lower body heat.

I did however find that Quercetin was considered a natural antihistamine. Histamine is produced as part of an inflammatory response which can bring along with it a general rise in body temperature. Perhaps an anti-histamine supplement would help?

I tried Quercetin with a natural sleep aid that contained valerian and hops. In the past, as mentioned above, the natural sleep aid didn‚Äôt seem to allow me to get any depth of sleep. With the quercetin though I seemed to sleep a little deeper.

Based on advice from the Examine.com I was informed the Green Tea Catechins would be synergistic with Querectin which I thought would be worth trying. This also seemed to work well. Finally I added 100mg of aspirin to the mix as an anti-inflammatory. When I took the 4 supplements together (including the sleep aid) it has generally been a knockout, although for reasons which I suspect to be due to having a later dinner or a stressful day at work their intake is not always a magic bullet.

A note of Caution. **Do not exceed the recommended daily dose for green tea extract.** There are, on record, several examples of liver problems that have been known to occur from overzealous green tea extract supplementation. Stick with the instructions on the pack.

## 4. Exercise: Mitochondrial Density¬†Training

As described above, exercise, made my insomnia significantly worse. This pattern continued even with lifestyle and supplement interventions. There was however one exercise pattern that seemed to circumvent the midnight waking phenomenon. Podcaster Ben Greenfield calls it Mitochondrial Density Training and uses the work of Richards lab as evidence [https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.196303](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.196303)

The idea is that it boost mitochondrial density in your muscles. To achieve this you need short sharp high intensity efforts followed by long (up to 4 minute) rest periods in between. This method seems to provide a form of cellular fatigue without compromising sleep.

If I took a guess at why it doesn‚Äôt compromise sleep I would suggest that it has something to do with the lack of heat generated. Both Sauna and intense exercise were detrimental to my sleep which suggest that heat regulation may play a role in my insomnia. Mitochondrial Density Training allows you to get a workout without overheating

## 5. Lifestyle

My experience with lifestyle modification is that you need immediate feedback. Without the feedback, will power becomes compromised and your best intentions cave. Although some lifestyle modification won‚Äôt immediately mean you sleep longer there may be other variables where you can judge of their effectiveness. Mood, energy, alertness, digestion are good areas to keep an eye open for.

Keep note by the day of any improvement. My rule of thumb is that if I didn‚Äôt notice any improvement within 3 days it was likely to be a waste of my time.

## Dinner time

An early dinner time had an immediate impact on my sleep quality. I noticed that after an early dinner, when I woke during the middle of the night I would fall asleep much more easily.

## Desert

In addition to an early dinner time, I also found cutting out any form of desert helpful. I found cutting out chocolate in particular meant a better nights sleep. Although I‚Äôm a huge fan of chocolate I must admit that I don‚Äôt miss it after sharply reducing it. If you live for chocolate though, perhaps after abstaining for a little while and making improvements in your sleep, you may be able to bring back deserts and a richer dinner before bed.

## Alcohol

During this time, mainly due to my social situation, rather than any form of will-power I benefited from low alcohol intake. I‚Äôm acutely aware that it is very difficult for young people in the modern world to pry their lives from alcohol. The reality is that I think trying to solve insomnia without reducing alcohol would be extremely difficult. Even after 3 years of low alcohol intake I still couldn‚Äôt break the insomnia curse.

This may leave you with a conundrum. How to reduce alcohol and maintain a healthy social life.

Here is one suggestion. Test how refreshed you feel after a night of 1‚Äì2 drinks compared to a night of zero drinks. I think you will appreciate a difference. This at least verifies that alcohol is not good for your sleep. Not even a small amount. Just like desert perhaps you need to give it up entirely for a month or so. Once your sleep integrity is back, perhaps you can look at reintroducing it back to your life.

## Coffee

It seems the case that some people function really well on coffee, I though, am not one of them. When I reduced eliminated coffee I noticed a slight improvement in sleep. I would advise downgrading to dark or green tea. When I did this I found that my reflux symptoms seemed to improve a little. My sleep also improved a little also.

## Stress &¬†Play

Stress for a long time actually really helped me. My stress allowed me not to sleep. It let me get a lot of work done. It justified me being an arsehole. But once I realised that I the amount that I had in my life wasn‚Äôt helping it wasn‚Äôt as simple as just doing a meditation session to turn the stress off. I had an actual addiction to stress. I logically understood that it wasn‚Äôt helping but I couldn‚Äôt just turn away just from being mindful.

Easily the biggest thing that helped me turn away from stress was realising the importance of play. I re-discovered the importance of play whilst listening to an Austin based author called Charlie Hoehn talk about his battles with the black dog and how play helped rescue him from it. He has a book that I can totally recommend called Play it Away. If you‚Äôre a little younger than me perhaps just employing play as a strategy may be enough to remedy your situation. It did for Charlie

## Other resources

Late in my solving of this problem I came across the self hacked website. It made me appreciate how important inflammation is in the clusterfuck that is insomnia. I have not purchased any of their plans and still it has been a great resource for me. If you‚Äôre stuck, at $69.00 USD I think Self Hacked is a reasonable price. Keep in mind you do need 23&Me data.

A slightly more well organised site that most readers will know is Examined.com This is another truly wonderful resource that allows you to verify the claims of many of the supplements you‚Äôre looking to try out. It‚Äôs not quite as pathology focused as self hacked and may come across as overly clinical, which isn‚Äôt always a bad thing. Even better the majority of the content on the site is free.

Last of all I need to also thank Rhonda Patrick, Chris Kresser, Mark Sisson and Ben Greenfield for holding a torch in the initial stages of my health Journey. They have not intentionally helped me but I have mined their sites (and listened to their pod casts) for information on the most obscure of ailments and they have been very helpful. They all operate with great integrity and are slowly making the world a healthier place.

## Conclusion

For me, there was no silver bullet to improving my sleep. There were however lots of small tokens that continually thrust me in the right direction. I hope this post will be one of those tokens for you in helping solve your sleep problems.

## TLDR

This is how I personally solved my middle insomnia. You may not get the same results I did from following & avoiding these steps.

The things that made my sleep WORSE

1. Exercise, the more strenuos the worse the sleep
2. B6 and magnesium
3. Dietary fiber (sorry can‚Äôt be more specific about what type of fibre)
4. heat

Things that HELPED ME get to sleep

1. Alpha Lipoic Acid
2. Lifestyle interventions (early and light dinner, swap coffee for green tea, no night time alcohol, play to help with stress)
3. Quercetin, Green Tea Extract & Aspirin, natural sleep remedies (Valarian ect)
4. Nutrahacker recommendations based on 23 & Me data: avoid B6 and Magnesium add NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract & Creatine
5. Strategic exercise: Mitochondrial Density Training

Discussing your insomnia,"My insomnia came up in a casual conversation with relatives and when asked how I was dealing with it, I admitted that it‚Äôs worsened. In return, I got various tips on how to deal with it (chamomile tea, lavender, meditation, the works - all of which I try now and again with varying results depending on the day), which I expected, but also comments on how I need to ‚Äúturn my thoughts off‚Äù or ‚Äúphysically and mentally exhaust myself‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt want to argue because I figured they can‚Äôt relate to insomnia. However, I came away from the conversation feeling as though my insomnia was just dismissed. 

I guess I‚Äôm just wondering how anyone else in this space deals with occurrences like this? "

Does anyone else have this experience while laying in bed?,"When you're laying in bed, you're tired and unable to go to sleep, and you think you're conscious. When you're in this state, an hour can pass by even though it only felt like 10 minutes. However when you get up, you're groggy as if you've been sleeping.

Are we actually sleeping without knowing it, like still conscious while asleep? Or is it just insomnia?"
Really concerned: 20+ years on nightly ambien and I'm supposed to stop? Anyone else done this before?,"Hello,

I have severe sleep onset insomnia for over 20 years. When it first started, I consulted a sleep disorder clinic and was diagnosed with something physiological causing it. I don't want to be tedious about the details.

The dosage of ambien I began at in the 90's was 40 mg a night with the option to take a 2nd 40 mg, a whole lot higher than now. I dropped to 30 mg. sometime in the 00's and 20-25 mg. when the FDA recommendation changed.

Since then, my doctors have been fine about my continuing for the most part, since I had a real battery of tests showing the degree of my problem, but the pharmacies in my area have refused to fill my prescription, and now my doctor of 15 years is retiring. I highly doubt a new doctor will be willing to prescribe this dose, even though I have zero side effects on it and it still works okay. My doctor has told me this outright. 

Without ambien, I just don't sleep. I don't notice any withdrawal from it. 

I've also come to the conclusion that I may not really be an insomniac so much as someone who gets very physically and mentally ill from a lack of sleep, if that makes any sense. Because it's sleep onset insomnia from a specific medical issue, I don't find any other medication to have worked, and I have literally tried everything on the market.

I'm getting desperate and thinking about just stopping before I am forced to stop (which would prompt so much stress for me), but then I'm afraid I will lose my mind. Literally.

Sometimes I can manage on 15 mg. but only if I stay up all night first.

What I find online is few stories of people coming off of long-term and higher-dose ambien, although I know there must be others. And I also find few stories of how sick people get from not sleeping: I wind up with severe vomiting, an arrhythmia, and my blood sugar all over the place and have had to be hospitalized once from this, and yet I still can't fall asleep because the medical issue awakens me the moment I start to drop off.

I am terrified."

Success story - 1 year of sleep issues,"I have pretty much cured my sleep problem. I‚Äòm sleeping 7 hours a night now and wake up feeling ready for the day (not as good as before all of this, but good enough). In September, I will start my bachelor degree in a different country and I‚Äòm ready for it.

Here are the things that helped me and will help you:

- Sleep Restriction therapy
- Changing my mindset about sleep (I read a book from a german sleep psychologist where he explains a lot about sleep and that relieved my anxiety over sleeping)
- doing sports during the day and riding to work with my bike 
- ear plugs
- spending time with friends, NOT avoiding occasions just because you think it will make your sleep worse (going out, staying up late with friends, travel, work!)
- ear plugs
- meditating 

Things that didn‚Äôt help me and won‚Äôt help you either (most likely):

- Valerian 
- ZMA
- trying too hard to sleep

"Ok, now i‚Äôm Officially fucking scared.","I‚Äôve had insomnia on and off since February. Been to the ER twice since I do not have insurance. Longest I stay up is maybe 2 days at a time. I get trrrible panic attacks when I don‚Äôt sleep which keeps me up even longer. Usually I am able to calm down and fall asleep after 2-4 hours with the help of NyQuil. Yesterday I was only able to fall asleep for 2 hours. Last night, I still could not sleep. I laid down at 4am and slept maybe 15 mins. I just kept laying there until almost 8am. I‚Äôm scared because this time I literally could not fall asleep. My brain would not shut off. I was not having a panic attack or thinking anxious thoughts. I just could not fall asleep. Now, the very top of my head hurts extremely bad like someone hit me over the head. It‚Äôs sore and it could be a brain tumor or something neurological. Then I told me boyfriend just now and he got mad at me for always complaining and got in my face like he was gonna hit me. I started crying and my head pain got even worse.

Why Chronic Insomnia Is (Maybe) Not Taken Seriously Enough,
"Anyone else have that problem where you fall asleep for maybe 5 minutes, or feel like you're in that ""transfer state"" then suddenly you're wide awake for the rest of the night?","This is how my insomnia works. It's like my brain is damaged in a certain way and just doesn't make the transfer state. Then it must think it just had a nap, and I swear - I'm not tired in the very slightest. 

Last night I was so fatigued and tired that it felt like I could barely keep my eyes open (very rare for me). I think I did sleep for 5 minutes with the weird thoughts and dreamy things that aren't logical and make no sense, and then SNAP. Much much later when I was brave enough to look at the clock it was 4:43. 

It really sucks knowing how fucked you'll feel the next few days. I try to meditate and such. I'm just rarely able to make the transfer. 

Anyone else experience this?"

Good news everyone! The FDA has approved a new sleeping pill - Belsomra (Suvorexant),
I finally went to a Sleep Doctor.,"Update 4/20/14: Pictures  http://imgur.com/a/3S6U5

TLDR:  Found out I have sleep apnea, waiting to hear from Dr on what to do next.

I went to my sleep test on Thursday night.  Had reserved parking, checked into the clinic on the 5th floor.  Passed a lot of pissed off people in the lobby who were in town to see Bruce Springsteen, thought they had reserved rooms, but they didn't.  Oops.  The clinic was in a sectioned off part of the 5th floor, and I had to be buzzed in.  Once in, I signed a bunch of forms, and they took me to my room.  I was in my room by 7.30pm.  As soon as I was in, my nurse came in, and told me my Dr had ordered a ""double test"" or something like that.  I had no idea what she was talking about, she said that my Dr told them that if I had signs of apnea within the first 2 hours, they had to hook me up to a cpap for the rest of the night and record my results of that, too.  So before lights out, she brought in the nasal mask and hooked it up to the cpap that was next to the bed.  She had me wear it to get used to it just in case she needed to put it on me later on in the night.

The nasal mask was actually wonderful.  It very soft, and as soon as I put it on my ears popped and I could hear.  And If I opened my mouth just right, I could sound like Darth Vader:)  

A little later, she came back in with a crap ton of wires and boxes and stuff.  I had to put wires down my pant legs, down my shirt, she put wires on my head and face and legs, connectors to all of that and on my back and boobs.  And to top it off, she taped stuff to my finger, and some plastic thing that stuck out of my nose.  I have pictures, but it has me in it and well, I'm not confident enough to be made fun of on Reddit.

She told me that if I had to use the bathroom later on she would come in, unhook me, let me pee, and hook me back up in bed.  The poor lady didn't know she would do that twice that night:(

Anyway, I took 2 Ambien and that's all I remember.

When I woke up the next morning, she said that I stopped breathing within the first 2 minutes of falling asleep, I had dreams, and I got up twice to use the bathroom.  They did put the cpap on me, and I had no problems for the rest of the night.  That was all she could tell me, so now I have to wait to hear from my sleep dr about what to do next.

Just a side note, there were 10 patients from all over the southeast that night.  1 nurse is assigned for 2 patients.

**********************************



TLDR:  I've had various degrees of insomnia for 40 years, and I am going to an overnight  sleep study (where they hook me up to stuff)  on the 17 to find out why.



I've had various degrees of insomnia since I was about 7 years old.  (I'm 47 now).  I believe it started because of the abusive house I was living in, mother was a raging alcoholic and would like to beat on us kids in the middle of the night.  All 3 of us would huddle in bed and the second we heard her rants turn to us, we knew she would stumble up the stairs and start on us, so we would hide. We would go out a window to the roof or under a bed or in a closet.  This went on for 5 years, until I was taken away by the state and sent to live with my father (who I didn't know) in a different state. 

I remember in those years that I had to move my legs at night to get to sleep.  I don't know if it was a comfort measure or RLS.

Once in the new state, I started sleep walking.  My father tells me stories of how I would get on the dresser and say that I was going to fly away.  I don't really remember having sleep problems during my teenage years, but when I reached my 20s and started working, I found that I could not fall asleep at night.  Back in those days (late 80s), not much was available for sleep and I didn't have insurance anyway, so I just worked 3rd shift on all of my jobs.  I was still moving my legs to sleep at night, which was brought to my attention by various boyfriends over the years.

Once married ( in 1999) got pregnant and that is when my legs really took off.  It was really fucking unbearable.  I would beat on my legs in an effort to get them to stop making me feel like they had to run.  Plus I gained a ton of weight, which started me snoring, and I still had a difficult time falling asleep at night.  

Currently, I find it impossible to fall sleep without Ambien.  I've been on 20mg's for 10 years, and it works.  It hasn't stopped my legs from feeling weird, but I can lead a perfectly normal life, take Ambien, go to sleep, and do things that normal people do without feeling tired.  But since I never lost the weight I gained, my husband says I wake up constantly throughout the night.  (I don't remember because Ambien).

I'm at the point where I want to get fixed, and since I have insurance, I might as well use it because this shits expensive.  Last week, I went to Vanderbilt Sleep Center and met with a young doctor who is board certified in Behavioral Sleep Medicine and Neurology.  She rocks.  This entire place rocks, this entire place is all about sleep.  I'm hopeful they will find out what is wrong with me.

She told me that the dose of Ambien I am on is not good, and the latest recommendation for women is at the most 10 mg.  And that there are no long term studies on Ambien and women.  So she told me to reduce my dose to 10mg a night.  (which I haven't done, my bad).  She also put me on a low dose of  gabapentin 100 mg, which I can take up to 3 if needed, for my legs.  And she also insisted that I buy a copy of ""Say Good Night To Insomnia"" by Gregg Jacobs.  She said this book is the best book on sleep.  I'm skeptical because I have read so much on insomnia, it all sounds the same to me.  But I'll read it and give it a try.

So my instructions for now are to lose weight, take gabapentin an hour before bed, read ""Say Good Night to Insomia"", and reduce the Ambien to 10 mg.

Next week on the 17th, I get to go to a swanky hotel and get hooked up to a trillion machines for an overnight sleep study. After insurance, this whole thing is going to cost about $1700.  And that's not including a cpap machine if I need it.  

If you managed to make it to the end, thanks for reading this far.  I hope my experience will help someone else, because chronic insomnia can make life suck, and we only get one short time here, and we should be able to enjoy it.

My cue to quit trying...,
"I can't sleep at night, but I have no issues sleeping in the late morning or afternoon.","I don't know how to fix this. I don't get tired at night when I'm supposed to sleep, and I end up lying in bed awake until 4 or 5 in the morning when I need to be up by 7:30 or 8. 

I'm at college and this wreaks havoc with my ability to attend classes and keep up with the workload. Sometimes I just can't help but decide to sleep away the day to make up for my lack of sleep the previous night. Besides this, my roommate who is a close friend of mine just announced to me today that she is moving out because of my nocturnal behavior - it's making it hard for her to sleep too. I feel utterly horrible about this."
I'm so frustrated right now... how is this even possible? [NSFW language],"I'm so fucking tired. I have always had issues with sleeping... but I figured that maybe, just fucking maybe... after traveling with little rest for two weeks and arriving in a new time zone, my body would only be too happy to finally get some rest. NOPE. Here I am, exhausted as SHIT... tired as SHIT... yet I *still* lay awake in bed for HOURS. I fall asleep maybe an hour or two, then I am up again. I really can't take it anymore. I have to work... I have to prepare for work... but I am just so tired I can't even think straight.

EDIT: Hello everyone. Something I have found that has been helping me is Valerian root extract. I've been taking it for a week now and it has been helping regulate my sleeping... crazy dreams though... which is just a bonus in my opinion."

i‚Äôve tried going to a different room and reading a book, tried sleeping in a different room, tried having a snack. tried meditating. tried relaxing my body part by part. Nothing works.

I had an intense match today under the blazing sun and i was a worried i‚Äôd pass out. I‚Äôm obviously also having breathing difficulties and heavy movement.

I‚Äôm literally the walking dead.

This only happens on big days.

Why am i like this? I feel so frustrated and i have zero clue on what to do."
I'm so tired of being tired,"It's 145am, I have to be up at 630am, but I still haven't been able to fall asleep.  If I do fall asleep I can't stay asleep,  and wake up throughout the night.  As the week progresses I become more irritable and it's harder to think.  On weekends I take sleeping pills and knock out for 12 hours,  but I feel like shit because I spend my time sleeping instead of work my kids.  I wish I knew how to stop this cycle!"
7 am sleep doctor appointments are just mean,"I had to be awake at 6, which is my bedtime.

‚ÄúWe know you don‚Äôt sleep at the normal time, so we‚Äôll make you wake up bright and early and ruin the rest of your day!‚Äù"
Sleeping past 4am everyday?,Lately all I do is watch YouTube until I passout at around 4.30am but last night I put on light chill music and it seemed to work. Still slept at 4am but was more comfortable and had better sleep. Earphones hurt while I roll around. Any tips or advice? 
I Never Sleep,"I know, a little misleading. But for my whole life, I have had sleep issues.  Whether it‚Äôs getting a few hours of sleep a day in increments, Hypnagogia, chronic multiple nightmares and night, Sleep deprivation to where I can‚Äôt stay awake but wake up 15 minutes later in panic, Sleep Paralysis, or just all of the above.  Sometimes I have panic attacks from anxiety and I think it has to do with my blood pressure always being off. I‚Äôm at the point where I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I started drinking heavily years ago so I could just pass out. But now I‚Äôm trying to cut it out and get sober because I wanna have kids in the next year or two.  Sometimes I live an entire other life in my dreams, sometimes they just haunt in the worst imaginable ways possible...  i‚Äôve never seen a doctor, but I am so scared of pills.  I‚Äôm just losin it man."
"I fucking hate you, insomnia","You've made almost every aspect of my life more difficult than it needed to be. You're making it so damn hard for me to finish my thesis when I've worked on this project so hard for over two years. I know having a very 'alert' brain also has advantages, but if it had a sleep switch, my life would be immeasurably easier."
Please help me sleep,"I‚Äôm losing my mind. This is the third time this week I‚Äôm destined for zero sleep, and these next two weeks are incredibly busy with grad school deadlines. I don‚Äôt know what to do. 

I‚Äôve tried every breathing exercise on the planet, drunk gallons of chamomile tea, taken a million ‚Äúrelaxing‚Äù showers, the usual basic shit. If my body decides it‚Äôs not going to sleep, there‚Äôs nothing I can do. The only thing that has ever worked is sometimes I get so upset that I cry so hard that I throw up and then after that sometimes I can get an hour of sleep. But lately I can‚Äôt even cry, I just lie motionless for eight hours until it‚Äôs time to screw up another day.

Part of my job sometimes involves scuba diving, usually early in the morning. So I can‚Äôt use sleep drugs or alcohol to make me sleep, or hit myself in the head with a cast iron pan (if I could I‚Äôd probably be an alcoholic by now). I don‚Äôt know what to do. Guess at this point my only hope is finding someone with a magic wand but maybe someone knows a secret I don‚Äôt."
"This is a cry for help, please read","I slept only one hour. And the night before that I literally got zero sleep. I'm not talking 1-3 hours of sleep, I mean ZERO. And yet i'm not tired. My eyes feel like they're burning and my whole body aches but i'm not sleepy. I never get the heavy eyes feeling anymore. I think i've been like this for two years already and i'm getting fed up.

I'm not the only one, right? I'm not the only one staying up for 2-3 days with zero sleep? 

I don't know what to do. Nothing helps. None of this natural supplement shit and sleep hygiene or whatever. And I can't take benzos because i'm a really small, very underweight girl and i'm afraid something might happen to me if I take some. I mean i'm literally idk 85-90 lbs at 5'3

Also this night, I had my first ever nightmare..I was with my friends and we were knees deep in SHIT and literally just throwing..shit at ourselves for no fucking reason. What the actual fuck? Later in my nightmare, i'm home and i'm like fucking dying or something, I don't know, it felt like I was dying, I couldn't breathe and I was in tears just begging to my mom to take me to the hospital and she was just sobbing and hugging me

I'm still shaking. Death is my biggest fear and especially death from lack of sleep, which I almost every day worry about.

What do I do if I don't sleep this night as well? Can I go to the urgent care for 3 days no sleep and how can they help me??
"
Complaining about your insomnia isn't fixing anything!,"I wanted to preface this post by saying that I'm not trying to offend anybody, but I am sharing what I would consider a 'challenging' truth about insomnia recovery that would've saved me a lot of pain throughout my insomnia, and had helped me in my recovery. This may not apply to everybody, but I'm hoping that it's helpful for the people that it resonates with.

When I browse r/insomnia, I notice that there's quite a few posts that are just complaints, things like - sarcastic posts about how great insomnia is, letting people know that it's 3am and you're still awake.

This sort of complaining isn't conducive to recovery, and from experience, there's little to no value in venting like this. Sure, you can argue that it's helping you feel supported or airing out some frustrations, but it quickly spirals, becoming unproductive and negatively impacting your recovery.

From experience, I've noticed that this sort of complaining is detrimental to recovery in a similar way that reassurance seeking for OCD sufferers is, and subs like r/ocd and r/rocd actually have rules against reassurance seeking, because they've realised how unproductive it is.

**Okay, so why is it so bad?**

I could write about this forever, but I'll highlight the key issues that I've noticed in my own life:

* **You achieve nothing through complaining -** seriously, ask yourself, what do you get from complaining that's conducive to your recovery.  Sure, you may get a little bit of relief, but it's temporary, and in the long run, it's just going to cause more hurt. It's an ineffective way of working with the frustrating and challenging emotions of insomnia.

* **You're fighting against something that you can't escape from -** if you're struggling with insomnia, you probably won't sleep tonight and don't have the choice to just sleep, so why fight the inevitable? I'm 100% sure that a huge component in why I developed such challenging insomnia was that I had spent so many sleepless nights spiralling into pits of frustration, getting angrier and angrier at my situation. I've found that the more you rattle against your cage of insomnia, the more you're training your nervous system to link anything sleep related to the feelings of helplessness, frustration, anxiety and anger, further tightening the grip of insomnia.

* **You're becoming self-centered, selfish and obsessive -** the more you entertain this woe-is-me mentality, the more you lose your perspective and find it easier to become consumed by your problems. When I speak to people who have suffered from insomnia for years, I've noticed a trend in some (but obviously not all) where their problems are all that matter, all of their decisions are based around this and they have no capacity to consider other people.

**Don't worry though, there is an alternative!**

Actually, there's a few alternatives, but at the root of each, it's about growing up and learning how to maturely and skillfully work with your frustrations. I have found that learning how to skillfully handle these frustrations and the general terror of insomnia, without complaining or ruminating, was super helpful in my recovery. I'll mention a few:

* **Acceptance -** rather than acting out your frustrations and complaining, it is possible to practice acceptance of your situation instead. When I realised I could do this, it radically changed my life (and not just my sleep), because it provided an entirely new way of relating to challenges and life in general. For me, the first step was learning how to experience the direct, raw sensory data of my feeling body, on a level below thinking - so you're feeling what you're feeling, without interpreting it. If you'd like more resources on this, just let me know in a comment.

* **Widening your perspective and thinking about others -** thinking about, and practising compassion for others, has helped me widen my perspective and proved to be a great antidote to the self-centered, neurotic and sometimes toxic cycle of obsessing about my own problems. When you consider others and how they are struggling, it provides you with a break in your self-obsessed rumination. [Here's](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/) a load of great exercises to help with this.

* **Dropping the complaint as it arises -** this is really tricky, but it's a worthwhile practice. Every compulsion to complain will first arise as a thought, like a 'damn, this sucks'. When you notice these, you can drop them as they arise, just letting it go. I do this by shifting my focus to the direct experience of my body if I start to ruminate, and I may have to repeat the exercise 10 - 15 times in a short period of time before I've fully dropped a particular thought, because I keep getting pulled back into the drama of it. The more you do it, the better you get at dropping this type of thinking.

I can't stress how important this is, and how detrimental complaining can be to your recovery. Everything that I have shared takes practice, and it's something that I'll personally be working on for my entire life.

I'm not saying that this will fix your insomnia overnight, and right now, you probably don't have a choice in being able to sleep, but you will always have the choice to skillfully relate to your circumstances, rather than fighting against them and making it worse for yourself.

I hope you've found this useful, and if you have any comments, questions or criticism, please let me know!

Noise Sensitivity,"The main source of my insomnia at this stage of my life is noise sensitivity. I moved recently, which set off all types of insomnia, and now what remains are the intermittent traffic sounds right outside my window. I also wake up if my cats make noises or my housemate gets home late, which is common (he works in a restaurant). It's putting a bit of a strain on our relationship and in fact, the traffic is keeping him from sleeping well too. I use a white noise machine, Bedphones and earplugs to try and block out what noise I can. Any ideas? "
Melatonin hallucinations/nightmares?,"Whenever I take melatonin I experience really intense hallucinations (minimal dose), or excruciatingly vivid nightmares (higher dose).

Is this reaction common?

Similar experiences/alternative recommendations??"
Don't believe everything you think!,"After many years of on-and-off insomnia, I learned something quite shocking about my insomnia today.

I just got back from a follow up appointment after a sleep study I did about a month ago. I was hooked up to sensors all over my face and head and my arms and legs and was studied for 7.5 hrs. Now, I have absolutely no awareness of having slept that night. It was long and uncomfortable. I know that insomniacs typically nod off and have light intermittent sleep more than they realize, so when they asked me, I guessed I maybe slept 1-2 hrs. It turns out I slept 6.5 hours and was only awake in the middle of the night for about an hour. (this is the time I remember most vividly as being frustrated and tossing and turning). The rest of the night, I believed I was just laying there awake trying to stay calm and relaxed. I asked the doctor if my sleep was light or intermittent and he said that it was perfectly normal and cycled through the different stages of sleep.

To me this is a huge revelation... A week or two ago, I decided that I had had enough with trying different techniques to sleep and writing in my sleep diary and all of that. I just decided to focus on having a good day and do my best and to just try to relax when I can't sleep.... and the amount of sleep that I have been getting (or believe to be getting) hasn't changed, but I do feel better. I'm doing better at work and able to get in a few workouts a week and socialize... I'm a bit sleepy but I'm ok. I think sometimes our anxiety/depression about sleep impacts us at least as much as the actual loss of sleep. 

I know it seems impossible. It seems like how little sleep you're getting is killing you, or that there's no way you'll be able to make it through your workday or whatever trials await you in the morning. But it is possible that you are ok, and just need to work on learning to let go of negative sleep thoughts and anxiety."
Sleeping in 30 minute intervals... experiencing night terrors,"Man, just when I think my insomnia is at it's peak it just get's worse. I'm now getting about 3 hours of sleep per day if that and when I do, I have incredibly vivid and horrific dreams. Like this morning when  I finally dosed off,  I was searching my house, in dream, for this demon-like entity. I felt extreme paranoia and in dream I was researching on my computer for getting vision flashes of this horned creature and I found that there was some sort of evil spirit playing tricks on me. It sounds stupid but I can't begin to explain how real it felt. I was literally in the first person, turning lights on and off, could feel temperatures, could see shadow figures... Yeah, once I woke up and all the paranoia went away because I hardly even believe in that shit, but a part of me does and that's beyond the point but I have no motivation to even try sleeping because this is just one of many extremely vivid and personal dreams I've experienced. "
"The ""New Guys"" always think they've had a breakthrough and ""cured my insomnia""","That's all. Just that I've been seeing a lot of posts on this sub lately saying ""omg guys I found this one crazy insomnia trick that totalllly works"".
That's what the new guys always say. I was there. 
It can ruin your life. Insomnia is a big deal idgaf what anyone says. It's basically impeded on everything I want in my life from getting accomplished. 

I was once the new guy just like everyone else.
6 years later and I'm honestly not sure how long I'm gonna survive. "
Having to deal with a tragedy today,"Don't know where to post, but I struggle with insomnia for many months.

Suddenly my stepfather died today, and I heard about it like 6 hours after the tragedy. My mom is devastated, she thought she lived a nightmare. The loss of one person suddenly is a shock for many of us, so it feels like you are living a dream.

I didn't love him that much tbh, but I respected him as a good man he was. I am concerned and now I realize that we must protect ourselves and our family members, to help them and let aside the conflicts. I have many regrets right now that I am aware of, and I want to fix myself as a person.

And I can't sleep because my mind is drown in the idea that one day I will disappear in a second from the conscious life. Very depressed.

UPDATE: Sleeping very poor, woke up in a nightmare."
Terrified of falling asleep,"As the title said, as stupid as it seems, I am terrified of falling asleep, and when tired I am literally scared of going into my bed. The feeling of dread I get when I know I MUST sleep in the next day or two is sickening. It's a lot of factors, but the mere concept of dreams and sleep paralysis scare the living shit out of me, especially considering I've never had it before, I almost feel like I'm just waiting for it to happen. 

I am also scared of the kind of surreal dreams I can have, I DON'T want to dream, I don't want to see what horrific visions my brain can conjure up, its a horrible feeling, even if I do ""forget"" it the next day, knowing that I will experience it is scary. And all this isn't that I'm stressed out in my life, its literally just sleep that scares me and causes me to panic. Lying there, you are completely vulnerable and unaware of the outside world and whoever maybe there...

Does anyone else have this level of anxiety of sleep? Do you think there is anyway I can get over it?"
What happened to me? Who are they? Can anyone help me? can anyone relate?,"It was probably about 11 in a hotel room near Canon City Colorado when i decided I'd take my Ambien and head to bed as my head hit the pillow I felt this odd feeling that I can only explain as a sinking feeling... The room began to turn pitch black and I decided to ""let go"" expecting to fall asleep soundly for once.. suddenly I find my self falling through the bed down a dark pit, I could feel the loss of breath as if I had just been on a roller coaster that was taking a dive by the time I could gasp for air I was in this hellish firey brimstone cave like environment, then these creatures began tearing me apart and burning my flesh, the pain was all to real..I forced my self to wake up and by the grace of God I was able, but as I screamed and shook to consciousness I found myself surrounded by these dark shadowy figures (writing about this now is giving me then chills) I was petrified past the group of shadow people surrounding my bed was a tall dark hooded figure looking at me with no face just blackness when my mother awoke near me to my cries they all left just like that.. please can anyone relate to this or do I have some demonic attachment I'm scared to sleep tonight at fear they will take me. I know this wasn't sleep paralysis because I had motor control."
Hate being told I sleep all-day,"Yeah, ""sleep"""
How I beat insomnia,"Even though my insomnia might not have been as severe as some people in this thread, I would like to tell you guys how it stopped.

For me, it began in grade 9, the beginning of high school (about 6 years ago) . It was the last night of winter break, the next day school was starting again. Even though I had stayed up late during the holidays (probably going to bed at 12 or 1) even when that time came along, I still couldn‚Äôt sleep. I can‚Äôt quite remember that night but at some point as time went on I just thought ‚Äúthere‚Äôs something wrong with me, I just can‚Äôt sleep!‚Äù 

So why? Why couldn‚Äôt I sleep? It was because I didn‚Äôt want to go back to school. High school was not the best experience for me personally.

I eventually fell asleep around 4 or 5 am, getting maybe 2 hours of restless sleep at most. I told my mom in the morning I wasn‚Äôt feeling well, my parents and I had an argument and eventually they gave up and I stayed home, trying to get some sleep but strangely it didn‚Äôt happen. I had never gotten so little sleep before, so I wasn‚Äôt used to how much your head hurts and limbs hurt. 

Anyways I don‚Äôt quite remember the following night, but I think I had a hard time going to sleep too, but definitely got much more sleep than the night before. 

A few days later my family and I went on vacation (I know a weird time to go) and I had no trouble at all sleeping (probably because I didn‚Äôt have school). And when we got back, the not sleeping came up again. 

I eventually got into a pattern where almost every Sunday I wouldn‚Äôt sleep until 4 or 5 (maybe not at all) and the day after that I would sleep okay and then I would barely sleep. That would be the cycle on the weekdays and on the weekend I‚Äôd sleep like a baby. 

This continued for me in grade 10 (after having a summer with barely any insomnia at all) and I was doing sports, and all I could think about is if I don‚Äôt get ‚Äú7-8 hours of sleep I will not be able to practice tomorrow‚Äù and so it was a self fulfilling prophecy.

It got to a point very quickly where sleep was all I could think about. I would spend hours before bed reading in the living room with the lights slightly dimmed in hopes it would make me drowsy. If that didn‚Äôt work, i would do yoga for an hour or two or meditation. I followed all the sleep hygiene. I read a book about it that stated many rules, you guys probably know them all such as only use bed for sleep, turn off electronics a hour before bed, don‚Äôt stay in bed if you don‚Äôt fall asleep after 20 minutes, etc. none of these tips seem to work because the minute I got into bed despite how tired I could be, my heart would never stop racing and the only thing I could think about was what If i can‚Äôt sleep? And how terrible I would feel the next day if I didn‚Äôt sleep. I would cry so much at night because of how frustrated I was. Whenever I got a good sleep I would wake up in the morning, be happy for a few hours then start worrying if I would sleep again.

Eventually, my mom took me to a doctor and I got zoplicone (something like that?) I think it might have been a placebo effect because when I got the prescription filled I felt so relieved like a big weight was lifted off my shoulders . The first night I took it was crazy (in a good way). within 20 minutes I could feel the effects. I could barely walk in a straight line I was so drowsy. It was great.

Okay, no, my insomnia was not solved with a sleeping pill. With it I would sleep maybe 9/10 nights instead of 4/10 nights. There were a couple of nights I distinctly remember where I took the pill yet didn‚Äôt sleep at all.

As time went on I knew very well it was the fact that I was obsessing over sleep so much that was driving the insomnia. It was also the stress of school and sports and the fact that If i didn‚Äôt sleep, I wouldn‚Äôt be able to function. It was always that fear. 

In my final year of high school, I dialed down my stress, quit sports and took the minimum amount of classes I needed to graduate so I‚Äôd spend less time at school. (It was mostly the social aspect that stressed me out but that‚Äôs a story for another time) during this year, I stopped taking my sleeping pills, and I slept fine, 9/10. I think this is because I stopped worrying and focusing my entire life around it.

Unfortunately, insomnia flared up again for me during the time I was about to start my second job. I could barely sleep, and the worry that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to sleep and not function the next day started to creep up on me again.

Fortunately, this time around I found a book that was far more helpful than the one I had read before. The one I read before suggested so many tips about promoting sleep that it made my anxiety worse. It made me obsess over sleep more, and worry more.  I‚Äôm sorry to say I don‚Äôt remember the title or author of this book (but I‚Äôll look around for it and post it here if I find it!) but the book was talking about letting your fear of not sleeping go away. It was kind of like CBT I think. Instead of thinking about how terrible you are at getting to sleep, get out a piece of paper and write ‚ÄúIM AN AMAZING SLEEPER‚Äù as many times as you feel necessary to do so.

The book talked about how sleep is natural, our bodies know how to sleep and we should trust them to do their job. 

Basically this book really I think was the thing that stopped my insomnia . Of course I‚Äôll maybe have a night of very little sleep maybe once a month or once every few months but I think that‚Äôs pretty normal. I don‚Äôt follow any sleep hygiene at all now. I‚Äôll sit in my bed whenever I like, I‚Äôll watch tv in my bed, do homework in my bed. I‚Äôll still be able to fall asleep pretty good. I think not following sleep hygiene helps me because I no longer associate my bed with anxiety anymore. Sleep hygiene made me obsess over the problem more.

I guess I‚Äôll stop there. Long story short, I was able to stop insomnia by not obsessing over it, getting rid of my stressors, and changing my mindset. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this seems to simple or obvious or doesn‚Äôt help anyone. I just had an urge to share."
Anyone else feel like sleep is a battlefield?,"I could be perfectly fine during the day but the moment that clock strikes 7pm and the sun starts to set and my f.lux & blue light filters start to active I instantly start dreading the hours as they tick by until I'm in bed and forced to just lay there and contemplate how long it will take me to fall asleep this time and how many hours I'll get tonight. 

It's mentally exhausting having this mindset night after night after night. "
I think I found the cause of my insomnia,"Food. If I eat after 7pm, when I lay down to sleep I have racing thoughts and keep waking up but if I don‚Äôt eat after 7pm, then I can actually fall asleep faster and stay asleep. I had a hunch this was the problem but continues to eat around 8pm or so, until last night when I didn‚Äôt and slept like a baby. "
"Second night of no sleep, omw to work","So, haven't slept in 54 hours, called in sick yesterday to get some sleep but it didn't work. Already missed too much in a short period of time so I have no choice but to go. It's not really safe but w/e.

Hopefully they see that I look like a mess and send me home."
What is troubling you?,"Very often insomnia is caused by stress or anxiety over something. Resolving it the most sure way to cure insomnia.

I improved my sleep a lot by learning a simple technique: when i feel something is troubling me (my mood is not positive) - i try to find what it is and resolve it as much as possible. If resolution is not possible - i change my attitude towards the situation,  looking at the positive sides of it.

Sometimes anxiety is hidden: i wont feel relaxed and sleep wont come at all, while i cannot think of anything causing it. Example from my life: i have a little kitten, if it is in my room - i wont feel sleepy because for some reason it is unconsciously worrying me. Bedroom and pre-bed time should be free of things and situations that cause stress or anxiety.

Talk to people who have same problems as you. Feeling that you are not alone will help, while together it is easier to find a solution. Do not talk to people who dont share your problems - they will not understand you and can say something arrogant that will anger you."
Mental Insomnia Treamnent Guide,"If you have issues like sleep apnea, paralysis or other physical issues - this guide wont help. Otherwise consider using it.

Insomnia is usually being onset by stress, anxiety or depression. If not treated quickly - it becomes chronical, which means that sleep gets worse and medications become less effective. If treated properly - it will pass within a month or two, but proper treatment happens rarely.

**Sleep Hygiene.**

1. Avoid stress at any cost. Nothing is worse to sleep than stress. If stress happened but passed - sleep will become worse for some time, but then will return.
2. Wake up at 5-6 AM and dont let yourself to sleep more, even if you didnt get full 8 hours. If you have delayed sleep phase disorder - this is the most important step of fixing it. Set alarm to 5-6 AM and make it very loud, and put phone far away so you cant reach it with your hand. Waking early is important to make you feel sleepy in the evening - it makes the circadian rhythm work, which otherwise is messed up.
3. 2 hours before sleep stop doing any work or tasks - no internet, no calls/chat, no discussions. Start watching a movie or anime and you will feel relaxed and sleepy.
4. F.LUX - it adjusts screen brightness to the time of day, i cant imagine my life without it. Set wake up time to 5-6 AM, so it will dim the screen past 8 PM and you will feel sleepy.
5. Dont go to bed until you feel tired. If you go to bed while not tired - you wont fall to sleep and make it worse. Its better to sleep for 5-6 hours only than to spend 8 hours lying in bed awake. People can function on 6 hours of sleep fine for several days.
6. When in bed dont think about anything troubling, especially about sleep.
7. If you cant help but keep thinking about something troubling - start listening audio books, i listened several wonderful books this way and they helped me to sleep. If you dont like books - listening mantra helped me too (its a singing that you cant understand, but somehow it calms).
8. If you cant fall asleep within 30 minutes - get out of bed and continue watching movie until you feel tired.

**General Health.**

1. Walk outside daily, better on sunrise (6 am) and sunset (6-8 PM). It calms tremendously and provides vitamin D. 30 minutes of walk is enough.
2. Vitamins from food: ocean salmon meat, salmon eggs, buckwheat, millet, cabbage (broccoli), carrot, onion, garlic, tomato, linen oil, beetroot, bell pepper, dill - they contain a lot of essential aminoacids. They can taste very well if cooked properly. Eating only potatoes, bread, chicken and cow makes your body starved on nutrients.

**Self Psychotherapy.**

1. When something is troubling you - try to analyze what it is (find the source), then find a solution and solve it immediately or as soon as you can. It can reverse your depression and bring joy of life back. It can sway your mood back to positive thinking.
2. Take time to appreciate every good thing that happened (or not happened) to you that could have otherwise been worse. It will sway your mood back to positive thinking. In other words look at the good side of any situation.
3. Creation. Looking at things as they improve changes mood to positive thinking. I grow flowers as my way of creation and looking at them calms mind.

**If you want to cure insomnia (start sleeping without drugs) - measures above are a mandatory.**

**Medications.**

1. Alcohol - it is a brain hormone, which is created when we eat (in our intestines by bacteries that live there). It calms, relieves anxiety and improves mood a lot. Alcohol was a tide-changing factor when i was discontinuing one of my medications. Optimal doze per day is about 600-800 ml of 4-5&#37; beer. Lesser doze will have no effect, higher doze will not add anything while building tolerance. Alcohol builds tolerance and addiction fast. As initial treatment you can drink this much daily for 1-2 weeks, but otherwise dont take it more often than 1 time per 2 weeks.
2. Phenibut - potent anti-anxiety medication, but builds tolerance fast and addiction moderately. If you want it to have effect - dont take it more often than several times per week. As a course you can take it for 1-2 months, but not longer - it will loose effect after a week anyway.
3. NyQuil - potent at relieving anxiety and sedating. Builds tolerance moderately, can loose effect after several weeks.
4. Melatonin - hormone that tells your body to sleep. Can be taken before sleep as a supplement. Builds tolerance moderately, can last for several months.
5. Atarax - similar to nyquil, but requires prescription.
6. Cannabidiol - is forbidden in many places, but where it is allowed - it helped many people. I cannot tell more about it because it is forbidden here and i never tried it.
7. Benzodiazepines - they are the most potent anxiety relieving medications, but also known to form a life-threatening dependency if addiction was developed. Generally it is safe to take them every day for 2 weeks, but some of them can be taken for a longer time. If you take them only 1-2 times a week - they can be taken for a longer time.
8. Pregabalin - similar to benzodiazepines, is one of the most potent anti-anxiety medications, also forms a strong addiction if taken longer than 2 weeks. Gabapentin - less effective and less addictive version of it.
9. Lunesta and Ambien - short acting (about 4 hours) sleep inducing drugs. Lunesta builds tolerance fast (a month or two at best). Ambien builds tolerance much slowed (some people take it for years), but many people hallucinate and sleep walk with it.
10. Trazodone - antidepressant that improves mood, but also has a potent sedating effect.
11. Mirtazapine - antidepressant and one of the most potent sleep medications, builds tolerance slowly, but causes massive weight gain. Weight gain can be negated or reversed with metformin (reduces blood sugar) and exercises.
12. Agomelatin - antidepressant that induces melatonin secretion. It is mostly used for treatment of delayed sleep phase disorder and people with insomnia naturally develop it with time.
13. SSRI antidepressants are the tide-turning factor in treating insomnia. Serotonin is the hormone of good-feeling and calmness, in the evening it is being transformed into melatonin (hormone of sleep). Lack of serotonin causes anxiety, feeling bad (depression), difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early waking up. Any treatment of chronical insomnia should be started with SSRI antidepressant to check if sleep will improve over several weeks. Escitalopram is considered the most suitable for insomnia, while paroxetine is the most potent one and is used for depression. It reduces libido for males (it takes longer to reach orgasm), but not much and some married people consider it as an improvement.
14. Quetiapine - its main action is reducing dopamine, and thus it can cause akathisia and dry mouse (passes over few weeks) and dyskinesia (it means that dopamine level is too low and quetiapine doze must be reduced). Side actions are antidepressive (it is quite potent at it) and sedating (again very potent). It builds tolerance very slowly, people (including me) take it for many years without loosing effect. While sedating and antidepressive effects are useful for insomnia treatment, reducing dopamine is not. Dopamine is the hormone of motivation, sexual drive and muscle tonus. Thus reducing dopamine will mean lack of motivation, reduced libido and can cause shaking hands. To avoid this you should start with 1/2 or 1/4 of 25 mg pill and increase until you reach required effect. Maximum doze should not go over 150 mg, but usually 50-75 mg is enough. Regular antidepressive doze is 300 mg, while antipsychotive doze is 600-1200 mg.
15. Chlorprothixene - another antipsychotic (dopamine reducer), has even stronger sedative effect than quetiapine. Does not have antidepressive effect, but has depressive effect instead and thus will worsen depression. Causes dependency and is very difficult to discontinuate. It is the last resort for people who cannot sleep at all and tried all other drugs.

**Drugs can be combined as long as they belong to different classes.** Ultimately you can take 1 drug of every class, this is how i cured my very severe insomnia. Antipsychotics can be combined, but it increases risk of various side effects, including dangerous ones.

Curing chronical insomnia takes years. Be patient, you can discontinue every drug no matter how long you were taking them. But discontinuing prematurely will result in a relapse of symptoms

If you want to discontinue something - cut the usual doze into 2 parts of 2/3 and 1/3. Take 2/3 part 2 hours before sleep time (for drugs except ambien/lunesta onset of action is 2 hours), if within 1.5-2 hours you dont feel sleepy - take the other 1/3 part. If 2/3 doze worked - keep this doze for 3-4 months before next attempt to reduce doze.

**Insomnia can be cured once you find the correct combination of measures. Experiment to improve your life!**"
"Does anyone else seem to have a ""cycle?""","Been this way as long as I can remember, but anywhere between every 1 - 3 months my symptoms get much stronger for a week or two, then go back to 'normal' levels"
I can't stay asleep for longer than 60-90 minutes at a time.,"For my entire life I would wake up every 3 hours or so. Which wasn't that big a deal. I would always fall back asleep fast and only wake up 3 times a night. I'd sleep three hours, wake, three hours, wake, 1 hour wake, then either get up or sleep till my alarm woke me up.

Recently things have gotten worse (I am only 28). Now I cannot stay asleep for longer then 90 minutes. Usually I sleep for about 50 minutes at a time. I am waking up 8+ times every night. I sleep for so little at a time I only know I was asleep because I remember my dreams vividly. 

Has anyone else experienced a problem like this and found a solution for it?

Some other background info: I have always had trouble falling asleep but now I use meditation and breathing exercises to fall asleep. I take ambien maybe twice a week and that will actually provide a 3 hour sleep stretch when I do. "
I'm not asleep,This is bad. I want to wake up at 8 and its 3. I'm thinking and thinking and thinking...
Have you tried just closing your eyes and not thinking?,"I love it when I get the most basic thoughts on how to treat insomnia. ‚ÄúJust close your eyes and try not to think.‚Äù What does that even mean how do you turn off your mind? I wanna reply with why don‚Äôt you just punch me in the back of the head please because that‚Äôs more effective. Sleep talk downs btw any good ones bc to me they are all more annoying or total BS than helpful. 

Thinking about different treatments I can‚Äôt do Benadryl or ZzzQuil or unisom anymore they just don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve tried 15mg of melatonin and currently on Ambien temporarily. What has worked for you? "
Anyone else's eyes feel super dry after nights of no sleep?,"On nights of either restless sleep (waking up every 15 or 30 min) or just no sleep at all, it feels like my eyes are slowly becoming drier and drier and by morning when it's time to get to school and through the day, I'm sort of squinting to make them feel less irritated.  I'm using lubricated eye drops to try to help.  Does this happen to anyone else?"
can any one else not remember a time when you didn‚Äôt have sleeping issues?,"more or less since i‚Äôve hit puberty i‚Äôve had sleeping issues, but even as a child it took me an hour to go to sleep. i‚Äôm 22 and this has been going on since i was like 11 or so and gets worse every year. and i can‚Äôt afford to do a sleep study
issues that are new to me however is my quality of sleep feels awful if it‚Äôs less than 8 hours, but the catch is i literally cannot go to sleep before 4 am (that‚Äôs always been a thing for me, but i used to be able to function on 4 hours sleep and now i can‚Äôt)"
Iv learnt to love insomnia unconditionally,"It's annoying only if you think it is.
I have learnt to live & love little sleep or at least the pros of it. 
Being in a room alone in the darkness for a long period of time can either drag one into a rabbit hole of insanity or make you one all rounded chilled person.
Thanks to insomnia I have learnt to love myself and enjoy the silence. 
I often go through rounds of music that inspire me to the point I sign up to random classes or workshops at 3am. 

If I never suffered from insomnia I would of chosen a completely different career path I'd be going to uni to get a 'real job' etc. 

But instead I await January next year to get on a one way ticket across the other side of the world for a 2 year visa. 

Because thanks to insomnia I discovered British Punk music from the 90s 

And thanks to British punk for sending me on this wild journey I'm about to endeavour. 

When people ask what inspired me the change I'll just say ""insomnia"" and carry on not sleeping lol.. "
Sleep + Stress = Impossible,"I woke up happy today.

Is to stay awake."
"I've tried everything...tramadol, remeron, ambien...nothing works quite as well as CBD drops. Out in 30 mins....great dreams, and wake refreshed","So here in San Francisco, they sell it at the marijuana dispensaries.  CBD removes the part that gets you stoned, but keeps the relaxing part.  Put two drops under your tongue and it's definitely bedtime.  It's about $50 for a bottle of it.  Should last a few months."
Get your insomnia figured out as fast as you can.,"Not trying to freak you out. I wish someone gave me this advice earlier than having to learn it the hard way personally. Years of chronic insomnia or even insomnia in general will, in fact, cause major health issues (mostly mental illnesses) if gone uncontrolled. I was a really healthy kid and my determination throughout the years couldn't fight insomnia on the physical level. Lack of restorative sleep for many many days throughout several years has made my health plummet. If you lay in bed for hours on end or go without sleep for several days consistently... there is a problem that needs to be fixed and nervous system suppression is only a short term solution. The cause may actually be very difficult to pinpoint but the earlier you try the more likely it is you can find the answer. Don't push the issue aside like I did because once you start to plummet from a health standpoint, you practically become a living time bomb. Value your lives and the benefits of getting sleep.

Just thought I'd throw my perspective out there for reflections. Insomnia ruins dreams both on a technical and personal level. A lot of users here are probably pissed asking how to fix the issue, see doctors and you most likely will have to see many through trial and error."
Ever feel guilty for not sleeping?,"Been battling with insomnia for several years now. And some nights such as tonight, it was 5 straight hours of trying to sleep until I said fuck it and got up. It's almost 5am now and I'm just playing some xbox and listening to music.

But I feel oddly guilty. Like I shouldn't be playing video games or enjoying myself. Like I should be trying to sleep like everyone says. Idk it's  a weird feeling but I can only describe it as guilt.

Anyone know what I'm talking about?"
I'm so happy I found this sub.,"I've been on Reddit for about 7 years and yet it never occurred to me to just search for r/insomnia. And now I have, browsing through other people's posts is such a strange sense of comfort. 

I've had insomnia since a child. 10/11 years old being the earliest memories I have of not being able to sleep, my parents have said I never slept as an infant and child and then diagnosed at 16 and again at 21. 

Whenever it comes up in conversation, I get inundated with people's personal methods to sleep that they swear by, some study they read once years ago, old wives takes etc etc. And while it's nice that people try to help and empathise, after years of saying ""yeah I've tried that... yup tried that too... yes you're correct I should just ""go to sleep"" "" eventually it just get exhausting. 

Knowing there's other people here who understand that this isn't a choice or something we want to have and we are actively trying to fix it is so refreshing! I haven't met another insomniac in a couple of years and can't wait to start engaging here! 

So cheers r/insomnia, lets all be sleep-deprived mental together! 

"
Just happy to have had a decent night.,"Last night, I had a couple glasses of wine and fell sleep a little before ten. I woke up at 12:15 to pee. That's usually the start of 1.5-2 hours wake but I was back to sleep within a couple minutes. Then I slept straight to 15 minutes before my alarm (I never look at the clock overnight but could hear the coffee maker start). Usually, that would be the death knell for sleep but I still dozed back off until my alarm. 

Nights like this are so rare that I am just thrilled. "
Anyone ever get right to the brink of sleep & then.. BAM! You're awake for good?,"I used to get this once a year or so, but it's been increasing in frequency now. I'll be right about to fall asleep, drifting off. Then I find myself gasping for air, panic a bit and then I'm awake. Usually accompanied by a buzzing ache in my head and hot flushes for the remainder of the night/day that follows. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, but it feels like it's pretty rare.

Anyone else suffered from this and had a diagnosis? I've had pretty terrible sleep for my whole life due to being a light sleeper and having to sleep in a noisy environment."
Try to not give a shit,"Something that has helped me a lot lately is trying to not give a shit.

My insomnia is mainly caused by sleep anxiety. If I've been in bed for 2 hours and realise I've got work in 5 hours I'll freak out and get a sudden rush of adrenalin and it's all over from there on.

When you have one of those nights, try to relax and assess yourself during the following day at work/school. Sure, you'll be more anxious than usual, and you'll feel pretty shit, but you can fucking do it, you've done it many times before.

Keep rationalising these thoughts about how lack of sleep affects you. It's not the end of the world and everyone feels that way sometimes.

I believe consciously challenging your anxious thought processes related to getting enough sleep can really help. Exercise and do all the right things, and when you do go to bed early and tired, truly do not give a shit if you don't sleep at all that night because you were fine the day before."
I have school in 2 hours.,Fuck.
"hello everyone, I have some advice","hello. 

I'm 17, my names karl, and I've had insomnia for 5 years now. I average 3 hours sleep a night, but obviously some nights I sleep better and some much worse. I've gone 7 days without sleep before (with no caffeine etc), and that was pretty scary to say the least. 

I've been to doctor after doctor, each saying the same thing.. 'excersize and don't have the tv on at night'.. well done you. every night, my room is pitch black, no electronics, no lights, no distractions. still cant get to sleep before the sun comes up. 

I've started going on morning bike rides
at about 3 in the morning. the world is so quite and empty, it's quite beautiful. the air is very fresh and damp and the few sparkles under he rising sun. 

I reccomend you guys do this. I went on a bike ride from 3:00 to 5:30 and came back, tried to get back to sleep (which I did eventually at 9am), but I felt very relaxed and refreshed. 

also, splashing very cold water on your face at night or in the morning is blissful. 

I've been on zopiclone, zolpidem, velerian, Valium, diphenhydramine, promethazine, and I'm currently on melatonin, but none work. it's horrible. I feel like I'm melting some days and I drive myself *crazy* with circling thoughts and voices in my head and little spiders and shadow people. I feel ill most of the time. 

i just want you all to know, that even if nobody else is, I am in the same boat as you. if you ever wanna talk at 4 or 5 am, please do. I love you guys as a community and how we all understand eachother like
normal people don't ('oh no it's 11pm and I'm not asleep I have insomnia!!!!') 

thankyou for reading, and I hope you all can get an hour or 2's good sleep, from me :^)"
"""Just go to sleep."" [Rant]","""Just go to sleep,"" he said. 

""Just go to sleep."" I can't just go to sleep. I have never been able to just go to sleep. You, Dad, of all people should know this. Don't ever fucking say that to someone with insomnia. Like we haven't thought of that? Oh shit, it literally NEVER occurred to me that I should just fall asleep. I must have been doing it wrong my whole life!

Just go to sleep. I have to be up in 4 hours for work. I have to work a 14 hour day. Sure, I sacrificed three hours of sleep because YOU made me go to this stupid dinner party (ok, I'll step back from that one because I had a decent time until you started talking about really inappropriate things like how all your children weigh too much and how it pisses you off that Mom spends so much time doing something she loves). Just go to sleep. I've been working 12+ hour days for a week now. I'm exhausted. Did I mention that I have to wake up in 4 hours? **For arguably the most important day of my career thus far, possibly ever?** Just go to sleep. And don't take pills to do it, you said. I guess I don't *need* to take medicine to sleep for the night. Even though I'm nervous as hell and having excitement/anxiety about tomorrow and you and I both know there's no possible way I'd get to bed any time soon. But you're right. I guess I don't need drugs. I can just go the fuck to sleep. Just like you! Oh wait, you suffer from the same anxiety disorder? It keeps you up at night stressing about things? Oh may Lanta, that's so WEIRD. It's like I inherited it from you, or something. Really your understanding is flattering. 

Just go to sleep, he told me. Thanks, Dad. Always a pleasure. 

So thanks for genetically screwing me into insomnia as a result of anxiety. And depression. I'm a walking, talking, female carbon copy of you and you tell me to just go to sleep. 

Just go fuck yourself. 

**tl;dr**: I only had time enough for a few hours of sleep before a huge day at work, and thanks to years of insomnia I knew I wasn't going to sleep well before it. So I told my dad I was taking a sleeping pill and he, who also has insomnia, tells me to just go to sleep. And I lost it. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. I haven't been this mad in a long time. Hopefully, my deep sarcasm coms across in text. If not, I don't even give a shit. Thanks for reading, Reddit. :) "
Does anyone else...,"Alright, does anyone else have a love hate relationship with their insomnia?  I hate that I dont have a normal sleeping pattern but also the night is when I have some of my best thoughts.  I think about my life, philosophy, and other intellectual things but it seems to come easiest at night.  

TLDR:  Insomniac that loves the feeling of being up at night but wants to sleep normally"
Why is it so much easier to sleep in the day?,"I've struggled with insomnia a lot in the past. The biggest problem I've had recently is that I can't really sleep *at night*, but as soon as the sun starts coming up it suddenly becomes much easier and I sleep from 7 AM to around 3 PM.

Recently I've been trying to force a new sleep schedule, and it seemed to work for about a day until I fell asleep yesterday at 10 AM for about five hours. I might sleep at night, but only for a few hours. Then the sunlight somehow makes me sleepy and I pass out.

This is like the opposite of what's supposed to happen. The dark is supposed to make you tired, right? So why does the sunlight make me want to sleep?

What's worse is after sleeping in the day I couldn't possibly feel better. I feel really refreshed.

Any ideas? It's been so hard to just fight it and sleep at night. after a few days of not being able to sleep at night I just pass out some time in the afternoon. And the whole struggle starts all over again."
Late night chat buddy,"Just wanted to throw this out there in case anyone was interested. If you're up in the middle of the night, day, whenever, and just want someone to chat with and keep you company, please feel free to PM me. I'll more than likely be awake and in just as much need of some company as you!

Edit: This may be bold, but someone pointed out real-time chatting, and I think that would be so much more effective in our situations. If you'd like to exchange info so we can Facebook chat I'd be more than happy. Just PM me. Thinking of you guys and wishing you sweet sweet dreams.

Anticipatory Sleep Anxiety,"Title says it all. This is so fucked. Every day I think I'm gonna be able to sleep well and then as the night creeps on those feelings dissipate and I get anxious about how my sleep will be.

Love this sub though. Doesn't make me feel so alone."

Sleep with me,"Hey all, thought i would share something that helps me every once in awhile. It‚Äôs a free podcast called ‚Äúsleep with me.‚Äù It‚Äôs definitely not for everyone but I found that listening to it helped distract my mind enough to dose off, and when I do listen to it I leave it on all night and each time I wake up (which is usually very frequently) I find that it helps me get back to sleep pretty quickly. Doesn‚Äôt always work, but it certainly does help to quiet the mind. 

The guys voice is a little odd and he basically talks about complete nonsense. My boyfriend couldn‚Äôt stand him and made me put my headphones on lol so not for everyone as I said but works sometimes for me! "
Does this happen to anyone else?,"Last night I went to sleep, and 2 hours went by in a blink. Like it almost didnt feel like sleeping, one second I went to sleep and in another second I woke up. It was almost like getting anesthesia. No dreams. Was this deep sleep? I cant really find any answers as to what this is."
In a weird way I kind of enjoy this...but not really,"I gave up on trying to sleep awhile ago. When I really think about it, my favorite part of the day is being alone in my room at 3am. No people to play pretend around, just me, music, and some turkish royals.


But the worst part or the day is around 5am when the pain settles in. When I run out of things to distract myself with and I wrestle with my agony before finally passing out at 7. Work at 9, wake up at 8:50, rush to work pissy and exhausted. Just have a vague idea on the what the fuck is going on but roll with it, usually goes fine somehow as far as I know at least.


Nevermind this sucks"
How to deal with the boredom of being awake,"Hi all,

I'm just wondering how other people here deal with the boredom that inevitably comes with being awake through the night. Over the years I've learnt to deal with the other problems insomnia causes but I'm still at a loss as to how to combat the loneliness/ boredom that comes with being awake when everybody else is asleep night after night. I would much appreciate some advice.

(First time reddit poster btw, hence the slightly awkward tone of the post)"
Anxiety about not sleeping causing insomnia,"( This is my first post on reddit and funny enough, the reason I made a reddit account was to have something passing the time while I lay awake at night not sleeping. )

For the past month, I started to have trouble sleeping at night. At first it was something really small - first night I was drunk and emotional and couldn't fall asleep, second night there was a mosquito in my room - and just led to a few nights of lying in bed, tossing and turning, not sleeping until the sunrise. At first it was a mild 'i can't sleep but this is probably just a phase' anxiety, but since then has grown into a fully fledged insomnia. On my worst nights I would get in bed at 4pm trying to sleep, and not sleep for two whole nights. Whenever I hit the bed my anxiety about spending a whole night trying to sleep, not sleeping, and feeling horrible in the morning would just surface and I'd just lie there awake with heart pounding. 

Recently I decided to try sleep restriction therapy on myself but haven't been very strict about it. The reason for that is because I know my insomnia is strictly a mental thing - no matter how tired my body is, my mind just has a way of overcoming all of that and making me anxious. So I feel like even if I established a 'strict' sleeping schedule and my body felt tired at the same time each day, that still wouldn't guarantee anything because my mind just keeps dwelling on the issue. Specifically, this anxiety is about not sleeping, which is ironic because of course worrying about this would just make it worse. Have any of you experienced this before, and what were some things you told yourself / techniques you used /methods that helped you overcome this anxiety?

I‚Äôve been awake since 4 A.M.,"It is almost 5 now, so I think I‚Äôll get a head start on cleaning that needs to be done.
I might even go to the gym... Eat breakfast for once... More importantly, I might get tired after doing these activities and get a little bit more sleep."
Staying half asleep but can't actually sleep,"Hey guys. I'm back, because yipee! I'm going through another bad bout of insomnia. This time, it's a little different.

I did not sleep a single wink last night, and I'm still up and running. It's 2:26 PM, and I've encountered a weird issue that I've never really had before with my insomnia...


I feel sleepy. I feel very tired. I feel so sleepy that I'm able to close my eyes, and drift off, with no thoughts whatsoever... The thing is.. I stay in that state. I stay in that state of being half asleep and I cannot for the love of god actually fall into a state of sleep. I'm having no concious thoughts in this state, nothing. I just don't fall asleep. 

Time seems to pass a lot slower when I'm in that state. It feels like an hour, I open my eyes, (which keep getting crossed when I open them?? Idk) look at my clock, and it's only been 10 - 15 minutes. What the hell is going on?
I'm also seriously scared of going through another crisis like I did last time and going four and a half days with no sleep. It's horrifying to think about."
Listening to podcasts,"I usually fall asleep after about a half hour listening to a podcast. I‚Äôve stopped and have fallen asleep without podcasts in about a half hour. And, I sleep more soundly now. I think the podcasts got my mind going throughout the night and I‚Äôm better without them. Anyone have a similar experience?"
anxiety at night,"For a long time I thought that despite being depressed, anxiety is not something I am struggling with...

But lately anxiety is the reason I cannot fall asleep. 

Whenever I lay down to sleep, everything just hits me at once and I can't shut my brain off. 

Anyone have any suggestions how to reduce anxiety at night? 

I know - dealing with my problems would be a step, but it's hard to do, when I am not sleeping properly and have barely any energy. Such a vicious cycle. 

I noticed that taking melatonin AND a pain killer ( with codein in it - as it makes me sleepy) helps me, but that is not something I want to do every night for various reasons. "
Insomnia is such a terrible beast,"I've been dealing with insomnia for 4 years due to depression, anxiety, PTSD and chronic pain. I used to be on several medications to help me sleep but I'm not anymore. It's 4:30 am and I've been awake for the past 3 hours after getting 2 hours of sleep. I am beyond exhausted but my brain wont let me sleep. I literally cannot remember the last good night of sleep I had, or the last day I've felt legitimately rested. I just want to sleep. "
I think I figured out a trick to insomnia,"I was unable to sleep for 3 days in a row. I only got a whopping 2 hrs of sleep and it wasn't good sleep at all. Fast forward to yesterday where I was able to nap in the daytime for 3 hours. 

I thought for sure that I had ruined any chance of getting rest that night since people usually tell you to stay awake during the daytime or you'll ruin your sleep. That ended up not being the case though. The nap helped me not to feel as anxious and overtired. I was able to lay down at 2am and only woke up at 6:30am when the alarm went off. 

I think being overtired can make it harder to fall asleep even though that might not make sense. For the first time in days I actually feel fairly normal. If anything, I feel like I could go back to sleep right now if I had the opportunity. From now on if I can take a nap during the daytime, I'm going to. I'd rather get sleep at odd hours than go days without any. "

masturbation to fall asleep,"What are y‚Äôalls thoughts on it? Worked amazingly for me when I was younger but now it seems like a chore to even try, and even then it takes several times to work.

Season change is killing me slowly...,I got over my insomnia (mostly) this summer. I even could sleep without meds! This season change is messing me up now. I won't sleep a night then sleep an entire day waking up tired. Anyone else get this?
Do you guys also listen to YouTube videos to help you fall asleep?,"I found this about a year ago and it's become a necessity now.

I used to listen to Simpsons episodes, the sci-show vsauce and Bob Ross.

Do you have any recommendations? I'm not into asmr, I just want to hear someone talking, analyzing a topic or idk.

Falling asleep for 10-20 minutes and then wake up for no reason.,"Not too sure if this is the best place to post this, but thanks for any advice. For about 3 months I have been falling asleep at night, no problem. I‚Äôll pass out, but only for like 10-20 minutes- sometimes even less. This only happens when I fall asleep at night. I was wondering if this happens to anyone else ? Why does it happen ? Do you guys know what this is called so that I can research a little more ?"
Delaying getting into bed,"Sometimes I plan to go to bed by a certain time, but I end up sort of procrastinating going to bed by about 20 minutes or so or even more because I find a couple of random youtube videos I'm mildly interested in. While I'm watching them, I'm not really paying attention to them, it's more of just a way to delay getting into bed because it leads to some anxiety. A lot of the time I don't have this issue, but during the periods where I'm struggling with insomnia I do. I'm curious if anyone else does this as well."
[Good news] Life-crippling insomnia in control,"I just wanted to post some good news for a change. After years of life-crippling insomnia (literally thinking I was causing myself brain damage and that there was no hope for me ever), I have finally been sleeping ok. It started during my long summer vacation during which I was in the countryside, and now I have been able to keep it up even as my stressful job started again. A key piece was being able to move out of my doghouse of an apartment into a nice two-room place. When I go to my bedroom, I feel relaxed AS FUCK even after a stressful day. I FINALLY have a designated beautiful little room to sleep in. And it seems to do the trick, combined with a very low dose mirtazapine medication. Can't seem to be able to quit that, but I don't mind, at least this one you can use for life. 

This was the result of years of pain and hopelessness, literally falling over a lot of the time and STILL going out there and doing the necessities. I still have to conjure a partner and more friends out of nothing, but now I am actually capable of doing that too.

There is hope."
I'm done.,"I didn't get any sleep tonight and I have a long day ahead of me. I took a dose of Nyquil and 2 sleeping pills, and I still wasn't able to sleep. I've been suffering through this for months. Heres what I really think...If I didn't have my bf, I would likely commit suicide. I know this sounds dramatic, but what is the point of living a life where I'm constantly suffering and never happy? Even when good things happen to me, I don't care because I'm so fucking tired. I think about suicide nearly every day and I'm fucking terrified. In some ways, I wish my boyfriend would just dump me so I can end my life. Insomnia has caused me to lose my job, my friends, and my spirit. After losing my job, I became broke and lost my insurance. My boyfriend doesn't make enough to support both of us, and I can't bring myself to keep a job. I had an interview a few days ago that I had to cancel due to not sleeping. What is this? What is this life? How can we enjoy life when we are so fucking exhausted and tired all the time? I would rather have any other problem but this one. Even on the days I do get my sleep, all I do is worry about if I'll sleep the next night. All I fucking think about is sleep. Insomnia has taken everything from me. It's defeated me. I'm just done. It's turned me into an asshole. It's made a mockery out of me. It's taunted me. It's taken my life away. It's taken my past, my present, and my future. I took the first 21 years of my life for granted. The first 21 years when I was able to sleep for 8+ hours with no problems. I never even thought twice about sleep back in those days. The anxiety, the depression, the hallucinations, the inability to walk down the street to get my mail because I'm so fucking tired....laying here for hours trying to fall asleep to no avail.

Insomnia; caused by high cortisol?,"So, for the past year I have been experiencing insomnia, I have gone to the doctors and they have brushed me off so now I‚Äôm asking the Internet for help. I experience sleep maintenance insomnia where I wake up constantly every single night, and have an urgency to go pee. I also wake up feeling unrefreshed because of a lack of deep sleep. I also experience headaches. I believe that the insomnia and headaches is due to high cortisol. I have tried using magnesium oil, rhodiola, holy basil, to lower cortisol but I have not felt much of a difference. I have felt a difference in headaches when I take the supplement called seriphos which is supposed to lower cortisol, but I have not experienced a help for maintaining sleep. I have also experienced low sex drive, bad cognition, and poor memory.  I‚Äôm a male btw, thanks for the help if you can recommend any supplement or anything that can help me sleep and lower cortisol,  I would appreciate it."

Trazodone Dreams are wild! Felt the physical presence of Christ last night!,"I‚Äôm a recent insomniac due to getting older I guess, and was prescribed Trazodone to aide with staying asleep.  Aside from a nasty 90 minutes to the start of the day, it works quite effectively.  However, I have had the most insanely awesome dreams since starting the medication.  Last night Jesus Christ himself came down from the heavens to tell me I‚Äôm a blessed man, and I communicated telepathically with his glowing ambiance about my real life struggles, and woke up feeling refreshed, like I had literally and physically been saved by Christ ready to tackle all life‚Äôs problems.

"The later I sleep, the better I sleep....Why ?","There are these odd nights like last night when I have to stay up late working on a deadline.

When I sleep at regular times like 10:30 pm, I always wake up after 3-4 hours around 2 AM. And can never go back to sleep again. 

Why could this be happening ? 

I cannot adopt the late night sleeping schedule though because I usually have to leave for work at around 7 AM everyday. "

4 uncommon tips,"As a normal sleeper again, I have returned from the pits of hell to live again...here are a few tips I wish I had known going into my insomnia ordeal:

1. Be careful what you read.  Interesting and informative as this place is, it's easy to come away more frightened than ever...it's easy to assume someone else's horrific experience will be yours too.  My descent into the insomnia-pit was springboard by spending my days reading about others' sleep issues.  Be very careful.

2. Also be careful about allowing yourself to be ""diagnosed.""  Once you are diagnosed by a person wearing a white coat (or even by yourself), then that diagnosis/classification/label will stick with you, possibly forever. You may never be able to mentally escape it..and you will always be a victim.  The victim mentality must be vanquished.  It's for this reason I always hated thinking of myself as an ""insomniac.""  The label alone is damaging if you allow it to define you. 

3. The cause of insomnia is connected to the mind.  Why am I sick?  Because I think I'm sick.  And because my doctor says I'm sick.  If he/she says I'm sick, and diagnoses me, and pins a label on me, and gives me a prescription then I must be sick. Maybe I'm not really sick, but my mind says that I am.  So I am.  See how it works?  And this allows fear to take over, because after all, we're sick.   I'm the same person now as when I wasn't sleeping.  At the time I had gone to the doctor and she was convinced that I had an anxiety disorder and wanted to put me on an SSRI.  I said no...she also wanted me to try a low dose of a depression drug....I took her up on that, only to promptly go sleepless for the next 5 nights in a row.  So I learned two lessons there: don't take drugs and don't mindlessly accept a diagnosis; they can both make things worse.

4.  Learn the art of conquering.  Learn to get the upper hand mentally again.  When I go to sleep I think of things that make me mentally and emotionally stimulated.  I love to think of me trying to survive a cold night out in the woods in a tent...or hanging off the side of a mountain in a tent....or being on the ocean in a raft, riding the stormy, windy seas.   So what would float your boat emotionally?  Telling your boss off?  Imagine the feeling if you could just tell him to get lost and walk off your job and be free from all the crap.......not that you would actually do it, but sometimes it feels nice to fantasize about those kinds of things.  Or what if you ran away...What would you do if you could start over?   Or what if you got that girl...or that guy....See what I mean?  It's good to dream and fantasize and get the upper hand emotionally again.  I like to imagine that I'm a fugitive from the law and that I'm trying avoid being captured....it's this sensation of conquering something or overcoming something that puts me at ease so I can go to sleep.

Good luck everyone....hope you sleep well.  Be good to yourself and remember, getting over insomnia has not so much to do with fixing something that's wrong, but rather empowering yourself and feeling better.  Tell someone you love them...it will help you sleep better.

How to get rid of insomnia. Please read if you are suffering.,"Reposting this with no links to books as it got removed.

This is a short description of how I cured my so called 'insomnia'. This does not apply if you have medical conditions such as apnea, but if you are having trouble sleeping and you have no idea why, this will help.
I started having problems going to sleep, often before going on a long journey the following day. This then started happening on a Sunday night when having to go to work on the Monday, often even when I was completely exhausted after a tiring or heavy weekend. I had no idea what was going on, but eventually found a book - The Effortless Sleep Method - which made me realise the most important thing - that not sleeping is not caused by any external factors at all. It is all in your head. Rather, it is caused by negative thoughts in your brain. That is why it is so incredibly powerful, and can stop you sleeping even when you have had 2 or 3 nights with very little sleep and are physically totally exhausted. There is a lot of stuff in this book that is good, but a lot I found not entirely necessary. So I am distilling everything that I discovered and realised into a few paragraphs, in the hope that it will help someone else. What set me on the road to recovery basically boils down to a single realisation:

Fact: - If you are having trouble sleeping, it is entirely caused by worrying about not sleeping.

It is very important that you understand and accept this fact. It applies equally to either going to sleep, or waking up and not being able to go back to sleep. Remember when you were a kid, you never gave it a second thought - you would just go to bed and go right to sleep. That is what you need to get back to, and it is possible but will take some time. As an adult, pressures of work and life generally add to stress levels, and after one or two bad nights you start thinking 'I really need a good night's 's sleep'. You start thinking that you can't cope without a good night's sleep. This adds to the pressure of wanting to get a good night's sleep, and so before you know it you are worrying about not sleeping, which in fact is what is making you not sleep. It becomes a vicious cycle. Really The solution therefore is very simple: stop worrying about not sleeping. Oh that‚Äôs easy for you to say I hear! I'll come on to how you can do it shortly.

Some people get into an awful mess, try all sorts of remedies, pills, old wives tales (milk before bed?), binaural beats nonsense and for some reason nothing works. That is because nothing like that will ever work - what you need to change is in your head, not some bad habit (unless you are drinking coffee just before bed or something really stupid). It is very natural to start attributing your sleep issues to all sorts of other factors; am I drinking too much coffee, did I lie in too long at the weekend, did I drink too much alcohol the other night, should I not watch TV before bed etc. etc. It is NONE of these things, or anything else other than the fact that you are thinking and worrying about sleep.

Now of course, not worrying about sleeping is easier said than done. Frankly it is pretty much impossible in the short term, but that is what you need to work towards. This is not a short term fix, but it is in fact the only fix. It might take a few months or a year or two to get completely better, but you will. Do not take sleeping pills of any sort, don't drink alcohol to sleep, don't do anything to make you sleep because this cannot work, since it is all in your head. In fact taking anything to help you sleep is a very bad idea because then it becomes a psychological crutch - if you don't have whatever it is, you will worry about sleeping and then have no hope of sleeping. Everything you need to sleep well is already inside you, just like when you were a kid. Also who wants to become and alcoholic, or sleeping pill addict? For this reason avoid going to see your doctor, unless you think you have a medical issue other than not being able to sleep, but otherwise they can do nothing apart from give you sleeping pills which is the absolute worst thing you can do.

So I am going to offer some brief practical advice on how to sleep well. This is all based on understanding and believing the fact above. Re read that a few times and accept it. Then you just need to do 2 things:

1. In the evening, or during the day whenever you like, say out loud: I don‚Äôt care how much I sleep.
Repeat this a few times (5 to 10 is fine) before bed, try to relax as you say it and actually feel what you are saying and believe it. What this does is actually tricks your subconscious brain into believing what you are saying, even if you are not quite convinced yet it doesn‚Äôt matter. If you can't say it out loud, you can say this in your head, but out loud is better. Try and mean it, say it a few different ways if you like. Or change the words, it doesn‚Äôt matter as long as the meaning is the same.

2. Don't think about sleep. Yes this is the hard part. Your lack of sleep is causing by anxiety and worrying about sleep, so you need to stop doing it. That is what perfect sleepers do, right? They never even think about sleep. That is what you want to attain. Of course it is easier said than done, but combined with the first point, you can put a kind of censor on your brain and catch yourself before a negative thought surfaces. So use point 1 to help with this - as soon as you start to even think about thinking about sleep, just say to yourself: I don‚Äôt care how much sleep I get, and start thinking about something else. Often if you just say the I don‚Äôt care mantra a couple of times you find your mind gets bored and starts thinking about something else anyway.

The object is to minimise any negative thoughts, and just have positive thoughts about sleeping. So you aren't worrying about sleeping any more, the only thoughts you have about sleeping are 'I don't care how much I sleep' over and over. The result is that your brain will calm down and you will actually stop caring about sleep. Even better, if you do have a bad night or two, it doesn‚Äôt matter as much because guess what; you don‚Äôt care how much sleep you get any more! So it helps you get through the day as well. If you have been suffering then you already know you can get through a day with very little sleep, so who cares? It may not be ideal but it is amazing how much you can get done in a day running on a few hours or less.

So that is it, accept the fact, and then repeat the mantra during the day as required in order to minimise worrying, and then again a few times before bed.

Note that none of this is new, refer to the book above, and other research e.g. google the 'guardian how to beat insomnia' article, but somehow it isn't widely known. Look in internet forums and they are full of people reporting varying levels of success with routines, audio books, drugs, etc. which all do nothing. By all means do further research, but it is crucial to understand that it is not caused by anything other than your own worries.

Disclaimer: I am not a doctor, this is based on my experiences and research. I have gone from barely sleeping several nights a week to sleeping like a log every night. If you have a medical condition, see a doctor."
"Fuck it going for it. They say sleep restriction cures everything. They say it has to, because you were once a normal person. 5 hours in bed, no more.

> Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a common type of talk therapy (psychotherapy). You work with a mental health counselor (psychotherapist or therapist) in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

> According to guidelines from a physician group, insomnia is difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, even when a person has the chance to do so. People with insomnia can feel dissatisfied with their sleep and usually experience one or more of the following symptoms: fatigue, low energy, difficulty concentrating, mood disturbances, and decreased performance in work or at school.

## What is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia?

> ‚ÄúCognitive therapy seeks to alter faulty beliefs and attitudes about sleep.[34] For example, insomniacs ""often display a great deal of apprehension about bedtime and performance anxiety in their attempt to control the process of sleep onset; some even entertain catastrophic thinking about the potential consequences of insomnia, all of which may heighten their affective response to poor sleep."" The objective of cognitive therapy is to cut short the vicious cycle of insomnia, emotional distress, dysfunctional cognitions, and further sleep disturbances. Examples of treatment targets for cognitive therapy include having unrealistic sleep expectations (e.g., ""I must get 8 hours of sleep every night""), misconceptions about the causes of insomnia (e.g., ""my insomnia is entirely due to chemical imbalances in my body""), amplifications of its consequences (e.g., ""I am going to fail after a poor night's sleep""), and performance anxiety resulting from excessive attempts at controlling the sleep process.[35]‚Äù

How many people use marijuana to help them sleep.,I just want to see how many people also do this. I feel like it is a really easy way to help you sleep without side effects of other prescription drugs. People I have talk to thus far agree. 
Here's what works for me...,"Talking to myself. 

I find that taking 15 minutes to half an hour to talk myself about how I'm feeling and about any worries I have before bed works wonders for insomnia. 

It kills that internal monologue that keeps me up all night, especially if the monologue is me fretting or worrying about something. "
How to deal with the loneliness of hours awake while everyone around you rests?,"I'm bipolar and have PTSD, which leads to fairly long periods of sleeplessness. Right now is day 13 of a fairly bad manic period and I've had 7 hours sleep during that time. 

This has been going on for so long that I barely feel tired anymore, mostly just the loneliness of being awake and not really having anything to do for those hours. Anyone have any time wasting suggestions/distractions?"
My insomnia has improved!,"So, after suffering from insomnia for a couple months (seemingly out of nowhere) I was not happy at all. Other things happened in life, and I got out of what I now realize as a toxic relationship , and along with more exercise on a weekly basis, I have been able to get sleep every night with ease. Some nights I don't get as much sleep as I'd like but hey, you lose some battles, win the war.  

It is possible for things to improve. Keep your head up! :) "
This is so isolating,"Our entire world is built around people sleeping between 10pm and 6am. I have one friend who has chronic insomnia and she is the only person who seems to get the nightmare of not being able to sleep.

My girlfriend is pouting because I was supposed to come and see her today but I don't feel like I can safely make the two hour drive after a particularly bad week of insomnia. I don't know what the point of this message is other than I am desperate for someone to understand how miserable insomnia is. How it is so much more than just being tired, it is being disconnected. Sometimes I feel like a man in a wheelchair in a world without elevators. People continue on around me happily doing the day to day which feels impossible to me. My chances of getting a week of good sleep is about the same as the legless man has of regrowing his legs. I don't have the same tools to get through the day as everyone around me does, but none of them can see it. I get that might be a little hyperbolic, but is it really?"
Enjoying sleep deprivation,I read somewhere as your day progresses your brain creates adenosine. When enough adenosine is all built up it turns into a neurological key that tells your brain to sleep. When you don't sleep your brain keep making adenosine and this overabundance has anti-depressant effects. I love not sleeping for a couple days because it makes me feel like a different person. It murders my anxiety because I'm too tired to over think things or worry. Am I the only that is like this or do I have sympathizers? 
I really hope this helps somebody.,"So I have experienced insomnia for a while now and made some investigation, I hope my advice will be helpful for some people. Before I start to share my methods I want to warn you that my advice does not refer for people who have had insomnia since their childhood or inherited their parents' inability to sleep, so it is genetic. In case, I believe only a small percentage of people on this sub belong to that category. However , even for them these tricks might work.

Insomnia is mostly stress and anxiety related, so most of the people all of a sudden sleep poorly at some random night and BAM! Here comes the cycle. You did not sleep well tonight so what about tomorrow? Will you be an insomniac for the rest of your life? What about if you do not sleep well and you will not be productive at work? Will you get fired eventually? How about those huge bags under your eyes? I bet most of the people think you are a stoner and look unattractive. How will you cope with that? Doesn't it make you feel uncomfortable? Oh, you are a student. Tell me more about how you are suffering with no sleep and still have to go to the lectures early in the morning. Probably even your student advisor does not give a fuck. How are you going to pass your finals when you are sleep deprived? And there a probably hundreds of insomnia-induced questions which you ask yourself every day. So here are my tricks for you to cope with this hell. There is no anymagical solution, but it is more about the psychological set-up.


1) Never ask that ""God, why me? "" question. I assume you probably wish you had more ""normal "" problems like studying for finals, getting your stuff done or finding a job. You probably watched the ""Fight Club"" where an insomniac goes to meetings for people who have cancer or other fatal diseases. Significant percentage of adult people experience insomnia at some point in their lives so you are just one drop in that ocean.

2) Do not talk/mention your insomnia to people unless they ask you about it. Neither do not get stuck on the internet for finding that ""100 % cure "". I believe by doing this, you concentrate on your problem too much and it makes it worse. You keep telling "" oh I have tried everything and nothing works "" over and over so your brain/body takes an alert mode before sleep, it recognizes sleep as a threat and therefore influences its quality.

3) LET GO! I know it sounds cliche and it was mentioned like 100 times in previous posts, but this is the most important aspect in your psychology. There is a quote saying "" The fear of danger is more dangerous than the danger itself "" ( might be a shitty translation, sorry) . How can you just let go when you suffer every day? Well, that's why I mentioned, this is the hardest part. There is a part of us which keeps telling "" ooh my life is ruined. I am suffering every day. I can't concentrate, my motor skills are deteriorating and I feel numb "". Well, fuck it. Accept all of the negativity, do not let your fear to take over. These thoughts are produced by your brain, and it tricks you. You are subconsciously prone to those news which say "" sleep deprivation causes this and this and this "" . Do you control your sleep? No. So can you change anything? No. It would even be better to read about people who get only a few hours of sleep and function normally.

4) Do not expect to be cured in a short-time period. When you try something new, like some herbal tea or over-counter pill, your brain also plays a game with you, as you take the supplement and lay there thinking "" ok so I should sleep now... '"" and as the time goes by , you get more anxious as you think even with the supplements you are unable to sleep! Trust me, it takes time. It takes a while for your brain to get tired enough/ be in that state where you are just knocked out without even thinking about your sleep. On the other hand, you can enjoy the relaxation effect of the supplements you take and just chill, laying in bed.

When I first went to my therapist and started to complain about my insomnia, he just did not pay any attention to my problem and started to ask questions, it was a psychoanalysis session. I was frustrated because I thought he would prescribe me some meds or suggest some routine, or herbal teas. My point is, insomnia has really deep psychological roots. I really wish you can reveal those roots for yourselves. In this post I did not offer any supplements or meds. I believe the psychological part is as important in this problem as physiological. 
Good luck to all of you and I hope you get better quality sleep soon!

P.S I believe some strict sleep restriction, and the right psychological set-up should be enough. Obviously, natural supplements or over-counter pills can only help.

Does anybody else feels that insomnia lowers their cognition?,"Ever since mine came, I haven't felt like myself at all. I used to be so focused and driven and generally all-round intelligent. But now I feel like I couldn't keep up anywhere near where I once was. It's starting to take a toll on my psyche. I'm worried that my depression will come back. The worst part is that I know my old mind is there. On the rare occasions I get good sleep, it comes out and I feel so happy. But otherwise, I constantly miss it and feel horrible emotionally."
"My battle with, and eventual victory over the monster that forced me to stay awake.","Greetings to you all, /r/insomnia. 

I have been a clinical insomniac for over 12 years. No matter if you can't sleep for a night, or almost an entire week, I know how you feel, and I know it sucks. 

My first episode that landed me in the hospital was at the age of 13. I had slept only a handful of hours over the course of 6 days. When I say a handful; to be more direct, what I mean is 3. 3 hours of sleep, somewhere in those 144 hours. I didn't have a bad life, and I wasn't suffering from any trauma, I just didn't sleep, no matter how hard I did or didn't try. 

I started to get very sick. I was running a fever, I was hallucinating, and it wasn't until I told my mother that action was taken. She didn't know I wasn't sleeping, which, in hindsight, was likely a bad idea to withhold from her. I was diagnosed with acute insomnia, given a sedative, slept in the hospital bed, and given some pills (trazodone) to help me sleep. No harm done. 

As a 13 year old, it was quite a powerful drug. 25mg did the trick, and I slept great. 

For a week. 

It stopped working, and my dosage increased. First 50mg, then 100. It got to the point where the drug did nothing for me. I spent years just dealing without sleep, an average day for me lasting 24-36 hours, and then getting 2-4 hours of sleep in between bouts. I spent the entirety of my late teens feeling like a zombie. I was always exhausted, I had nearly no desire to do anything, and I was slowly going insane. 

At ages 17-19 I had very easy access to liquor. I drank myself to sleep on the really bad nights, and quickly became a young alcoholic. I met my now wife at that time (8th anniversary this October) who helped me kick the bottle and get some focus together. Magically, for a couple of years I slept semi-regularly. Never a full 7-8 hours, but 24 hour awake times were a thing of the past. I felt better than I had in years. 

This continued until about 22 and then my insomnia was more seasonal, if that is even a thing. During the spring and summer I rarely slept more than 2 hours a night, sometimes 4-6, and sometimes none. Then when fall and winter would appear, I would be more regular. I dealt with this until I was 25. This was last year.  

I started working (and still am) as an IT Engineer at a mental health care company where my insomnia was running rampant. I had terrible episodes, almost similar to schizophrenia. Auditory and visual hallucinations were regular. Sleep was certainly not happening, and I finally decided that after 5 days without rest, it was time to go back to the doctor. 

My doctor said it would take some serious prescription testing to figure out where I need to be. I have been on an insane amount of medications to try and solve this issue over the last year. Every benzodiazepine you can think of (most notably, Seroquel and Ativan), and all but one sedative (Ambien, Sonata, etc..)

Finally my Doctor threw in the towel. The medicines either stopped working, never worked to begin with, or worked TOO well and rendered me useless the next day. I missed a lot of work, but the Human Resources Department and my director were able to make an exception for me due to chronic insomnia and anxiety disorders being in line with the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Association) guidelines. My doctor signed off on the form and my job was safe. 

I was referred to go to a sleep study. This wonderful little place would put a hat on me with a bunch of wires connected and monitor my brain activity for 8 hours, two nights in a row. 

The catch was that even after insurance coverage I would be 2.4k out of pocket. I couldn't afford it. I felt defeated. 

Ultimately I went back to my usual patterns and nothing got better. I was about to give up and accept that this was going to be the rest of my life. But I found out something else about myself in the last 6 months. 

I am severely depressed. 

Once I realized one of the core issues, I was resistant. I felt that I was weak and no one could help me. I felt that I was a burden to the people around me. My wife, thankfully, and kind of forcefully convinced me to seek help. 

I changed doctors and he reviewed my history with my medication and found the winning combination. 

Zoloft and Lunesta. 

I have slept, for 7-8 hours, every night, peacefully for the past 21 days. I don't feel like I am going to panic when I think about things that bother me. I don't doze at my desk or nod off at the wheel. I am living again. 

My advice to all of you who cannot sleep, get help. It is not a minor condition, and it is no way to live. Somewhere there is the proper medicinal or behavioral treatment out there for you, and you will make it. 

Sorry if this sounded rant-y or preachy, but I really wanted to get this out there. 

If you want someone to talk to about it, my door is open. "
I've been awake 54 hours and I'm now very drunk. I know it's not a real solution but it'll put me to sleep & I'm desperate to have the feeling of being fully rested (if hung over for a few hours) for the first time in well over two days,
I'm so sick of this,So frustrated with this shit. I just want to fall sleep like a normal person.

How the f**k do I sleep?? ,"I feel like I'm doing something wrong. Like laying here with my eyes closed isn't enough. It feels like there is just one more step required that I'm missing. Anybody else feel this way?
Most people:
1)lay down
2)close eyes
3)sleep

Me: 
1) lay down
2)close eyes
3)wait
4)wait
5)wait
6) repeat steps 3-5 until you sleep"
I just want to sleep.,"Not really a good topic, but hey, maybe ya'll have some advice, or at least can commiserate. 

I haven't slept over 4 hours in a night for about 10 days. It's not normally this bad. I may have a night or two a week where I just can't sleep and I end up getting <3 hours, but I can function ok. I have been doing finals the last week, and haven't been sleeping due to studying/stress. Now, I am done, but between work and prepping for the holidays, I just can't get home before midnight, let alone asleep before 3am, and when I have to be at work the next day it's just impossible. I can feel my mental capacities slipping as it goes on. I just need one night to recharge and then I won't need sleep for a while. Just one night!
"
When I don't sleep I draw odd things...,
Does anyone else ever get so tired that you can't sleep?,This happens to me a lot but no one I've ever asked understands what I'm talking about. I get so tired that I get really hyper and productive and then I can't sleep. Then it can take me another day to reset and fall asleep. Similar experiences?
Surreality,"I'm still trying to find my way out of this haze that I woke up from after 2 hours of sleep and it's almost 4:30 AM. The days really just bleed together. Nothing feels real. Did I sleep last night ?  Maybe for a few hours...or maybe that was the night before? Is this all just an elaborate dream? The sporadic dreams I have in the few hours of sleep I get a night blend in with what has really happened.

I hear my name in the distance as if somebody is desperately calling for me to help them but nobody is there. I hear a phone ringing, it sounds just like the phone that I heard ring all throughout my childhood. There's no phone though, at least at this point I know it's not real. I see shadows and figures in my peripheral vision. It doesn't startle me anymore, it's just a sign that I will probably finally crash tonight...at least for a few hours. 

I have pneumonia, who the fuck gets pneumonia when it's 85 degrees outside? I'm only 24. The antibiotics aren't helping. I feel worse every day.  I keep getting sicker, I don't get better. It gives me anxiety about my health which makes me sleep even less. I know my immune system is virtually non existent. 

I feel like I'm deteriorating mentally and physically. I feel like I'm losing my mind. I keep losing weight and when I look at myself in the mirror a terrible wave of nausea washes over me. I look like death. 

The doctors have been different the last few times. They seem very solemn, as if they know exactly what is wrong but they are afraid to tell me. I don't think they understand though, most of the time I don't really feel like anybody understands. A lot of the time I don't understand.

The only thing that happens when my eyes close is an existential mind fuck...just to open them again and realize it's two hours later and I still haven't slept. My mind races constantly. I feel like I could write paragraph upon paragraph about the things I think about when I wish I could sleep but I doubt it would be coherent.
 
I don't have sleep apnea. Pills might fuck me up enough to sleep for a bit but then I'm awake again 3 hours later. The only thing that even allows me to sleep for the 2-3 hours a night that I sometimes get is smoking weed. 

I think to myself - "" if this pneumonia doesn't kill me I'm really going to change things, I'm going to get my life on track and feel normal and healthy again. ""

I don't even remember what ""normal"" feels like."
My experiences with insomnia (tips from a recovering insomniac),"First of all if any of you suffer from acute insomnia and haven't yet seen a GP - go see one. My biggest mistake was that I was too stubborn to go to the doctor, when I suffered from stress-induced insomnia.

&#x200B;

The following is a couple of experiences I've had battling my insomnia. They might work for you and they might not . Insomnia has many faces - figuring out what triggers your insomnia is the first step towards treating it.

&#x200B;

(If you don't suffer from mental-health issues or respiratory diseases, you can skip the following two paragrahps).

&#x200B;

As mentioned my insomnia started when I was going through a stressful time in my life. I had too much work and there was an imbalance between workload and spare time. Therefore, if any of you feel like things are out your hand, that you have just too much on your plate - take a break. When I found out just how stressed I was, I sought out help from a psychotherapist and gave myself a six-month vacation to calm down and recover. This helped me immensely. Your mental health is alfa-omega when dealing with insomnia, so do not hesitate to get psychotherapy.

&#x200B;

Second of all, I suffer from asthma and allergy, which means I use steroid-inhalers daily. The side affects of these vary individually. I found out that they have an arousing affect on me, so I started taking my medication earlier in the day.  Another implication of having allergy is that I have very sensitive sinuses and get a clogged nose very easily, which in turn made me breath through my mouth instead of my nose, which then made me wake up with dried out mouth several times a night. To counteract this I started using a presciption nasal-spray and started breathing more through my nose during the day. The latter may be counterintuitive, but the logic is this: how can a vital organ of the body function, without it being used? Think of it as a muscle - they grow when they're used and wither when not. As I looked in to it, the connection between breathing and sleeping is also very well known. E.g. when you focus on your breath you stimulate the prefrontal cortex of your brain, which regulates emotions and that might help you to relax, which is why mindfulness meditation work for some. So if you're suffering from respiratory issues - go see a GP.

&#x200B;

The most effective thing I implemented however was CBT. Shit works. Mainly for me it has helped regarding the anxiety that I got every time I went to bed. Now if I feel uneasy or unable to sleep it's okay, because I know, that if don't fall asleep within 20-30 minutes, I just get out of bed and do something that I enjoy and that is also relaxing. Like reading a nice book or taking a shower. CBT has proven to be the most effective treatment for insomnia. In studies it has been found to be more long-term beneficial than medication. As CBT is so often mentioned on this page, I won't go any further into describing it's benefits and principals because it's mentioned a lot on this sub, but seriously if you haven't tried it yet - try it. You can find all the information you need regarding CBT through a quick google search.

&#x200B;

Blue light: Do not use your phone or computer in bed and at least one hour prior to sleep. Your circadian rythm is heavily dependant on the balance between light and darkness. Try out som blackout curtains aswell to block out the light that might wake you up in the morning. Sunglasses are also very useful in blocking out light, when you just have to watch a game of late night sports or a good movie. F.lux is also helpful in limiting blue light.

&#x200B;

And there's one last thing which I've found to be helpful: when you go to bed find a comfortable position and then just lie still. Don't move whenever you feel an urge to do so. The logic behind this is that just as being physically active make you more awake - the opposite must be true. Physical inactiveness should make you more sleepy. It's a theory of my own making and therefore it might not work for you, but try it out.

&#x200B;

Lastly, to anyone out there feeling like life just isn't worth living. Hang in there. You have so much to live for. Don't let insomnia get the better of you, and I for one believe in you and your ability to change your life for the better. Seek comfort in the fact that you are not alone and there will always be people on this sub to support you, when the going gets tough.

&#x200B;

And thanks to all of you for all the guiding I've had from reading this sub.

&#x200B;

Edit: Forgot to mention caffeine and nicotine. There's a very common misunderstanding regarding how long caffeine affects your sleep. When people say that caffeine only affects your sleep for 5-8 hours, they're actually thinking of the half-life of caffeine, which is 5-8 hours. Therefore if you get 300mg of caffeine by noon you'd still have 150mg in your system by the time you go to sleep. My advice is to not drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages after noon."
Finally felt i could sleep.. checked the time and its 6:27.. three mins before my alarm.,Never felt so defeated but it feels nice even for a bit to be sleepy.
How do I not stress about my insomnia!?,"So I know I‚Äôm causing my own insomnia it all started with a few days of having trouble sleeping to me worrying about not sleeping to me not sleeping for days at a time... I know I‚Äôm causing it on myself but it‚Äôs so hard not to think if I‚Äôm going to sleep tonight or not, when night time comes I get anxiety and I start to overthink it and I‚Äôm really trying not to let this take a tole on me but it is, i know I can get out of this but i don‚Äôt know how or how to not overthink it, it‚Äôs so hard for me to stay positive I just feel like I‚Äôm not going to get through this, I‚Äôm slowly getting depressed over this.."
An interesting revelation,"I had had insomnia for as long as I can remember. It was my anxiety that caused it for the longest time. But I did notice that if I‚Äôm able to put my head down and fall asleep more quickly then my anxiety doesn‚Äôt have time to reach the point where it keeps me up. 
Recently I‚Äôve had stomach issues but I didn‚Äôt think they were severe enough to warrant any medications. I took a famotidine (Pepcid) tablet with my night meds one night about three weeks ago and for the first time in years I slept through the night. I honestly had no idea my stomach issues were playing such a big roll in my sleeping habits.
Apparently, acid reflux can be caused by sleeping medications, antidepressants and antihistamines. 

I also started using a cotton based blanket instead of a comforter, and while I prefer the weight of the comforter I can‚Äôt deny that the blanket has kept me cooler. 

Just two small changes I have personally made within the new year that has helped. "
"Too anxious to waste time sleeping, too anxious to fall asleep when I finally try to","Does anyone else get too anxious to waste time and delay going to sleep, then get super anxious (panicky, heart throbbing, cold sweat kinda thing) because I won't be getting more that 3-4 hours of sleep, making it super difficult to fall asleep. It gets more intense as time passes on and in the morning I realize I haven't really even slept at all. "
Mind wouldn't turn off last night. Got literally 0 sleep. Have to go work for 6 hours then school for 3 more.,Today will be long. Wish me luck comrades.
Sleep state misperception is the worst!,"I can‚Äôt tell if I was sleeping for the past 4 hours or not. I read that it‚Äôs called sleep state misperception and supposedly a lot of insomniacs experience this. 

I also can‚Äôt tell if the thoughts I remember or the stories in my head were dreams or just deep thoughts while trying to sleep. It‚Äôs weird because I would try to sleep and then open my eyes like a hour or two later and not tell if I slept for that time or was trying to sleep!

Part of me wants to believe there is no way I would stay still for hours at a time without getting restless but I can‚Äôt tell for sure! I‚Äôm wondering if my recent dose increase of Prozac can be responsible for this. "
Just asked God to please stop fucking with me,"Been in bed since 7pm, have to wake up for 330am for work...well I did but called out about 15 mins ago.

I don't get it, I'm dead tired but can't seem to catch sleep, came close twice.

Feels like my nervous system is outta wack, like when I used to binge drink. I'm experiencing hot flashes and invasive thoughts.

Idk what to do, so I put on a documentary.

Pissed my attendance is taking another hit"
Anxiety about falling asleep,It‚Äôs 2am right now and I have school tomorrow. I‚Äôm freaking out because I don‚Äôt want to be exhausted all day. I get anxiety about not sleeping which makes me not fall asleep. I‚Äôve taken 2 melotonin and a Xanax and it still hasn‚Äôt worked. I‚Äôve decided to take school off tomorrow but I don‚Äôt want my friends to think I‚Äôm a burnout because I‚Äôve missed school in the past for this. I just don‚Äôt think they‚Äôd understand 
"GUYS, it could be a microbiome related problem!","I just wanted to point this out as I‚Äôve been exhaustively (ha) searching for things that cause my insomnia, and only now did I came accross the idea that it could be an issue with your gut microbiome. These tiny guys are intimately intertwined with the brain play a huge role in your mental health. Alterations in them can even change your personality. Furthermore, chronic insomnia damages these microbiomes, which can very well lead to a self fulfilling cycle if left untreated. Specific kinds of bacteria play different roles and can be more effective than medicine.
I wish I could provide better information but I‚Äôm not the best person to talk about microbiology. It‚Äôs worth doing some research on the topic if it hasn‚Äôt crossed your mind before. 

update after some days of multibiotics and yogurt: It got a lot better. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs related or not, but the fact is I‚Äôve gone from a monthly average 3 hours of sleep per night to sleeping ~7 night after night after night... The sleep wasn‚Äôt perfect, but I was able to fall back asleep like a normal person and I can‚Äôt believe this is how it feels to sleep 7 hours... 
extra: I also tool an effort to spend a few minutes of chill time in green nature and being in direct sunlight when there was, trying to get direct sunlight in my eyes (without damaging them, be careful!)
I don‚Äôt know if these were the cause of my recovery but I did get better, so hope that this may help some of you. Every case is different."
I just want to relax,"I have to work in four hours and all I want is to feel comfortable and calm in my own bed. 

Anyone have quick tips for falling asleep and/or surviving the hellish day ahead?"
Anxiety insomnia- can‚Äôt give up Screen Time,Having anxiety/depression and insomnia for the past year... I would like to stop screen time before bed as I‚Äôve heard it helps... but when I don‚Äôt have TV on my mind starts racing and I my anxiety gets worse... anyone going through this as well? I‚Äôve tried reading instead but once I put the book down my mind goes off again.....
Why isn't there a tablet for long term use?,"I've tried everything, antihistamine, benzos, prescription hallucinogens. The antihistamines are my favorite but they can only be taken for three days. My doctor won't prescribe melatonin and it's not PBS anyway and too expensive. I've used sleep restriction, sleep hygiene, CBT. I just want a non addictive button I can press to go to sleep."
Nausea after a night of little sleep?,"So i'm lucky for 4 or 5 hours a night. It sucks. But i noticed after a particularly bad night, like no sleep at all to two hours I am so nauseous throughout the day. To the point of gagging and possibly vomiting what little i did eat. It also seems like a new symptom, maybe the past year it has been happening. Does anyone else experience this?"
Have no trouble falling asleep but waking up constantly,Title is self exploratory . I can fall asleep but after 1 hour sometimes 4 hour sometimes 20 minute I wake up. Do you have any idea what is this. I feel very sleep deprived at mornings
Does anyone have occasional insomnia?,"When I was in my teens, I would have a bit of insomnia for maybe 2 nights to a week out of every month. It subsided a year or so ago, until the past week where I've only been getting about 3-4 hours of sleep a night. Otherwise I fall asleep within half an hour and sleep all night, I was actually sleeping *too much* a couple of weeks ago. 

Is this anxiety related? Does anyone else here experience this? "
Pendulum induction vs insomnia,"Started out as an experiment, I created an app to test out pendulum movements.

I then realized it helps fight insomnia in two ways.

1. Hypnotize induction.
2. Simply relax by looking at it with background music.

Basically looking at it makes me pretty tired so it works for me and a few people I asked to test.  See if you guys wanna try it out and give feedbacks, thank you. :

When would you give up and go back to the pills?,"I was medicated with amitriptyline for 12 years. Never slept a single hour without it during that time.

The side effects became unbarable the last few years. I quit my job in order to get it fixed

Changed pills. Two weeks with mirtazapine. Sometime I slept, sometimes not, didn't liked side effects. 4 days on Quetiapine, great sleep, felt like a zombie and wanted to kill myself

It's been 9 days since I decided to be pill free. I'm averaging 2-3 hours of sleep a day, and I don't even know if I'm actually sleeping. I try to go to bed at 12am and fall sleep at 7-9 am. I think those couple of hours are the reason I'm still standing 

Barely function, can't drive, stumble when walking, have trouble thinking. I honestly expected the mind would shut off at this point but it hasn't happened. Last night I drank a few beers and they barely helped

Doctor says whatever I'm trying is futile. Since few things work on me he gave me pregabalin, trazadone and agomelatine to see if anything sticks.

I know I can't go too long this way but I don't want to get trapped with pills again

Marijuana & Insomnia,"Not so many people really believe I suffer from insomnia, they just think it‚Äôs an excuse to smoke weed. I have been smoking since I was 14 (I know, very young). I‚Äôve always had trouble trying sleep ever since I could remember. My friend and I had a sleep over and again, I couldn‚Äôt sleep. It was 4am and I still had energy for days so he (jokingly BTW) told me to try and smoke weed to have a good nights sleep. I did and ever since HAVE to smoke every night to sleep. I try to get my body physically and mentally tired but nothing ever works. Was wondering if there is anybody out there that suffers from the same thing? Or is it just me? "
"If you haven't yet, try listening to some ASMR or white noise to force yourself to sleep. It's worth a shot.","I get these bouts at night where I lie awake for hours, despite knowing that I need to sleep and being tired. The only thing I've found that works for me are droning, repetitive sounds. Check youtube out for some white noise videos. It might cure your issues.

"My insomnia has been insane lately, to the point where I'm becoming suicidal","I have been getting <4 hours per night and no sleep ~30% of the time. I've currently been up for 2 days. I have finals this week and next but I've just been skipping my classes because I don't even care anymore. Idek the last time I went.

What drugs help you deal with the discomfort of sleep deprivation during the day or to help you fall asleep? Trazadone and alcohol don't seem to be working very well and I'm willing to try anything at this point."
Screw this.,"I woke up for work yesterday, I was let off an hour early just so I could be well rested, it's 4:30 am, my next shift starts in 2 hours, and even though I laid in bed for 7 hours trying different things, it's just not happening. This happens every Saturday and I hate it.

It's not like I'll be able to just go to bed after my shifts over either, I've got final projects to do, so now I'm stuck just powering though this until at least 9pm. 


Rant aside, I could use some advice for staying functional until then."
Discussing insomnia with non-insomniacs is painful,"Why? Because they have no fucking idea.

""I haven't slept in 3 days""

""Oh? Just do x! X always helps *me* sleep.""

I hate that word, ""me"". Everybody thinks that the world revolves around them or that other humans experience struggles on the same level as they do, so they'll always downplay your sleep issue without ever understanding how serious it actually is.

Melatonin is often suggested to me, and it never worked. I'd hold 10 tabs under my tongue until they all melt, feel sleepy for about 30 minutes, then the effect wears off as if I hadn't taken anything. And yet people without insomnia still swear by it and cannot seem to understand that it does not work for some people at all. I basically started ignoring all recommendations from people without legit insomnia because it's clear to me that they have no problems sleeping and the placebo they get from their herbal supplements is all they need.

The stuff that actually does work- Cannabis, benzos & gabapentin are almost never suggested because people without insomnia tend to also be those annoying people who ""Don't do drugs"" yet still drink and take antidepressants or other meds their doctors are prescribing them. 

It also really bothers me that there's no known criteria for a person to be considered an insomniac, so people who take an hour to fall asleep can go around telling everyone ""YO, I'M SUCH AN INSOMNIAC"". Meanwhile I've been lying in bed wide awake for the last 4 hours on top of not having slept the night before and finally got fed up and started writing a rant on reddit. You are reading said rant right now.

Overall, the only way to talk to an insomniac about insomnia, or a person with any problem really when you yourself have no fucking clue is to listen and get an actual feel for our struggle before putting yourself on top of it. 

I don't know why the sleep gods hate me so much but for people who are blessed, kill yourselves. Please. You are the scum of the earth and my sleep-deprived brain hates you."
A quick poll: weighted blankets - do they work?,
"Okay, now I‚Äôm worried.","For two weeks straight I‚Äôve been sleeping from about 5am until around 6:30 when my kids wake up. I then take the oldest to school and the youngest goes with me to work. I work 8-5 most days and am completely fine energy wise once I get there. How much longer until I can expect a complete system shut down? I‚Äôve tried everything except sleep medication, which is not an option for me. "
"Shift work has ruined me. Zop starting not to work. Want to turn things around, but how?","I've been working shift work for about 9 years, and for the bulk of that time it was very haphazard and chaotic turnarounds. I currently have a schedule that means I have to work 2 weeks of day shifts followed by 2 weeks of night shifts which is slightly better. But the damage has been done.

I feel like I have no circadian rhythm left. I now often struggle with sleep anxiety and end up tossing and turning and fretting for hours on end. When I do finally fall asleep I can't /stay/ asleep, and often wake up feeling unrested and fatigued.

I tried Zopiclone a few years ago and it helped, but after a few months I stopped taking it and managed to go back to natural cyckes. However, this year I started taking it again and now I find myself dependent on it (7.5mg). To my utter horror even this is has lost its efficacy.

I want to start reversing this pattern but I don't even know where to begin. Anyone have any advice or wisdom?"
9 years later,"I have been suffering from insomnia since I was 12, I am now 21 and will be starting university soon. I have also been diagnosed with severe anxiety and depression. 

I remember being exposed to a pretty crappy school environment, bullying, being beaten up, being threatened and such. Which I think manifested in my anxiety. I‚Äôm pretty sure this is what caused my sleep issues in the first place I didn‚Äôt want to go to school so I would refuse and sleep all day, then would stay up all night unable to sleep. This got me referred to a child psychology unit in my borough, who decided the best thing to do was put me on melatonin and leave it at that. I was prescribed 9mg of melatonin which didn‚Äôt help on the slightest, I would be in a dark room for hours with nothing to do, this would lead to me thinking badly about myself and push me deeper into the self loathing hole, I was then put on citalopram, an antidepressant which made me more emotionally messed up, and my parents wouldn‚Äôt help by calling me useless or lazy or making fun of me for it. Ive been in the cycle of fixing my pattern for maybe 4 days if I‚Äôm lucky then going back to being awake for more than a day and feeling like trash. My sleep was quite sporadic, I would wake up a lot and when I get up I‚Äôm not in the best of moods and will often be late due to not waking up to an alarm.

My sleep issue now is not as bad as it once was (I say writing this post at 7am) I was once unable to sleep for days at a time unable to sleep comfortably to now rarely oversleeping and rarely going over 24 hours unless I plan on it for pattern fixing purposes. My biggest worry is starting university and not showing up because I‚Äôm asleep, my insomnia would ideally be cured by then with the new pattern but I highly doubt it as nothing has helped before. 

Has anyone had anything similar to me where their insomnia is linked to anxiety/depression, I feel like it‚Äôs pretty common and if you do what strategies to you use to help yourself sleep and keep a good sleeping pattern. 

Thanks.

Tips that helped me fall asleep and break my insomnia,"Hello reddit! I've been suffering from anxiety induced insomnia for the past couple weeks, specifically sleep onset insomnia. Here are some tips that worked for me to finally be able to fall asleep. I'm sorry if they don't work for you :(  I put the highlighted tips in italics (for tldr's sake)

1. **Addressing the anxiety:** *I think the first and foremost thing was to address where my anxiety was coming from and having a resolution for it.* I have a huge test coming up in a couple days (one where my life kind of depends on) and I hadn't been doing well on the practice tests, so it was making me have full on panic attacks at night when I'm about to sleep. It really worsened my anxiety because I couldn't sleep due to stress, and I was tired all day from the stress and I couldn't study properly. I studied as hard as I could through the insomnia/tiredness. I feel a lot better about the test now and my mind is less crazy. *If you're actively working on something and you are giving it your best effort, it's okay not to worry. Everything will be okay!*
2. **Sleeping aids:** *I used half a tablet of Benadryl (12.5mg because 25 made me way too drowsy) on the days my anxiety was really bad*, and I didn't use it consecutively because I didn't want to become dependent to it. Usually the night when I take Benadryl, my sleep quality isn't that great so I end up being tired anyways throughout the day. Since I have an exam to study for, I couldn't use any drugs that would affect my memory (like weed, benzos, and whatnot), and Benadryl was pretty helpful for the sleep onset and I had some decent REM sleep. There is a little bit of grogginess when you wake up though. I tried melatonin 3mg (cut up into 4ths) but it wasn't helpful and it gave me heart palpitations so I gave up on that. I think it's very important that you don't get dependent on drugs unless on the days you ABSOLUTELY need it, because your body will stop trying to fall asleep unless there are drugs involved.
3. **Sleep hygiene:** Some helpful things that made me comfortable was *sleep with only my underwear, making sure I was at a comfortable temperature. I have a low pillow* (I tried a high pillow but that made my insomnia worse because I was uncomfortable). I use earplugs (but not inserted too deep because that gave me a headache).
4. **Trouble falling asleep:** I'm a REALLY light sleeper so when my family is walking around, closing doors, I end up waking up. It was hard, but I went to bed only when I knew it was going to be quiet for me to sleep because *I felt that the more times I kept waking up when I was falling asleep, the harder it became to actually fall asleep. Making sure you don't have any interruptions when you are trying to sleep is IMPORTANT.* When I had been in bed for more than 2 hours unable to sleep (because family being loud and whatnot), I got up and read my notes at a dim light until they went to bed, and until I became tired again.
5. **Sleeping ritual - this was the most helpful for me!!!:**  *I make sure to not drink any water about 1.5 hours before going to bed, and I turn off lights and read with a dim light for 2 hours before going to bed*. *I make sure I'm not hungry when I'm going to bed. I spent about 20 minutes listening to quiet music, thinking all of the thoughts I usually think before I go to bed, and making sure I have a resolution and a plan for my worries. When I go to sleep, I remind myself how comfortable this bed is, how good the temperature is, and* ***I relax all of my limbs and do not move or swallow any saliva (this is important because you WILL wake up if you move even a slight bit), and just focus on breathing in and out.*** *Especially focusing on just breathing helped me not think distracting thoughts and focus on being relaxed.*
6. **Activity:** I tried running for 30-40 minutes about 3-4 hours before going to bed or going on a walk for 30-40 minutes but I didn't find it helpful for falling asleep, but this may be different for everyone. Running actually just made me tired but I still had insomnia, so I gave up on this.

Thanks for reading and please let me know if you have any other tips!!"
sleeping on the sofa when i can't fall asleep in my bed,"hey guys, does anyone ever do this? if I can't fall asleep in my bed, sometimes trying for hours, i'll sleep on my sofa and pass out immediately. But I don't get why this happens."
Anyone else take Diphenhydramine every night?,It's become something I take every night to fall asleep.  I usually take either 50 or 75 mg.  It's sold both as a sleep aid and as Benadryl antihistamine.  Been wondering lately about side effects.  I might be noticing that I feel really lathargic and generally shitty in the morning after taking it.  I know some people like to abuse this stuff by taking massive doses and that's definitely not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about taking reasonable amounts for the pure purpose of falling asleep. Anyone else take this all the time to fall asleep? Anyone notice any negative side effects?  
I need to drive my dad to the hospital in less than five hours and I can't sleep,"As of writing this it is currently 01:17 am, and I'm scared to drive with so little sleep. He can't drive himself and I don't know of someone else who can. Please help, I don't know what to do."
How to optimize sleep and fix insomnia,"Hello reddit. I have struggled with chronic insomnia for years and have learned a lot about optimizing sleep. I am doing much better these days based on these practices. I have compiled this list of tips/methods to optimize your sleep. With diligence, even the most stubborn insomnia may be able to be cured. Even if you aren't an insomniac, you can probably improve your sleep in some ways. Many of these methods are major lifestyle changes for some people. Dont make too many changes at once, otherwise you may burn yourself out and fall back to old habits. Slow and steady is the better bet.

A lot of this comes from the two books, ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker, and ""The Sleep Book"" by Guy Meadows. I highly recommend reading both even for the normal sleepers (especially the first).

**Schedule**

* Go to bed and wake up at the same times, every day.
* Melatonin can be used to give yourself an early melatonin spike if you have jet lag. It only works if you travel eastward, such that the sun is setting earlier than your biological clock thinks.
* Avoid sleeping in on weekends. It's better to get up at the same time so you dont screw up the next nights sleep by losing sleep drive.
* Try to align your sleep schedule with sunrise. For most people this will mean going to bed around 10pm.

**Sleep restriction therapy**

* Dont spend more time in bed than you need. Most people need 7 to 9 hours of sleep. Experiment with that range.
* Set how many hours you would like to sleep, and set sleep/wake times that comprises those hours. For example, say you want to wake up at sunrise, which is 6am, and you need 8 hrs. Count back 8 hrs to 10pm, and that is when you should get in bed, no sooner.
* There are more rigorous methods of sleep restriction therapy, but they are difficult and reserved for extreme cases. You can try going as low as 6 hrs per night but I wouldnt go below that without the supervision of a sleep doctor.
* Track your sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) and you may increase time in bed if you are above 85-90% and feel you need more sleep.
* Dont spend more time than allotted in bed even if you are trying to ""catch up"" on sleep or sleep in. 

**Naps**

* If you are not getting optimal sleep, try to avoid naps because it might lower your sleep drive too much.
* Otherwise, a short, 20-30 min nap in the afternoon is ok. Humans naturally have a rise in sleep drive in the early afternoon, so there is speculation we took an afternoon nap before modern work culture.

**Environment**

* Spend some money on a good comfy mattress, pillow, and covers. Doesnt have to be expensive but you should go to a store and try various ones out.
* Cool the bedroom to 65 - 70 degrees F. The body needs to lower its core temperature to signal to the brain its time to sleep
* Make sure your bedroom is completely dark at night. Even a small amount of light can interrupt sleep. Sleep masks dont solve everything because there are light sensitive cells on your skin as well.
* Block out distracting sounds with a fan or white noise app.
* During winter you can try a humidifier if you frequently wake up with dry mouth/throat.

**Drugs**

* Avoid alcohol altogether. It suppresses sleep. If you must cave in, stick to no more than two drinks, no later than a few hours before bed.
* Avoid marijuana. It may help you fall asleep in the short term, but it suppresses REM sleep, so you will get better quality sleep without it.
* Avoid tobacco. Nicotine is a stimulant and will keep you up if you smoke at night.
* It goes without saying, most other drugs will interfere with sleep in some way. We all love to party but you've got to keep it infrequent for optimal sleep.

**Caffeine**

* Some people metabolize caffeine slowly, meaning it stays in your system for a long time. Try going without any coffee or caffeine.
* Ideally, you should have at least a few days a week in which you have NO caffeine.
* Definitely dont have any caffeine after lunch time.
* Chocolate has caffeine in it.
* If you have a high tolerance to caffeine, you should take two weeks off to reset tolerance so you wont need as much.

**Light therapy - controlling your circadian rhythm with more natural light exposure**

* Get at least 30 min of direct sunlight (outside, no sunglasses, even if it is cloudy) within the first hour of waking up.
* Wear blue-light blocking glasses after sunset, for at least the last hour before bed. I use the cheap Uvex Skyper glasses.
* Align your sleep schedule with the sun. Wake up around sunrise and go to sleep within a few hours of sunset. Typically this means going to bed no later than 10pm.
* To aid with getting light exposure in the morning, you can get ""Re-Timer"" glasses that have LED lights shining the optimal wakefulness-promoting colors.
* Get a small red-colored flashlight or nightlight to use if you get up at night, so you dont induce wakefulness with bright artificial light.
* Dim the lights in the hours before bed time. Try to avoid screen use in the last 30min - 1 hr before bed.

**Diet**

* Chronic poor sleep can make you insulin resistant. This means your body is less able to clear out blood sugar. If you eat a high-carb meal, it will lead to a spike in blood sugar, followed by a low. These wild swings in blood sugar can mess with cortisol. If your blood sugar is too low, the body will raise cortisol. If that happens at night, you will wake up.
* Shift your diet to a lower carb diet with low glycemic-index carbs like sweet potatoes, brown rice, beans, etc.
* Most people only need 50 to 150 grams of carbs per day, dont over do it.
* Avoid carbs for breakfast, and save most carbs for dinner. This will help your body maintain a natural cortisol timing because high blood sugar suppresses cortisol, but we should have a cortisol spike after waking up.
* Eat a good serving of veggies for natural fiber to help digestion.
* Dont eat too large of a dinner, otherwise you will raise your body temperature at night when it should be lowering to promote sleep
* Dont eat within 2-3 hours of bedtime.

**Exercise**

* Get at least 30 min of rigorous exercise per day, preferably in the morning or afternoon.
* A morning walk/run outside is a great habit as it kills two birds with one stone: daily exercise and morning sunlight exposure.
* Dont exercise within 3 hrs of bed time.

**Mental game**

* Some people psych themselves out at night, whether worrying too much about getting sleep, or spending too much effort on ensuring the perfect conditions. You need to learn to let go and let nature do its thing.
* Practice mindfulness meditation during the day. There are some good guides on the internet about this.
* When you lay down in bed, try welcoming the various types of thoughts that come. For example, say you start worrying about something at work, simply think: ""Welcome, work worries."" Treating these thought intrusions in a welcoming way is part of ""Acceptance therapy"" which helps to calm you down.
* Dont spend too much energy on getting the racing thoughts out of your head. If they come, simply observe and know they will go away eventually.
* Dont worry about having a bad night of sleep. Just accept it and know that good sleep will come in time.
* What should you do with yourself if you law awake for hours? Try to spend a little time on mindfulness meditation, focus on relaxing and conserving energy for the next day.
* Do something relaxing for the last 30 min - 1 hr before bed, like reading a book. Avoid excitement-inducing activities like video games or action movies.

**Getting out of bed**

* You may have a hard time getting out of bed at your alarm. It is crucial you dont spend excessive time in bed, otherwise your brain will fail to release enough sleep-promoting hormones. Here are some novel ideas if you are really struggling:
* Make it a habit to jump in the shower as soon as you get up. Once you've showered, you're unlikely to return to bed. Shower first with hot water then finish off with cold for a jolt of wakefulness.
* Keep a bottle of water, a high-protein snack, and a caffeine pill beside you. Consume all three as soon as you wake up. This should help jump start your energy enough to get out of bed and start your day.
* Use a portable electric heater on a timer. Have it turn on 30 min or so before your alarm, so you wake up warm. This will discourage you from staying in bed and sweating.
* Block internet on your phone so you dont lay in bed browsing. The app Freedom.to can do it but there is a small monthly fee. With Freedom you can set a schedule to block, such as 5am to 9am. If you need to unblock it, you can log in on your computer and remove the device from the block, but make sure you add it back in later.

**Sleep tracking**

* You should track your sleep in some way so you know what works and what doesnt.
* Manual method: keep a spreadsheet and fill it out every morning. Log the time you went to sleep, how long it took to fall asleep, when you woke up, when you got out of bed, how many awakenings did you have, how many hours did you sleep (estimate), and calculated sleep efficiency.
* Automatic methods: There are many sleep apps. I use an Apple Watch in combination with the Pillow app. Fitbit is also good. A phone by itself can only use the microphone to detect the sounds of you moving, which isnt that accurate, so wearables are better. Supposedly the ""Oura Ring"" is the newest most accurate sleep tracker.

**Sleep aids**

* In general, drugs are not effective long term at inducing restful sleep. They tend to knock you out without letting your brain do what it needs to do for actual recovery.
* If you are habitually using sleep aids, you need to taper off slowly, because they can cause rebound insomnia when you stop.
* Melatonin is not scientifically proven to help in most situations.
* In general there is no magic bullet, but the best sleep aid I've found for occasional use is called ""Doc Parsley's Sleep Remedy""
* Try to only use sleep aids in special situations, like for jet lag or emergencies. It is too easy to become dependent and they often result in less restful sleep.

**Sleep apnea**

* Go read about the symptoms of sleep apnea, and if any of it resonates with you, get a sleep study done to rule it out."
"Can't ""get comfortable enough"" to sleep?","I feel like my main problem is how uncomfortable I am lying in bed regardless of how tired I am. I hate my bed. I hate lying in my bed awake for any length of time now. My room is very small so it's hard to avoid sitting or lying on my bed during the day, but I try and I'm continually trying harder to reduce my time spent near it. I do have bad back problems, but alot of the time it isn't the pain that keeps me awake.I feel like my neck is so strained on my pillow and my pillow is lumpy, my bed is hard and needs to be replaced and offers no comfort either, my blanket is too light and doesn't give me the pressure and security a heavier one would. I can't afford to replace these things as I'm 17 and my family is broke. I also get this issue in my grannys house though, her pillows are a bit better but I still toss and turn and I'm up all night. I have to toss after 10 minutes or less or I'm uncomfortable or I'm in pain. I do baths, magnesium, 5-htp and valerian before bed, I wear wax ear plugs and try to keep the room dark and cool. I read, meditate, do yoga, listen to music or do something else of simular nature to wind down. It's so frustrating. I can't take it anymore, I'm too sleep deprived to do anything. It's interfering with all aspects of my life. I was already in a difficult place to begin with, eating disorder (anorexia + binge eating), anxiety/depression, new Aspergers and ADD diagnosis, loneliness, severe chronic back pain and a bad home life. I just need to get this under control, I really can't function well without my sleep. I don't know what to do anymore."
CBT Week 2 Update,"I'm back, and things are still going well. My sleep efficiency has still been going up, (time spent in bed vs time asleep), which is great. I had one relapse this weekend because I showered with a bright light on too close to bed. I thought I was sleepy, but turns out I wasn't. I think this coming week will be the most important for me because I'll be extending my time in bed to 6 hours. Before, it was only 5.5. If this next week works out, this could be me kicking insomnia in the ass pretty soon. See you all next week."
I slept 3 hour today guys.,
No trouble falling into stage 1 sleep but jolted awake when approaching stage 2. Insomnia?,"So sleepy, so cozy. Eyes feel so heavy. Thoughts are becoming dreams. I still think I'm awake but I'm actually in stage 1. I'm not worrying about anything, just drifting... off...

Nope NOW I'm awake for seemingly no reason.

Does anybody else experience this? Is this insomnia and not something worse at least?"

Catch-22 with sleep,"I can't sleep because I'm so stressed out, but not sleeping makes me even more stressed out. My stress is just snowballing at this point and I have exams coming up. I know its gonna escalate pretty badly in the coming weeks, and I've been thinking about asking my GP for some sort of meds. I know that drugs can make anxiety worse in the long-term, but I'm just worried I'll pass out from exhaustion in the middle of a test or something. Anyone have any advice on which route to take?"

How to Approach Insomnia Mentally,"Recovered extreme insomniac here.....it can get better...but having the right mindset helps:

1) The more I try to control my anxiety the more I am controlled.  In order to reduce my stress and anxieties and fears, I have to make friends with them.  The war must be stopped.  Peace must come first, then sleep will follow, not the other way around.   The more I focus on my fears and try to control them the worse they get.

2) Insomnia is not a war.  It's not something to fight.  It's not something to out-think, out-smart, out-maneuver or trick.  I don't need to ""fight,"" ""battle"" or ""overcome"" anything...I refuse to be a willing participant in this non-existent ""war"" with myself...I am no longer a willing participant and I refuse to ask myself unanswerable questions.  Thus, i cannot lose or be beat mentally because I refuse to engage in a fight, whether it be a mental fight, an emotional fight, an intellectual fight or anything else.  Disengagement is the best and sure fire way to approach insomnia.

3) Insomnia does not deserve nor require attention.  Instead it deserves, requires distraction.  The best distractions are focusing on things you like or your accomplishments.  These accomplishments can be past accomplishments or even getting something done like housework or finishing a project.  The brain must re-learn how to engage with life and disengage from thinking about how to fix itself.  Insomnia is not the problem -- the problem is overreacting to it.  Sleeping well does not require any sort of engagement whatsoever -- it requires disengagement...it requires getting back to basics...getting back to you...getting back to the simple life and just being the old you, the best you -- not searching for a new you.

4) If you've always been a good sleeper yet you've had problems in the recent past and gotten on meds, your sleep will not return to normal unless and until you get off these meds.  Only when your brain is allowed to sleep normally, unaided will it be able to do so.  You will never develop trust in yourself, or your body again, if you never get off the meds and do it on your own.  you must confront your fears head on and beat them back with success.  This is true with all fears and phobias.  Confronting them gives  you power.  Don't bend over backwards for insomnia in order to soothe your fears -- it doesn't work. 

5) End the ""what-if"" questions.  Ignore them if they pop in your mind.  Don't address or answer them.  We ultimately don't trust ourselves to make the right choices anyway, so why engage?  Doing so will only lead to fear, indecision, regret, second-guessing, etc....Just make a decision to be yourself, act as you always act and never look back or question it....just go forward like the real you.  Soon, the real you will emerge again and you will look back and wonder why you ever allowed yourself to be manipulated and twisted into something that doesn't even resemble you.

6) Finally the answers are simple.  What you should do is instinctively obvious.  Don't look to someone else for advice on how to sleep.  They do not know how to make you sleep. Their opinions will only confuse you.   Only you know...the answers are not something that you should be searching for anyway -- there are no answers to be found....your internal wisdom and common sense are much more valuable than what someone says in a book or on the internet.  I sleep normally nowadays but I'm still clueless as to how to beat insomnia.  I never did figure that out.....but I sleep good.   Sleep is a mystery..but as soon as you can get back to being the victorious you again, the sooner sleep will return. My sleep issue, as it turns out, were not due to of a lack of valerian tea, lack of melatonin, or lack of a psychotherapist appointment, lack of Ambien, lack of reading, lack of knowledge...proven by the fact that I'm lacking all of these now, but sleep fine.

Good luck.  if anyone needs help or advice, don't hesitate...I'll be glad to try and help you.  Tom"
The insomniac life,"Still up. You‚Äôd think one would be tired. Nope. Sigh, keep trucking along my fellow insomniacs?"
Doctor won‚Äôt prescribe ambien to me(23F) now because I‚Äôm too young BUT when I was 19 it was okay.,"I‚Äôm so frustrated and I need to vent. 

I had minor sleepwalking when I was previously prescribed ambien at 19yrs old so I stopped taking it. Despite the sleepwalking it was the best I‚Äôve slept in years. My dr has given me 4 different anti-depressants, lunesta and recently trazadone. 

Trazadone caused me to hallucinate a terrifying amount and the antidepressants had their own issues.

I‚Äôve asked for ambien again because I knew it worked and I‚Äôm in a much better living situation and my life isn‚Äôt as stressed so I may not be as active now. 

I‚Äôm sleeping maybe 2-3hrs on a GOOD night, I feel like a lunatic. I am so desperate for sleep at this point it‚Äôs sad. 


"
I'm sleep deprived all the time and it's making everything awful. I feel emotionless.,"I'll go to bed at fucking 12 PM and lay in bed for just hours and hours, until it's 5:30AM and I'm still awake with an alarm set for 8:00 so I can get up for classes. Usually I get around 4 hours of sleep a night and even sometimes 2 and about once a week I get a good night sleep. Melatonin helps a little bit sometimes but I get awful dreams when I use it. Benadryl does jack shit and I feel hungover the next day when I take it. Marijuana makes me feel anxious as hell. The sleep deprivation makes me feel emotionless and I can't concentrate on anything at all. It fucks with my vision a lot too. I get a ton of visual snow when sleep deprived and I hallucinate badly when staring at things for a while (which happens a lot when sleep deprived). I want to see a doctor but I can't afford it myself and I don't want to ask my parents because they'll probably think I'm seeking drugs, also I don't want a physical dependency on benzos or z-drugs and I'm not touching anti-depressants. I hate this. It's been like this for 2 months now. Used to not be that bad. Thanks. "
"I have eliminated coffee and since then, I have slept better than I ever had in years!","The title says it all. I have suffered from insomnia for several years. I just hated the feeling of not getting enough rest, getting suboptimal rest, waking up in the middle of the night and not going to sleep, etc. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to my roommate and he just told me to try eliminating coffee and caffeine off my diet. I didn't think it would affect me because I stop drinking caffeine at noon and I have been drinking coffee for a decade. Nevertheless, I gave it a try. For the first two days, I had major headaches and had to push through with Advil. But shortly afterward, I slept over 20 hours the next two nights. The last time I did that was over a decade ago.

I really hope this helps some people here. Please try taking caffeine off of your diet. I suppress my addiction to decaf coffee. My brain feels a lot sharper and I am a lot happier."

Can we get a subreddit wiki?,"I think it would be incredibly useful to have some sort of wiki for this subreddit. It would help to provide some basic guide for anyone who comes across this sub and has common questions. Also it would help define more complex subjects such as CBT (e.g. what is it?, how do i start?, etc.).

For example, check out /r/fitness's wiki page: https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/index

Now I'm not saying it has to be this advanced, but at least having some simple text sections would be nice, especially Q&A's.

Also if we need help coding I am down to help.

Another idea to make this subreddit better,"There should be a topic pinned on top where all people who fought Insomnia and won, write all their experiences and how they got healed. That will be so helpful for people with Insomnia. This subreddit is completely useless as it is right now... Comment if u agree. We really should try to make this subreddit better together. If there's any thing you think this subreddit should do better. Please comment that below too. I'm not a moderator, just a person with Insomnia and looking to cure myself, just like every other person browsing this subreddit. If we really want to fix ourselves, we should work together and make this a helpful subreddit. Stop being lazy. Let's all work together and do research and stuff.."
I'm starting to actually sleep again...,"After two and a half years of doctors, medications, natural remedies, UNNATURAL remedies (sooo many goats and demons), frustration, depression and gradually going from a normal looking guy to a disheveled, droopy-eyed zombie...

I'm starting to actually sleep again.

Now, granted. It's only been about a week, but in the last 7 nights, I've slept soundly for about 5 hours. The first two nights were the roughest, as if my body was fighting against my newest sleep aid, but the last five?

A full five hours. To some of you, that might not seem like much. To others, you'd probably give your left leg for four.

I'm not selling anything, I'm not promoting anything, I'm just saying that this worked for me. Don't care what brand, size, shape or what you try, but if you're at the end of your rope like me, the secret was...

A weighted blanket.

I can't believe that it is working, but it is. 

Sure, like every other remedy I've tried, it might not last, but after this last bout of insomnia, I'll take even a temporary reprieve.

They've got their share of cons... (My wife hates it, it's heavy and cumbersome, and I'm positive that washing it is going to be an absolute nightmare) ...but yeah.

Don't care what brand, weight or style - but for me, it's actually working and I can't recommend it enough.

My spouse sleeps every 2-3 nights for 60 minutes. Any way to help her?,"My girl is in her early 30s. She have had sleeping issue since she was in her teens. 
In the last 9 years she sleeps once every 2 or 3 nights, and even then only for 30-60 minutes at most. After the 3rd night without sleep she would usually pop a bunch of sleeping pills, or else she experiences nausea, eyesight problems, memory loss, or sometimes even just faint. 
She doesnt feel like she's tired - she just knows that after 3rd night things get icky, hence the sleeping pills.
After she pops sleeping pills (double the recommended dose, the most that her doc approves) she does get 3 hours of sleep - but she experiences severe muscle pain when she wakes up, so she tries to avoid sleeping pills as much as possible.
She tries hard to get natural sleep - she would spend hours at nights trying to get some sleep and get very frustrated about it- but in most cases it gets her the half-hour sleep, no more.

Is anyone familiar with this or can guide as to what may be a solution to this?"
Pharmacology of Insomnia,"Hey everyone! 

Long time lurker here. Just today signed up to kind of give back to the community and be more involved.   In this post I want to share with you everything I've studied over the years to address all my mental issues haha including insomnia and anhedonia(depression?). Obviously in here, I'll be talking specifically about insomnia and the pharmacology behind it. I'll also be addressing different causes of insomnia and how certain people will have different symptoms and things that can help them.

Let's start off with it's causes

# Causes of Insomnia

## Underlying mental or physical conditions
Insomnia is almost never diagnosed by itself. It's usually a symptom of another condition. Nobody goes to a doctor and comes home with an Insomnia diagnosis. Your doctor will often ask you questions to determine the underlying cause. This condition could be a mental one such as depression or a more physical one such as hyperthyroidism. Therefor your treatment should focus on treating the underlying condition. Your doctor will prescribe you medication to treat your insomnia along side your underlying condition as well. Which is fine. No reason why you should keep suffering. In this post though, I'll only address the mental conditions and how they cause insomnia.

## Stress
Stress isn't necessarily a mental condition. However, it might lead to many mental conditions especially if it's prolonged and not addressed. I'll get into the pharmacology of this as well.

## Nutrient Deficiencies
A chronic deficiency in certain nutrients can cause insomnia. Just to name a few, magnesium, vitamin B(almost all of them) , vitamin D. Deficiencies in these will often cause a chain of imbalances in your neurotransmitters which will in return result in you not getting the sleep you need.

##  Chemical Induced 
Certain compounds you‚Äôre taking could be causing insomnia. Anti-depressants, diet pills, stimulants are the most common ones. Insomnia usually goes away after cessation of consumption.

## Circadian Rhythm Irregularities
If your circadian rhythm is off, you won‚Äôt be able to get the sleep you need. Your body won‚Äôt be ready to sleep when you want it to be. This might be caused by many things. Night shifts, no sun exposure, staying up late on a regular basis. 

# Potential Treatments

Now I‚Äôll explain how these conditions result in insomnia and the pharmacology behind them.

## Mental issues

### Depression

Depression has many causes and results in many different neurotransmitters being out of whack. Let‚Äôs discuss which ones are actually responsible for insomnia.

Serotonin: Serotonin is the neurotransmitter that facilitates many things. Regulation of your sleep cycle is one of them. Your body produces the most serotonin upon waking and replaces it with melatonin as the sun sets. Yes your body/mind do react to sunset. 
	Depressed people often require more serotonin than people that aren‚Äôt depressed.

Glutamate: Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in our brains. Your body naturally elevates glutamate levels when faced with ‚Äústress‚Äù. The reason for this is that, glutamate is heavily involved with analytic thinking and learning. When you‚Äôre under stress , you need to be doing a lot of learning and thinking to either adapt to your current stressor or to eliminate it by resolving it. Therefor glutamate is released. However , people with depression often have issues that aren‚Äôt resolved or addressed, this results in glutamate constantly being elevated. This in return diminishes dopamine as glutamate and dopamine are negatively proportioned.

Adrenaline/Nor-adrenaline: As I mentioned above, people with depression are stuck in a stress/fight or flight state. Too much glutaminergic stimulation triggers ACTH release. This also results in their adrenal gland being over-worked. Researches show that , depressed patients often has bigger adrenal glands that those that aren‚Äôt. Having too much adrenaline and/or noradrenaline will be quite stimulating and can cause insomnia.


So how can this be fixed? Well it‚Äôs definitely not easy. But start somewhere! Address your depression. See your doctor. Usually the first line of treatment will be an SSRI. This has two benefits. You having increased your serotoninergic stimulation will in return decrease glutamate which in return reduce ACTH release and also directly inhibit noradrenaline release. However, SSRIs also increase ACTH directly by acting on serotonin receptors. What happens when you‚Äôre depressed is that, your body does produce more serotonin to cope with the ‚Äústressor‚Äù but it being constantly elevated often results in desensitization. This is why there are a few anti-depressants that are developed that remove Serotonin from synapses which in fact re-sensitize them to serotonin. Try these new anti-depressants. There is also a drug called Riluzole. Ask your doctor for a prescription for it. It works by reducing glutamate. So your serotonin pathway isn‚Äôt affected at all. If you‚Äôre being treated for depression and you‚Äôre still not sleeping well, try  a very low dose of melatonin. I often recommend 50mcgs. It‚Äôs a super low dose but trust me your body will react to it better. Your body is capable of turning melatonin to serotonin and vice versa. So if you take a higher dose, some will be converted to serotonin which will increase ACTH and cortisol and guess what? You won‚Äôt be able to sleep. You can find a ton of anecdotal evidence for this. Melatonin also decreases dopamine and this might result in things like restless legs and stimulation especially for people with ADHD(will get to it later).If you‚Äôre taking an SSRI and it has worked for you for a short time and stopped, try supplementing with 5-htp. SSRIs work by making your serotonin stay around you synapses longer which result in more serotoninergic stimulation of them. This however tricks your body into thinking it has too much of it, so your body stops producing serotonin. So after a while, you‚Äôre back to where you are in terms of serotoninergic stimulation. So fix this, you might consider taking 5-htp or a precursor such as L-tryptophan. 5-htp is basically serotonin. L-tryptophan is what your body uses to make 5htp.

### Bi-Polar

People who are bi-polar go through 2 phases of mental states. A high and a low. Both states can result in insomnia. However, obviously a when going through a high, you‚Äôre more likely to stay up and not sleep. What happens during this state is that you‚Äôre glutamate is low and your dopamine and noradrenaline are sky high(Mania). It‚Äôs often treated with drugs that stimulate NMDA and other glutamate receptors. You can try a gram of Sarcosine and a few grams of L-Glycine during this state.They work by decreasing glutamate re-uptake and directly binding to Glycine glutamate receptors . Stimulating glutamate receptors will normalize your dopamine levels. Melatonin could also work during this state as it will decrease dopamine as well. Also make sure you‚Äôre taking any mood stabilizer (Lithium etc.. ) your doctor gave you. If you‚Äôre going through a low, your mental state will be quite similar to those with depression. For this reason , all the advice given above will apply here too.

### ADHD

People with adhd have a hard time collecting their thoughts together and relaxing. It‚Äôs because their brains lack dopamine in parts that facilitate focus/attention. They often get distracted and only get intrigued by things that are ‚Äúnew‚Äù and stimulating. Otherwise they‚Äôll suffer from racing thoughts and anxiety. Both of which can cause insomnia. To treat ADHD induced insomnia, you can try a low dose Ritalin. Not adderall because adderall also increases glutamate and serotonin. I also have ADHD and I had the best sleep of my life with 50mcgs of melatonin and 5mgs of ritalin taken together! Taking ritalin close to bed-time makes my racing thoughts go away and melatonin gets my body ready to sleep. It‚Äôs definitely worth trying. Melatonin does facilitate sleep through means other than reducing dopamine so don‚Äôt get confused here.




### Anxiety

Anxiety might be caused by a variety of mental conditions and the sense of anxiety often differ. People with ADHD can feel anxious in a different way than people with depression. The treatments would obviously differ. Addressing the root cause of anxiety would often help with the accompanying insomnia. People with ADHD obviously wouldn‚Äôt be treated with GABAergics. Doing so could potentially worsen their ADHD as gaba would inhibit their already low dopamine. That‚Äôs why some people feel stimulated by Xanax. Seriously this is a thing. There‚Äôs plenty of anecdotal evidence for this. If you have depression and feeling anxious , a gabaergic could help. You could try Gotu Kola or Valerian. They‚Äôre both work through increasing GABA and/or directly binding to GABA sites. Gotu Kola works by converting glutamate to gaba. Valerian binds to GABA receptors directly. If you have ADHD, stick to your medication and it should keep your anxiety in check.

## Stress

When you‚Äôre under stress, you have a lot more Glutamate , Adrenaline and Noradrenaline in your system. You‚Äôre basically more stimulated. This will cause insomnia. However the cure will depend on how long you‚Äôve been under stress. If you‚Äôre worrying about a speech you need to give tomorrow morning and can‚Äôt sleep. I recommend a glass of wine. Alcohol(Ethanol) is a NMDA blocker, GABAergic and also blocks melatonin re-uptake. Now I don‚Äôt want you to think, I encourage drinking but for short term stress , alcohol is great. For long term, I would recommend adaptogens. Cordyceps Militaris is a great one. It works by binding to Adenosine receptors(opposite of what caffeine does). This in return reduces glutamate and acetylcholine release. Both of which are elevated during stressful times. Also an obvious treatment would be eliminating your stress factors.

## Nutrient Deficiencies

Deficiencies in certain nutrients that happen to have a direct impact on neurotransmission can and will cause insomnia. Magnesium for instance, it‚Äôs a NMDA blocker so a deficiency would result in an over activation of these receptors. Vitamin B6 facilitates conversion of Glutamate to GABA so a deficiency would result in again an over activity of glutamate and a lack of GABA. Vitamin D does have a direct impact on serotonin receptor sites so a lack of it can negatively impact serotonin. Obviously fixing the deficiencies would help you with your insomnia.

## Chemical Induced

If you‚Äôre on a medication or taking certain supplements, your insomnia might have been caused by them. If you‚Äôre drinking Coffee , stop. Caffeine has a long half life so it doesn‚Äôt just go away. Diet pills often has stimulants like Caffeine, Yohimbine etc‚Ä¶ So if you‚Äôre taking them you‚Äôre going have to stop. Your anti-depressant might be causing insomnia as well. Like I mentioned above, try switching to another one. Don‚Äôt just switch to another SSRI if you‚Äôre already on one. Try switching to one of the ones I mentioned(Riluzole, Tianeptine). Common OTC sleep aids can cause insomnia too. Diphenhydramine(Benadry) is pretty common because it‚Äôs a cheap anti-histamine. What people don‚Äôt realize is that though, it‚Äôs also anti-cholinergic. So it blocks muscaranic Acetylcholine receptors. Blocking these sites will increase dopamine‚Ä¶ so you‚Äôll feel stimulated and not sleepy. People with depression often welcome this though since acetylcholine is increased in depressed people. Dextromethorphan is another drug that goes into sleep aids. It‚Äôs a NMDA blocker and it‚Äôs known to be an SSRI as well. So it might not be the best sleep aid as NMDA blockage can increase dopamine and SSR inhibition can increase ACTH and therefor stimulation.

## Circadian Rhythm Irregularities

With this, the first thing comes to mind is melatonin. If you work  a night shift. Try taking melatonin at the times you want to sleep so your body shifts your circadian rhythm. Also , you can try taking Mucuna Pruriens(contains L-Dopa) and 5-htp(Serotonin), when you first wake up. So you‚Äôre supporting your body‚Äôs own sleep cycle. Dopamine and Serotonin are the highest when you first wake up so it would be smart so support them both. Also consider taking Vitamin D with breakfast. Your body expects sun exposure upon waking ,so taking vitamin D could help mimic that. But having real sun exposure would obviously be the better choice here.


While I don‚Äôt have specific references for these, I don‚Äôt think I made any claims that are off the chart and most of my knowledge comes from reading studies and tests on NCBI anyway. Hope this helps someone that‚Äôs having a hard time sleeping! I'll be around to answer questions as much as I can! So ask away!

"
Insomnia suport group,"So I was thinking of starting a sort of thing where people with insomnia can talk to one another for help and support and so on at night when things are difficult. As some one who has been dealing with insomnia to some extent or another for about 9 years now I think something like this would be help full for people, myself included. Don't really know the logistics of this yet but if anyone's in or has any ideas just post it here. (about 4 am here now if I'm still up ill respond right away) "
"After years of guessing, I found something I think I might have","> Delayed sleep phase disorder (DSPD), also known as delayed sleep-wake phase disorder, is a chronic dysregulation of a person's circadian rhythm (biological clock), compared to the general population and relative to societal norms. The disorder affects the timing of sleep, peak period of alertness, the core body temperature rhythm, and hormonal and other daily cycles. People with DSPD generally fall asleep some hours after midnight and have difficulty waking up in the morning.

Can't sleep whenever i need to get up early,"Every time i have to get up early, or I plan to do so to get something done, the night before my sleep goes to shit. Most of the time i can't fall asleep at all until well into the morning, or i wake up every half hour or so. Today I went to bed at about 11PM, my alarm is set for 6am. was feeling very tired as well when i went to bed. now it's 2am and ive woken up for easily the 4th or 5th time and cant fall back asleep. I have no clue as to why this keeps happening but its pretty much guaranteed to. 
I dont really stress about it when i go to bed so that cant be it, must be something going on subconsciously. doesnt matter at what time i go to bed either or if im tired or not... this is completely fucking up my productivity during the day. Does anyone have an idea what i can do?"
No sleep 96 hours,This morning I am going 96 hours with no sleep. I have tried otc sleep medication and melatonin. My grasp on reality is slipping fast. I think I am going to get a ride to the emergency room. I am scared they won't be able to help. This has never happened to me before. It feels like my brain just won't shut off. I'm very scared.
Anyone else finally get a proper nights sleep only to wake up feeling shittier than if they hadn't slept at all?,It happens to quite often where I'll fall asleep quickly and stay asleep for a good 7-8 hours and then wake up feeling absolutely horrible and then just feel heavy and awful for the rest of the day.
Worked a 17 Hour day. Got home at 4 am excited for sleep. Guess what?,"I'm an MSEE grad student with insomnia (duh). I was looking forward to hopefully falling immediately asleep after a rough, long day, but my troll brain strikes again.

Anticipation of another night of poor sleep: self-fulfilling prophesy,"I dealt with difficult a year of tinnitus that produced anxiety which made sleep difficult. The tinnitus has since settled down but for the last 6 months as soon as my head hits the pillow, my heart starts pounding and I have a hard time getting to sleep or staying asleep. My brain is anticipating another night of poor sleep and it turns into a self-fulfilling prophesy.

I feel like i'm not in control of my brain, my brain is in control of me. How do I snap out of this cycle? 

My sleep hygiene and bedtime routine are as close to perfect as I can get it. "
hotline to talk about why you can't sleep,"In the summer during a bout of insomnia I realized how much it helped me to talk about why I couldn't sleep. So, I started a project where people could call a voicemail and leave messages about what keeps them up at night. I animate these messages using public domain footage from the Prelinger Archives.

"Insomnia drains me of all energy, motivation, and everything I need to succeed in life.","On school nights - all but Friday and Saturday night, with rare exception - I suffer from maintenance insomnia, and often fail to fall asleep initially within 30 minutes. The result when I wake up is a lack of energy throughout the day, poor school performance, and not enough motivation to do much when I get home but movies, TV, Reddit, and sometimes reading. I just feel like I don't have the mental capacity to push myself to do homework, which does provide me with a great of anxiety, which fuels my insomnia. The positive feedback loop only makes my week worse and worse until I sleep well on Friday night, and Saturday night. Upon waking up on Saturday and Sunday I've found that I have a great deal of energy, unlike the week days, and so I want to use all this energy to have fun, since I never have any real fun during the week anyways. It's almost as if I only have 2 full days in a 7-day week, and I'm pretty horrible at time management as it is. I don't know how to start solving my problem, and it's senior year so unless I get my shit figured out I'll be fucked for college next year (which I'm not even sure I want/ will be able to survive). Thanks for any and all help, it's very much appreciated."
"Serious question: can someone actually describe to me what it means to ""sleep""? I get a few hours of something in each night, but I don't think it's sleep.","My husband will close his eyes any time, any place, and be snoring within 1 minute.  If I'm absolutely *exhausted* it may take me an hour to drop off -- typically it takes 3-4 hours and that's on what is double the normal dose of prescription sleep meds.  If I'm lucky, I'll get as much as 5 hours in -- typically closer to 4, then wide awake or fitfully sleeping for another 4 hours till I drag myself out of bed (not nightmares, but very vivid, stressful dreams).  

I haven't had a decent night's sleep since I was 11 -- I'm going to be 58 soon.  I was in my 30's before finally going for prescription sleep aids (name a brand, I've tried it).  I've also tried every OTC remedy, yoga, meditation, breathing, music, books on tape...name it, I've done it.  At one point I was seeing a sleep specialist, and I *have* had a sleep study done (I do have sleep apnea and no, the CPAP didn't help at all).  Sleeping is literally something I cannot do, or at least it feels that way.

I take my meds, I read, I try doing all the right things and even if my body and brain are telling me I'm exhausted, the second I close my eyes my mind starts wandering and racing and I can't get it to STFU.  Is it mind over matter?  Is that how people fall asleep?  They're just able to shut off their brains?  Seriously, how does one even do that?  

I know everyone here is as frustrated as I am and I guess I'm just venting.  Thanks for listening and for any insight."
Can i bitch about my insomnia on this subreddit?,"Well I guess we'll find out. Ive delt with it all my life. There's no specific pattern to it. Ive tried everything from warm milk to medication and i don't think medication is good to be dependant on for sleep so I don't take it. I work out a lot, still cant sleep. If I feel stressed, if something is bothering me. I can't sleep. If nothing is currently wrong and have no real complaints, I can't sleep. I'm just used to being tired. 20 years of this and I just gave up on trying to treat it with anything more than setting my alarm for 7-8 am unless I work early in the mornings, then it's 5am. Its almost 1. Here and if I'm still awake by 4, I'm just making breakfast and having my coffee like usual."
Meditation helped me,"Haven't been on this sub in a while. As i've been sleeping well for a while. But thought i'd post to say that meditation REALLY helped me with sleeping. Even if I didn't do it right before bed (which I did, and would recommend if you have insomnia) Now I just do it during the day, and because I am generally relaxed enough during the day, at night I sleep like a baby.

Don't just do it a few times then give up. It takes a long time to quieten down the general stress in the body and mind. If you can go to a local class which will keep you motivated. Or make a promise to try it everyday for 30 days.

Good luck. "
"Dear 3 AM, we have got to stop meeting this way!",Damn that cup of coffee I had earlier today. I knew better! üò£ ...wasn't even good.
I've discovered what's wrong with me..,"I've tried all the tips and tricks, all the drugs and supplements, anything a doctor or a therapist or a naturpath can think of, I've tried. I finally came to the conclusion that nothing is wrong with me this is just the way I am. I don't function on a normal 24 hour cycle. I took a couple weeks of work and ran an experiment on myself. I stayed up ignoring the time and only went to bed when I was sleepy. Turns out I'm on a bit closer to a 32 hour long cycle. I can stay awake for 22 hours, but then I need about 10 hours of sleep. I need 10 hours of sleep regardless of how much I stay awake and I need 22 hours of awake time regardless of how much sleep I get. I feel optimal at that point even though I'm not anywhere close to being on a normal schedule living like that.

I realized this might just be how I am after a conversation with my psychiatrist. I told him that I stopped trying to suppress my fidgeting and I feel much less anxious because of it and he said that sometimes you just need to realize how your brain is wired and work with it rather than against it. So I measured it, my circadian cycle is about 32 hours long. If I accept that and find a way to make it work in today's Society, then I'll be happy."
I recommend using a sleep mask.,"It's not a cure all, but it helps. I started using one while I was working on a cruise ship. It was 14 hour days, and eventually I would get so tired I would try to sleep during any spare time I had. Unfortunately I had room mates who would work different shifts and come and go turning the lights on and off. The mask was originally just for the light, but I started to develop a Pavlov-like effect where just putting it on, my body and mind would start to prepare for sleep. I have a cheap $2 one from walmart, and it has been working fine, but I'm going to try and get the nicer $8 from amazon and see if it works better."
"Awake as fuck when needing to sleep, tired as fuck when needing to wake.","Really hope this is some karma for fucked up shit done in a previous lifetime.

I have to be at work in 3 hours, been up for 24 hours now. 

Love knowing that disease is probably just festering in my body because it doesn't know how to do its fucking job. 

Love knowing that my performance will be hindered because of it.

Love knowing that I'll be living with my parents and working in a grocery store forever because I can't figure out how to get a sleep routine on track.

Love knowing that no medical professionals can help, and that I was just born biologically fucked. I guess we all have to experience some types of suffering in our lives, but shit, having no ability to escape from it for 8 hours each night really seems to mimic a biblical hell."

"Over 100 hours without sleep, my thoughts and experiences","First of all I don't know why I can't sleep, I go to bed but it just won't happen. I lay there for hours and eventually see the sun come up. I've tried 8 different sleeping pills and they all don't help. Some of these problems might not be from insomnia but I've only experienced them since I started having major troubles sleeping. At the moment if I had one sleepless night every 2 nights I would consider that good, I've had a lot of back to back sleepless nights lasting 2-3 days and if I do sleep it's only 4hrs max. 

I'm coming up on the fifth night without sleep so I thought I'd share how I'm feeling 

- my eyes are so dark that I can notice it in group photos. Up close it looks like I've been punched out and have black eyes 
- I'm having huge troubles conversing with people, I have to ask them to repeat what they're saying over and over because it just sounds like noises not even words. 
- I've started hallucinating pretty bad, if I'm laying down with my eyes closed I can't tell which way is up. 
- my body is constantly hurting, most of the time it's a muscular pain but a lot of the time it will also be a stabbing of aching pain that I can't explain why
- I'm always going through some kind of painful experience. Like if I'm swimming I'll chafe really badly or I'll just be walking down the street and my back feels like it's burning and it feels unbearable. I also have lots and lots of headaches. 
- my body and face especially has gone really really pale despite spending a lot of time in the sun. 
- can become extremely irritated at everything

Some of these things happen all of the time and some not so often

Why I Enjoy Insomnia,"I'm currently self-employed as an artist/freelance-animator, which requires me to be constantly creative just to make money. I always find that after a night of little to no sleep, the coffee or energy drink the next morning supercharges my creativity, but my best ideas come sitting at my desk in the early morning, letting my brain freewheel in strange places. However, the downside is that my personality has changed, making me a little darker, which reflected in my art. Also, I occasionally lose control of my temper, and more often my humor goes nuts. Fortunately, artists are generally accepted as being crazy, so my friends cope with it. All in all, I'm enjoying sleeplessness, so yah."

I sleep better when I'm depressed,"Hello,

It's 2 AM and I can't fall asleep though I really tried. I should be up by 6:30 which leaves me with 4 hours of sleep at best or avoiding school tommorow which might lead to me getting kicked out eventually but I'd rather sleep for as long as I can so I am able to function for a longer period of time (and I had some issues with probably?? a low blood pressure yesterday and I almost passed out and it's more likely to happen when I am sleep deprived and I don't want to feel like that tommorow).

While trying to fall asleep, I found out there might be a pattern in my sleeping habits. When I am depressed, I usually feel numb and I have no problems to fall asleep unless I'm very anxious but that's rare when I am in the depression state. But when I feel okay, maybe even too excited and hype for no reason, I can't fall asleep if my life depended on it. Like now.

Does anyone else have a similiar experience? I just mostly need to vent."

Seizures caused by lack of sleep?,"My boyfriend has been struggling with his sleep for a few months now, and takes melatonin almost every night. This past Thursday he hadn‚Äôt slept at all for two nights, and had a seizure which caused him to fall down a flight of stairs. He suffered a severe concussion and dislocated his shoulder, but the doctor said he should recover just fine. They did a CT in the emergency room and didn‚Äôt find anything abnormal, but he‚Äôs set to follow up with a neurologist in a few days. 

This is the second time that he‚Äôs had a seizure like this - the first one happened in January 2018 under similar circumstances (lack of sleep, extreme exhaustion). I‚Äôm curious if anyone else has ever experienced something like this. "
Sleeping every 2 days?,"I've dealt with insomnia all my life and I've had plenty of all nighters but lately I only feel the need to sleep every two days. I'm always awake for exactly 36  hours before I sleep in for 9-12 hours. I was prescribed Ambien and took it for a week straight, it didn't do a thing. Didn't even make me sleepy. I've also tried over the counter sleeping pills and NyQuil.   It happened gradually over time, the all nighters got closer together. I even stopped drinking caffeine for a week and it didn't make a difference. Has anyone else experienced this? It's been going for about a month like this now and the only thing I noticed is that my eyes are a little dryer than usual. 

EDIT: I should add that I have unusual sleep anyway. I think it's sleep paralysis because sometimes when I'm falling asleep or waking up, I'm aware but not awake and I can't respond. I've had few night terrors but never like anything I've heard of sleep paralysis. There are times I enter a dream the minute I close my eyes, or at least within 10 minutes or so. If I can't fall asleep after the first hour of laying down, I know I'm not going to sleep anytime soon. If I get lucky and I'm able to go to bed early, I'll wake up a few hours later feeling slow and groggy with a headache. My most active hours are between 3-6AM and 9-12PM. I can actually feel myself snapping from being tired enough to sleep to completely awake. It's like a cold wind hits my face. 

Sorry for the long post! "

I got my diffuser from TJ Maxx an I got a essential oil box kit from Relax 6 at local vitamin shoppe really not expensive investment. 

I purposely have not used use it some days to see if it is just a placebo effect I had going on but not at all. Sometimes I remember my dreams when I wake up but for the most part I don‚Äôt remember them they don‚Äôt make any sense anyways just random whatever the brain wants to do but this has really helped my night time anxiety/overthinking for sure!

My insomnia had gotten to the worse point ever I made a post about how long have you stayed up straight before anyways after this episode I was like I have to try something new so I gave this a shot and I responded very well to it. Also I have been taking full spectrum CBD gel pill in the morning with first meal along with my multi vitamin maybe that built up in my system along with this? Anyways I sleep really good these days and I‚Äôm giving the credit to my aromatherapy."
Has anyone tried the Calm app?,"For those who aren‚Äôt familiar: There‚Äôs an app called Calm that‚Äôs supposed to help with relaxation, getting to sleep, and also meditating. They have ‚Äúsleep stories‚Äù which have basically boring but chill short stories read by people with soothing voices. It‚Äôs also got the standard sounds you‚Äôd find on a sound machine (ocean, thunderstorm, rain, etc.) It has breathing exercises which seem nice to relax. And if you‚Äôre into meditating they‚Äôve got a LOT of content on that.

I‚Äôm asking because the app costs 80 DOLLARS which is ridiculous!! I‚Äôm on the 7 day free trial, and I do have to say that when I was listening to the Bob Ross sleep story last night I knocked out pretty quickly, and their breathing thing is cool. The other stuff I don‚Äôt find useful, personally speaking. Any thoughts for those who have tried/use it? Is it worth that insane amount of money? Has it helped you with sleep at all?"
"Trying CBD oil, hopefully it works","Update: So, after I went to bed around 11, I pretty much slept for a few hours, then woke up around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning, just kind of tossing and turning and occasionally falling into light sleep. It might not have worked for me as good because I only took half the amount of dosage, because I was already tired. That could be an explanation, so I will try full dosage this weekend when I don't have to wake up at a certain time. This week however, I will try half a dosage with melatonin about 15 minutes after taking the cbd oil. "
Shit sleeping quality,"I haven't been going nights without sleep like I used to, but my sleep quality is so Shit. I get almost no deep sleep,  just in and out of dreams,  waking up half a dozen times a night. But Benzos seem to help but I know I will get hooked and I have to take twice the reccomended dose. I suffer from anxiety and depression,  also suffer from excessive daytime sleepiness,  but I can't nap,  I'm too hyper. Last night I had a dream and then realized I was dreaming, and I could control what I was doing in the dream, but couldnt change the parameters or the dream itself,  I also couldn't wake up. I feel like I was dreaming about lucid dreams without actually being lucid, really crazy shit, any suggestions on how I can get deeper Sleep with out this waking consciousness type of sleep.  I think it has to my anxiety around sleep but I feel like I can't change that.  Pls help I just want to be put in a coma type sleep"
I may have a tip or two for fellow people with Insomnia. Allot may has been said in the past.,"As we know insomnia is a pretty harsh thing to put up with. I have pretty horrible  time sleeping myself. 

Last night I had around 3- 3 and half hours of sleep (Note I have done much worse its a nightmare) at the most, so take my tips with a grain of salt.  I have a feeling I won't get much sleep tonight either.

Anyway, I'm typing this at 2:00am, so please bare with me. 
Have a routine: I know this is easier said than done, as I usually try and fall asleep between 12-1 in the morning and wake up around 7-8. 
If you have anxiety or mind is on overclock 24/7 (Like mine) :

Write your feeling down on paper, this has helped me in the past a few times.  You can shred it or throw it out afterwards if you're not comfortable with having it around the house.  (it can be embarrassing) 

Watch your favourite youtuber through the night- this will help take your mind off things, mind numbing content is 100 times better than  overthinking things that has happened through the day. ( I know that is rich coming from me) 

You'd be suprised how good reading is through the day, however resist the urge to nap, sometimes in the past this has stuffed my sleeping pattern up. 

I have a strong issue with not taking my own advice, so as mentioned above take this with a grain of salt. I hope this will help you in the future.  I do apologise if all has been said in previous post in the past. Sigh, I have a feeling  won't be sleeping to great tonight. Best of luck Reddit!

This is my first ever thread on Reddit, I usually just comment. Hopefully it formats okay.

Insomnia tied to Stress and Eating Issues,"I have struggled with insomnia due to stress related to academics for several years now. Currently, it is my senior year in college and I am fed up. The past few weeks, I have been crashing during the day with one to two hour naps and not sleeping at night. The only thing that‚Äôs been keeping me awake is coffee and eating excessive amounts, which triggers my anxiety due to feeling unhealthy and unhappy, and my insomnia worsens. 
I don‚Äôt know what to do, and not sleeping makes my academic performance worse.
I have tried to seek out therapy at my school, but they have not returned my requests to schedule an appointment. "
Falling asleep faster in the daytime rather than night,"When I want to take a nap, I fall asleep pretty fast (20 min max). But at night it takes much more, like 2 hours per average.

Why all of these happen?"
"Had a nightmare that I ""noped"" right out of. Now I'm up after three hours of sleep.",I was going to sleep at least another two hours depending on my kiddo. But I got caught in a nightmare and now I'm so tired. And so awake. Just had to share with someone.
Insomnia coupled with manic state and other complications,"Hello I‚Äôve been wanting to post this for some time now. Just to see who can relate to a very specific form of insomnia that seems worse than the ‚Äòtextbook‚Äô case, and maybe some empathy about the situation. 

When insomnia hits me, twice in my life, it hits extremely hard. Like four to six nights with only about 2 hours of sleep. Both times it was during college and grad school respectively. I‚Äôve had to leave everything behind and head home to recuperate. Because after a few days without sleep, my brain becomes near manic, panicking constantly, and nothing can bring it calm. Every night I lay there and cannot sleep, in the daytime I can barely function as I just lay there thinking what the hell is wrong with me.

During these two periods, always lasting 2-3 months, life is almost impossible. I had to rely on my parents heavily to get anything done. The usual sleep medications and supplements don‚Äôt do a single thing. They actually make me wake up with a jolt and make me very agitated. So life is a continual hell. Can‚Äôt watch TV, read a book, do normal things because my mind is on another planet freaking out. Some doctors call it mania others anxiety. I call it mindless despair.

Just asking my fellow insomniacs if they‚Äôve experienced similar intense episodes, where they had to pause their life. After months of a cocktail of medications, and somehow letting go of the stress, and having my parents help me, sleep slowly came back.  Very slowly, and I can never sleep as well as before these episodes. I always awake with a jolt.

Besides the mental issues, some other things I noticed were a decrease in intelligence and creativity still lingering today, a dismal sense of helplessness, flat emotions, and unresponsive organs (namely my GI tract and other things were extremely slow. I thought that lack of sleep was slowly killing my organs functions).  Is there anything I can do to prevent this sort of thing from happening again. I don‚Äôt think I can survive a third ordeal.  Thank you my fellow insomniacs. May we somehow persevere."
Is anyone else experiencing memory loss?,"I‚Äôve had insomnia for about 8 years now and i feel i forget basic things, like i‚Äôm thinking of something i have to do, within 1 min i forget about it. Does anyone experience this?

Haven't slept and forced to go to a party,"This subreddit is my people, if I belong to any group in the world this sub reddit is it

Now let's get to the point point
I'm forced to go to a big family gathering in an hour, I was told to dress up, wear makeup and look pleasant, but because I did not sleep well in the past week, I feel and look like a zombie, my head hurts and I have no facial expressions, I look awful.
I also have to smile and be polite and be alert, how am I supposed to do that??
I will not have fun and neither the people who are looking/interacting with me, I can't focus, all what I can do is stare at them
Insomnia ruined my life, they no longer accept ""I'm really tired, I can't go"", so I have to go if I want people in my life, I don't want to be lonely. 
I'm controlled by my unconscious mind which I can't figure out, why is my unconscious mind strong and what does it want from me? Or is it my conscious mind that is strong?

Falling asleep with adrenaline rushes,"Hello üëã my first time posting here 
Over the past few years I have been having troubles going to sleep. It is almost like as soon as I get close to tipping over the edge into dreamland I get a sudden woosh of adrenaline. Every night my body will tense up and I get that familiar feeling of anxiety ripping through my chest and stomach as well as a marathon of racing thoughts. I‚Äôm taking 200 mg Zoloft and Ativan. I do stretches and breathing exercises too. I‚Äôm at a loss, I feel my whole world crumbling away. "
Anyone else?,"Anyone else lay there for hours trying to sleep, get frustrated and angry, start crying and give up?"
Thoughts or experience with weighted blankets?,"Weighted blankets are heavy blankets, usually weighing 10-12% of your body weight. They've been used for years to help children and adults with sleeping problems. The weight or pressure of the blanket helps calm the sleeper. The sensation created is likened to being held or hugged to sleep.

Has anyone here used a weighted blanket and found that it helps you sleep better? Can you please share your experience?

Also, what brands and fillings are good? Some have different fillings like plastic beads, glass marbles, or cotton. "
Might Help - Touch the Sun for 10 minutes in the morning,"To get your schedule back on track, it has really helped to get out in the sun in the morning.

Don't want to go to bed. Is that Insomnia or something else?,I'm not really sure if I classify as having insomnia but am often up till 4-5 am. I suffer with anxiety and I just don't want to go to bed so I put it off until I am ridiculously exhausted. I know I should try to sleep better but I just don't have the will power to make myself go to bed early. I want to be able to have a good sleeping routine but when it comes down to it I just cant make myself go to bed. Is this Insomnia or just a symptom of anxiety or something? 
My body has just accepted that its fine with 3-4 hours of sleep.,"I don't even feel tired anymore throughout the day. My energy levels are always up and I am getting stuff done despite only 3-4 hours of sleep every night .

Has my brain and body just somehow adapted/resigned  to the fact that I am going to be sleeping only for 3-4 hours ? 

I am just worried that there may be long term effects of this even though I feel nothing right now.  

I just don't know if I should keep trying to get longer sleep or just let go and not even think about it. :/"
Do y'all dread the birds?,"I'm on day 3 of my sleepless extravaganza, and it's currently 4:30 am here, which means that I shall be hearing them *very* soon. I can feel the world waking up and all I really want to do is drift off. Ahh and there they are, like clockwork, before I even finish this godforsaken post. 

When it's not the wee hours, I adore birds, but right now, I'm wondering just how Hitchcock managed to unintentionally capture my animosity towards them with such poignant symbolism so many years before I was born. Anybody have thoughts, similarly disdainful or otherwise, on these dreaded harbingers of the sun?"
Body says to sleep yet your brain disagrees.,"Im on multiple safe drugs. Tylenol 3 and ibuprofen for sciatica... amitryptaline to help me sleep and propranolol for anxiety... for the last 4 nights ive had bare minimum sleep.. my eyelids are heavy but my mind is racing... will i wake up in time to go to this family event? Oh fuck its 1am why am i up... fuck fuck fuck its 2am shit...etc until morning

Amitryptaline knocks me out but i think its not working anymore..

My hearts racibg every time i close my eyes and i fear of sleep starts

If it was up to me id take more pills but i feel like that might be a problem... or atleast THE problem here

I have an underbite and calculus build up so whenever i kinda drift off. bam falling sensation and my jaw clamps shut... grinding my top and bottom fron teeth together and give me a 5 minute panic attack... i check my teeth... yup still there... cry then wait for pill effects to ckme back

Hesitant to go to sleep even though I‚Äôm exhausted... anyone relate?,"My eyes are hurting from being open and I‚Äôm too tired to even watch a new episode of my favorite show. And yet, I‚Äôm in bed, on my phone, instead of laying down and closing my eyes to sleep. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôm afraid of the moments laying there, before I fall asleep. 

Makes no sense. I‚Äôm tired but reluctant to attempt sleeping. Does this resonate with anyone at all?

Scarred by past experiences to the point where I file them away under ‚Äúnever‚Äù and just block them out, at my expense. "
Benzos or feel miserable every damn day?,"While I would never advocate that anyone use drugs to treat their insomnia I have found incredible relief from benzos/RC's.
These chems are addictive and you will build a tolerance to them with repeated usage yet for the occasional night when you really need to get some sleep they work like a charm. Etizolam has a short half life and won't give you a morning hangover but may not give you a full nights sleep either. Flualprazolam is much longer acting and can provide a full nights sleep but does cause morning drowsiness. Neither of these chems is scheduled nationwide yet. Google them for more info. For those who have found no solution to relieve their insomnia these two could be of immense help if self control is not also an issue. I do not sell these chems nor provide info on acquiring them. I am only sharing info as a starting point for you to pursue should you choose to."
Insomnia Club,"I‚Äôve always had this idea for opening a club for insomniacs. 

No music, no dance floor, just lots of tables with stuff to rearrange and books to flip through. 

Food would be served, lots of fruit that would be ignored as the chocolate would be behind it. 

Conversation would be frowned upon until dawn where a, mumbled, ‚ÄòSee you tomorrow‚Äô would be permitted. 

Dress code would be pjs...

Insomnia is severe - I have terrible anxiety and OCD. Please help me. I feel hopeless.,"I can‚Äôt take this anymore.  I have terrible OCD and anxiety and it is greatly affecting my sleep.  About 2 months ago I was averaging 2 hours of sleep a night, then was ok for about 6 weeks.  The insomnia is coming back and it‚Äôs worse.  Last night I didn‚Äôt get any sleep at all.  I laid there for hours all night, trying to relax, trying so hard to just let myself fall asleep.  No avail.  Every time I felt I may have been dozing off my body jerked awake and even though I wasn‚Äôt sleeping, it was like I was still dreaming because I was so tired.  This is destroying my life.  The intrusive thoughts mixed with insomnia is just too much.  What can I do?  I‚Äôm forcing myself to come to work but can‚Äôt focus at all.  I‚Äôm so afraid this will kill me if I don‚Äôt get sleep.  I have a wonderful boyfriend who I‚Äôm getting married to next year and I don‚Äôt know what to do...I want us to have a happy life together and this stress and insomnia is interfering with my everyday life.  I fear going to bed.  My doctor put me on Prozac and also a mix of melatonin and Unisom to take before bed.  Last night was the first night I took everything, is there maybe a reason to why I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all?  I‚Äôm so scared.  I feel hopeless.  Please, someone help me.  I want to be normal again."
The Insomniac Life,"It‚Äôs 1 am. I feel sleep anxiety for some reason. Took my emergency sleep aids. Nothing. The life of the insomniac is not knowing when you‚Äôre going to have a bad night or knowing every night is a bad night.

Its weird to have experienced so many types of sleep problems,"Sleep onset insomnia. Maintenance insomnia. Interruption insomnia. Exploding head Syndrome. Sleep paralysis. Night terrors.

One of the strangest ones is the explosions head Syndrome. Hearing loud bangs or high pitched sounds just before falling asleep. Really vexing"

Why do I sleep bad at night but great during the day?,"I have had this problem for years, but I basically I fall asleep easy every night but start waking up constantly and have a general feeling of uneasy or anxiety in the middle of the night. I often get repetitive things stuck in my mind at night (math or coding a lot during the day are big triggers for this). 

After the night has gone by, about 9-10 hours bring in bed, I suddenly feel way more relaxed and fall asleep good, but typically it's too late to stay in bed because of life. 

I started liquid melatonin 3mg each night and it worked great for feeling more energy during the day and feeling better when I wake up, but somehow it stopped working after 1 week.

Notably, I also sleep much better at any time of the day than at night, especially in the afternoon when I can take a 2 hour nap and then feel incredibly happiest and more rested. 

Why does my mind have to suck at relaxing and sleeping only during the night time?"
Free CBT-I resources,"https://shcs.ucdavis.edu/wellness/conquering-insomnia

Hey there fellow insomniacs, I found this website which contains some free cbt-i information.  I believe the program is based off the same authors that wrote *Say Goodnight to Insomnia*.  The website includes 6 sessions with PDF and audio files.  I don't know if this has been posted before, but it can't hurt to repost helpful material."
"2 hours from now, I will have reached the 4 day mark with zero sleep","Well, the title is pretty self explanatory. I have never gone this long without sleep, I think went 3 days without sleep a couple weeks ago though m

Anyone have any experiences to share from times they‚Äôve been at or near the 4-day mark in the past? 

So far, here is how I feel:

- I seem to be hitting ‚Äúcycles‚Äù every 2-3 hours where I alternate from modest sleepiness to being completely alert
- I go thru short phases where I see streaks of light out of the corners of my eyes, or even streaks of very fine mist in the air 
- definitely seeing shadows that either don‚Äôt exist or just seem ultra accentuates because my senses are kicking in to overdrive to overcompensate
- in fact, I‚Äôm also noticing my hearing is much more sensitive than usual. I find myself jolting up whenever a tiny piece of degree blowing in the wind lands on the ground within a few feet of me
- body feels a bit tight, especially my back. Probly cuz I‚Äôve been sitting in an office chair for so many hours
- pain sensitivity seems elevated. Nothing major though. I‚Äôm also more sensitive to the cold.. outside smoking a cig in the cool air of San Francisco 
- heart rate seems fine. I‚Äôm not jittery or uncomfortable. Kind of relaxed actually

Walk in the nature,"I had a lot problems with sleeping last week, and this Saturday i went out, and just walked in forest for whole day.

And boom, slept like 10h that night.

The nature is calming + walking a lot exhausts you."
"Going into my third night of sleeplessness, feeling very lonely and afraid.","Genuinely scared, I'm actually shaking slightly, this is becoming like my own personal torture and I don't know what I should do.

It's easier for me to come online and rant than lay my head down and confront the flooding of anxiety I seem to be met with trying to sleep, it's somewhat overwhelming me.

I feel like I'm slowly going insane with this and that it's impossible for me to make sense of this right now....

UPDATE- slept 8-9 hours last night, and about 5 hours in broken segments the night before. I'm in the clear for now. Really hope I don't have to return ;)"
Insomnia Causing Frustration Causing Insomnia,"What do you advise for not being able to sleep and getting frustrated with it, and then having that frustration mount up an up so that you definitely can't sleep. I do all the things suggested like reading a book or doing something else when I can't fall asleep but while I'm doing that, my frustrated goes higher and higher until I get a nervous breakdown. What can I do to stop this?"
Slept like a fucking rock! (had to work myself to near exhaustion though),"For the first time in maybe this entire year. I slept like an absolute rock last night! from 10p.m to 8a.m almost without interruption.  


I think it‚Äôs because i did a double shift yesterday at my job and worked from 10a.m-8p.m, so almost as soon as i got home i crashed. 

I hate that i have to almost over extend my body just to get a good nights rest but hey, that sleep was nice. 

But it‚Äôs also depressing because usually i get 2-4 hours of sleep and i wake up irritated, groggy etc..., *THIS MORNING* though i jumped right out of bed , felt rested and felt great. It‚Äôs depressing because i know i‚Äôll probably not feel this great after a sleep for a long time but man it was worth it. 

I really feel amazing.!

Banana tea for sleep.,"For the past few weeks I've been getting very little sleep. I'm on medication that supposed to help you sleep but it doesn't help much. I mentioned to a co-worker that I've tried a lot of things and nothing has really worked. He told me I should try boiling a unpeeled banana and drink the water and try to eat the banana. I didn't believe him till I searched it and watched a couple YouTube videos, it actually is real.

I use a snore app to kind of monitor my sleep and the results usually are depressing with little sleep. After trying banana tea my sleep results were a lot better.

I cut the ends off and cut it in half because the pot was small. I used around two cups of water and waited for it to boil, then set the timer for ten minutes and put the banana in the pot.

They say to eat the banana as well as drinking the tea, but I couldn't eat the banana, it had a weird mushy asparagus taste and cinnamon didn't help. The tea however was easy to drink once it cooled down, I did use a little cinnamon and honey to make it have some taste.

You should really try it if you have a banana and are having a tough time finding something to put you out."
"after 11 years of insomnia, i cant take much more","I'm a 34 year old Irishman who has suffered with insomnia for 11 years. It started suddenly - 11 years ago I just stop sleeping properly. There was no event that triggered it - I had a summer job as a house painter and suddenly went 2 nights with no sleep. Since those 2 nights, I've only had a week here and a week there where I've slept well. The vast majority of the time, I struggle. 

I tried sleeping pills years ago and these worked, but I got hopelessly addicted for 3 and a half years (even faking prescriptions) and ended up in rehab for 28 days. I haven't taken a sleeping pill for 7 years now. 

I've worked as a software engineer for most of this time. It's been a real struggle to work while sleeping so little, but I normally manage. About 12 months ago I started to wear blue-light blocking glasses in the evening. These had an extraordinary effect - I suddenly went from 4 hours restless sleep to 6 hours deep sleep. It was beautiful and I thought I'd finally cracked it. However, this only lasted about 3 months and slowly but surely I started to have problems again. By the way, I usually have no problems getting to sleep - I pass out within 10 minutes most nights. However I get a very shallow restless sleep, and wake up every 90 minutes. It can take anything from 5 minutes to 3 hours to get back to sleep. After nights like this, the next day I have headaches, concentration issues and deep depression. Over the last 7 months, things have gotten worse. I had to quit my job and, as a result of my bad mood, irritability and deep depression brought on by night after night of broken sleep, my long term girlfriend broke up with me. As we shared an apartment, I had to move out and move 2 hours away back into my parents house. I was angry but I realise she had to move on with her life and I was holding her back. She showed incredible pateince with me for 4 years but my situation eventually broke her. 

Currently I'm living at home with my parents in an isolated area. I have no friends around here. I have good friends back in the city and we meet occassionally but their patience is wearing thin too - I'm constatly cancelling plans to visit due to another poor night's sleep and the subsequent headaches and depression that ensues. 

I have tried an awful lot of things and I live quite a strict healthy lifestyle: I eat very well (unprocessed foods only), I force myself to run every 2 or 3 days (I even regularly win 5km and 10km races), I have a low heart rate, low blood pressure, low cholesterol. Basically, I've never been fitter and when I go to the doctor, I pass all tests with flying colours. I practice CBT and also sleep restriction therapy where I only stay in bed for 6 hours each night. I also have practiced vipassanna mediatation on and off for years. I'm currently doing it fo 2 hours per day and this is a help - I sometimes feel moments of bliss brought on by deep concentration I have achieved. But still, I cannot stay asleep, or get into a deep sleep (I've tried all OTC pills - melatonin etc and have found them to be no help). 

A few years ago I did a sleep test - it showed I hd 88 'mini arousals' during the night (I only slept for 3 hours so that's 88 in 3 hours). They ruled out sleep apnea and didn't know why I was waking up so much.

One other thing worth mentioning is that 4 months ago I got teeth braces, top and bottom. This actually exacerbated my problem. I spoke to the dentist and he said in the thousands of patients he has treated, none have reported chronic insomnia as a consequence of braces. I'm not 100% if this has anything to do with my sleep issues since I had started to get worse 2/3 months before the braces. 

I've now reached the stage where I am contemplating suicide. I feel a complete burden on people - I was on my ex, and now I am on my elderly parents. I feel no sense of self-worth and have enormous envy for other people my age that can work, drink, have relationships, sleep well and be happy. Such simple things are now out of reach for me. I've had suicidal thoughts for years but I never seriously considered it until recently. Now I find myself planning exactly how I'll do it (I have access to a gun) and where (far from my home so my parents aren't the ones to find me). 

To be clear, I'm absolutely convinced I've arrived here because of chronic insomnia, not depression. The insomnia as brought on the deep depression and despair, not the other way around (I have tried various amti-depressents but none have helped me sleep and therefore the depression has remained).

I'm writing this post out of desperation and the hope that someone can suggest one more thing I can try just so I can get a regular nights sleep. I now truly feel like my options are fully exhausted, apart from one.



EDIT

Thank you everyone for such kind replies and suggestions. My plan is to commit fully to Sleep Restriction Therapy, starting with a 6 hour time-in-bed window. This is something I had moderate success with before, but I never committed to it for more than 10 days or so. I started it 2 nights ago and plan to see this through. I found an app called CBT-I Coach which is dedicated to SRT so I'm tracking everything with this. I'll post weekly updates here. Thanks everyone.



EDIT

Just to update people, I've have done 11 nights of SRT. I started out giving myself a 6 hours of time in bed - 11.15pm to 5.15 am. As my sleep efficiency was below 80% (i.e. I was awake at least 20% of the 6 hours in bed) I reduced to a 5 and a half hours of time in bed for the last 3 nights. My sleep efficiency is still below 80% so now I'm reducing to 5 hours time in bed - 11.30pm to 4.30am. I'm a very extreme case but shouldn't I have seen some progress after 11 nights?"
Sleep deprivation fucks up my entire day,"Whenever I don't get a satisfying sleep and I'm disturbed regularly throughout the night and don't go into deep restorative sleep it literally kills the person inside of me. Depression increases to a ridiculous degree and I cannot function or concentrate for the entire day. 

I know that coffee and sugar is no good for promoting healthy sleep but I can't seem to shake the habit.

Has anyone else had to abandon certain lifestyle habits in order to get the sleep they need?"
"There is currently a sleep expert (his words) Dr Michael Larson, doing an AMA over on /r/iama sub",You can find the thread here https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/6w6767/i_am_dr_michael_larson_inventor_entrepreneur/
"insomnia and anxiety, any tips would be appreciated","  I suffer from anxiety and a dissociate anxiety disorder. About five years ago I started work at a place that required me to wake up at 4am. I found myself unable to do fall asleep and spent the night tossing and turning trying to sleep for the first time in my life. After that I started to notice the fear of not sleeping creeping into every part of my life even when there was nothing to do the next day. 
 
  I left the job to study at a university but had to leave after two years due to my anxiety and insomnia reducing my ability to perform. 
 
  Now I have an obsessive loop of a self-fulfilling prophecy that constantly cycles because I fear not sleeping which makes my anxious mind that likes to grab hold of obsessive thoughts very tense and thus not able to turn off.
  
  I practice meditation, mindfulness and have completed courses in cognitive behavior therapy with therapists. I also take anxiety medications that help with my overall symptoms but still find my insomnia and the fear of no sleep to be the greatest challenge rivaled only by my dissociation.

  Any tips and help would be greatly appreciated. I know there must be a way to correct this thought pattern as I know I can sleep fine if it were not for the anxiety surrounding the act of sleep itself. It's a thought pattern I've thought myself into, so any help on helping my brain see it as simply that and not a legitimate threat would be nice, any repeated phrases or anything?

  "
I currently fall asleep at 5AM every morning.,"And then I wake up at around 1PM, still feeling so tired that I can hardly stand."
Anyone have experience with extreme insomnia ''attacks''?,"So, I will make this as short as possible. For about 3-4 years now I have had standard not-too-bad insomnia, which I can usually keep away by taking 15-22.5mg of zopiclone. But once every 1-2 months I get these extreme episodes where my brain kinda explodes with thoughts, and I just can't sleep at all. Pills won't work. Tried taking 70+mg of both zolpidem and zopiclone over the course of a night without effect, and have tried a buttload of different benzos as well. Once I reach 72+ hours without sleep, I drink till I pass out, and this usually ends the ''attack''. But it's not really a great way to deal with it. I was once set on riding one out without drinking, but after 120 or something hours without sleep I was checked into a psychiatric ward, because I was so delirious from fatique. Here are the things I have tried:

- Gym, Tea, Walking, Running, Reading(Not in bed), Sleep schedules, 30 minutes in bed and 30 out of bed, No bright light 1 hour before bedtime, other stuff.

- Numerous sleep ''specialists''

- Weed

- PSG sleep study

- Cognitive therapy

My therapist thinks I suffer from PTSD caused by some childhood stuff, but I strongly disagree, since I rarely think about stuff like that, and thinking about it doesn't make me sad at all. Every specialist I have been to haven't been able to tell me something I couldn't find online. Hopefully one of you guys have tried some weird shit that might work. I'm 22 by the way. Thx for reading."
DAE with insomnia generally also just hate sleeping?,"Honestly the mix of my completely awful sleep problems, and the fact that I feel like sleeping is a huge waste of time and not always enjoyable, I generallt hate sleeping. Sometimes I even dread sleeping when I do get tired, I just hate it. I wish I either didn't ever *need* sleep, or that I could sleep for unlimited amount of times (a year, a week, forever).

Anyone else have any of these feelings, or hate sleep due to reasons other then not being able to get it enough/at the right time?"
Can't sleep due to fear of organs moving / I feel the need to restrict my abdomen to sleep,"Hey guys I'm a 17 year old girl and since I was about 13 I've had this weird fear of my organs shifting around while i lay on my side. I feel as if laying on my side makes them ""flop over"" and all of my abdominal organs fall on top of each other. So i always sleep laying on my back usually with my arms crossed over my chest. I feel like laying flat on my back keeps everything in my body the way it should be. Also to sleep i have to wear underwear with a thick waistband and a pair of spandex shorts. That makes  me feel like everything in my belly is secure and strapped in. If i don't t have the correct underwear and shorts on or if i have to be on my side i start to panic and i feel like i cant breathe and my abdomen aches for restriction. lately it's gotten worse and worse and to the point where I'm up all night and resorting to sleeping sitting up. The past week I've tried out melatonin an hour before i fall asleep so that knocks me out a little earlier. But i don't want to always rely on that. This has been going on so long and I want to solve this problem. Even knowing that organs can't move in the way im imagining it doesn't help I still feel as though they are. Keep in mind that i am not overweight, I weigh 115lbs and i don't have any confidence issues or body image issues. I graduated high school last year and it's become worse and worse of a problem this past year. I still live with my parents and I've addressed it to my mom and she's the one who suggested melatonin but I really want to know if there is anyone else out there who struggles with this and if there is anyone who knows what could be wrong with me or give me advice. Thanks. "
"I can get sleepy reading a book, but then wide awake when I out it down to fall asleep","It's infuriating, as soon as I put it down it's like my brain is now free to worry about going to sleep which causes anxiety and therefore wakes itself up, yet I can't stop it."
It seems like people accept that blue light affects sleep but there may be more to it,"Recently I saw some stories published in various places about a study that suggested that camping could result in you falling asleep earlier and waking earlier, roughly in line with the sun. The participants didn't have any screens or even torches. It seemed like it was another study suggesting that blue-light was causing sleep problems.

As it happened I remembered that a similar study had been in the news before. Turns out the same people did both studies and there wasn't much new this time other than they did two tests, one in the summer and one in the winter.

Unlike the news stories, the study suggested that there might be other factors here. It wasn't just that the campers didn't have electric light at night but they also had high levels of day-light during the day.

The authors say that a lot of people don't get exposed to natural light during the day, working in windowless offices and going home to electric light. In this study the campers were outside most of the day and were more active as well. As a result they got not only natural light but a more intense light too. So, perhaps a lack of light is large factor in sleeplessness.

If the findings are correct, it raises other questions. How much light do we need during the day? How strong and for how long? Does colour temperature matter that much and if so could this be cured by enough of the right coloured bulbs during the day? If someone had enough light during the day, how much artificial light would be required to disrupt sleep.

Looking at my own history, it would certainly make sense. I grew up being a total early bird, I'd get up full of energy at 6:30 or 7. I spent most of my day outside or in a classroom not too far from a window. I'd watch TV late at night but it didn't seem to affect me, maybe because I'd go to bed and listen to the radio with the lights out or read a book. The opposite has been true since I started having sleep issues.

Recently I've been making some progress. I'm waking up at 9, more like 10, rather than 1 or 2pm, but it's not enough. For the last two days I've made sure that I get more light during the day. When I wake up I turn the bedroom lights on and I've made sure I've gone for walks during the day. On Saturday I woke up fairly easily, just before my 9am alarm, that I usually hit snooze on and go back to bed. On Sunday I woke up just after 8am and although I didn't get up for almost an hour it's a big improvement for me.

It's too early to know if there's any real change or if this is just a bit of luck but I thought I'd post this in case it helps someone else.

Edit: 
I've done a sleep diary for the days after I initially posted. Mainly for my own benefit but hopefully someone finds it interesting.

Day 3 - Last night I didn't get to sleep that early, might have been after midnight which I was disappointed about. Woke up this morning at 6:30! It was actually too early, usually if I wake up before I expect I try to go back to sleep and that's what I tried to do. I think I managed it but I woke up again, maybe 7:30 and finally got up at 8:00

Day 4 - Woke up at 7:30 and got straight up! A little groggy but not MUST-SLEEP groggy. It was 12/12:30 when I went to sleep. I'm also sleeping less too, so maybe my sleep is better?

Day 5- Same as yesterday. I'm worried that I'm not sleeping enough now. First woke up at 6:30. What's amazing is that last week I was concerned that while I was getting up at a semi-reasonable time it was 9/10 hrs after I went to sleep and I was still feeling sleepy.

Day 6- Decided to try to go to sleep an hour or so early. I think it worked except I woke up needing a pee! Fell asleep fairly quickly again. Woke up at 6:30 again and tried to get back to sleep, was only partially successful.

Day 8- Day 7 was much the same despite staying up late to watch TV with a cup of tea. Woke up at 5:15 on day 8 to notice my Hue light had come on then seemingly couldn't get back to sleep. Except the next time I looked at the clock it was 8:00. Think I was probably awake for an hour which might be why I woke up later.

Day 17 - Things continued well for a few days after this but unfortunately things have gone back to normal now. One reason might be that I got a bit complacent and one night I ate late and was on the computer later than I should have, might have had the lights on too. I believe the biggest difference was going back to work on Day 11. I work in the evening and I knew that I wouldn't be getting any early nights, in fact since Day 1 I've deliberately gone to bed at my usual time. However I work in quite a brightly lit environment and while I get about 2hrs of near darkness before bed it's probably enough to disrupt my sleep. 

This morning I woke up at 6-ish although it's hard to say how long I was awake for I definitely. fell asleep once. I wish there was some device that could tell when you were awake or not, I've got a fitbit but even if I shake my wrist or move it around, it might register as ""restless"" if I'm lucky. Short of electrodes I can't think of how you could register sleep vs eyes closed, perhaps some sort of phone app with a dead mans switch might work?"
"*blip blip* what's the time? Oh 7 am. Look it's morning already. Silly me, I thought I'd grab some sleep tonight. Wow, it's a beautiful day outside. birds are singing, flowers are blooming... on days like these, kids like me.... SHOULD BE BURNING IN INSOMNIA-HELL.",
A meditation technique which worked for me,"In my teen years I had moderate insomnia on a regular basis. This is a technique I invented which worked well for me. It's extremely difficult to describe but I will try my best, if it helps even one person it'll have been worth trying. 

In my head, I have two different ""voices"".

 My own voice which I am in total control of, the voice which is reading this out to you in your head. The voice you use when you try to talk yourself out of something, you know?

The second is what I can only describe as my ""stream of consciousness"". You know how when you begin to fall asleep, and you're in that in-between period where you're kinda dreaming but not totally unconscious? The second ""voice"" is basically that. Words, images, ideas which you are not making an effort to form, but which exist in your mind regardless. I learned how to tap into that voice while still fully awake. 

Here's how: I try my best to silence the first voice. Then I focus on the thoughts which remain. At the moment, I have a song stuck in my head so that's what remains. (note: this technique is much harder when your have an ""earworm"" like that) I silence that as well. Now all that is left is this kind of stream-of-consciousness which is very hard to describe. In my head, I ""hear"" a quiet voice speaking nonsense. Maybe it's just bits of conversations I had today, or voices from a show that I'm watching. But it's not anything coherent like the song stuck in my head. 

I do my best to focus on this voice. I listen to each word. If done correctly, it will feel like these words are flowing to you, they are not consciously being formed. Stay focused on these words. The words begin to form a kind of dreamscape, I begin to imagine strange visuals based on these words. I think this is how dreams begin. If I can stay focused, I will be hypnotized by this and begin dreaming. Sleep, hopefully, follows. 

I realize this will make no sense to 99.9% of people. I'm trying to describe the inner workings of my subconscious mind. I've never heard of this technique being used by anyone else, however I imagine that it is basically just a variation on a kind of meditation."
Missing classes due to insomnia - anyone else had this problem?,"Recently I've been struggling so badly.  I am an MSc student and it's got to the point where I have been up all night and eventually passed out about 6 or 7am which, if I am to be in class for 9am, is clearly no good.  I've missed two classes this way in the past week - I am at my wits end.  Apart from forcing myself to stay up all night, I honestly don't know what to do.  I also don't know whether to say something to my teachers.  It seems awful rude to just not show up, but saying 'Sorry I missed your class, I was asleep' sounds so shitty an excuse.  I feel so miserable, missing class, I can barely study because I am so exhausted.  Feel like I'm going crazy. 

I guess I don't have a specific question other than have you ever been in this situation, did you say anything, what happened etc.  

Thanks and commiserations to all you insomniacs out there."
I feel like insomnia is slowly driving me insane,"Since my meds no longer work, and ativan makes me sleep through my alarms, I have to go unmedicated for now. I'm waiting to go to the sleep clinic, could be up to a month. I feel like I'm going insane, I'm always tired but actually sleeping is hard as hell, and I often feel wide awake when I'm trying to sleep. I'm averaging about 4-5 hours sleep each night. I can never get comfortable and going to bed had just become dreadful. The bed I used to love and struggled to leave has become uncomfortable and kinda depressing. And I can't even use sleep as an escape or a way to skip time anymore, and I god do I need that. Sometimes I honestly feel like I'd rather just die instead of trying to sleep again. If sleep want necessary I'd never sleep again. I just want to sleep normally again, I hate this :("
"Insomnia, depression and not being able to get 8hrs of sleep to take sleeping medication.","My husband recently got back home after being away for 7 months. In that time I got treatment for my depression and insomnia.

I was feeling great sleeping decently. No longer sleeping excessively and started getting regular and consistent sleep along with no more mood swings or muddled feelings I finally felt truly happy and normal.

He was on block leave/vacation the past 2 or so weeks which was fine for awhile, we would stay up playing video games and not sleep much at all, I was dealing fine. Then this last week I have been feeling the effects gradually get worse, I ended up just compulsively playing video games since waking up at 5 and not being able to fall back asleep (or if I did itd be bad falling asleep in the afternoon).

He started being a jerk (not like him at all) the day before he had to go back to work and that combined with little- crap sleep has triggered a huge depressive episode. I can't stop crying or thinking about wanting to kill myself and all the ways I could (I won't do it I know for a fact, if I thought I would I have the resources to be put on a psych evaluation). My husband understands mostly but I don't think he understands fully or to the extent on how bad it is.

I want to tell someone about it in detail but anytime I try they freak out thinking I really want to kill myself or just look at me like I am crazy and I don't want to scare anyone away. I want to talk to my dad or my friend but I don't want them to worry. 

Insomnia is more then just sleep related, it makes mental issues so much more worse then you would think. I am medicated but even still this can happen and it does.

I am fine, I just really wish people could understand depression and insomnia better, trying to explain it without people freaking out can be a pain. It can be like a little voice in the back of your head saying all these things you know aren't true but the devastation you feel make it all feel real and true.

I really just want to sleep and I don't know how to make it work with everything that needs to happen around me."
Feel like I can only get solid sleep once I hear the early morning birds?,"So at night when I try to sleep I am constantly turning and thinking about things.. I sleep in patches of up to 30 minutes to an hour.  I would say 2 hours straight is a massive success for me during the night. But when 5 AM to 6 o'clock rolls around I hear the birds and pass out like a rock for a good 4 hours.  Dreams and all.  On the weekends I can get almost 6 hours.  It almost feels like I'm not supposed to sleep until other people are just starting their days.  I'm 26 and am already seeing bags forming under my eyes.  I just want to be able to sleep at night like a normal person lol.  Does anyone else expeirance this?  Or am I just ""different""?"
It has now been 15 days of sleep with 4 hours of sleep or less,"I've had insomnia since I was 4, I have all kinds of strategies and pills and coping mechanisms on the terrible nights where I just don't sleep. Sometimes, its just that it takes me forever to konk out. Sometimes, like tonight, I just straight up do not sleep at all. I tried to mitigate an uncomfortable night (very hot, kind of weirdly restless) by going to bed when I felt tired instead of earlier, so that I wasn't gonna condemn myself to a night of tossing and turning. I also opted not to take a sleeping pill, because I've been going through a LOT of those, and I'm worried about the potential health impacts.

Guys, I don't know what to do at this point. The only thing in my life that has ever helped is me smoking weed back in America (I'm currently in a country where that's not feasible.) I feel like I'm slowly internally breaking down. I've been taking a combination of doxylamine succinate, (which is fine if I have time to internally burn the whole dose, otherwise I wake up like a zombie) and Valerian. I have melatonin, too. It no longer works for me.

Please, chronic peeps, what do you do? God bless my family and friends but they all tell me to do yoga and masturbate. Like that has ever worked.

It is currently 05:39. I went to bed at 12:20 ish. I have to get up in 1.5 hours at the latest."
People that cannot stop thinking - Have you tried white nose during sleep?Did it work?,"I am just curious. I think too much, and cannot stop during the night. I am thinking a portable white noise machine might help.

"
tonight's insomnia activity,"Lying awake at 3am. Got sweaty and scratched my skin to bits. My drunk flat mates put in our group chat their lost as fuck, I drive into town from uni and rescue them. Insomnia isn't all bad eh."
You know what sucks?,During the day I feel like a shambling zombie. At night? Wide awake.
Fuck melatonin.,"I've had insomnia for about 3 years now, posted here before. I have these 4-5week periods where I average about ~2,3 hours a night. No idea why. My friends and family would always ask, ""why don't you get more sleep? How about going to bed earlier?"" I'm in my bed no later than 9:00 each night, and I spend hours just laying there, doing absolutely nothing until about 3-4 in the morning. 

Last year, I finally decided to try to fix it. I started following a very strict sleep schedule, slept in close to complete darkness, and avoided caffeine and alcohol. That didn't work out, I quit after 4 months. I read that marijuana could help me get to sleep. I just think about everything and want to eat a lot. But not sleep. 

So 3 weeks ago, I finally gave in and bought a 200ml bottle of melatonin. I took 20ml, and wait to see what happens. It made me unbelievably tired at first, and I think to myself, ""great, this works!"". How wrong I was. I was just stuck at that point of barely awake but not asleep for hours. But for whatever reason, I kept taking it, and I'm worried that I won't be able to sleep without it. 

Fuck you, melatonin. Fuck you. Your friend insomnia can go ahead and eat a dick as well."
I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy...,"I've gotten to the point where I absolutely dread nighttime. Nighttime means sleep‚Äîand, for I'm sure many of us here, trying to sleep is nothing short of agony.

I can't remember the last time I had a restful night's sleep. It's not that I toss and turn, it's not that I continue waking up, it's that I often can't even get to that point‚ÄîI can't fall asleep. My mind is tired, my body is tired, my sheets are clean and warm, but its never quite enough for me to drift into sweet rest.

I usually spend about three hours (some nights more, some nights less) laying in my bed trying to sleep. I become incredibly tired, but it never matters. At about hour three, I tend to get frustrated‚Äîwhich, of course, only makes matters worse. I rummage through the Internet for any tips/tricks/advice I can find; and then, upon several unsuccessful employments of various ""don't be so anxious"" clich√©s, I often resort to a strong dosage of Zzzquil to get the job done. It's a cycle I wouldn't wish on anyone.

My schedule is consistent, I do not take naps throughout the day, and I do not drink caffeine after 4:00pm. I'd like to think I have a positive outlook on life, and I wouldn't say I'm any more stressed than a typical person my age (24). I've tried many OTC medications and have exhausted a majority of the techniques that can be accessed online. For the rare nights that I do end up getting over four hours of sleep, they are often not restful. So here I am at almost 6am (CST) just as awake as I was at noon. 

In all honesty, I find it embarrassing and pathetic for me to be this powerless in submitting my body to perform an operation that should be so natural. I just want to sleep."
The best advice for insomnia I can give.,"I have been plagued with insomnia for the past year or so, and within the past few months I have been doing some experiments to figure out what works best for me. I have tried almost all suggestions that people give online, and nothing has worked, at all! Until I stumbled across an article (I can't remember where I found it-I'm trying to find it now) that gave me the absolute best advice. 

*A little backstory:*  My insomnia began when I started working 6am to 2pm shifts instead of my usual 1pm to 9pm shifts. How was I expected to be fully rested and be at work by 6AM?!?!? I started to worry about not getting my full eight hours of sleep, and not having the energy I needed to get through work the next day. This was the start of my insomnia.


Here is all of the things I tried that didn't work

- Valerian Root (tea and pill)

- Melatonin (10mg and 3mg - teas and pills)

- Doxylamine Succinate

- Benadril

- Magnesium Citrate

- Moving my electronics out of the room

- Not using electronics a few hours before bed

- Waking up at the same time everyday

- Exercise ( I ran/jogged 2.6 miles every morning - didn't help)

- Reading under a dim light

**Doing these things actually made it harder for me to fall asleep, because I did them with the anticipation that it would make me fall asleep easier! Which made it worse!**


I took a vacation week when Dark Souls III came out for PC (I had a vacation and needed to use it-I'm about to move and be with another company), and I had no problems sleeping whatsoever! I would go to bed at midnight and wake up around 7am and go for a run. It took me less than 15 minutes to fall asleep and I always felt fully rested the next day (unless I drank that afternoon). 

I came to the conclusion, that **it was my worry about the next day that caused me to stay awake.** 

- I worried about my performance.

- I worried about what time I'd fall alseep.

- I worried about waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep.

- I worried about having such a crazy workday ahead of me that I wouldn't just be able to make it through.


I had to be up at 5am today to be ready for work. And do you know what I did before I went to bed last night? Played Dark Souls, talked to my friends over Skype, and drank grape soda. I didn't give a darn about being tired today, and in turn I fell asleep fast and felt well rested and ready for my workday.

So here is something to try: Have fun with your night regardless of what is going to happen, and **don't try to fall asleep.** Do what you would normally do until you feel that you need to sleep and then continue to lay in bed, but don't try to sleep! JUST RELAX AND HAVE FUN.

TL;DR - Thinking about insomnia (and the things to counteract it) actually makes insomnia worse- and you just need to relax and have fun!


Sorry for the long post. I have been struggling with insomnia for a long time and I am so glad that I am finally feeling some relief from it. I want you guys to experience some relief too!"
My Experience Overcoming Sleep Anxiety (Insomnia Help),[Here is the post!](http://www.zazn.io/anxiety/insomnia-help-from-an-insomniac) Let me know what you think of it. I hope it's helpful.
Lifelong insomniac dating someone who can fall asleep in 5 seconds flat. We...butt heads.,"I greatly prefer to spend my non-sleeping hours doing something productive rather than laying in bed staring at the ceiling or my phone. I read, take care of written correspondence, do organizational work and planning for my job, you get the idea - activities that don't take any exertion, so I'm still getting some kind of rest, but that still make me feel like I've done something.

My boyfriend can literally lay down and be asleep within seconds, without fail. As such, he doesn't ""get"" insomnia. He gets angry with me because I don't ""try"" to sleep, and I've tried to explain to him that my body and my mind just don't work that way, but it never gets through to him.

He gets angry and frustrated, I get angry and frustrated, and that's one more way insomnia fucks up my life.

TL;DR - I can't sleep, boyfriend can, we both get mad about it."
"Those who have taken Ambien regularly for more than a few years, how does it affect you, good or bad?",
Finally completely free of sleeping meds and sleeping better than I ever did on them,"I'm not saying I never needed to go on meds in the first place, because I definitely did.  Last summer I was in a terrible place, and sleeping meds gave me a shot at actually getting a few hours of sleep as opposed to going days without a wink of sleep.  I'm just saying there is light at the end of the tunnel for everyone with insomnia on meds and when you feel stable and ready to tough out the taper, you'll be able to go off them.  Don't rush going off the sleeping meds if you don't think you're ready, but if you feel 'stable' on sleeping meds, I'd gather the confidence and give tapering off a try.  Don't be surprised if it gets worse for a while, tough it out because it'll eventually get better again.  The first few times I tried quitting meds, I went back to not sleeping at all for days at a time and got scared that I was going back to where I was at before so immediately went back on them without giving it a decent shot, or sticking it out a while more.  This is because the first few times, I tried tapering off them when I wasn't 'stable' on them yet.  When you get to the point where you can consistently sleep with meds for a few months, only then should you consider tapering off.

I slept worse while tapering off them and for about a week after I had completely given up them, but after that harsh ""withdrawal"" phase (sweating, worse insomnia, etc), I feel like I'm for the most part better off now.

"I've slept 12 hours since Thursday, the 7th. I feel like I'm losing my mind...","So... Lifelong insomniac here. I say that relative to the larger portion of my remembered life has been plagued by this horrid ugly fowl behemoth. I might ramble, my mind is all over. I've been to the doctor three separate times over the past ten days trying to clear up this fucking terrible spell I'm in. I got an injury earlier than the 7th. I slipped on Black Ice. My 26 year old arthritic body took it hard. Call into work Monday the 5th. Figure, day, take a day, sleep it off, ice it up, heat it up. Good as new like always, no. Wakeup Monday late in the evening. Body hurts. Hurts way more than usual. Racking pain... I went to the ER. The docs tell me I have several contusions on my side and a minor concussion. They write me a note until Saturday. Go home and sleep for three hours, even with opiates and weed, and I wake wide awake. Great... Just when I need most, it shows up, I think rather sarcastically. I'm awake, so I start to read, luckily I have Friday off, so I read, I listen to music, and I play games. All day from 2 AM to 8 PM, and I go to bed, again opiates and weed, I'm a lightweight with both usually, nothing... Tossing and turning for five hours, and I can't sleep... My vision framerate drops a little, and I'm seeing the world on a second and a half delay. I'm sluggish, it's been two years since my last really bad episode. I'm tired, but I can't sleep. I cut out electronics to try to help, so I read and nothing... Sunday night roles around, and I've managed three more hours since Thursday evening. I go back to clinic. They give me trazodone and tell me to go back if it doesn't get better, also tell me to take until tomorrow. I slept like the God damn dead Thursday night. Friday nothing. Saturday I hung out with friends and slept okay, 5.5 hours, and last night, now noon on the west coast, I have not slept for a fucking MINUTE. Not a single mother fucking blissful relieving minute of solace from this anxiety ridden fucking shell that's enclosed me, it's like I'm not actually in my own world but merely watching as my job is at severe risk even with doctor's notes as I've already missed time due to an on the job injury and a bad flu that hospitalized me. I can't hardly move... How can I work tomorrow... I'm terrified of hospitals..."
Is your insomnia caused/exacerbated by a fear of falling asleep?,"For most of my life I've had a fear of falling asleep. Giving up control of my consciousness has just always freaked me out. I'm curious if others here have or have ever had the same issue.

Thanks"
Does anyone else have blurred vision due to chronic sleep issues?,"Not sure if this is a thing - if it's already been identified medically - but my vision tends to get affected by the quality of sleep I get. When I don't get much sleep, I am near-sighted. I can't read distant road signs or make out much detail of strangers' faces on the streets. When I do sleep well, however, my clear vision returns. I am no longer near-sighted; I can read road signs 2 or so blocks away and I can see people's eyes. 

Edit: grammar."
Choline cured my insomnia,"To make long story short, I've suffered from insomnia for 15 years although I wasn't a good sleeper even as a child. Every time I lie down, it feels like my brain is turned on -- stupid and irrelevant thoughts pop to my mind keeping me awake. 

For the first decade I tried every prescription drug available. The only one that didn't cause tiredness or other side effects was mirtazapine -- in extremely low dosages it just make you a bit more sleepy. Though even a bit too much causes awful tiredness during the next day. Of course in addition to drugs, I've tried every other remedy available but I don't think I need to tell you that.

In the past five years I started 'biohacking' my insomnia. My posting history gives an indication of what I've been doing. I've tried fish oil, lactobacillales, GABA, HTP5, taurine, creatine, etc. 

Nothing helped until I encountered PhosphatidylCholine. First I took whole pills (250mg) that caused tiredness, headache and other problems. But I noticed it had a strange effect on my brain activity. So I started to lower the dosage until I reached about 75mg every other day.

First of all the main effect was natural sleepiness. Now, instead of feeling anxious and tense every night, I feel simply tired and sleepy. Before it took me about two hours to fall asleep, now it takes less than ten minutes. It feels like choline silences the 'voices' in my head. My thought don't jump all around but stay focused. Even when I wake up at night my mind doesn't start racing.

It's been now two months since I started taking choline and its effect hasn't changed or lessened. It DOES have side effects that I would summarize as 'feeling different'. Some or good and some are bad but in the end, nothing beats not feeling tired all the time.

I hope this helps someone else.

Edit: since choline accumulates to your brain, it might take a week or so until you notice the effect."
Totally trying this next time I can't sleep...,
"PSA, this is a solvable problem","TLDR: 
I was on here four months ago and read a PSA post from someone who had gotten better after suffering from chronic insomnia.  That post mentioned CBT for insomnia and it inspired me to give it a go. I'm happy to say IT WORKS.  I sleep soooo much better now than when I was on Ambien.  The biggest help is sleep restriction.  
/TLDR

It all started 2 years ago, when I was overwhelmed by trying to work 80 hours a week.  I was super stressed about getting everything done and when I couldn't fall asleep, I would lay there and try to force myself to sleep.

Rule #1) never try to force yourself to sleep.  It is a losing battle.

However, relaxation techniques can be helpful.  I recommend getting really good at one of them, and only using that one.  For me I will simply play a game with myself in which I count my breaths.  In is ""one"", out is ""two"", in is ""three"" etc.  With each outward breath, I will feel myself sinking into the bed and I will consciously relax any tension in my muscles.  The game is to see how high I can count before I lose track.  I usually don't get over 40.  I find that breathing a little faster than I normally do is helpful.  If you find that you have stopped counting, just start over.  If you find yourself stressing out about the game, then it's probably time to get out of bed and go read a book.  

The worst cycle to get caught in is to lay there stressing about not sleeping.  You will never fall asleep if you are stressed about sleeping, and trying harder to sleep won‚Äôt work.  If it did, you probably wouldn‚Äôt be here reading this, would you?  If you keep that cycle up, it will become normal for you to lay there stressing about sleep.  This is a condition known as Insomnia.

To break this cycle, never force yourself to sleep and only go to bed when you are sleepy. Get out of bed and go read something that is not stressful. The stress comes from the thoughts ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt sleep‚Äù or ‚ÄúI won‚Äôt be able to get everything done tomorrow‚Äù.  If you are reading a lovely short story about bob‚Äôs vacation in El Salvador, then those thoughts can‚Äôt happen.  You will relax and start to feel sleepy.  

Shutting up the thoughts is also the point of counting your breaths.  If you are counting ‚Äúone, two, three, etc‚Äù, you can‚Äôt wonder if you are going to pass the test or have enough money to pay rent.

Another problem that I had is that I have a partner who needs about 20% more sleep than I do, and I had been trying to go to bed when she does.  If you are a poor sleeper with a partner who sleeps a lot and you try to go to bed when they do, you are 100% guaranteed to develop insomnia, which gets us to rule #2.

Rule #2) never, ever, ever be in bed if you aren't actually sleepy.

This rule is difficult.  After being on Ambien for a year, I started to need it every night just to fall asleep.  Not only that, but I was no longer sleeping through the night.  I am pretty confident that the Ambien was disrupting my body's normal sleep cycle and was actually causing my insomnia at that point (The stressful situations that had initiated the insomnia had passed).

The reason rule #2 is hard is because I had forgotten what feeling sleepy felt like. It‚Äôs not the same as being exhausted.  Sleepy is an active mechanism in your brain that kicks in when it is damned good and ready to.  There are things that you can do to encourage it, such as relaxing, avoiding evening caffeine, not exercising 2 hours before bed, getting up at the same time every day (yes, weekends too), but until than mechanism kicks in there is nothing for you to do but wait for it, and don‚Äôt do the waiting for it in bed.

I started to call the mechanism ‚ÄúMr. Sleepy‚Äù. Sometimes Mr. sleepy wanted to visit, and sometimes he didn‚Äôt.   All you can do is wait for him to pay you a visit.  Trying to force him to visit scares him.

Rule #3) no drugs.

If you are dependent on any drug to fall asleep, that drug will eventually become less effective. Remember the first time you drank alcohol? Caffeine?  Even if you don't drink coffee every morning, ask your friend who does, eventually, it just loses its effectiveness.  Even the over the counter stuff.  It has been repeatedly shown that CBT for Insomnia is much better than drugs in the long run, and my personal experience backs that up.

Realization #1) There is a thing called core sleep.  Core sleep is about 5.5 hours a night, no matter how bad your insomnia gets, you will get at least this much sleep on average.  Of course you could go several days without sleep, but you will eventually get that 5.5 hours, no matter what.

So I was suffering from insomnia and developing a tolerance to Ambien, and the only solution was rules #1 and #2.  

The following 2 weeks were very difficult.  I found keeping a sleep log to be very good.  

Rule #4) keep a sleep log

Mine is here:  you should be able to download a copy and use mine
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16VuxmiANGcQLrMbT3ihan4DBIbvzy_F9A5u7jVuaZiQ/edit?usp=sharing

I kept track of the hours with decimal hours (10.25 is 10:15) The sleep score is the amount of time you are asleep divided by the total amount of time you spend in bed.  Your score should be above 80%

Looking at my sleep log should be instructive.  I took my last Ambien on 4/22  the following 2 weeks were pretty tough, but by 5/9, you can see that I was averaging 6 to 7 hours of sleep a night.  I stopped recording my feels at around that time because things started to level out.  Today, 4 months on, I am sleeping 7 hours a night and only having about 1 night a week that I only sleep 5 or 6.

That experience taught me Realization #2.

Realization #2) even if you are sleeping 5 hours a night on average, you will survive.  For the first 2 weeks, I only slept 5.5 hours a night on average, but I was still able to get up, go to work, and take care of my shit.  This realization is incredibly useful to me today, because now, when I can't fall asleep immediately, I know that I'll do fine the next day,  I might not feel amazing, but it won't impact my ability to get my work done.  This realization means less stress.  Less stress means more sleep.

So sleep restriction means you‚Äôre going to have a lot of reading time on your hands.  I recommend installing Flux, buying a 15 watt incandescent reading light, and some books:

Rules #1 and #2 are the only real rules; the rest of this stuff is just here to help you with those two rules
"
Already at the office two plus hours before I need to be. I say it's to get a jump on the week but that's a lie. It's because I can't sleep so why not just go to work.,"I feel pathetic and so sleepy now. Busy week so I was awake by 3am. I laid there until 4 because my brain is wide awake. I finally left for work by 4:30am although I don't work until 7. I tried to find somewhere to grab a little breakfast but everywhere was closed so I was in my office by 4:55am. Now, of course, my brain wants sleep. Out of luck now. I am so sick of my inability to sleep anywhere close to my alarm. "
Sleeping pills watercolor,
Anyone get insomnia so severe you've stopped your life?,In the past month and a half my insomnia has been so severe I've had to stop going to school and work. Sleeping pills/anti anxiety work very on and off. Anyone have similar experiences to this?
Insomnia + School = Fuck my life,studied all day for a test but of course its one of those nights where no matter how long I close my eyes or how I position myself my body is just fucking rejecting sleep
"That's genius, Melisa.",
Just found out mold was causing my insomnia.,"Before I would stay in bed for a good 8-10 hours and maybe get only like 30 minutes to an hour of sleep before I had to get up for school or work. Did all those things mentioned from sleeping documentaries but nothing helped. As I was cleaning my room, I noticed white some mold growing on my wooden bed frames and closet doors. Cleaned that up and I've been able to sleep for 7+ hours. It's been a month and I'm still getting the same results.

Moral of the story, check your wooden furnitures or vents in your room for mold."
Does anyone else just need to not feel alone when hit by sleeplessness?,"I have several times suffered from temporary insomnia for maybe 6-8 months each (while on prescribed sleeping/anxiety pills), and now I just have a few sleepless nights a week.

But all I feel like sometimes is just to be able to reach out and hearing from someone having the same problem as me.

I just have a feeling that it would make one feel better"
Some things that help 'cause I'm on my own.,"Hi, all! So.. a little background, i guess. I've had insomnia as long as I can remember. I remember staying up for 3 days when I was 8 just because I couldn't sleep. This happened multiple times. I'd go to bed early, but be up for hours and hours. And then I'd wake up after only 4 or 5 hours of sleep. When I was 9, I developed psychosis which has now gone into full blown schizophrenia.  The insomnia has exacerbated the issue, but I digress. I've tried all sorts of doses of melatonin and it worked for awhile. Even after 2 months now of not taking it, it still doesn't work. Trazodone was prescribed to me by my psychiatrist, but that has since stopped working as well. My antipsychotic has a side effect of drowsiness, which helped for awhile, but this has also worn off. I'm in between psychiatrists right now, so I'm on my own. My current psychiatrist wouldn't help me anyway.

After that long story, here are some tips from me to help get to sleep! 

1. Put the electronics away! - I know you're bored just laying there, but this might be part od the reason you're awake. I havent gone to sleep before midnight in years. I put the ipod away at 1015 now and I've been asleep before midnight every night.

2. Have a set time to go to bed - this has actually helped me. I take my medications (antipsychotic and multivitamin) between 9 and 930. Bedtime is usually around 10-1030. I'm a nursing student so my days start early. 

3. Get up early - this has helped me tremendously. I know you're tired.  But within a few days you'll be on a better schedule. I try to be up by 730 every day. No, it doesn't work all the time. I have a day every week where I just sleep as long as I want, but evem when I do that, I'm getting up earlier. And therefore getting to sleep earlier

4. Use your bed only for sleeping - I never thought this would work until I tried it. I lived in a 4 bedroom apartment with 7 people for 2 years. My bed was my sleeping area, my dining room, my desk, and my living room. I did everything on my bed. I've since moved amd now only use my bed for sleeping and I'm getting to sleep earlier because now my body knows bed=sleep

5. Reading - I read every night before bed with my fiance. It helps me to relax after a day of staring at computer screens and working on patients. I relax and so I get to sleep faster.  I only read for an hour, tops. Most of the time I fall asleep while reading. 

6. Chamomile tea - it works wonders on sleep amd anxiety (I als o have anxiety amd panic disorders. I'm a mess, haha!). I've found that amythi g warm in my stomach will help me sleep. The two biggest things I've found that helped were chamomile tea and oatmeal. It takes some trial and error on times. For me it works best if I drink the tea just before I'm ready to sleep.

7. Find a comfortable position amd stay there! - if I wiggle too mich it wakes me up. If I lay still, I'll fall asleep

8. Nature soundtrack - I've found that a distant thunderstorm soundtrack really helps me sleep. Mostly because it gives me somethi g to drown out. 

9. No Caffeine after 10am! - Yup! That's an early time, but it's necessary. No caffeine at all, if you can avoid it. But if you can't, none after 10am! It helps!

Insomnia sucks, I know. But there are things you can do to help yourself. This is a list of what I've found helps me. It doesn't take care of the problem by any means. I still have nights were nothing I do helps, but now I'm having better nights than before. 

If you've made it this far, tbank you for reading! Please try some of this! I want you all to have a great night's sleep!"
this shit is tearing me apart.,JUST LET ME SLEEP
Feel like my body is locked into a 28 hour day cycle,"If I manage to get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep one night, the next night, I am never ever able to go to sleep any earlier than 4 hours later than I need to.  For the next day or two, I'll get 4 or 5 hours of sleep, until I'm finally exhausted enough to go to bed at a normal time.  Then, 8 hours of sleep, and the cycle repeats.  

I feel like I would be **golden** if our days were 28 hours long... But since that's not likely to happen, I'm at a loss.  Am I just doomed to repeat this horrible cycle for the rest of my life?  It's been this way for years and years.

EDIT: I have the answer.  I just have to travel 1 billion years into the future.  The Earths rotation is apparently slowing enough to cause the day to lengthen by 1 hour every 2,500,000 years.    ........  >.<"
Almost 7AM and I'm still awake...,"But then I sleep well into the day, I think it's my sleep patterns that are fucked up. "
Tired during the day and awake all night.,"I am dead tired during the day mainly because after being dead tired all day  get home and even though i fight for hours in a dark room I just cannot get to sleep so i end up getting up frustrated and bored and not tired and then I finally go to some mode of half sleep where I know what's going on but I am sleeping somewhat. Then i wake up tired and then i want to sleep all day but right when i get home to sleep I can never sleep. 

What can i do to fix this?"
Specific flavor of insomnia...,"I don't know how common it is but, I don't know if I can't sleep or if I just don't need as much sleep. There a nights when I'm just lying in bed awake with my thoughts, and other nights when I'm tossing and turning but never quite getting to sleep. I can stay up all night if I choose and have little to no ill effects during the day, but other days I'm absolutely wrecked from lack of sleep. Some nights I'll stay up 'till morning just reading a book or watching t.v, other nights I'll be frantically constructing a crazy cardboard sculpture like my life depends on it for no reason at all(I'm a visual artist so I'm not counting the times I stay up to finish within a deadline). I'm not jacked up on caffeine because I only have one cup in the morning with breakfast. Does anyone else experience these varied forms of insomnia?"
Fast for 16 hours to reset your circadian cycle.,"Hey guys.  I've been an insomniac my whole life.  I've generally been shitty at falling asleep, staying asleep, breathing while I sleep (apnea), but the main issue has come down to having a late/long circadian cycle.  It's extremely easy for me to stay up late, and extremely difficult for me to fall asleep early or get up early.  It's easy for me to have a regular sleep schedule, falling asleep at midnight or so, and then in one night destroy it by not being able to fall asleep until 4 or 6 AM, and then not be able to fall asleep until like 4 AM the next night.

I'm now 26, and a lifetime of insomnia (and reading things) has taught me a lot about sleeping better.  I used to fix my circadian problems by just staying up all night some time, but that was never a great solution.

My new method is to fast for 16 hours, and then eat breakfast at regular breakfast time.  So if I want to be getting up and eating at 9 AM, I would stop eating food at 5 PM the day before.  I usually manage to fall asleep at a somewhat reasonable hour just from being so hungry, but then it's the breakfast that really sets my schedule straight.

Scientists learned about this trick by studying bats.  The bats are normally nocturnal, but at the end of their season their predatory birds migrate south, and the insects they feed on only come out during the day, so the bats become diurnal.  They found that when the bats stopped finding food at night, they would stay up until they found food, and then when they did eat, it would immediately flip their sleep cycle around.

There's a lot of other advice on insomnia I could give.  Not drinking any alcohol is a big one for me.  I switched from alcohol to pot a long time ago, and it's done wonders for my sleep."
Doesn't it suck being caught not sleeping?,"Almost every night -

\*Roommate/sibling/parent/SO catches you up at 4:30 a.m. when they have to get up to pee\*

Them: uhhh are you still up right now?

You: Psh what no I was asleep and you getting up woke me up

How to Stop 20 Years of Trazodone?,"If it weren't now considered to be such a huge risk factor for dementia, I'd stay on it. I'm 54. Until 2014, I was on 100, then dropped to 75, and now on 50, tho recently I've used bigger doses to fall and stay asleep. 

I have other risk factors: genetics ( homozygous for MTHFR and COMT mutations), one APOE gene, lifelong anxiety and major depression, and was on benzos for 24.5 years. Dementia, imo mixed Alzheimer's and vascular, killed my dad in early 2018. My wiring seems not unlike his, but very luckily for me, I received testing at a mental health clinic this year that revealed the mutations, and I now take l methylfolate and B12.

So far, my heart has done nothing unusual. 

I want to remove trazodone from my life. Been on it 20+ years. I used the Ashton Method to taper off benzos, over a period of 1.5 years, going comfortably from 1.5-2 mgs of klonopin/d to 0. Cold turkey twice may have caused some brain damage. I'm also 3 years out from menopause. My cognition is shit. I don't want to see it get worse. 

Anyone have a good plan for a trazodone taper? Also, what might I take for rebound  insomnia that won't further bollix my brain?"

Antidepressant insomnia: I would not wish this upon my worst enemy,I was prescribed Wellbutrin XL for my anxiety and ADHD and it has completely fucked my sleep schedule. I have to get up at 6 every morning for an early class at my high school and I haven't gotten more than 4 hours of sleep this entire week. Every waking moment it feels like someone is pushing in on my temples and rubbing sandpaper across my forehead. It's getting to the point where I feel like the side effects are hurting me more than the drug is helping me. I have these rare moments in the afternoon sometimes where I just get overwhelmed by a tired feeling but I always have to get up to do something and then it's gone for the rest of the day/night. With ADHD-I my working memory is already compromised and I mentally cannot function when that's combined with only 3 hours of sleep. I have this huge AP Gov test tomorrow and I only have 4 hours left to even fall asleep. I feel like I'm going insane 
How many of us have trouble sleeping because our phones/computers put the internet right at our disposal and we‚Äôre so used to jumping from one thing to the next instantly that our minds move at that same speed as we attempt to fall asleep?,
Went to grt a haircut and it would seem my sleepless shows,"The other day I went to get a haircut. Once I sat down the lady commented on how tired I looked. It's getting ridiculous at this point, the bags under my eyes have become so large that, ironically, they are the size of sleeping bags"
Lost the ability to sleep on a mattress. Only can sleep on floor.,"I  toss and turn keeping my wife up so I decided to sleep on the floor. Now I use a sleeping bag and find it way more comfortable then our extra firm mattress. I hate that I can't share a bed but at least she can get sleep. 
Anyone else have a similar issue? "
Sick and tired of being sick and tired,"Hi all, I am somewhat new to this. I have periods where I can‚Äôt fall asleep sporadically (is not always a consistent thing). Thing is it sucks. Even when I do sleep I don‚Äôt sleep well, I haven‚Äôt in years. I have ADD (diagnosed and medicated) and am hypersensitive to pain, noise, and body positioning, which doesn‚Äôt help on top of that. My back is sore most mornings too for some reason, and it kills right now. Sigh. 

I definitely have an anxiety issue which I think is probably the culprit along with my ADD. 

I plan on going to the doctor asap and seeing what I can do. I know that antidepressants such as trazadone are commonly prescribed. Thing is, I don‚Äôt have depression. I have anxiety. I would rather not take an Antidepressant as a first line therapy. It would be nice to just have something that would calm me down or make me sleep. 

What medication do you guys take for this kind of thing? I don‚Äôt know what to expect. "
Anyone had good luck with a sound machine?,One of my ex's had a programmable machine that rocked. I don't remember the brand but if any of y'all know of a good brand I'd love to know it.
Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome,"I wondering if this is to blame, and not insomnia?
So, I never had problems sleeping until about 5 years ago. I was always a great sleeper as a kid, and even as an adolescent. When I was 22, I started at a job where my hours were 3 am to 12 pm, and I had a long drive to work, so I had to wake up at 1:45 am. I did this job for a little under 2 years before my body couldn't take it anymore. I've had a job with normal office hours (8 am to 5 pm) for just under 4 years now. Every now and then, I'll go through bouts of insomnia where I just cannot fall asleep until 2 or 3 in the morning. Even if I'm tired, I simply cannot fall asleep. It feels sometimes like my body cant sleep yet, even though I'm tired. Last night i slept from 2:30 to 7:30 am.

I've read online that normally, this syndrome is genetic. I'm wondering, can shift work cause this as well, and can it take years to fix? I usually never have completely sleepless nights (I've only had a few in my life) but I have nights where it will take me hours to finally go to sleep. "
Forgetfulness/Memory Loss,"I‚Äôm 25 yrs old, I take no meds, and am healthy aside from the insomnia. The thing is I‚Äôve been forgetful for the last few months. I go on a walk with my dog everyday and have forgotten my way back, have forgotten my locker combo, forgetten names of people I always talk to, and forget what class I‚Äôm supposed to be in. All blood tests and physicals have been normal.

It started gradually over the last 5-6 months, and while it‚Äôs pretty intermittent, it has been increasing. Luckily, I always eventually remember but could this be from insomnia. I wake up tired, and feel like I haven‚Äôt slept in a day or two."
I really hate this horrible cycle,"Anxiety and insomnia. Anxiety causes lack of sleep, which causes additional anxiety, and the cycle goes on. I hate being trapped in it with no way to break out.  Any tips on how to break this cycle? I get caught in it at least every couple months."
"3:00 am again, I keep telling myself it's not so bad, but it's probably worse than I would like to believe.","Coming up on close to a month of averaging 3 hours of sleep a night. Good nights I'll get 4 to 5, bad ones maybe an hour and a half, seems to average about 3 hours a night every week. During the day I'm so scatter brained I can't focus on work or school ( coding fo work, physics for school). Both require me to be able to sit and think but on a good day I can devote an actual real serious hour to each before I feel like I need to ram my head into a wall, which iv actually  done to make me feel better. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or depression or stress or a combination of them, but every single night for the past month I feel like I am crazier and crazier at 3:00 am. Nothing really works, I exercise regularly, not like bullshit exercise but actual keep going until my body is hurting excersise. Still no help (I do feel most clearheaded after working out so its usually when I try to get stuff done). All over the counter pills do nothing, if anything they make my insomnia worse. Went through a phase with using ""legal"" benzos like etizolam and shit that ends with lam instead of pam, that didnt work due to past substance abuse issues, that road quickly turns into ""hey these help me sleep and help me feel less anxious during the day!"" With that train of thought you see as to why those became out of the question. Honestly soup and a few glasses of hot sake have been the best to me when I try and snag those few zzzzzs, but not good enough to even feel like I can live somewhat normally throughout th day. So now here I am, one month of 3 hour nights. Feel like I'm brain dead, worried I won't be able to function through school or work for even another week..... guess I'm rambling nothing better to do at this time. Sorry just needed to vent."
How did our bodies forget how to sleep???,"I've sleep fine for nearly all my life, until Aug. What the hell happened?"
Another insomnia story,"I am coming up on one year since insomnia entered my life. I had never thought much about sleep before..pretty much slept when I wanted. I didn‚Äôt really understand what insomnia was,but now I do.

It came on suddenly and I couldn‚Äôt understand why I didn‚Äôt just sleep. After a week of what I thought was almost no sleep, I was sure I wouldn‚Äôt survive. I even went to the emergency room where they gave me Ambien and told me to go to my doctor.

So my doctor ran a few blood tests which were normal and gave me Restoril. No other real advice so I felt I was on my own and obsessively began reading everything I could find and learned sleep meds were far from ideal. 

My insomnia continued and I never got a restful night. It made me selfish in that everything was about me and sleep day and night. I went through the motions of living but did not feel alive. I really didn‚Äôt want to spend the rest of my life this way and could now even understand why suicide is an option for someone. 

I asked my doctor for Trazedone which I thought was the best drug option. It did help but not consistently well. I was thinking and researching sleep almost constantly.  Never a day without it at the front of my mind. 

A year later I am now sleeping a lot better and feel rested most days, enjoying life again. I am still on trazedone but have decreased the dosage and am hopeful to get off. The trazedone helped but I think other things were more key. The biggest frustration is not knowing what really helps or hurts. I incorporated CBT-I methods. No formal program just what I read. Tried to not overthink and go to bed knowing I am ok however I sleep. 

Anyway just wanted to share because at one point I thought it was hopeless. Maybe it is the natural progression that I can sleep normally again or maybe combination of Trazedone,meditation and other CBT-I methods. Also it takes time so don‚Äôt give up.

Gratitude for belonging,"I don‚Äôt read all the posts here, but every time I log onto reddit this sub seems to show up off top of my normal feed. From what I see it‚Äôs the usual posts of suffering not being able to sleep and staying awake until 5/6am and gotta get up in an hour.

No shamming on that at all, I‚Äôm a fellow sufferer. Some of your posts have brought this grown man to tears because I know what it‚Äôs like to try every day, to lay awake in bed 10p-6a and say well hopefully tomorrow (happened 5 days in a row) . Like it pisses me off too, if we only were 100% sure no chance of sleep we could have watched some tv or studied some stuff, but no that 1% chance we fail and put hope in.

While I am a recovering acoholic, I like how they say I won‚Äôt drink with you today. My thing on here is that I‚Äôll stay awake with you tonight friends.

"Took all my pills yesterday, sleepless week ahead","So I stupidly decided to take all my seroquel for the week last night. I slept like a fucking log last night, but now I know I'm going to be awake and restless for the next whole week. It's going to suck, and I have no one to blame but myself for it. I'll have to steel myself against the insomnia to come. If only I didn't have issues with suicidality and self-harm, then maybe I wouldn't be in this mess today."
its so frustrating when you're able to get a good sleep for a week or so and then the insomnia just comes raging back.,every time i think i've seen the worst of it this keeps happening
What do you even do after a night of no sleep??,"So i've had sleep issues my whole life, but they were a lot more under control over the last 7 or 8 months while i was on birth control. I also got super depressed so i stopped that, but the insomnia has come back full force and t sucks. Texted my boss that im not making it into work, so ive got a good 18 or 19 hours before i try to sleep again for tomorrow.

Ive been so desperate for some free time lately so i could work on creative projects, but i have never been able to do anything if the sort when im exhausted. Its always been waste time on reddit, replay roms of old games, and make attempts to be vaguely productive before giving up because im too tired. Kills about 5 or 6 hours at most usually. What do you do to pass time until you can sleep?"
Getting a Full Nights Sleep and Still Tired?,"I'm a 23yo male that's been struggling with insomnia for the past year. How it effects me is always been different whether it be tossing and turning for 4-5 hours or only sleeping for 30 minutes at a time for a few nights.

This last week however may be the worst I've had yet. I'm getting a full night (for me) of sleep consisting of about 5-6 hours of sleep before waking up and getting another hour or so that's broken up. Usually that's fine for me but this week I keep waking up tired, and I stay tired all day. It's like I'm getting enough rest for it not to progressively get worse but not to go away either. I have a constant head ache and feeling of being tired with cloudy foggy thoughts and wanted to know if anyone else has ever gone through it and how they were able to deal with it. I'm so incredibly irritable at the moment and I want it to stop."

Little trick I purposely ignored!,"Hello friends! Backstory:
So I developed insomnia after I had a miscarriage in 2015. It seemed like my whole body just shut down afterwards.
I gained 3 dress sizes in 6 months despite not my healthy eating and exercise, my monthly cycle disappeared, I had anxiety, depression, extreme pain in my abdomen daily the list goes on. The thing that hit me worst was the insomnia. I would stay awake for 3-4 days no matter what I tried and then crash from exhaustion and sleep for 12+ hours and repeat. 
ANYWAY got diagnosed with PCOS and turns out all of these things were attributed to this illness. So I got told to deal with it because this is my life now. üòè
I tried sleeping pills. I didn‚Äôt look at any screen after 6pm, I ONLY drank water I kept my room cool and dark. All the suggestions.
My husband uses white noise apps to go to sleep (bless his heart he once went without for 2 months because he was scared they were what was disturbing me!) and one day he added a guided meditation single aimed at insomnia to his white noise. 
The woman‚Äôs voice was soothing but her advice in my overtired state made me bristle with anger. ‚ÄúOh yeah just breath in and out haven‚Äôt thought of that one. Thanks Karen!‚Äù üôÑ so...I ignored it üôÉ night after night I lay awake angry at this stupid woman telling me to breathe my way to sleep. And then one day I woke up to my husbands alarm. But wait it was only day 2 of my cycle??? I didn‚Äôt try to sleep?! I just did the stupid counting thing?
Well I‚Äôm happy to say I‚Äôve never had a sleepless night since! 
Breath in....
Breath out...100
Breath in...
Breath out...99
Breath in...
Breath out...98.
I don‚Äôt think Ive ever gotten past 60. Obviously I understand this isn‚Äôt going to work for everyone. But if this post helps even 1 person desperately trawling the internet for ways to fall asleep like I did so many times, I‚Äôm happy! Just focus on the numbers not on sleep. Don‚Äôt even think about trying to sleep. 
Just take a deep breath in, and as you exhale think the number in your head and repeat, counting down from 100. If other thoughts intrude your mind don‚Äôt feel frustrated just acknowledge the thought and pull yourself and your thoughts back to the next number.
I really hope this helps someone."
I really cannot deal with it anymore,"It‚Äôs 1 in the morning and i have to get up at 5 to go on a 10hr ride to greece on vacation. I have slept 10 hours in a week. The level of exhaustion is something i have never felt before. This is not worth it. I can‚Äôt do anything, i cannot enjoy anything. I can‚Äôt even feel good about going on holiday, i just think about how am i going to sleep and how it will affect my day. I feel ruined. I just can‚Äôt anymore. "
Using a wrist slap band to reduce anxiety,"I know this is a pretty old psychology trick but it kind of worked for me. All you need is a hair band. Wear it on your wrist, and when you are feeling anxious and having negative thoughts, pull it and let it slap your wrist. Focus on the pain and try to think of happy thoughts (ex. 'this is not a huge problem, there are people in the world suffering way more than me right now' 'I' ll be able to sleep again but even if I don't I can still function through the day' etc), and stop slapping it when you feel less anxious and the happy thoughts take over. Repeat as needed, and you'll feel less anxious in general. I mean I still can't sleep but now I feel better than laying around thinking my life is going to be screwed by insomnia. "
Something in my closet,"So I want to start off saying I'm 22, and even as a kid was never afraid of any closet. The one in my current room can't close because of the hinges. Recently I've had a lot of things coming up that have given me next-to crippling anxiety. Bills, school and family, things like that. 

A couple weeks ago I had a completely harmless dream that suddenly ended horribly and abruptly. Kind of like sitting around having a good time and out of nowhere a corner of the room goes dark and everything gets moldy and decrepit. It scares me enough to wake up to see a large man in my closet. I scream out loud at him and quickly turn the lights on and see its mostly clothing hung up. 

I sounds really silly. It's just my shirts in my closet. But this happens twice a week for three weeks. It kind of makes me afraid to fall asleep to be honest. Do I need to get a nightlight?  "
What is this ‚Äúsleep‚Äù you speak of?,"I‚Äôve had a very unorthodox relationship with sleep my entire life. 

As far back as I can remember, I would sleep 16+ hours a day, occasionally getting up to use the bathroom but otherwise I‚Äôve done nothing but sleep for the majority of my life.

Over the past 6 years (I‚Äôm 25 now), I‚Äôve been getting consistently less sleep, sometimes not sleeping for 2+ days and working 10-12 hours a day. 

I was on a variety of different sleep meds for almost 5 months and, while it does eventually help me fall asleep, the first feeling I get is restlessness - I have to get up and walk around for a bit before I start to feel tired - then after I do finally sleep for however long (ranges anywhere from 2-10 hours) I feel worse than I did after being awake for 24+ hours. 

I gave up on it a few weeks ago because I feel it does more harm than good in the long run. I‚Äôve tried white noise, sleepy time tea, turning electronics off a few hours before bed - nothing works and I‚Äôm resigning myself to the fact that I‚Äôll never sleep properly. 

It is currently 6.30am, and I have to be up in 2 hours for a day of travelling. I had 4 hours of non-consecutive sleep the night before. It‚Äôs going to be one hell of a day. Cheers!"
I've given up hoping for sleep today,"Current time is 4:30am. I'm supposed to work at 9am. I've tried moving to the couch, turned on the AC, took 100mg of trazadone, sleepy time tea and even asmr and reading. Nothing has helped. The moment I start to get tired and shut my eyes my brain kicks into overdrive. "

Tips to help sleeping?,"i have had trouble with always being tired and whatnot for a while but within this year my sleeping problems have gotten so much worse. i am now unable to sleep and i have tried so many sleeping meds. my doctor prescribed me one and it had been working for a bit but now my sleeping problems are even worse. it takes me so long to fall asleep and most nights i wake up at least once during the night and have trouble getting back to sleep. im constantly exhausted and its really starting to negatively affect my ability to function. and that is a huge problem right now because i have so much i need to do but its really hard. even if i nap i cant nap for very long and i still feel exhausted afterwards. does anyone have any tips? i really need some, thank you!"
"I notice when I'm falling asleep, and the noticing wakes me up.","Last week I had a cup of coffee in the evening to do some work and couldn't fall asleep that night. My fault. But ever since then, I can't fall asleep anymore.

I lie in bed, thinking of nothing, my mind trapped in the hazy twilight of Stage 1. I stay there for hours.

My environment is perfect. Cold room, nice mattress, soft sheets, white noise, pitch blackness, heavy blankets. I'm cool, I'm comfortable, I'm tired.

Every few minutes the wave comes and I start to drop off. My hands disappear, my mind sighs, and my consciousness slips.

And I notice it.

There's no words or anxiety. I'm not fist-pumping in my mind, ""THIS IS IT! I'M GOING TO SLEEP!"" I just notice the sleep coming. And the noticing wakes me up.

I know to CBT. When I realize I've missed the wave I say to myself, ""that's OK, another wave is coming soon."" Or even better, I don't say anything to myself at all. But it doesn't matter, that's not the problem. The problem is the microsecond before, when I notice the sleep coming.

Ativan gave me a rash. Neocitran (Theraflu) made the twilight softer, but didn't help me ride the wave to sleep. I've stopped consuming caffeine after 10 AM and I haven't had any alcohol for a week. I'm taking vitamins and going for walks during the day.

Obviously I have been sleeping a bit, maybe 3-4 hours a night, but I am a 9-hour-a-night kinda person.

I just need to stop noticing when I'm falling asleep. What's the trick?"

We can't afford for me to miss and he doesn't understand why I want him to come to bed at a decent time. I've had insomnia for as long as I can remember l, but sleeping alone makes it so much harder.

I've tried antihistamine until I have developed high tolerance now even an entire bottle of cough syrup or pills won't even put me to sleep. I've tried all kinds of pills with possible side effects like drowsiness. I have tried prescription medications for years but I had to stop since I've developed serious side effects. So around March I have been off everything completely. And I was struggling at first like sleeping 3 to 4 hours a day and I was fine with it, better than nothing. But looks like over time I am beginning to get less and less sleep. The last time I slept now was on Friday for maybe a couple of hours or so. I have tried relaxing music, white noise, meditation you name it nothing worked. I have officially lost all hope now and I don't know what to do anymore, and I legit look like a walking corse now and my work requires a lot of attention to details and concentration and I can't even do that.

/R/Lectures knocks me out cold,"I've been dealing with bouts of insomnia (too much computer use, I suspect).

Eventually, by around 2 or so, all the neighbours lights have gone out and everybody is fast asleep except me.

Seroquel: my miracle medicine,"I‚Äôm not trying to promote overmedicating. And even then, Seroquel is not perfect. I still don‚Äôt sleep through the night. On average, I wake up about 4-5 times. But I sleep for hours at a time. And most nights I get 6-7 hours. This is all while consistently taking Seroquel.

Without Seroquel, I‚Äôm a fucking train wreck. I won‚Äôt sleep at all without it. On the rare chance that I do fall asleep without it, at most I‚Äôll get one hour.

I suffered for years before my psychiatrist recommended it. That‚Äôs another thing, too: Seroquel is mainly used to treat symptoms of bipolar disorder, anxiety, and schizophrenia. They don‚Äôt just prescribe it because you ask for it. 

So if there‚Äôs anyone out there that has mental health issues as well as sleep issues, I personally recommend talking to your doctor about seroquel. It‚Äôs literally saved my life and helped me maintain sanity.

Things for insomnia,"Hi friends 
I‚Äôm not asleep but that‚Äôs okay for now.  

Thought I‚Äôd share things I‚Äôve done in the past and do now for insomnia‚Äîthey have all worked in their turn (everyone is different!)

Showers are a go to before bed, and if I can‚Äôt sleep I‚Äôll take a shower again.  It might be bad for the environment but sometimes it helps me reset.  I use essential oils and treat myself to nice soaps or lotions as well.

Sometimes lotion can help!  You may be itchy and not realize it, and it can Cool you down

Keep it cold!  I will turn it down to 64 when I really am struggling (though usually around 66).  When I was younger and not married I‚Äôd sometimes get very cold then quite warm after getting in bed, and an electric blanket helped me with that situation 

In college I would wander the dorm, now I hang out with the cats sometimes 

Sometimes certain phone games help me check out and fall asleep (bite me, sleep hygiene)

Sometimes I am just very tight and rolling out on a foam roller will help 

Shows like ‚Äútoo cute: kittens‚Äù or other inane things.

Good night, I hope! 
"
What's worked (and hasn't) for me.,"So a few weeks back I made a couple posts here when I was at probably the lowest point of the insomnia that I've been struggling with the past month.  I wouldn't say I'm completely better now, and I've had some ups and downs, but I believe that the rough times are behind me and there's only improving from here on out.  Thought I'd share what I think has worked for me in case others can benefit from it.

First, what I don't think really did anything for me: medicine.  I first tried taking Unisom with doxylamine succinate alongside melatonin, but not only has its effectiveness been questionable whenever I have taken it (it didn't really seem to help me get to sleep faster, or stay asleep longer) it leaves me feeling WORSE the next day than if I didn't take it and got the same little amount of sleep.  I then tried this combination sleep aid I bought on Amazon called [Luma](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Habit-Melatonin-Chamomile-Magnesium-Supplement/dp/B00JCO3ALG) that has various different supplements meant to help with sleep and reducing anxiety.  I'm not entirely certain it's helping either, I've had nights where I took it but still didn't sleep well, but it doesn't leave me hung over the next day so I've incorporated it into my nightly routine at least until I run out of it.  I've found that taking it about an hour before bed works best.

I also discovered the [Sleep With Me Podcast](http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/).  While skeptical of it at first, I've gotten into the habit of playing it whenever I've noticed I can't fall asleep for an extended length of time, roughly half an hour.  Like the drugs it hasn't always worked...  But, probably over 75% of the times I've had to play it I've ended up falling asleep during the podcast.  The times it hasn't worked has been when I was either listening to the podcast too much and got too involved in the story being told, or when I got too fussy about volume and stuff.  But otherwise, it's worked so well that despite probably going through over ten episodes by now I can maybe recall what only two or three of them are actually about.  Usually, I'll find myself zoning out and unable to really focus on listening to it which will lead to me falling asleep.  However, I haven't actually needed it the past few days due to probably the biggest, most significant change I've made that has helped.

I stopped looking at the time everytime I woke up.  Specifically, I turned my alarm clock away from my bed and the one time I did have to turn on the podcast I covered the top of my phone so I couldn't see the time on it while hitting the play button.  This has been, by far, the biggest improvement to my sleep yet.  Instead of nights being strings of me constantly waking up and trying to get back to sleep, nights have become...  Almost normal, even if I feel the next day like I briefly recall waking up a few times.  Why's that?  Because the mere act of looking at the time when I woke up only served to wake me up further.  I'd calculate how much sleep I got and dwell on how little I had slept, or how little time I had left before I would have to get up.  Yet by resisting this, and just staying in bed and keeping my eyes closed, it feels like I've been able to get back to sleep whenever I've waken up so quickly that I can't remember I was awake at all.

On top of that, I've begun settling into a routine.  Because of my work schedule I've always preferred going to bed around 4am and sleeping until 11 to noon.  So lately, once 3am hits I'll take two of the Luna pills and start to wind down whatever I'm doing on my computer (which has long had F.lux installed on it to help with the blue light issue).  At 3:30 I'll turn off my computer and the lights, go to the bathroom and if needed take some ibuprofen (I've been having frequent headaches due to lack of sleep) and/or ranitidine if my stomach acid issues are acting up (they can end up keeping me awake).  I'll then sit down in the living room (NOT in my bed) and play an episode of the Lore podcast.  Reading or something similarly relaxing and distracting would probably also work, but I want to make sure I'm avoiding looking at a backlit screen.  I like Lore for this because the episodes are short enough to fit in that half hour time frame, self-contained so it doesn't leave me wanting to hear more to see what happens, and despite the more macabre material the music and his voice just make it a very mellow podcast to chill out to.  This helps to calm my mind, helping it shut down before bed.  Once it's done it should be around 4am, so I'll go to the bathroom one more time to try and squeeze out anything left so I don't have to go during the night and then hop in bed making sure my alarm clock's turned away from me.  Before I know it I'm usually asleep.

In the end, like probably most spontaneous insomnia I figure this has all been caused by the anxiety of not sleeping.  It first came when I got sick at the beginning of January, and sickness tends to cause my sleep to get disturbed.  But I was so worried about it that very worry ended up making things much, much worse.  And every night when I woke up, looked at the time and saw how little sleep I was getting just kept the cycle going.  But I feel I've finally managed to break that cycle by ensuring that even if I do wake up there's nothing notable that can happen to kick my mind in gear.

So here's hoping this continues to work for me.  A month of insomnia has been the longest it's ever hit me, usually it just pops up for a week or two and only manifests as difficulty falling asleep, not the difficulty staying asleep that has also been a problem recently.  With any luck this will be the last post I feel like making on here."
Doesn't it just scare you knowing you won't be able to fall asleep tonight :(,I cannot find out my fucking reason for my insomnia and I thought it go away after 2 years....
Surprisingly huge drop in price for my medication,"Hello there. 

I've had insomnia since I was about 13. I'm in my 20s now and I only recently started trying to treat it with medication in 2015. I could never afford it though because the total would always come out to be almost $100 for 30 pills and that was for the generic form of ambien. I recently renewed my prescription and now it's become less than $20! This is great because now that it's so affordable I can use it to regulate my sleep schedule instead of sleeping every other month. "
have not slept for 3 days.. i need help please,"i use to take seroquel 100mg-200mg.. but i have a new doctor and change it my mood stabilizer to lamotrigine. 

I'm having problems with the sleeping medications he gave me, its not working:
- trazodone 50-100mg i started vomiting 
- doxepin 10-20mg it doesnt work low dosage
- hydroxyzine pamoate 50-100mg currently on not working.

been in this office 3x time and problem is im on a cruise for 5 days and i think im having fever because of the cold weather. 

i would kindly appreciate it.. im just so frustrated i want to cry. 

PS: I explained so many times that i need a higher dosage! i have chronic insomnia since childhood. I need something highly sedating like seroquel. "

"Exhausted by day, alive at night","Hi everyone

I am pretty sure there‚Äôs something wrong with my sleeping pattern.
Every day I feel extremely tired in the afternoon and usually it ends up in me taking a nap. On average I go to bed at 3 and wake up at 6. The rest of the ‚Äúday‚Äù I feel exhausted but stay awake for dinner and seeing my family. At 10pm I go to bed. Suddenly I‚Äôm wide awake and can‚Äôt sleep. As if I just took multiple espresso shots. Around 4am I fall asleep and on weekdays I‚Äôll wake up at 6, when I‚Äôm free it can go from 9-12. 

So I thought I just fucked up my sleeping pattern by taking naps causing me to need less sleep right?

I‚Äôve been forcing myself to stay awake all day, no naps. It‚Äôs been weeks since I slept during the day. I‚Äôll still feel exhausted for the entire afternoon. But as soon as everyone starts to go to bed I feel energized. I don‚Äôt drink any coffee or sugary drinks after 5pm and I try to stay away from my laptop, tv and put my iphone screen on nightmode low brightness. Still can‚Äôt fall asleep before 4am. 


Should I just nap to get some hours of extra sleep or will that make everything worse? Are there other people like me that seem to come alive at night? 

Ps: no jetlag, taking meds for iron and b12, also take medication for hypothyroidism"
Insomnia causing school absences - how do I talk to my profs?,"I'm a college student and I've been dealing with insomnia that appears/disappears over time. In high school, I was driven to school so I didn't really have a choice on whether or not I was going, but now I'll sleep through lectures because I'll get to a point where I can FINALLY sleep after so long, my body will just shut down, or I'm so delirious I know I won't learn anything. 

It's getting to the point where it's genuinely affecting my studies because of participation points, which is affecting my overall mental health and confidence as a student. I need to be able to explain to my professors that I'm not just missing classes because I'm fooling around, I just literally can't sleep and miss them. 

I'm not officially diagnosed but not being able to sleep is a pretty obvious symptom I fill lol. 

I was wondering how people dealt with telling their professors and if you were able to get excused absences / sympathy? I need to not fail. "
Last night,"I beat you last night insomnia, made it to sleep before you came around to chat. Guess you were busy last night, I hope you are busy tonight as well. "
Cannabis as a Sleep Aid ‚Äî Here's What You Need to Know,
Here's a song I made for people who have a hard time sleeping. I hope this can help you and put you in a relaxed state of mind.,
Have insomnia? don't panic...here's some advice,"So it's easy to hit the panic button when you stop sleeping.  And when I stopped sleeping I hit the panic button hard because I soon found myself going completely sleepless for multiple nights in a row.  This was truly incredible after being a professional sleeper my whole life. 

My wicked stint of insomnia lasted for over a year.  That was over 10 years ago and I sleep fine now.   The point is this: The first thing you need to know is that if you have been a good sleeper for all or most of your life, then your sleep will almost certainly turn around. Generally sleepers will be sleepers.  They may have ups and downs but eventually sleepers even out to be good sleepers again.  So take heart.   It's like baseball:  .300 hitters, they say, will be .300 hitters.  They may have a bad year here or there, but these types of hitters will eventually turn it around to become .300 hitters again.   You are no different in regards to sleep.  So before you panic and go off thinking the worst, remember this; your situation will most certainly turn around.  Just be easy on yourself in the meantime.

So keeping the aforementioned in mind, I want to tell you something about insomnia:  For me, a bad night's sleep would sometimes make it a bit more difficult to go to sleep the next night.    There was something about my brain that just didn't feel the same. Like it was tight, stressed (cortisol rush?), and even though I was exhausted, I tended to not get sleepy, at least not at the right times;  at night my sleepiness would be replaced with panic and I wouldn't sleep. 

On the contrary, if I slept good one night, the next night would often be good too.  After a while I started noticing the trend that sleeping well often springboarded more good sleep.  There is something about sleeping that relaxes your brain and allows you to sleep easier, almost effortlessly sometimes.   

Even nowadays I generally sleep really well -- for months at a time...but if I have a tough night, it often remains tough for a few nights in a row.   I don't say this to scare you but rather so you can know that this may be normal.  And as frightening as this idea may be, it actually comforts me knowing the truth about it and knowing that my sleep will eventually turn around if I don't freak out and think my life is over. 

Some of the things that help me get out of a bad sleep rut are: 

1. not staying in bed all day -- get upright (sitting or standing) as much as possible, even in the evening. at least periodically. 

2.  Learn the art of yawning.  Especially in the evening.  Yawning brings more oxygen to your brain and helps it relax.   Yawning often triggers lots of yawning, which triggers real sleepiness. 

3. learn the art of distraction. Distraction is about the only real fix for fear.  Keep your mind occupied reading or watching something on tv or something you like doing. btw...computer-watching at  night can be detrimental to getting sleepy! beware....be careful. 

4.  Go to bed at a reasonable time.  I like the 10:30 - 11:30 range. We have natural sleep rhythms and various chemicals that help us go to sleep at different times of the night. These chemical waves come and go.    If you choose to go to bed at 1 or 2 am, for example, you've chosen to skip one of those waves.  

5.  Don't ""try"" to go to sleep.  Instead, try to dream.  Try to get lost in your thoughts.  Distract yourself and enjoy yourself while in bed.  Being asleep is just another stage of being awake.  You are not knocked out or unconscious when you sleep; you are just as alive and conscious there as you are in the real world.  Just relax, be easy on yourself use your thoughts to put you in another place.   Good luck, Tom"
