7,"My biggest regret First, some context.

So I broke up with my girl friend, of 6 months, two days ago. It was my first long term relationship, and I seriously considered marrying her in another 6 months (we’re both in the military; and in training). Long story short (kinda), I got some bad news about her, from an anonymous source, while I was apart from her for a month. I took it out of context and basically made the next month hell for her. She put up with me because she did feel like she made a mistake, and felt like she had make it up to me by listening to my bullshit. When I finally got done training she was cold to me, and it took a weekend of me being ignored to make us both realize that the relationship was over. 

Anyway this is a poem I wrote to help me deal with the heartache.



Jeni


Now that she’s gone I can do what I want
Now that sh’e gone I can screw who I want

Now that she’s not in my life I can do more
No More ball and chain to hold me down

Haven’t been this free in 6 months
Go around to any bar, and show up these chumps

Find a new girl to fill the hole
Find a new girl to complete my soul

They say to not give a fuck
But I guess it just not my luck

I gave all I had to that girl
I fear I have nothing to give to the next

A man of twenty and two years old
Has never felt anything as cold
As a women that was his
Be lost by his arrogance 

It’s crazy what I could have had 
If I had not acted like a chad

But now that she’s gone there is no holding back
I could go anywhere with just a rucksack 

But nothing will ever feel the same 
Because I know I am the one to blame

But I finally tried something that is always suggested here: melatonin !

For real! Melatonin works wonders! I wish I tried it sooner! I just got some 3mg of melatonin and take it half an hour before I want to sleep and it has been great!

Any ideas to help? "
24,"Mental distractions to help you sleep for when you’re too anxious to read before bed? I’m usually too anxious to read before I sleep, so I have a hard time paying attention. Instead, I’ve been focusing on breathing while I try to think of a story in my head. It helps to divert from the anxiety and be sort of fun. Does anyone else do this?

I think of a character who isn’t based on a person. I think of what they look like and what their values are. Then I think of something they want or need. Then some sort of event or conflict... and I go on and on. You get it... it’s a story, but it’s being surprisingly effective in beating back the malaise that hits when you’re alone with your thoughts trying to fall asleep.

Does anyone else have a mental exercise like this? 

Good luck, everyone "

**ENVIRONMENT**

**Tip 1: Make your bedroom completely dark**

So the first step is to make your bedroom completely dark, because the blue light from street lamps and other sources will affect your circadian clock, which will delay the production of the sleep hormone melatonin.                              

**Tip 2: Avoid blue light from all your electronic devices**

Tip number two is to avoid the blue light from all of your electronic devices before bed time. Personally, I turn off all electronic devices an hour before bed and use that time for reading or journaling, which is much more productive than what I otherwise would have used that time for. If that's too much for you, it's also possible to make many of your electronic devices emit less blue light. For your computer, you can download F.lux. For your android device, you can download ""Twillight"", and for iPhone, there is a built-in feature called ""night shift"". It's also possible to set some websites like YouTube and Reddit to ""night"" mode, which will remove a lot of the white light, which is beneficial since white light contains all colors and therefore also the blue light we try to avoid. Otherwise you could also just buy some blue light blocking glasses.

**Tip 3: Make your bedroom cold**

Tip number three is to make your bedroom cold before bedtime. Our core body temperature starts dropping when it's bedtime, so if your bedroom is too hot, it will prevent this natural process from happening. Therefore, the recommended temperature for your bedroom when sleeping is 60-67 degrees fahrenheit, which is about 15.5 to 19.5 degrees celsius.

**Tip 4: Invest in a high quality pillow and mattress**

Tip number four is to make sure you have a high quality ergonomic pillow and mattress that will support your body in its natural curvature. You spend a third of your life in bed, so it's worth investing in.

**Tip 5: Get fresh air in your bedroom**

Now the fifth tip is to make sure that the air in your bedroom is fresh. Houseplants like the peace lily can improve the air quality -- reducing contrentations of benzene, x,x,x,x. --, and therefore, also your sleep. I've included a link to an infographic in the description where you can read more.

**Tip 6: Remove unwanted noise**

The sixth tip is to reduce unwanted noise in your bedroom. Even if you don't wake up because of noise, it can still interfere with your sleep quality. If many inconsistent noises keep you awake, you could consider either getting some ear plugs, or otherwise playing some white noise or ambient sounds.

**Tip 7: Keep your alarm out of hand's reach**

Tip 7 is to keep your alarm clock away from you when you sleep. Watching how much time you have left for sleep can cause unnecessary stress, and therefore make it harder to sleep. If you have trouble with snoozing, then place the alarm clock somewhere that forces you to leave the bed upon waking up, and therefore causes you to start the day immediately.

For the next 7 tips, you do have to change yourself, or at least your behaviour.

**BODY**

**Tip 8: Start exercising**

Tip eight is that you have to start exercising, since it will increase the build up of adenosine in your brain, which will make it easier for you to fall asleep at night. Just make sure that you are done training at least an hour before bed, because training is a stimulating activity.

**Tip 9: Eat healthy**

Tip nine is to eat healthy, so your body has all the nutrients it needs to repair itself during the night. In one study, researchers controlled people’s diets, and saw that eating more sugar, more saturated fats and less fiber was linked to lighter, less restorative sleep, with more awakenings. If your sleep quality doesn’t improve upon implementing the other strategies, maybe your diet is the main culprit.

**Tip 10: Don't eat too much or too little before bed**

Tip number ten is do not eat too much or too little before bed time. Eat up till 3 hours before you plan to sleep, but with that said, if you come home late, then it's better to eat something compared to nothing, but don't be tempted by sugary foods, since this can lead to sugar cravings and overeating. It’s worth experimenting since this varies person to person.

**Tip 11: Don't drink too much before bedtime**

Tip eleven is don't drink too much before bed. Make sure you are hydrated throughout the day, but don't drink too much 1 to 2 hours before bed, since you will risk having to get up in the middle of the night to pee.

**Tip 12: Get rid of stress**

Tip number twelve is to find a way of getting rid of stress before bed time, since during stress your body releases glucocorticoids such as cortisol, which wil keep you awake. A good way of getting rid of stress, that I personally use, is to have a bedtime ritual, where you spend some time meditating, stretching, reading or something else to relax before bed. Having this bedtime ritual primes your brain to enter a relaxing state more easily, so it will be easier to fall asleep.

**Tip 13: Reduce or eliminate Alcohol and Cannabis consumption**

Tip thirteen is to reduce or eliminate Cannabis and alcohol consumption. Cannabis and Alcohol may help people fall asleep faster, but will reduce the time spent in REM sleep, which is a necessary part of the sleep cycle where we dream.

**Tip 14: Get sunlight in the morning**

Tip number fourteen is to get sunlight as soon in the day as possible, since this will wake you up and reset your body's circadian rhythm, and your body will therefore know when it's time for sleep at night.

**Tip 15: Don't sleep on your stomach**

Tip fifteen is to not sleep on your stomach. Unless you can breathe through your pillow, you'll have to twist your neck, which can give neck and back problems, which will make your sleep quality worse. So sleep on your back or on your side. If you are prone to sleep apnea or snoring, then sleeping on the side can help.

And now the last 3 tips has to do with the timing of your sleep.

**TIMING**

**Tip 16: Consistent sleep schedule**

Tip sixteen is to have a consistent sleep schedule. A good way of letting your body know when it's time for bed is to have a consistent sleep schedule. So you should aim for getting to sleep and waking up at the same time everyday. Even on weekends. Naturally, life happens, so do not fret if your sleep gets dysregulated, instead, just revert back to a consistent routine as soon as possible.

**Tip 17: Take naps**

Tip seventeen is to take naps. Taking a nap has many health benefits, and the best time to do it is around 2 or 3 pm. The ideal duration of a nap is approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Doing it much longer or too late in the evening can interfere with your circadian rhythm, and therefore, interfere with you ability to fall asleep at night.

**Tip 18: Wake up during light sleep**

Tip 18 is to wake up in light sleep. When we sleep, we go through 4 sleep stages. 3 of the stages are Non-R.E.M. sleep and the fourth stage is R.E.M.-sleep, where most of our dreams occur. The goal is to wake up during stage 1 of non-R.E.M. sleep, which is our lightest sleep. Many people think it's possible to calculate when to wake up, because an average sleep cycle is 90 minutes. But the problem is that 90 minutes is just an average and can vary by more than 30 minutes each way! So another option is to download an app for your smartphone that will analyze your sleep patterns and wake you up during light sleep. Currently, no studies have investigated their effectiveness, but it seems to work for many people, but one study does show that after people start tracking their sleep with these sleep apps, it helps them get into the habit of sleeping longer, so it may be worth a try anyway.

Don't sleep on your stomach. Unless you can breath through your pillow, you'll have to twist your neck, which can give neck and back problems, which will make your sleep quality worse. So sleep on your back or side. If you are prone to sleep apnea or snoring, then sleeping on the side can help.

   
 

Tip 11:

Eat healthy, so your body has all the nutrients it needs to repair itself during the night. 

   
 

Tip 12:

Make sure you are hydrated, but don't drink too much 1-2 hours before bed, since you will risk having to get up in the middle of the night to pee.

   
 

Tip 13:

Find your way of getting rid of stress before bed time, since the release of cortisol doing stress will keep you awake. A good way of getting rid of stress is to have a bed time ritual, where you spend some time before sleep meditating, stretching, reading or something else to relax before bed.

   
 

Tip 14:

Get sunlight as soon in the day as possible, since this will reset your body's circadian rhythm, and it will therefore know when it's time for sleep at night.

   
 

Tip 15:

A good way of letting your body know when it's time for bed is to have a consistent sleep schedule, so you aim for getting to sleep and waking up at the same time everyday. Even on weekends. 

   
 

Tip 16:

It's okay to sleep longer if you are in sleep debt, but if you find yourself needing more than 9 hours of sleep every night, then this can be unhealthy.

   
 

Tip 17:

Taking a nap has many health benefits, and the best time to do it is around 2 or 3 pm. The ideal duration of a nap is 20 to 30 minutes. During it much longer or to late in the evening can interfere with your circadian rhythm, and therefore interfere with you ability to fall asleep at night.

   
 

Tip 18:

If your alarm wakes you up in the midle of deep sleep or rem sleep, then you will feel groggy and tired, so aim for waking up during light sleep. "

59,"A sleep for two hours had part two of a horrible nightmare woke up and it's officially my birthday. I had a dream like maybe a year ago that me and my husband went an looked at these condos. In real life we are home owners and we have a pretty small house but we love it. In the dream the condos we're like 4 story loft condos. So like each level was one entire condo but no walls devided them. And a shared large yard/dog park in the from of the building. So in the dream we liked them and decided to buy one. I think that was pretty much my first dream. I woke up and just thought it was funny how the condos didn't have any walls and you had to hear and breath your neighbors air, cooking, everything. I told my husband about the dream and we both had a good laugh.

Tonight, I innocently go to sleep, not knowing what crazy shit my brain has in store for me. Upon slipping into a snoozing unconsciousness part two begins...

Now it's apparently been the right amount of time to wait before moving into this condo. So my husband and I and my daughter go to check it out. This time it was in the evening when people are home. Upon driving up there are like 50 dogs in the dog park/yard/field running around and dog shit everywhere. Also there is a horse sized pig who is lactating and is squirting breast milk constantly. I ask a person with their dog about the pig and person said ""oh she's a miniature pig pet"". It was huge! So we go see our condo and realized it's much worse than we originally thought. There are events going on in each condo and it's clear the condos are being rented out for like AirBNB or parties. Our was the middle floor. The condo took the open concept to the extreme and there were no walls, just railings breaking up the rooms. Then my husband says we need to get out of this. So I'm on my phone and some how realize we didn't actually sign anything. So we find the office and explain everything and they tell us we can move in and pay for a mortgage or declare bankruptcy. My husband was not talking and just kept saying ""you're in charge of the money, you need to fix it!"" My daughter was crying because she wouldn't get a bedroom and in my dream stared having a panic attack. I woke up at this point it took me a few minutes of laying in because thinking it was all real before realizing I was dreaming.

And it's midnight here so it's officially my birthday now!

63,"Guess I’m starting my day at 2:30am I work 12 hour nights shifts. 7 days on, then I get 7 days off. I like to adjust my sleep time so that I sleep during the night when I’m off work. I can usually completely reverse my sleep schedule the day I get off work. I get home at 7am and take a nap for 3-4 hours and then I’m able to make it to the end of the day when I’d normally sleep, usually around 9pm. This has worked for me for the last 2.5-3 years I’ve worked nights but the last several months I’ve had trouble falling asleep. I’ll lay in bed for 1 or 2 hours before fully falling asleep. But in those 1-2 hours it’s like my body is teasing me, because I’ll get into a half dreaming state several times and then I’ll be completely awake and just repeat that cycle until finally falling asleep. It’s frustrating because it doesn’t really feel like real sleep when it happens. The weird part is that when I’m working and I get home at 7am I am able to fall asleep with almost no issue, maybe 15 minutes and I’m out like a light. Anyone else sleep better during the day? Anyway, now when I’m going to bed at night I get really bad “sleep anxiety” (what I’ve started calling it) because I know what I’m in for and it just contributes to the difficulty falling asleep. Last week when I was off work I started sleeping on the couch because now I just associate my bed with that sleep anxiety and I actually had an easier time falling asleep on the couch recently. 

Yesterday I got off work for the week and took my morning nap but was pretty tired so I retired around 8pm. I moved all my sleep accoutrement (blanket, alarm clock, fan for noise) to the living room anticipating a good nights sleep. I feel the sleep coming on, but.... oh great I’m in the half-dream/awake cycle again. Queue anxiety. So it’s the same ole’ same ole’, laying there for probably two hours before I get any semblance of actual sleep, but it does come. Then I’m wide awake. “Aight cool I guess I beat my alarm by a little bit” (I wake up at 5am, I hate sleeping late). I check my phone and.... 1:30am. Kill me dead. I use the bathroom, get a drink of water and try to go back to sleep but my body ain’t having none of that. After an hour I give up and just start my day like normal because maybe by 9pm tonight I’ll be good and tired and maybe get some sleep. I guess I’ll move back to my bed tonight, since now the couch will probably give me sleep anxiety. Might as well be comfortable if I’m gonna be miserable.

I've finished the individual assignment which was just to take notes while reading some pages in our big ass textbook, but I still have to come up with two questions to initiate a discussion in a group.

I've read about America's ""gilded age,"" ""Social Darwinism,"" and the many ideals regarding labor and socialist ideals for America. But the thing is, I've absorbed all this information and learned about it, but I don't even have an opinion on all this.

The question ""What do you think?"" never resonates with me. I feel like I don't have enough experiences in the world to truly come up with an original idea I could properly communicate to another person. But it applies to other assignments as well, not just everyday conversation. I've passed the online discussion assignments from last quarter's history class only because I read someone else's posts and used one of their opinions for my own post.

110,"The most perfect girl and my stupidity. Yall wanna talk about stuff after? I know that this title is so bland and it wont garner much attention. It is of course my
first post ever but I felt that I need to get this off of my chest and I would like to see
what others may think. Before I even begin, I don't know how to describe the way I
have been feeling of why I do the shit I do. I guess I'll start.
I first met her approximately a year ago. I met her at a camp but me being the crazy
person I was, never tried to interact with much people and instead tried to bring chaos
through any means. I really was something before. Breaking people's trusts and
gathering information to set up shit. It was something I just sort of had going on for me
because I never really felt much. I saw her and I guess had a crush the first time but
brushed it off as just teenage hormones at its work. She was another pretty and smart
girl that eventually I would never see again and would probably never understand me.
Fast forward a couple 6 months later as the new school year began. The last person I
would expect to see at my school would be her. I was kinda still weird and really didn't
want her to see that I liked her so I tried to ignore her as much as I could. I only had
her in one class and she sat not so far away from me, so I believed I would go through
the school year without her talking to me or me ever talking to her again after a year.
Then Student Council came and guess who showed up. The last person I would want
there was there and I had to not show her my vulnerability. I would keep seeing her at
student council and in the hall and would learn she was actually on par with me on
intellect [This sounds very Narcissistic, but others in my school call me the smartest,
which I really don't like, but eventually i learned to accept some stuff :)]. So I decided
to I guess disguise my ""lust"" with a mask of sorts. I would put on a character as I
would do when I would try and get comfortable with people and gain their trust and
shit. I was used to it and once I found out she had a boyfriend already, I was satisfies
and at an unease. I was glad I didn't have to worry about her anymore, but at the
camp I believed she had one already. The quarter passed by and I would become
friends I guess with her. I would one day decide to talk to her and ask her for her
scores on the tests we took before our break. This was definitely the biggest turning
point in my life.
I tried to make the talk seem about just the tests when i just wanted to talk to her, but
me being the ""genius"" I was, I decided to joke about manipulation to imply I play
around with people. It's a small test I use on people. They would either brush it off as a
funny joke and write me off as a crazy jester or think I'm some weirdo. I'm fine with
either, trust me. But then she took it literally as I always try to imply it and opened up
to me and said she used to do the same. I was startled at first, as she was the last
person I would think would go as far as to hurt people through their trust and shit.
Again, I had to do it and took a leap of faith and asked another question. My theory
was that maybe she comprehends things in many lights because she went through
some stuff as I did which ended up pushing ourselves to the point of becoming
""intellectuals"" :). These risks I take are something I love and hate about myself.
[foreshadowing 0.0]. We went back and forth with these questions about things I would
never ask anyone because if I did I am very sure they would call me crazy and its very
different than being thought as crazy. We spoke about life, religion, and well I am glad I decided to talk because we would stay up to 4 am talking all night, every night, for 2
weeks of break. I can't say much about what we talked because I feel that would be
disrespectful, and well this was the beginning of something beautiful. We were way too
similar in many ways I was amazed. It really hasn't been a long time, but I feel that
that was the time I felt real true happiness at its most.
She was all I could think of. Hell I still think about her every day and anytime that I
can. We are way to similar and she was beautiful. I felt very uncomfortable and
superstitious about it as I thought well this might not end well. I didn't tell her that but
we went on to talk about the odds of this. We both believe in the possibility of anything,
and well we knew well enough that the way we both thought so similarly was erie but
somehow, maybe something was happening. Destiny or God's work? It kept getting
better and better as every passing second we would bounce back ideas and I never
wanted to stop talking. We were insomniacs so it sleep was no problem :). I can't tell
you how great I felt... but something was off. As I've said, I grew up different. I never
felt much as I grew up in a bad household and I felt the need to ""dispose"" of emotions
in a way to benefit my studies as I felt it was a survival of the fittest. She grew up in a
bad household too, but she took different approaches to many things and ended up as
a different version of me.... or I ended up as a different version of her lol. Anyways,
those small differences were the things that set her apart and were the things that I
admired and cared about from her. From that point on, I had to make this decision. I
know. You can call it love. I don't want to. I am happy to say it is something more than
that. I wouldn't say I thought of her as a sister, but I wouldn't want to call her a friend.
Anything with some sort of relationship was out of the question, as I felt that any sort
of relationship always ends. I never wanted this to end. I just want to take care of her.
She sort of reminded of a smaller version of me [Narcissist right here :P], and so I felt I
needed to guide her. I have had these hypothetical situations before in my head if I
met myself as an older or younger self. I had assured myself that both would help each
other out back and forth and both would become theoretically the best. I felt that
through time we would both learn from each other and would never stop and grow to
become what we dreamed together. I trusted her at this point more than others and so
I told her about my plan to learn from each other without telling her how I felt about
her. Of course she understood. I still remember the things she said to me. ""I guess we
are stuck together forever now, huh?"". Of course I was a pessimist at the time, so I
would also play devils advocate to try and find the best solutions together once we
headed back to school. I would doubt her at time and make small references that we
would only understand together. We were inseparable in my opinion. We had a small
running joke that we were mentally unstable which would explain why no one would
understand us and why were were so smart. Without giving too much details away, she
would then go on to tell me that she had these sort of conversations before, which only
made me look up to her more. She told me no one had been so similar though, and so I
felt happier every time I found out something similar between us. Unfortunately, I
believe that the way I used to act would now begin to make my life go downhill.
I was a pretty risky dude. I liked to plan things a lot ahead of time. Seeing that I never wanted to see her hurt in any shape or form, I decided to make a plan. I've told her
how I hate the sight of her being hurt, but she never took it too seriously. She knew I
didn't like it, but argued that she hated it when I get hurt when I do something stupid.
Hey, I'm a dude. I like getting reckless doing stuff I regret at times. It's life. So when
she told me she was in love with one of my friends after her breakup, I began to plan. I
didn't hate her for liking someone. I just don't want her hurt anymore from
relationships. The plan was simple and stupid... but spoiler alert, it worked out and
failed. I was to make it my goal to never have another relationship again until after her
studies because I know how they affect your studies. Either I was supposed to take
care of her from there on out or no one. This is where yall come into play. You can call
me the bad guy for doing this, but know I had to think about it as well and decided to
risk it. If it were to come that she would want more relationships, I would have to make
her see that relationships won't help her. Her parents never accepted any relationships
because they were religious, which is why I never really wanted a relationship with her.
I just wanted to take care of her. Maybe I could make it seem like a relationship but
deny it to anyone as we would both know it wont be one. Anyways, I had to go with
one or the other, and so the latter resulted to work because I managed to show her a
relationship isn't worth her time right now subliminally. The thing was, that it came at
the price of her not seeing me as the same person.
I used what I knew from deceiving people and shit into this. I can't tell you how much I
cared about her. I just want to know if she is fine most of the times and how she was
doing. She would teach me a lot of things, and finally helped me understand emotions
more and control them in a way. She is the reason I do most things. She was someone
many look up to and could talk to anyone. She was perfect. To try and make her leave
relationships, I tried to be affectionate. I would give her compliments on many things.
Keep in mind I wasn't forcing myself. these were things I would think about and she
was fine with hearing me out on a lot of things on my mind. She hated compliments
like me but another goal I had was for her to accept them. The one thing I still cant get
over is her smile. Though she calls it lopsided and not the best, I cant tell you how
much it warmed me up every time she would turn to me in class and smile. We decided
to sit next to each other and every time she would smile and I would get right back to
work giving my 1908374129348% effort. These things would come to an end because I
was selfish. I felt she was too good to be true. If I really wanted her to be safe, then I
really cant make her suddenly have a relationship again. These things end one way or
another. And so, with my planning, I succeeded in hopefully making her back off on
relationships but at the same time back away from me.
I feel stupid now. I still am smart to not get so depressed on it. I truly did love every
night coming to my phone to talk to her for hours on end. If it wasn't for what we had
talked about, suicide would have been a viable option, but I knew what may come of
that. I guess I was smart and stupid. After she told me she wanted space after I tried
to figure out how I should tone down my affection towards her, I wasn't the same. I felt
both happy and sad. Happy that she may be better. Sad that I can't talk to her. Happy
that she is beginning to talk to more people. Sad that she may break the promises we made together and maybe also begin another hopeless relationship where she may get
hurt in. Happy that I may not hurt her or do something stupid or drag her down. Sad
because I don't have much motivation to do things and she wouldn't work on things.
Happy because she showed me to always face problems with a smile. The masks we
used to wore aren't just for show. We can still use them and deceive people with good
intention. I was too stupid and bombarded with these feelings to try and hide how I felt
and ended up confused. I would call it that but my friends would call me depressed.
They would joke about it because that was something we all did. We all called it a form
to get attention but that was far from what I wanted. I wanted less trouble for her and
even worse, my life would eventually start falling apart as I would have people getting
very sick, hurt or even dying in my family. Through so much I managed to keep a smile
when I can because I knew that was what she would have wanted.
I swear I can go on and on but it is pretty late for me and I just hope you can all I
guess have fun at this weird story that is my life. It's not much about love. I have told
her that I loved her so many times because I felt that may be what she would like with
us being so similar. I grew up with little people to care about me and so did she. All
these things led to her not talking to me much before and me trying my best today to
smile on for her and let my emotions talk when they can. It is what defines a human
you know. I guess you could say she saved my life from going down a rabbit hole. She
saved me through an addition and she has told me I came when her life was bad. We
helped each other out and had a very wild ride that hopefully I could continue some
things some other day. Right now I still don't know how to feel. all I know is that I still
care about her so much. She has never hurt me or done nothing bad to me. It was my
actions that brought this. She has told me she is at her highest point in her life. I am
proud to say I am at my highest right now and also somewhat at my lowest. I couldn't
have lived the great life I am living without her. My next step... I'm not too sure. I just
want to know how you all look at this. Am I crazy? Am I right? What is life? I cant sleep because I keep thinking about this. this is my
first post and well I would like to know more people around here and see how every
person can be. She taught me that everyone is unique and special. Maybe someone
else can relate somehow and we can sit back and talk about the universe and reality
and whatnot... you know? thanks for listening"

I know my mom doesn't love me and that my older brothers tried to find any implication that I wanted him to do what he did. They abandoned me and left me to rot alone somewhere. My dad accused me of telling lies when I wouldn't bend to his stupid rules about learning to be a dutiful daughter who's only worth marriage and giving birth before being tossed aside. It seemed like no one wanted to protect me. Not even the schools. I didn't lock my passions and my self away. I didn't bottle myself up and walk away for my favorite things in life. I died and became a breathing writhing mass constantly trying to reconstruct itself and failing every single time and no one gets it. No one sees it.

I can’t recall how we all ended up on the topic of sex, but eventually everyone still at my house is sitting outside of my table and we end up talking about sex. Everything is pretty foggy but I remember going into the house after my friend saying “your window of opportunity is closing” so I go into my house and Ryan follows and I guess we go into the house with the intentions of having sex. This was consensual I did go into my house with this guy and think ok I’m about to have sex and I was ok with that, but as soon as he started I began to feel very uncomfortable. I didn’t enjoy anything that was going on and I honestly just wanted it to be over. He was very aggressive and it was very scary. He choked me and I felt like I couldn’t breathe and was trying to hold me down and restrain me. I’m not against rough sex and I’ve done it before but I felt very uncomfortable with the idea that a complete stranger was being so aggressive with me. 
  
    I have also been talking to my ex’s lot recently and couldn’t stop thinking of her the whole time so that just made things even worse. I tried to tell him to stop what he was doing but the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. It felt like I as stuck. I tried to go along with it hoping it would be over soon but when I realized he was probably gonna be here for awhile I started to panic a little bit. I tried to fake an orgasm so he would stop but that didn’t work and I tried getting up from underneath him but he was way stronger than me. I still hadn’t said anything like stop or no and I don’t know why I didn’t. I knew I was uncomfortable and wanted it to be over with but the words just wouldn’t come out. Luckily my roommates knock on the door trying to be funny and “ruin the mood” but I use that as an excuse to get up. I say to him “I’m over it you can leave now” and he’s shocked. He’s says “you can’t suck my dick until I cum” and I just say no and try to put in this front as if I’m unbothered and act like I already got what I wanted so I don’t care what you want” I go into my closet to put some clothes on and he follow me and tries to turn me around and I say no I’m done leave me alone. I put clothes on as soon as I can and practically run out my front door. 

    As soon as we go outside he’s like talking to his friends telling them he made me cum 3 times and saying I gave him blue balls and stuff. At this point I’m silent my roommates fan tell I’m not ok and I just want them to leave. I say I’m tired and they get the point so Ryan and all his friends leave. As soon as they leave my yard and the gate closes behind them I just start crying.  I start t feel so gross inside like I’m gonna throw up and I just can’t be around anyone. I run into my bathroom and turn the shower on. I’m sobbing but tears don’t come out. I’m just sitting in my bathtub with boiling hot water pouring down on me and I feel like I can’t breathe. I’m grabbing my chest and hugging myself trying to calm down. I can’t stop scratching my neck and arms it feels like he’s still touching me and like someone is going to come from behind me and just pull me toward them. I recognize this feeling. As a child I was abused, so I know what it’s like to feel like something just isn’t right.

   I knew Ryan had triggered something inside me. The aggression was too much. The look in his eye was too familiar, he smelled like someone but I couldn’t remember who. Like cigarettes and cheap wine. Even thinking of it now makes my skin crawl. The water won’t get hot enough. I can see the temperature rising. My shower head has a thermometer in it, so I can literally see the temperature rising. 113 degrees. I take the shampoo off the rack and pout half the bottle in my hands. I start scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing but the feeling doesn’t go away. I can feel him between my legs and it’s won’t stop. I start scrubbing my genitals hoping that I can cleans myself if what just happened but the feeling won’t fucking go away. It’s inside me. The filth. It’s manifesting inside my body and I have to get it out. After scrubbing my skin until it was raw and almost bleeding I lay down on my side in the bathtub. I just stare at the side of the bath with a blank expression in my face, wishing I could cry but not being able to force out a single tear. 

   The feeling still won’t go away. I keep thinking about how I can cleanse myself. I have a usual ritual for these kinds of situations. 
Run the bath water without filling up the bath for half an hour 
Run the shower while sitting in the bathtub for another half hour 
Scrub scrub scrub
Shampoo my hair 3 times 
Purge 
Purge again 
Purge again. 
So that’s what I did. 
I lean over the drain and take my finger and put them in my mouth. 
I push them as far back as they go into my throat and just like that I can feel it all come out.
But one time is enough. I have to get rid of it all. So I do it again, and again, and again. 
I layback down with my thighs clenched. The feeling is still inside of me.  

     My roommate is fully aware of the self damage I like to partake in so he has already taken all sharp objects out of my bathroom. But that doesn’t stop me. 
I take the sharpest thing I can find. Which isn’t very sharp at all. And start slashing my upper arm. Keep in mind this thing isn’t very sharp. It’s just a hard piece of plastic I found, so it’s very hard to break the skin, but the feeling of inflicting even the slightest pain into myself give me so much relief. Still I haven’t cried. After laying in my bathtub for around 2 hours thinking what I had done. Thinking of my ex girlfriend who I love so much. I decide to get out of the bath tub. When I get out of the bathroom the girl that had introduced me to Ryan was still in my house. Laying in my roommates bed that we share sometimes because we’re waiting for another to be delivered. One of my roommates asks if I’m ok and I can’t even answer. He hands me a cigarette and I try to ask for a lighter. He touches my should trying to console me and I start crying. Tears finally come out but it’s too much to handle. I give him the cigarette and run back into my bathroom. 

   I sat down in my toilet and out the corner of my eye I see a razor blade my roomates had forgot about. I pick it up and start cutting my upper arms. This time it feels so much better. The blood calms me. It makes me feel something. After cutting a few good times I roll my sleeve down and make another attempt to go into the living room where everyone is. One of my roommates is asleep with the girl on the mattress and my other roomates is still awake. He asks if I want to smoke and I say yes. We went into the porch and sat in silence for a minute before I find the energy to say “I never want to see him again” and he says “you don’t have to” I explain to him that I couldn’t stop thinking of my ex and that he was too rough and then I tell him I’m going to sleep. 

   I stand up and he follows. He gives me and hug and for a second I felt safe. I try to go to sleep in my bedroom in the floor like I have done before many time but I can’t shake the feeling. The lights coming in my the street are too bright and the smell of the air is making me scared. I don’t feel safe at all. Usually I sleep in the same bed as one of my roommates but since that girl decided to fall asleep I had no room. I decide that maybe I’d feel safer in my closet. So I bring my pillow and my blanket and fall asleep in my closet. The next day comes and the feeling is still here. "
168,"Too scared to sleep now I was doing so well getting to sleep after finally getting off Lexapro..it's been hard, especially with my anxiety ramping up right at bedtime because I don't know why. Melatonin, NyQuil, and Benadryl (not all at the same time, I alternate them) have been helping, along with reading ebooks til I can't see straight.. I've even been lucky enough to fall asleep before midnight a few times. Great, right?

So, tonight, I'm doing my usual reading, getting kind of sleepy...keep feeling a hair or something tickling the side of my face. It won't stop no matter how many times I try to brush it away. I panic when I realize it's moving, and slap the shit out of whatever it is. I turn my phone light on just to reassure myself that it wasn't a spider or something like that and I just slapped myself for no reason. But no, there's a dead spider right next to my pillow. I'm horrified. 

I'm trying sooooo so hard to convince myself that it's dead now and there's no way that can happen twice in one night, but sleep is nowhere in sight. I even took an extra Benadryl and I guess that little adrenaline rush is just cancelling all that out. 

Fuck spiders, man."

So I'm still uprooting my life and moving away, yet I'm not sure how it's all going to work out.
Everything is changing so rapidly and then changing again. I feel lost and alone. Awake and feeling sorry for myself. Leaving the TV on so I'm not alone with my thoughts.

173,4th Freaking Night Life is going super well! I am tiring out my body and mind and following a bedtime ritual. I'm happy and my anxiety is down. But its the FOURTH NIGHT IN A ROW that I cannot sleep.
174,"4:16 on a Tuesday Morning I check my watch. 4:16. It has only been a few minutes since last I checked it. I sit in the chair nervously tapping my foot. Sweat has begun to drip down the side of my head. I worry for her. When I brought her here, the people at the front desk looked at her like she was already gone. Looked at me with sympathetic eyes. Like they knew it was all over for me. I check my watch again. 4:17. The doctor was supposed to come back at 3:30 with the results. That's what he told me. I look down at my hands. They are covered in blood. In her blood. She bled right through that rag I put over the wound to stop the bleeding. My foot starts tapping even more now. I am becoming more scared and impatient than I have ever been before. Is she alright? Did I rush her to the hospital fast enough? Are these doctors even able to save her life? Another thought passes over me. Our health insurance. It was cancelled several days ago. They won't be able to pay for any of this. We don't have any money to cover it either. I stop myself from thinking about this. How can my thoughts be about this right now? She is in intensive care, only a few hallways away. She is more important than money. Besides, we'll find a way to fix this money issue. We've overcome everything before. At this, I'm reminded about all the times we've shared together. All the memories we made. When we went out to our first date at that dusty arcade. When we spent a whole night lying in her backyard, looking up at the stars. When I took her out to see a movie, and was nervous the whole time, until she grabbed me by the tie, pulled me close to her, and kissed me. So many memories with this girl. It's been 4 years since we made those particular memories. Our first memories together. I can't seem to recall much else in those four years though. Maybe it's because of how stressed and tired I am. I look back at my watch. 4:17. It hasn't even been a minute, yet it feels like an eternity of sitting in this chair. Finally a man approaches me in the waiting room. ""Doctor?"" I ask. He glares at me. Looks at me like I am a monster. ""Doctor? What is happening in there? What is going on with Synthia?"" The doctor continues to glare, but looks almost baffled at me. ""Synthia Marks, your girlfriend, was pronounced dead 5 minutes ago. I thought you might want to know that."" My heart stops. I can barely breathe. He said it so bluntly. How could he say that so bluntly? The love of my life just died. He begins to walk away from where I am sitting. I manage enough breath to ask him how she died. As he is turning the corner, he pauses. He turns to me and looks at me in disbelief. Then he gives a sigh of resentment. ""Fucking junkie."" He walks away. I close my eyes. And it becomes clear to me again. I murdered my girlfriend. I stabbed her 8 times because she wouldn't give me the rent money to buy more dope. I started shooting it into my veins four years ago. A month after we started dating. I open my eyes again. I'm not in a waiting room. I'm in a police Precinct. I am handcuffed to a chair. It has been mere hours since the police came to the hospital to arrest me. I am a murderer. I am an addict. I will be sent to the chair, or stabbed in prison for what I have done. My shitty life is over. And as I think about loosing my love, and my life in a single day, one thought appears in my head: I could really use a fix right now."

(I've tried all these things through the course of school last year as well) I have no idea what to do anymore. This insomnia needs to end. Insom runs in my family, so I think that's why I can't sleep and I can't really find anything to sooth or help it in anyway.

201,"The canons in the lake beware of the tale that stems from it. ## The canons in the lake #cantsleep

This story stems from a vivid nightmare, I had a couple weeks ago. My cousin told me that I should re-tell my nightmarish dream to the #cantsleep for other people to read. This was by far the weirdest most real dream I think i've ever dreamt. It felt so real to the point that I was confusing my dream with reality. In my sleep I couldn't tell if it was something I was dreaming, a fragment of my imagination or a story I was living. A alternate realty I was sucked into only for the brief duration of my dream. Perhaps a distant memory from a past life, far reach but the universe works mysteriously in many ways or maybe I only dreamt it to provide enjoyment and curiosity to the readers who fall upon on this post. Now I think I've babbled on to much the rest of this post is up to your discretion, can you handle this dream or will you fall victim to imagining it next.

Crystal blue water thats overlooked by a temple on a hill in a small abandoned town. Not many individuals reside in this town as many fear the wrath of the water. Knowing the tale many stay away from the small quaint town, the ones who reside are locals whose families have lived their for generations. Knowing the story they know not to fear but abide the laws set through the tale. If the tale is true or just folklore made up to scare away visitors has never been proven. However, the mysteries left behind those who have broken the rules from the tale are proof enough to others to not to do the same.The tale goes that this beautiful water hides a dark secret.

The tale goes that centuries ago a young peasant female was in hiding from the villagers at the time. As all had the misconception she was a witch at the time witch trials were in action and a very real thing. No one could survive the wrath of the town council nor their suspicions. The fair young lady may have been innocent but an incident where she saved a young child from a major sickness at the time through herbs and prayer led others to believe she was a witch. As how could a illiterate young women know how to save a child. She was not a doctor and had no medical knowledge that known in that time. In suspicions of her identity the villagers set on rampage to hang this women and set ablaze to her body. As that was the only way she could be purified from the devil. In hopes of sympathy from the villagers she ran to the temple overlooking the crystal blue water and begged for forgiveness. Gaining no sympathy she angrily made a vow, that anyone who dares enter the water will not escape her wrath. To stop her from jumping two canons were fired, the first as a tester and the second to warn her. On the third canon she jumped to her death and a final fourth canon was fired on accident, dying instantly from the impact of the water and sinking. Her remains were said to never be found.The time she died 5:30pm. The folklore from this incident was that anyone who dared to go into the water or drink from it or even go near it would hear four canons, the first canon to warn you, the second canon to let you know she's coming, the third canon to let you know you're doomed and the fourth to guiding you to your doom. Those who have mysteriously died are said to have their souls taken and become creatures of the night. These creatures are possessed shape shifters who taken on different appearances to misguided the ones whom are doomed. The canons are heard by the ones who are doomed at 5:30pm everyday until their last. There is no cure for the lake, locals have accepted their fate and guard the lake in fear.

Not aware of the tale of the lake, a group of young teens visit the town where the lake resides. In hopes of a fun getaway weekend these teens arrive ready to party and make the most of their trip. Renting a old cabin near the lake because of the good offer. Little did they know what awaited in the near future. Three of the eight teens are acquainted with the tale and vow to stay away from the beautiful lake near their cabin. While five disregard all warnings and call bull on the tale. In retaliation they go in the lake and have fun not caring and drinking. Once proving the other three wrong they leave and call the the three losers and scaredy cats who fear a old folklore. They assumed the tale was only made to keep teens like them out of the clean crystal blue water. Until 5:30pm like the tale warned the five heard four canons in the background while drinking back in the cabin. Now fearing the tale the five make the decision to cut their vacation short and set out to take the next bus out of town at 10:30pm. When leaving the cabin the five witness the towns people in odd daunting costumes, walking in odd formations and behaving out of norm. Almost possessed like in a zombie like trance. Four of the five are taken aback and set off running saying they can't wait and run off leaving behind one of the five. The one left behind takes off in a different route when one of the innocent three follows suit from the cabin freaked out trying to go home.

In some miracle way the 6 aboard the bus when on the bus home they admit their wrong doings of venturing out into the lake. Its dark outside and the bus is heading on a ominous road, pitch black out nothing can be made out besides from the very dim light in the bus. Water pools start appearing on the road and bus abruptly stops, Little did the teens that a shapeshifter was on aboard. The doors of the bus open and the shapeshifter approaches the group of 6. With cold red eyes it turns into the human eating monster with a mouth of a hundred sharp teeth and a tongue of a snake.

The 6 run out of the bus into the woods where the rest of shape shifters wait. One by one each is cost and appear back in the lake where there doom awaits. The original women appears with eyes black and pitiless as a soulless being and the same appearance as the other shape shifters only bigger and stronger. Saying they denied her warning and ruined her rest she takes her Sharp teeth and bites the head off one of the 6. As the rest shape shifters tear apart and rip apart the other 5. With one vowing they never visited the lake. With one look at each other they attempt to run while then others limbs are ripped off. Running back to the cabin the innocent once warns the rest of their fate where they attempt to flee and hide to no avail shapeshifter and possessed locals surround their cabin breaking it apart piece by piece. One goes into the underground cellar where their are black magic protection spells written on the walls among other things and a skeleton is hung in a circle surround by voodoo things. The lady appears when the one approaches the circle telling her she cannot approach her remains. The one thinks of something in a rash decision prays to the lord and takes a lighter burning the bones. The ghosts screams and fades way.

It's now morning the ones comes back up and all their friends are gone, the house is torn apart and the friends lay surrounded in corpse bodies and remains all around leading back to the lake. When attempted to run away while crying about the loss of their once friends. The police show up and investigate where they rule it to be a cannibal case and the one with their crazy story is put into a insane asylum. The non locals leave and its a year later the cabin mysteriously restored. You are led to see the way to the underground cellar where the Bones are restored and a family approaches the cabin with shots of a cannon in the background."
202,"Idk why I'm awake but I can't go back to sleep I've always had this problem where, once I'm up, I'm up. There is no rolling over & going back to sleep unless the thing that woke me up was external & insignificant (boyfriend talking online, phone ringing, etc.) 

But things like screaming in the night (I live next to a bar), doors opening, or something falling in the room will wake me up. It's like my brain processing the noise fully wakes me up. And then, if I want to go back to sleep it's going to take at least an hour. Which is super frustrating those days when something wakes me up at 5 AM & I have school or work at 8, & was scheduled to wake up at 6. Not getting that hour (especially during the school semester) makes me want to tear my hair out. 

I have no clue why I'm awake right now. It's 4:40, something woke me up at 3:50, & I wanted to be awake at 7. I have a lot of things I wanted to do, well, today so I think that stress caused me to feel wide awake as soon as something brought me out of sleep. It could have been my mom walking around in the house or my cat jumping on the nightstand but these things usually don't wake me up. 

I could also be nervous because I'm having a double date with my bestie & her boyfriend of 3 years tomorrow at an early-ish time. I've never met him since they were long distance & then she moved to be with him. I've had very little interaction with this guy & only know what she's told me - which is no way to judge or get to know a person. I don't even know if he likes tea! And this was my idea! Ugh.

I don't know if I should just go about my morning as if I woke up at a normal time & go back to sleep when I'm sleepy, but I feel like I won't wake up in time to get ready if I do that. If I just continue to lay in bed until I fall asleep I won't be asleep now until 6, & then I likely won't be up until 9, which sucks. I'm an early bird for people my age. I naturally wake up around 7:15-8. 9 is sleeping in. Which I DON'T want to do on a day I planned to game, do Pilates, practice a dance routine for an upcoming show, go on a date, hang out with my friend, update my bujo, work on some project planning stuff for my dev team, & bathe my cat that has fleas :'( 

When I'm up at these times I feel like a car running on the end of it's fuel. I can go for a couple hours but then I'm gonna run out of energy & probably crash. Dear scientists: please make a pill that will instantly make me fall asleep without knocking me out for 5+ hours or make me feel like hell. Thanks. "

204,"My strange story how I got here I was at a party at a friends house not far from mine. I went home on my bicycle, parked it in the backyard and tried to unlock the back door. My key did not work so I walked to my front door but the door would not open because it has locks that keep the door from opening despite having a key. Then I rang the bell three times. No one answered. I even called through the newspaper hole. If someone woke up they probably thought I was a burglar as no one rings at 4 in the morning. I then went back to try the back door again. I must be crazy I used this key this afternoon. Again it did not work. I then came to the idea of going back to my friend. He cannot have fallen asleep yet. I cycled back and rang a couple of times and just when I started to give up on waiting he was there. We then sat downstairs. Charged my phone as it was empty and tried calling my two brothers (fun fact we are triplets) and parents’ phones. No one answered. I then went to sleep on my friends couch where I am laying as of right now. Suddenly I hear my phone vibrate. It was my oldest brother. He asked where I was and I said at my friend and that I am going to sleep. And that is now 20 minutes ago. Now I am on my phone after trying to sleep, typing this while listening to music. Goodnight."

207,"I am ungrateful I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone. My boyfriend is my best friend but he is very stressed with school and fixing his house. So I don’t want to contribute. And my best friend has worse problems than me. I wish I could talk to her but she’s always exhausted with her life so that I feel like I shouldn’t complain about mine. She is barely able to keep up financially [she is a recent college graduate] and her new apartment is in horrible condition with mold and a kicked in door. And she had to pay two rents this month because of the lease. Her parents can’t support her financially. I try to give her suggestions like eating out less and not spending money on things she doesn’t need. To save her money. She says she doesn’t have any money to save. But I know she had random subscriptions. For example: I suggested to only pick Netflix or Hulu but she insists she needs both. I know that hat $12 or so a month saved can add up. Or even not buying that super cute coffee maker wouldn’t make a difference. I wish I could just yell at her and say she is causing herself to be financially unstable but her “friends “ that went to college with her already did. And they seem to not be good friends either. They like to leave her out of group gatherings and they always take her for granted. I’ve told her to find new friends but she insists to be friends with them. These are just a handful of what she has to deal with so when I try to talk to her when I don’t feel well. She usually just says she’s gets what I’m feeling. Which I’m sure she does but we don’t actually talk about anything. I really try my best to help her as we are long distance friends. We both live in two different states. But I feel like a broken record. Trying to help her save money but she just makes excuses for all my suggestions. 

I feel so ungrateful [i tried to tell her about this but she was exhausted from work so I didnt press it]. So my family and I are on a vacation in Europe. We did a cruise and are also stayin in Italy. Don’t get me wrong I know I am so blessed to be able to travel. But I wish to not be here. I don’t know why I would like to buy a plane ticket home to my bed and sleep forever. I miss my dog. It’s not even my dog it’s my boyfriends dog [weve been together about 6-7 years so his dog and I have gotten close, me and the dog often have sleep overs with our my boyfriend] when I feel like this I usually talk to her [the dog] about it and it makes me feel 99x better. But since i am away I can’t talk to her so this is what I have. It’s not like I can’t talk to my boyfriend about anything because I know I can and vice versa. I just can’t bring myself to do it. I don’t even know what is wrong with me. I am on vacation and I have cried myself to sleep 3 nights. I think it’s because I miss my boyfriend or his dog. But I really don’t know. I’ve been kind of talking to my boyfriend but I don’t feel much better. [hes also very tired for some reason and keeps taking many naps through out the day and is a horrible texter] I really wish dogs could text. I just don’t want to get out of bed ever again. My mom wants to go on a tour but I am dreading it because as I said I don’t want to get out of bed. I feel so ungrateful. This is a first world middle class problem. It’s not even a real problem. I basically just want to go home and cuddle next to (my) dog.

209,"The state of Colorado their beliefs and their people. As I have spent time in colorful Colorado I have found that this state is full of spoiled brats who should have gotten their butt's beaten more and for the right reasons, but they practice physical, mental and emotional abuse here like you wouldn't believe or imagine and everyone wants to fit in but what are they really going to lose? The head of the Jefferson county mental health department is just as twisted and the children she raised aren't much better. This state is so big on property and values it's so experiensive to live here by yourself and I swear they push women to look for men who will take care of them and their children. The men pamper the wrong woman who are abusive to them so they in turn are abusive to their spouses. Single women go after married men, I know that is normal but it's like groups of people who live here are all the same and they use grease for a pan or such as massage oil, the convict's and crimals are the enforcers well ex convict's. The foster parents do drugs allow their foster children to be around petifiles, and will even get the children to react so they can put them away to get money from the state.

It's like as soon as I'm left alone to my thoughts it's all I can think about and it genuinely freaks me out. I've tried using a sound generator to play the sound of rain or music to try and concentrate but it blocks out the stories I also tell in my head to try and get rid of them. Right now it's not 1am but I wanted to go to sleep earlier as I'm getting up earlier. The heat is bad as well which isn't helping. Hopefully the rest of you will be able to get to sleep soon

I got up.. continue my pending workload so tomorrow I’ll have lesser work to do.. but whenever I sit and face my computer to supposedly finish or at least continue working on some projects, I end up getting back to bed because I feel so fucking tired when all I did before getting up is just lying on the friggin’ bed.

218,8:00 How come I can never fall asleep when I have something important to do? I don't know if it's just me but I'd say once a week I have a night where I can't fall asleep until 7 or 8 am. But during the school year I would have to wake up at 5:45. So I wouldn't be able to fall asleep to about 3 or 4. Typically it's when something important is happening the next day. Like during the school year it would be a big test or a performance for theatre. But now its going to a freinds house tomorrow. And when I can't fall asleep I always feel super tired. But my eyes won't close. My mind feels tired but my body dosent... Do I have minor insomnia? Or is it just my slight anxiety?

Things I know aren’t real but things none the less. I began drawing these things but all the drawings are just jumbled up messes of lines that remotely look like figures. The idea of what it was I saw keeps changing in my head and I draw different features from what I had begun to draw before. There is only the clock ticking away that I can hear.

295,"Can't stop thinking about her I woke up at around 5 am after only about 4 hours of restless sleep. Don't know what woke me up, but I can't get back to sleep because I can't stop thinking about her. (We'll call her C) It all started about 7 years ago when I was a sophomore in high school. I had just started dating C's cousin (we'll call her A). A is a year older than me, C is 2 1/2 years younger. When A first introduced us, C hated my guts, mostly because I was dating her cousin.  Towards the end of my junior year, A and I broke up. After she graduated we basically never spoke again. Those last few months were hell though as we had several classes together and mutual friends. 

So my senior year, which was C's freshman year, we started to become very close friends. I started to develop feelings for her, but I just pushed them down because I thought it would be weird considering I had been dating her cousin less than a year ago. So I graduated and went off to college. Nearly as far away as I could be without leaving the country, went from Alaska to Pennsylvania. It didn't go well but that's a story for another day. Honestly my life is a mess.  For the year I was there I talked to her on a daily basis. And my feelings for her only grew stronger, even as I was seeing a couple other girls. 

At the end of my second semester I dropped out and went back home.  I had arranged to take her to see one of her favorite bands live at that years state fair. I was hoping that by then she would be my girlfriend. We had made other tentative plans for the summer, but we both ended up being too busy and could just never find the time. 

So the state fair comes around, we go, and talk a little bit about the possibility of us dating. She basically says that she doesn't want to date anybody at the time. (I know, that was a load of crap but i fell for it at the time.) A couple weeks later I said something dumb, can't remember what, and we didn't talk for a while. And during that time, I found out that she had started dating someone soon after we went to the fair. Obviously I was pretty hurt, and didn't talk to her for even longer. 

At the time I had no idea what I was gonna do with my life. I eventually decided to enlist in the Air Force, and went off to basic that spring, march of 2015. That in itself was one of the better decisions I have made in my life up to now. The mistake was the afsc I chose. But I'll get to that in a minute. So after I finished basic training and went off to tech school, we got access to our phones again so I reached out to C. We talked for a while and it was going well. But it didn't last. She is asexual. I am an idiot. I said something ignorant about her sexuality (to this day I still don't know what) that pissed her off and she just stopped talking to me. I didn't find out why until much later. 

So back to my poor choice of afsc. I enlisted as spec ops, which it turned out I wasn't cut out for. I washed out pretty early on, and got an entry level separation (not a honorable or dishonorable discharge). At the time I didn't fell up to facing my father who is ex army, and had wanted me out of the house, so I moved in with my grandparents who live in Utah. This was July of 2015. I didn't talk to C for about 6 months, but thought about her nearly every day. I missed her so much and was miserable the entire time. 

That Christmas I went home to visit my parents. The entire time the only thing I could think about was her and the fact that she was just a few miles away and how nice it would be to see her. However I had no idea how to approach her. 

Christmas morning came around and I decided to just text her and say merry Christmas. So we started talking, but by the time we had worked things out, it was time for me to go back to Utah, so we didn't get to see each other. From then on we were constantly talking, and my feelings came back full strength (they were only shallowly buried to begin with) and proceeded to get even stronger. 

This girl is amazing and perfect for me in every way. She is smart and has nearly an identical sense of humor to mine, she's absolutely gorgeous, and she is so caring for everyone, even people she barely knows. I could go on for days about all the reasons I love her, but that's not what I'm here for. 

So that summer I was hoping to see her again when I went to visit my parents for about a week. The chance to see her actually was a bigger part of my decision to go to Alaska than visiting my parents. But after I had already bought my plane ticket and it was too late to change my plans, we were talking and realized that she was going to Maine to visit family a couple days before I got to Alaska, and getting home the same day I was leaving. So that was another missed opportunity. 

At the time she was dating another guy, so I was still suppressing my feelings for her. It wasn't until that next spring, 2017, when I went on a couple dates with another girl that I realized I was hopelessly in love with C. Around that same time, my dad called me and offered me a job working for him in Alaska over the summer. Also at the same time, C broke up with her boyfriend.  A plan started to form in my head. 

So I talked to my dad and said, yeah, I'll come work for you this summer. I arranged it so that C would be the one to pick me up at the airport (my mother was understandably upset as she had no idea what was going on). In the mean time I was getting pretty flirty with C and she seemed receptive. I planned on asking her out when she came to pick me up at the airport. 

And then everything went wrong. She had a friend ( we'll call him W) who was also romantically interested in her. He had the advantage of being in Alaska, and by the time I figured out what was going on it was too late and it looked like they were gonna date for sure. And then he made some super sexist comments that totally pissed her off. 


So I thought I still had a chance. But before I got to Alaska, a guy from one of her classes in college, asked her out. And she said yes. This was mere weeks before I was gonna be there. So I think to myself( and everybody tells me) this is my last chance, tell her how I feel before things get serious with this new guy. So I talk to her. Tell her that I'm in love with her.  And she tells me that I'm too late because she has a bf now. 

Then I finally get to Alaska. She picks me up at the airport. I get to see her for the first time in nearly 3 years. It's the happiest I've been in nearly 3 years. This entire time, and to this day, I've been fighting with depression because no matter what I do I just can't seem to get anything right in my life. But whenever I'm with her, it all just goes away, and I lose myself in the moment. 

Over the summer we only see each other a few times, not nearly as often as I would have like, because we were both busy with work. But every time I do see her it is amazing and leaves me in a great mood and constantly grinning like the fool I am for about a week. 

About a week before I leave to come back to Utah, I spend one last day with her. We're out hiking, talking and having a good time. And then she says something. ""Stop making me want to move to Utah."" I'm speechless for a moment. And then I ask her about it. And then for the first time ever she admits that she has feelings for me and has seriously been thinking about us a lot recently. It also comes out that she has considered dating me that spring before W came along.  It was then that I realized that if I had just listened to the advice my friend gave me when I first realized how in love with her I was, and just talked to her, we would probably have been dating. (Don't worry, I've already beaten myself up over this plenty. No need to join in.) 

That day we talk a lot about us. She all but promises that if she breaks up with her bf, which she kinda thought was gonna happen pretty soon due to her being asexual and him not being ok with it. It almost seemed like she wanted me to ask her to break up with him, but being who I am, I could never do that to anyone, least of all her. I both wish I had, and am glad I didn't. 

And then I came back to Utah. I almost didn't. A couple months later, I'm scrolling through my news feed on Facebook, and I've been noticing for a few days that She has mentioned or had any interactions with her bf. So I go snooping on her profile, and see that she broke up with her bf and didn't tell me. Naturally my hopes skyrocketed. I don't say anything to her right away, assuming she didn't tell me because she didn't want me asking her out right after they broke up. 

That is when I notice that W (remember W?) is back in Alaska again (he's in the navy so he comes and goes) and he's getting rather flirty with C again. And she is getting kinda distant with me. The exact same shit that happened last spring. So I ask her about it. And this was her reply: ""Things with (bf) didn't really work out and I realized that I've really always had feelings for W. Like even when I wasn't very happy with him I still loved him. We actually started dating 😂 like recently. Yes I was thinking about us, but I honestly shouldn't have said that and I'm so sorry for the inconvenience done to you. And W has nothing to do with why I distance myself from people.""

I got this text 2 hours into a 12 hour shift at work. It broke my heart. But I just bottled it all up and basically shut down for the rest of my shift. When I got home I laid in bed and cried for a couple hours before I finally fell asleep from pure exhaustion. This was the end of sep, 2017. 

For the next couple months I considered it a good day if I made it through without crying. My good days were very few and far between. I would get up, go to work, come home and cry until I fell asleep. My two cats are the only thing that kept me from wrapping my car around a lamppost at 100+ mph. 

I couldn't bring myself to talk to her again until about a month ago when I was finally starting to get back on my feet. Well maybe not my feet but at least up to my knees, rather than face flat on the ground. But talking to her only brought all my emotions back to the surface and sent me back into the depths of my depression. So I am once again not talking to her, even though it's killing me. She is the only thing I want in life, and I will never be able to be with her. 



Tl;dr: I am hopelessly in love with a girl and have been for years who I can't have, even though she has said she had feelings for me before, because she is in love with someone else and is with him. 

I'm at my wits end and only hanging on by a thread. As far as I can see there is no way out of the situation. I can't be with her, but I can't cut ties with her entirely because she means too much to me, both as the woman I love and as my closest friend. "
296,"Work nights / sleeping method Work nights are pretty much the only nights I can’t get hardly any sleep which sucks cause I work factory and I work 10hrs a day, depending on how slammed with work we are it’s 12hrs. I have taken pills and or liquid (z quill for example) for a sleeping method. I’ve also tried to sleep without any lights on and tv turned off. Lol I’ve grown up my whole life falling asleep with tv and or lights on. It sucks. Changing from 17 years of that to now trying to sleep with everything off is actually one of the hardest things to do but I’m trying. Sometimes I’m ignorant and don’t listen to myself. Anyone else have trouble sleeping on work nights like I do? Do you have to take pills and or a liquid to put you to sleep as I do? And do you need something on to help put you to sleep? "
297,"Can't sleep... Obviously.(Warning, probably incoherent) I have this problem every once in a while where I think too much. Particularly about death. I think a lot when I try to sleep. My mind races and processes and plans and....KEEPS ME AWAKE. Seriously sometimes I just want everything to be quiet. Like, I can't just think about one GodDamn thing, it's gotta be every encounter with someone, every reddit post I've read and every song I've listened to for the past week all at once, like going to a best buy, playing a different video on every single TV and turning the volume to max. I used to be able to over come it. The best way for a while was to pick a song that had a lot of background noise and try to concentrate on all the different things I hear in the background. Nine Inch Nails Closer was my miracle song. It used to put me to sleep in 10 min or so.
But now it doesn't work and here I am at my desk wondering what the moon smells like with Lady Gaga's Show me your teeth stuck in my head because I heard it on the radio of a car that stopped at the same red light as me 4 days ago. And thinking about deathSHIT how did I get so far off topic?!
I laid down a couple of hours ago and started thinking and somehow I wandered onto the thought of dying in my sleep. Am I going to wake up? What if I don't wake up? What if I die? What if I never get to say goodbye to me wife? What if she kills herself? And I think oh it wont matter I'll be dead and wont feel anyhting.
AAAAAAAnd then it hits me. The nothing. Trying to imagine dying is a lot lot getting hit so hard you black out. Black. Nothing. Not even nothing. Like, non existence. How can I be me one second and not me the next? Is my soul going to live on? Are all those crazy religious people in the right? Maybe it depends on how you're disposed of... Maybe my body has to be burned to release me so I can move on and start my next life. Or maybe I have to be buried so that when it's time I'll come back with everyone else. What if I get stuck because I choose the wrong one SHIT WHICH ONE FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUUUUUUCK! And then again maybe I'll just slip away into the abyss that is nothing, forever gone, after a lifetime that doesn't even equate to a moment on the great cosmic timeline. I am completely and totally insignificant as far as the universe is concerned. I guess we all are. How did our species get so conceited? We're God's chosen people, or we're enlightened, or we are most liked by the Flying Spaghetti monster. We're not special. In the grand scheme of things we basically just figured out how to wipe our own asses as self aware beings. Fuck we thought we were the center of the universe for a long LONG time.
So that's it then. Nothing.

tl;dr: Can't sleep. I thought too much and had severe panic attack about death.

After a while, I could feel my whole body kind of lock up, but not in a way I couldn’t move, but in a way I couldn’t bring myself to move. It was easy enough to twitch, but moving my limbs was hard as hell. I began to “dream” while still feeling my actual body, so I could feel both my dream body and my real body at once. In my dream, I began to think existential thoughts while floating through space, and there were giant cups everywhere. I went on a long monologue about some bullshit universe thing, using words like “cascading” and “ever-expanding”. It scared the hell out of me, as I could barely control where the existential rant went."

So the movie is either about the white man marching into Africa and trying to colonize the country, OR about slavery itself. Why can’t the light colored lions and dark colored lions live together happily? Why is every dark colored lion labeled as bad and the light colored lions labeled as good? It perfectly describes the race issue that was, and still is, going on in the world. "

I'm also getting really anxious and sweating a lot, these are new symptoms to me, but so are my autism symptoms, I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 16, very late and all these symptoms started affecting me, I was only diagnosed with autism but I feel like I should be diagnosed with a lot more. I have really bad OCD, which leads me to think I am some sort of OCD, I'm anxious a lot so anxiety springs to mind,  and now I'm not sleeping well, so many sleeping disorders spring to mind. I love the dark, this is a vital point to this story. I love the dark, I'm not sure why, I just like the dark. I'll go out walking at 4 am in the night and love it. I think this is why I like to stay awake at night and sleep in the day. I can be really tired, like 3 days without sleep kind of tired and I do feel tired, that's why I'm more worried, is this harming my body? what is happening to me? Why am I like this and can anyone give me any advice please. Should I be doing this? Do I have a sleeping disorder? I'm just a bit confused on everything right now. Please don't get me wrong, I CAN sleep at night, if I'm really really tired, or just feel like sleeping then I'll sometimes be able to sleep, but it seems eventually my sleep pattern always gets turned around, It's affecting my education a lot, as I go to college in the day.

It was before those 2-3 weeks, one day I was staying up to 4 am playing a game (Visual Novel). Then I decided to go to bed, but apperantly I was unable to go to sleep the whole night. Decided I would stay up for the whole day and probably go to sleep the following night. I was really tired the day and accidentally fell asleep from 12:00 to  16:46, which I think was a big mistake, because I couldn't sleep the whole night again. After another sleepless day I had no problems sleeping for about 5 days. And from then on I've been having other problems. Some days I would sleep only for 4 hours (from 22:00 to 4:00), or would have a broken up sleep (from 0:00 to 3:00, then fall asleep again from 4:00 to 6:00 then from 7:00 to 8:00 and such),or falling asleep lightly, or have another sleepless night like today.

I think I'm losing my best friend again because he doesn't like my boyfriend. He tells me that he supports me and wants me to be happy and if it's with him then well, do it. I just feel like he disapproves of me. I'm not sure my boyfriend and I are good together. I jus know, I am happy with him and I want to be with him. He had broke up with me a while ago and I acted like I hated him the whole 3 months but he apologized and said he wanted to try again and he wanted all the things he was hesitant about before. My boyfriend and this relationship kinda scares the shit outta me. I know he could hurt me so badly and I am doing it anyway. That's gotta be a trust thing right? I must not completely trust him. That's one issue, another is his ex who is like a ""best friend"" I guess. I don't have a problem with him being friends with any of his exes but she called me ""toxic"". I feel like I love my boyfriend and because he hurt me so bad and we got in this intense conversation where I was crying and asking him questions and he lied straight to my face, I lost it and punched him in the face. I didn't hit him hard enough to leave a mark and that doesn't justify it. It's just that I did, and I apologies profusely, he left the house and I cried alone til he returned. I felt so much remorse and I still do. I don't want what I did to be 'swept under the rug' and ignored. I want it to be 'water under the bridge', I want to talk about it, deal with it and move forward. I will never hurt him like that ever again. I jus don't know what to do when he doesn't talk about emotions at all. We have a relationship journal, where he writes to me sometimes but still even there it's scarce and obscure. I am not completely sure why he may feel how he feels sometimes cus he leaves stuff out. I'm jus lost. so lost"

Maybe this was always what I was best suited to, but just didn't know it? I've been able to pull off the monophasic schedule for the most part, but I definitely always hit a wall in midday where I felt a bit useless.

387,"Weird thing about me I normally cut my hair very short, I've done this since I was very young. I really don't like having hair growing over my ears because it's annoying, plus long hair has always been more difficult to take care of than short hair. I was in the military and kept short hair there too, It's never been a problem. But for some reason, a few months ago, I didn't feel like cutting it so I let it grow out a little bit and just kept telling myself I would cut it later. Now, several months later, my hair is longer than its ever been and I still get annoyed by it being in my ears so I constantly move it out of them and go about my business, that's not the weird part, the weird part for me is that I get super paranoid that people are judging my hair... I have never cared what people thought about my hair because it was always too short to matter, now that it's long I care a lot. Sometimes I feel like I can't go in public because my hair might be a little greasy or I might have some weird cow lick from sleeping on it. I will even brush it and still feel like I will be judged harshly for it. I feel like I don't even want to leave the house to sit in line at my son's school because people will look in the car and see my hair. That's a weird thing about me."

So now I'm forced to leave him behind to be cared for by the relative I am living with now. The reason it's terrible, is because I don't think he will be properly cared for. Picture this : White American, qualified to be on hoarders after I move out. He's lazy, forgetful, and very lazy. There's much more to it. But I can't sleep. I can't stop feeling the pit of my stomach churning with empty pain. Sorry World, huge failure. And as redemption, I will never adopt another dog. I am not worthy for the task. "
390,"Please review my year 9 horror story New Message 
Alex had just received a message from his sister, saying that she broke her ankle because of a group of preppy students who supposedly didn’t enjoy her presence. Her first day at a new primary school and students were already bullying her. Alex was fuming with a mixture of rage and sorrow. His sister Rachel, was twelve years old. Alex, Rachel and their alcoholic of a mother, have moved states countless of times; all to escape the problems their mother rose. Their mother is always on bad terms with everyone. Rachel and Alex have never had a friend that has lasted more than three months due to their mother always sleeping around. Alex sighed, Rachel was only twelve and her childhood was already flooded with scarring memories. He shook his head, he had to remain strong for Rachel. Becoming enraged about the past won’t help erase it. 
He reversed hastily, knocking down their empty garbage bin. He glanced at his phone numerous times to see where he was going. It was his first time going to this particular hospital, he had to use the GPS. He went through several turns and empty tunnels. He was now waiting at a red light, he was the only care going to the left.
 Alex finally arrived at his destination. It was dark, pitch black to be clear. There were no cars nor people to be seen, well it was late at night, it made sense, he thought. A loose entrance sign flashed wearily. Alex rushed towards it, as it as the only light in the area. He raced inside the building while focused on getting his Medicare card out. Alex fumbled around with his keys and wallet, cursing excessively. He was relieved to see the green card peeking out. 
“Hi I am Rachel Winchester’s Guar-” Alex was surprised to see no receptionist. 
He furrowed his eyebrows in confusion but then at that moment everything stopped. Alex’s mind, heart, eyes, everything, they froze. He slowly turned his head, not a single person could be seen, but what he saw next made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. 
Bodies, at least thirty of them, laid like ghoulish mannequins in a waste of blood, the oesophagus and arteries sticking out, like corrugated pipes. Their raw, fleshy intestines spilled out onto the floor. Corpses dispersed all over the place. One of them groaned, it looked at Alex with inclusive eyes. Its eyes became wider but lost complete life as another body came soaring down. Alex flinched and looked down. No human was physically capable of doing such. The bodies looked as if they were dolls and had been dissembled from limb to limb. 
The walls, floor, ceiling and furniture were splattered perfectly in thick, scarlet blood. Body parts were thrown in haphazard places. More blood dripped from the ceiling, crashing against the floor, creating a light sound. A strong fresh, metallic taste blanketed the air. Equipment were scattered across the ground and the once pristine, white bed sheets were now stained in red and black fluids. The walls looked as if they were painted in grime. There was only one working light bulb.  Alex’s heart beat like a million mallets, where was he? Where was Rachel? He tried to move but his feet wouldn’t cooperate, paralysed, he tried to call out for his sister but his voice strained into oblivion. Alex breathed heavily, only the panting of his breath was heard. He couldn’t bear to think what had happened to Rachel, his heavy breathing turned into light sobs. Abruptly, the main door swung open, clashing with the blood smeared wall. Alex waited to hear the wind but the atmosphere still remained silent. The door wasn’t swung by the wind. 
“Alex, help me” a young voice cried. 
Rachel! Alex’s eyes scanned the area. He wanted to run to her but he didn’t know where to start, there was at least a hundred rooms on the first level alone. His mind was filled with worries and doubts. 
“Help” she whined again.
It was coming from the hallway. Why was she there? He made his way down the murky narrow hallway, using his phones flashlight to guide him. No lights were seen, all of them were broken, as if they burst from high voltage. He heard a quiet whimpering coming from the room across him. He followed the sound, nearly tripping on a ragged head. He entered a cold empty room. 
Contrastingly, the room was spotless. The tiled ground shone as the light hit the surface. The room was wide and open made for the use of four people. The bed sheets were pearly white, the windows were glistening, and even the ceiling looked like it had just been cleaned. The whole room looked new and unused. The beds, curtains, windows were picture perfect, too perfect. 
Alex couldn’t hear the whimpering anymore, it was silent again.
 He decided to exit the room and search somewhere else. Alex touched the door knob but his hand came in contact with something warm and sticky. He flashed the light on it, it was blood. The door knob was evenly coated in hot, crimson blood. Alex tried to get rid of the blood from his hand. He wiped it on his overworn, denim jeans repeatedly; he illogically wiped it with his other hand, only causing it to transfer. He couldn’t get the blood off his hands. His breath quickened as he panicked more. He fell on the icy floor. The blood stained deeper into his skin as time went. The blood spread, it was on his jacket, shirt and his jeans. No matter how hard he tried, it wouldn’t come off. He pulled his hair in frustration, dying his blonde hair a faint red. Then suddenly, a corpse had slipped from the low single bed to the right and laid staring up at him, the mouth open, the head almost cleft from the body. He saw again, the severed vessels. Then another came falling down, it propped ungainly as a rag doll, against the far wall. Its head dropped forward and over its chest, a great mat of blood covered his chest, resembling a bib. 
Before Alex could react he heard a cry again.
“ALEX, ALEX HELP, PLEASE!” 
 Alex’s mind was a mess, he pushed open the door and yelled for Rachel. He ran and he kept running, he looked through the rooms, kicking the doors open and pushing every large object. He tried not to become bothered by the corpses. He ran up the blood stained stairs. Everywhere he went, blood followed him. Alex stopped running and panted loudly, his lungs felt like they were being squeezed their life out.
“RACHEL, WHERE ARE YOU?” He yelled.
“RACHEL WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOU RACHEL?” He screamed on the top of the lungs using the last bit of his energy. 
He was answered back with silence. 
“PING” 
Alex had received a new message.
 He unlocked his phone.
“Where did you go? Come back home mum’s drinking again.”- Rachel
Alex’s heart dropped.
“PING” 
One new message.
“Aren’t you going to help me?”- Rachel Unknown. 
Rachel’s profile name swiftly changed before his eyes, reading “unknown” 
No muscle in his body moved except his pounding heart. The only light bulb in the room burst. 
Alex was surrounded by darkness.
But only for a while as he was greeted with two laser red eyes.

There's also a Market for downloading more sounds. There's also a timer to turn the sound off after an hour or however long you need.

I like to listen to rain falling on tent or rain falling on the car to fall asleep to. It kind of distracts you from your brain hyperactive thoughts, but I find that I have to set it at exactly the right volume so I can hear it but not be too loud.

I'm not even sure if posting this is safe, but everyone has a right to know. They need to know. The world is ending. And not inevitably. Right now.

It started off small with the elevation of technology. Making computers mobile and so high tech that they talk back to you. The higher the technology, the easier the next step was: government control. Governments gained the ability to watch our every move and see our every typed out message. Hell, I'm sure they can see me typing this right now. They gain control over media, creating fake stories and testimonies in the news, altering our way of thinking to conform to theirs. They make us fear the world so that they can exist the way that they want. But the one fatal flaw to their plan is social media. In this format people are fearless and say what they wish, no matter the consequences. They beat each other verbally and shove their opinions down each other's throats. This creates chaos and hatred among the people. The hatred is felt worldwide. People begin to express themselves in public and then the unpopular opinion is beaten down. Riots break out and the government attempts to tighten their grips on humanity’s throat. Their efforts not only fail, but distract them from their enemies. A vulnerable government is sure to fall. And when the weaker has his back turned, the stronger is sure to plunge a knife into it. It becomes a domino effect. One country fires on another and the demolished country’s allies fire back and so on and so forth. It all ends back at technology. While we are so buried in our modernism and fancy-featured devices, we forget about the fact that technology bigger than all of us sits idly waiting in 9 countries around the world. Nuclear warfare isn't a new concept, but it hasn't been too terribly necessary in modern times. At least not to everyday citizens. Of course until now. But the world is so distracted by their online conflicts and their opinions being disagreed with that they don't even see. They don't see the war inching toward them like a lion to a gazelle. I wish I didn't know either. It's too late to stop it now.

I have the unfortunate pleasure of knowing first hand what the end of the world will look like. Nine months ago I was taken from my home. It was a few weeks into my father's 3rd deployment, and I had finally gotten back in a routine. Being a 17 year old with a father in the Navy, I was accustomed to being alone. I was never bothered by it. Not until now anyway. Not until I was snatched up like a rag doll by a man whose face I never saw, and whose footsteps I never heard. I was in my room one second and the next I had a rag clamped over my mouth and the world was going dark.

I knew I had woken up, but the darkness never faded. It felt like I was buried alive. Like the oxygen would be sucked from my lungs any second. However, once I calmed my breathing down, I was able to hear the dull hum of a running engine. I was in the trunk of a car, undoubtedly bound and gagged. I should have panicked, but a calm shock settled over me as the thought of being kidnapped buried itself in my brain. I let my brain focus on the movement of the car. How it moved smoothly over the pavement and glided around curves. I couldn't tell how fast it was going, only when it slowed to stops. The smoothness only last a while before the  crunching of gravel sounded beneath me. The road seemed to turn to a series of sharp bumps and hills. I slid helplessly around in the trunk, trying not to make squeals of surprise and pain when I knocked into other items. That's when the car squealed to a halt. I heard the door open and close before the distinct sound of a rusty gate being swung open. The car moved for another ten minutes or so before it stopped again and the engine’s hum subsided. I closed my eyes as the trunk opens and light floods the back of my eyelids. I kept completely still and tried my best to control my breathing. The man picked me up and swung me over his shoulders like I was nothing, the strength of this man and the sheer power in his bulbous arm frightened me even more until the ability to contain myself became less of a medial task and more of an inability to do so. First we went upstairs and then down some long walk before finally he sat me down on something soft. The bag was removed and I stared straight into blazing blue eyes shielded by a black ski mask.

“Where am I?” I whispered, shivering.

“I’m surprised you didn’t scream, not like it would matter, no one can hear you here anyways…”

I look down at the old flower print on the dusty couch and at the remains of a house that seemed more like a graveyard of old memories. It could’ve owned to some recently deceased old grandma, what with the overwhelming scent of rose candles, molded cookies, and mothballs.

“Where am I?” I repeated.

“Hell,” he said with a shrug and left.

For weeks it went on that way, he would lock me in a different room in the house that was set with only one item. Days would go by with only a water dish and a slice of bread in the corner to keep me alive until he returned. I was lucky if I managed to unchain myself from the furniture and crawl over to the rations before the mice picked it away. For the first set of three days, it was the den with a couch. The second set was in an upstairs bedroom where there sat a radio in a far corner. The batteries were taken out, so I could never have contacted anyone. The third set was in a room with peeling wallpaper and a  yardstick propped up against the door. The fourth had a helmet inside, an old and battered army helmet that had many dents from bullet wounds. The fifth had a newspaper that dated far back, an original copy from the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The sixth had a little arch sitting in the middle of the room. The seventh had a beautiful aquarium with intricate coral designs and a small school of fish that swam back and forth as if they were on a set track through the water and could go no place else. Seven sets of room, the setting changed but was always the same situation. I began to think it would never change, that it would go on this way until I finally died.

Until my eighteenth birthday.

The man lifted my frail body and carried me to the basement, locking me in a room with many computers. My hands were not bound, my head not covered, and no rations were available.

“This is your chance. If you survive, you pass the test, but if not, then oh well.”

“What do I do?!” I demanded though some part of me knew that the key to my escape lied with the high tech computers that were so out of place set in the darkness of an old house’s basement.

I approach the control table and presses the spacebar. A screen requiring a password appeared. A seven digit password.

“Seven letters? What the hell?! You have locked me in this house for nearly a month! Only one useless thing and enough to sustain my life, barely! Where could the hints to a password be?” I screamed out. A clock in the corner of the screen appeared that read 60 Seconds and was counting down.

That’s when it hit me.

Twenty-one days I have been here, three days--which is as long as a normal human can go without water--per room, seven rooms. Seven letters. One object. Couch. Radio. Yardstick. Helmet. Newspaper. Arch. Aquarium. Do those things all have something in common? No! 

30 Seconds.

First letters… C…R…Y…H…N…A…A…

Does it spell something? Cry hana? Arch nay? Yach ran? Maybe it’s one word. Yarnach? Aranchy?

10 Seconds.

ANARCHY.

It was a long shot, but my fingers blazed over the keys. With only one second remaining, I jammed the enter key. The screen went black before finally I realized that had gotten it correct. Nothing had happened.

In white letters a sentence appeared on the screen, and then more in quick succession.

A. Arch. The foundation of the society.

N. Newspaper. The media, the spread of lies.

A. Aquarium. The droning of citizens, thinking they have an environment but it’s all contained.

R. Radio. Communication between the citizens.

C. Couch. The cushion of the government holding against gravity, the absolute of the system.

H. Helmet. The sacrifice of the military for a populace that doesn’t care.

Y. Yardstick. Measure how much, measures only enough, measures not enough.

The foundation of the society is crumbling, people go on in their mindless tasks unknowing of what is going on behind the scenes.

Break the system.

Only you can see beyond the mindless fog. Only you can make the change. The system is collapsing.

Break the system.

Nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, highly trained soldiers… The world is ready. America isn’t.

Then images of all the horrible things running rapid in society began flashing on the screen. I watched, dumbfounded, my eyes flicking back and forth over the pictures. Then, the computer shut off and I was left awestruck. The man came into the room and pulled off his mask, I recognized him as one of my father’s commanding officers.

“Do you see now? I created this program to test the limits of future individuals in our organization. None is less than brilliant. You have a choice right now-” Then, through the light of the open door, I could see that he was holding a pistol at his side but it was quickly raised to my forehead. “Join or die.”

I joined the organization that day, set to stop the inevitable, but I know now that there is no hope. As I type right, I want you to listen to me. THERE IS NO HOPE. Nuclear war is coming and the only possible way to stop it is for everyone in every place in the world joins together and fights against their government. They think they what’s the best for us but they have us captured and trapped like sheep. Only they aren’t the herders, they are the wolves, picking us off one by one. Terrorism. Mass suicides. All of it. Only one at a time isn’t enough. No, it is time they annihilated us all. I don’t know why they decided that total nuclear war was the proper action to deal with us cattle, but they did… And there is nothing we can do to stop it.

I wrote this to warn you all, but knowing the way the system works, this might not even make it online. I might get tracked down and killed for trying to save billions of lives. But so long as there is the chance to change the fate of the world as we know then I will take it. Not too long ago, my father died for this country, so long as I am alive I will try my best to preserve it. I will not see it fall.

So I will post this and pray that someday, someone, somewhere will know where ANARCHY truly lies: in the media where people can say what they want and try to salvage what everyone else seems to be trying to destroy.

Nothing matters.

I am a semi-recent transplant to a new city and this is the furthest away I've lived from my family. I live with one of my best friends from college who is a party animal and great roommate. We have a blast living together...but today as with many weekends my roommate is out of town and I feel super alone in a semi-new city. I haven't made that many new friends, and there's great people I've met here but it just doesn't feel the same, ya know? I miss my family and friends at home and often wish I hadn't left home to try out a new place. I'm a middle child and have always felt like I've had a big part in keeping the older and younger siblings together as the family. Idk, now that I'm hours away it just feels so different. Anyone else feel the same? I Just want to chat with some internet ""friends"" here. I'm not like suicidal or mentally ill so no huge worries there, just missing my family and old life and things and would love to chat about stuff.

Now I don't live in the same state as my parents, but I'm a huge daddy's girl who had to move away for my husband's job. So when we found out my dad was only given 3 months- 1 year to live I told my husband I needed to go home to take care of my dad. So the following week, with my husbands blessing, I flew home. 

I flew home in October and started to be my dad's caretaker. I was with him 24/7. I barely slept, as he couldn't get much rest himself and couldn't do a lot by himself, he needed someone up with him to help him. This continued for 3 months. Now the day comes. January 2, he's very sick and not comfortable enough so the hospice nurses want to take him in to re-evaluate the medicines he in on in order to make him as comfortable as possible, and then send him home again. (His wishes were to be at home, no hospital and a DNR). This just didn't happen. He died at 3:30 in the morning on January 3.

The problem is, i decided to sleep. He went to hospice and I was tired so I took the opportunity to sleep instead of going with my mother that night. I was going to pack a bag in the morning and stay with him until he was released in a couple days, I just wanted one nights rest. I'll regret it the rest of my life.

Gotta work today too and it doesnt look like its going to be any less work as yesterday. Propably its a lot more because its friday. Are those the thoughts that keep me awake all night? Is someone even reading this am i being heard out there or will people just be like tl;dr lul and keep going with their lives with normal sleep cycles? Maybe not on here given the fact its a subreddit about not being able to sleep so... at least i hope my thought process is so boring for some people that they actually fall asleep reading this, as its not working out for me.

As im quite enjoying to rapidly move my fingers on the virtual keyboard of my phone i lose precious time i could use to sleep but oh well im already way to deep into this to just suddendly stop without a real conclusion, now am i? If someone is really in a worse position then me and spent all the time they could've used to atleast try to fall asleep have my condolences. You're just in a spot as bad as mine.

445,"The Story of Patrick I would like to preface this story by saying that I do not know who Patrick is before or after this story. 

So I wake up at about 6am and I can't sleep. I'm tossing and turning, but ultimately I realize the reason I can't keep my eyes closed is because I'm hungry. I know I have nothing to eat in my kitchen (poor college student) except for a few boxes of cereal, but here's the catch: no milk. 
So I decided to make the trek to the local convenience store. I put on some clothes, walk outside my apartment complex, and begin my walk -that is only one block over- to said store. 

Almost immediately, I see this girl stumbling in the distance. It's fairly obvious she is an intoxicated college student. She sees me, or at least I think she sees me, and calls out ""Patrick?"" (Not my name). 
At this point I thought she was perhaps just meeting up with someone and had gotten us mixed up. So I keep walking towards the store and towards her, which is in the same direction. She calls again, ""Patrick?"", so I decided to respond and tell her I was not. 

Now at this point you assume something like: Oh she's just too drunk to realize you're not this Patrick fella and she tries to make out with me/punch me/some other thing because she has mistaken me for this guy. Nope, it's not as exciting as that.

We're about 20 feet away from one another at this point; I'm only about 100 feet from the store. She says something along the lines of, ""Oh sweet a free ---, I'm gonna take it!"". I couldn't see what she was referring to nor did I hear what she said at first. Upon a few steps closer, I see her bend over and pick up a soaking wet bra off the street (college, right?). ""I don't care if it's wet, I'm gonna wash it and wear it."", was her next fine choice of words. I respond with ""Hey, you do you."", out of awkwardness and a little bit of disgust. 
""Me do me"", she says. At this point we pass each other. I roll my eyes. A second later I hear her beginning the call again, ""Patrick?"".

I finally make it to the store, buy myself milk as well as some of those mini donuts to treat myself to an early morning outing. Then I return to my apartment without any sign of the intoxicated girl from before. As I stand over my kitchen counter, pouring my cereal, I think about the odds of me having that encounter and how no one else was a witness to it. I thought it both funny and very odd. Well that's college for you."

465,"School, work, confusion This is my first ever post anywhere online. 

I'm 24 and feeling confused. Can't sleep. 

I need school to work out. I've got school loans from taking 6 years and still haven't got my bachelor's. Not to talk down on myself about it but it's too long to be in college. Weird thing is if it was someone else I'd assure them from here to Mars that it's okay they've been in school that long but I recognize the reality that no one is going to wait on me, especially life. Life will swallow me whole and I'm just sitting around waiting for someone to ring the dinner bell before I decide to start acting and save myself.  

I'm a hard worker and great at getting shit done but only at work. Not at school or at home or with friends. 

Socially, I've learned a lot and am growing but I enjoy lazy, dirty, angry and fucked up individuals. Personally, I'm pretty straight laced but I've always been around the fucked up crowd and intend to keep it that way. This does not help me with my responsibilities or my extremely high standards that I have set for myself: finish school, work in a career field, pay loans and save money, pursue a place to live that keeps me close to the things I enjoy and allows me to meet people who enjoy them too. 

However, I'm not down with the American dream. Contradictory isn't it? 

I contradict myself on every detail of my life. I want money because I decided school was a good idea but I don't want to live any kind of normal life. Again, I like the fucked up people of this world because I've always understood them and honestly...... They're way more fun than you normal fucks! 

I cringe at the realization that I'll never have good time management skills as to be able to do good on school or run a household. On the other hand I work so hard on shit once I get the ball rolling that I Iook at others and laugh when they even try to get close. 

I'm not smarter than most but I'm way farther ahead in introspection and understanding others. The childish insights of others is painfully pathetic because I figured those things out years ago. BUT others are painfully ahead of me in all of the relevant, professional ways as well as being way more relaxed than me. I'm too fucking serious, a dash of narcissism, overly modest about my talents, and I don't believe in myself as much as I believe in others. 

Contradicting but also makes sense. 

I basically think there's a lot of idiots that think they're the shit. They are not. I'm way better than them except that they perform better in many social situations and professional situations. 

I value telling the Truth. 

Idk.  Just like most others I'm  scared. Which is new. And I'm confused. Searching for motivation and practice at being better with studying. I wish I could care less about dumb fucks but they seem to be the loudest and most influential. And I'm angry. Very angry. I guess I'm synical. 

I'm so normal that it hurts and I think I'm better when I'm not although I don't feel like I'm better from day to day, just when I'm angry or sad. And that makes me very confused sometimes. 

I wish I could wrap this up somehow but honestly, I just wanted to sleep and idk how else to help me get there.

493,"Noisy Neighbors So... I've been living in the upstairs portion of a duplex with my boyfriend for almost a year. We have a thousand square feet and a pleasant quiet small dog (amazingly). We don't party, we barely if ever fight, and we barely invite people over. 
However the same cannot be said for the couple that live downstairs. With their thousand square feet they live with 2 tomcats, and a medium sized dog who loves to bark. The animals have seperation anxiety, and whenever they leave the house there is always a chorus of yowling and howling for almost thirty minutes, and this can be in the morning, afternoon or night, they also tend to leave the television on at a high volume for their pets (Diesel, Jack and Murphy). They have guests often, and their vehicles rip up the section of the yard dedicated to a fire pit and roaming space instead of parking in the spots left or on the road.
The girl downstairs often likes to dabble in cooking, cooking that ends up smelling like something Cthulu would unleash, that smell travels through the ventilation into my apartment.
But I would have to say my biggest complaint is that every week, at least 2-3 times, typically Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays... They leave in seperate vehicles and are gone for a stretch of hours (which is blissful after the animals downstairs quiet down), and then return, in their seperate vehicles drunk and loud. They come barreling into the driveway (they've hit the porch before but didn't demolish it), slam the front door enough to rattle the windows upstairs, and then proceed to fight for a good thirty minutes before you hear the girl scream at him, begin crying and then more doors slamming before its quiet again. This all takes place between 1am and 3am... every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. While we, my boyfriend and I, typically have a good distanced and polite relationship with the people downstairs, I don't know how long I can stay quiet. The first few months we spent laughing as we were forced to listen to the couple downstairs have very loud, very descriptive sex...however those days are long gone. The constant fighting is exhausting, and I'm not even the one yelling... "

My husband was overseas for six months and my older kids would wait for me to sleep to act up so I stayed up. Over Christmas I went completely off and experienced the worst withdrawals. Since then I've gone from one hour of sleep a night to four but only with the help of things like Valarian root, gabba, otc sleep aides, etc. Whatever I use works well for a month or two and then stops. I was prescribed desyrel to help with less side effects  but afraid to go down that road again.

Went to a Halloween party and she was there.

I wish that there was a way to obtain that feeling or moment forever. 

The rest of the night was interesting. 
She almost kissed me a few times. She kept making intense eye contact. 
A few hours later, we started talking about stuff and she broke down and started crying-her ex boyfriend really did a number on her.. 
It was pretty heartbreaking to see her that way. 
I didn't know what else to do other than hold onto her and keep wiping her tears away. 
She nearly passed out on my lap. I was softly dragging my fingertips over her eyebrows and down the length of her nose and back up it. 
After a while of silence and when she calmed down a little, she decided that it would be a good idea to find a sober ride home. 
At the end of the night, I walked her out and she kissed my cheek during a hug. I kissed her forehead. That basically summarizes the evening.

549,"couchpotato Hello, i'm not going to bore you with life story, but this is just something i need to get off my chest. I think i'm a nice guy trapped in a douche bag mindset, that i created when i was a kid. Manly because i got bullied for six years, kind of found out how to become popular, and it consisted manly of not caring about school, get beer and smoke. So i ditched those friends that stood by my side when i got bullied (other kids that used to get picked on). I was flying high, 8-10 grade, partying in the weekends and sleeping with the hot girls in the library during class, and when i say sleep, i mean actually sleeping. this attitude worked fine, until after ""Videregående"" witch is the Norwegian equivalent of High School. Every other friend left or started working, while i took another class, to have the opportunity to study other things on a university, instead of  starting a entry level job as an electrician, witch was what i studied to become in high school. After the last year extra in high school i went ant studied to become a kindergarten leader of some sort, that sucked, it was the first time i moved away from home, i fast became this unimportant blob in the world that is university. Became really asocial, sat inside my room an played video games and barely talked to my flatmates. So i quit the class and moved home, thought to myself that i needed a break from school, and should find myself a job and rather learn about the working world and become more independent before i started studying again. The exact opposite happened! I came home, started smoking weed almost on a daily basis for a year or so, lied to my parents about applying for work, and what i deed on a day to day basis, actually went so far that i lied about that i was working, and one year i lied and told them i was studying at the university in our city, while i was really home, smoking weed and playing wow. three soon four years later, here i am. I got no job, still live at home, no money of course, 100,000 nok (11560USD) in dept, and some depths from friends that loaned me money, witch i cant pay because i don't have a job as i said. Now, i'm going to a psychologist, had three sessions, she seems to think the drugs, alcohol and asocial activity's is just things i do to numb myself from actually dealing my problems, and i guess she's right, but i feel so low, no confidence and no enthusiasm. Thank you for ""listening"", good night."

I can't get our queen sized bed to be comfortable enough for me to fall asleep easily. I have much better luck on my big leather couch. But of course this makes the wife upset and thinking I don't want to sleep with her. But in all honesty I just want to sleep period."
552,"Here's a peek in my mind. Reddit, I choose to write to you as if to myself. I shall speak as if to a mirror tonight. If only to see what the responses may be.

It's 10:00PM or so. Trying to brake away from the to-be-in-laws or whatever you call your fiancee's parents 6 days before you marry their daughter. I had to smoke 3 cigarettes in an hour just to avoid the conversation of the Tour de France and how high-fructose corn syrup is ruining our lives. 

My lungs are burning. Doesn't help that the Texas heat persists through the night. The locusts sound off as the mosquitoes lay into my ankles. A lucky one catches me on the lip before I have the time to angrily smack my face, cigarette in hand, and both shame and burn myself in one, unsuccessful stroke.

I spot my fiancee on the couch, fast asleep to Frasier (thanks Netflix!) and decide now is the time. Nope. Now isn't the time. My neighbor owes me weed and I'm in need. I knock on the door.

No answer.

Fuck that. Tonight was awful. Fucking DJ's for the wedding, fucking $80 for a ring pillow and some kind shit for her ring to be taken out on, fucking brother that can't remember the fucking color of the jacket for wedding despite my sending an e-mail, text, and Facebook message with links to all the colors and options for purchase...what was I talking about? Anger, ADD, those things, yea.

She's fast asleep, Frasier. Thanks. I sneak in and creep my way around the couch, up the stairs, in to the makeshift man-cave. My shitty duplex's spare bedroom has been abandoned for about a week since a girl I used to know in high school moved out to live with her boyfriend's mother (wtf?). 

I've remodeled the room since she left. I now have my $3000 rig (2013 money) sitting up there beneath a desk that is littered with dirty wine glasses and empty beer bottles. An ashtray with a passed out Mexican, dick exposed, contains a few roaches and serves as a reminder of my last day in the military. I'm white, but from far enough south Texas that I consider myself in sync with Mexican culture. How does one describe that? I'm more Vaquero than Cowboy. I'm also nothing like either of those things.

What was  I talking about? Oh yea, the room.

I sit down. It's 11:00 now, how the fuck did that happen? I realize it's my first time alone, with semi-assurance of non-interruption (am I using too many hyphenated thingys?) (did I spell ""thingys"" right?) I re-read what I just wrote to remember what I was talking about. I close one eye. I realize that I haven't had sex or beat-off in like 5 days since the to-be-in-laws arrived and decide to correct that.

The sound of my dog and fiancee going up the stairs scares me. Please PLEASE don't open the door and ask me to massage you right now...I'd love to. You're beautiful. I'm in love with you. I can't wait to marry you in a few days! But damnit, I'm drunk and stoned and just want some me time right now.

By the time I finish the thought and the typing she's gone. 

OK.

My bathroom is off-limits, she'll for sure hear me sneak into the room and the dog will bark. To-be-in-law's (fuck that shit, English needs a concise description for this situation) bathroom it is. What's here...hmmm...some kind of organic arnica cream for muscles, toothpaste, facial cream, soap, organic tea tree something shampoo and conditioner, gold bond....fuck. What am I gonna try and beat off with?

I decide on an Arnica cream and facial cream cocktail.

Doesn't work, hurts like hell, instant regret, seriously hoping I didn't wake anyone when (mid-wank) I hollared and my legs jumped and I knocked off like 5 empty beer bottles that were resting precariously on my desk.

I would keep myself awake by reading, watching terrible movies like The Room, watching all of R Kelly's Trapped in a Closet hip-hopera, or just obsessively checking the focus of the images I was taking. Now if I stay up past 1 pm, my body thinks it's observing and won't let me fall asleep. The sad thing is I can't see any stars in this city, so I just stay up all night, looking at the haze created by all the lights until the sun washes them out."

It's impossible to even find average costs for procedures so I can't even decide if I should start saving up or if it's all a big farce and I should give up the ghost and accept my miserable body the way that it fucking is, and die in a corner oblivious to the world around me."

I'd like to go again this year, but I am torn. I would love more than anything to go with him, but sadly it's been (almost) three months of no contact. And it's not just about going, it's what it all represents, a time when we were happy together. 
I asked a friend to go with me and she is excited about it. I'm afraid that I will find a way to upset myself over it. I am trying to do things I enjoy to feel happy again, but somehow it all just feels like I am trying to replace memories  (which is not my intention, because there were many happy times).

I'm half tempted to break off a piece of boyfriend's Seroquel but last time I had half of one, I had an anxiety attack and was groggy the entire next day. I'm out of melatonin and don't know what else to do. I have two days worth of family funerals so I need to be on my A game, but my toes are curling in frustration. I've also learned through this ordeal that I actually feel a lot more at ease sleeping with the boyfriend, but I can't wake him up now as the Seroquel kicked in for him an hour ago.

Just looking for advice for tonight and the future. I'm a bit nervous about sleeping pills (Ambien and the like) because side effects. I just want a fucking constant restful night of sleep.

572,"How things change...(just talking to myself, but you can listen) I remember just 4 years ago I was young...I don't feel young anymore. This girl just the other day (attractive, energetic) starts telling me about her night on 6th Street. Basically Austin's version of Bourbon Street. Picture college kids celebrating being young and stupid every day of the week in 100 bars crammed on a single stretch of testosterone and piss infused asphalt and concrete. Yea, so this girl tells me how much fun it was...all I can think about is how dumb it is. But here's the thing man, I was there making that shit happen and eating it up just 4 years ago in LA. No hangovers...could drink and butt heads with other assholes like me (4 years ago me) with the best of em. As she tells me about her night I sigh and recommend a few craft beer bars and some good live music joints when she starts laughing. ""I don't want to go to and old guy place...hehehheee."" Fuck. I'm old. 

Don't really care all that much what one 21 year old's opinion is...that's not what really affected me. But it was the spark that ignited the thought that became the feeling that's currently washing over me. Thing just change man. You just wake one day and realize you're different. It's not good, it's not bad. It just is. 

So much is different for me. Back then I was in the Coast Guard, in super shape and rolling in money. I had no debts and a cheep car, I spent liberally on video games and my gaming pc. On sushi, women, and mango sticky rice twice a week when I got home from duty. I didn't give a fuck. 15k sitting in my checking account just begging to blown and that money was guaranteed by Uncle Sam. Now here I am just proud I saved up enough to buy Witcher 3. I'll be playing it tomorrow on my Craigslist POS PC. A rig I literally pieced together one broken component at a time. I'm am amateur solderer/tinkerer with electronics (I fucking fix broken shit cause it's easy to me but I don't what that skill is called) and bought and repaired a bunch of college dude's broken nonsense to make a gaming rig on the cheap. 

Ranting...get's away from you. Point is, man, shit just changes. You just wake up and look in the mirror and you're different. It's not not bad or good for me. I just see what see and am what I am. I did what I could with what I had and I'm still doing it. Now I'm getting married and have a dog...and no money. haha. I traded them out. That part was worth it. Way worth it.

If you read this at all I guess all I really have to say to you, all I really give a shit about from your end, is....I don't fucking know. How would you end that sentence? I don't know what to say to you. shit just gets weird. One moment you're drinking Petron and sake with the sushi chefs twice a week cause you're loaded and frequent there too much and the next you're counting dimes and sipping Lone Star beer with your fiancee and new dog. I didn't lose anything, shit just shifted. The only real guy that takes the fall is your gaming rig. Your shit. The dumb things you think care about in a moment and time just let's you know how dumb they are. 

But dumb things are missed too...especially beautifully dumb things. Like being 21 and knowing Witcher 2 is coming out soon and blowing 6k on a PC just for that game. That beautiful moment when you realize just how awesomely dumb that is and that's it's ok. That you have the money and you earned it. And now I don't, now I compromise. I traded those things so I could devote myself to this girl. Cause what she gives back isn't beautifully dumb...it's a lot more. Waking up to another human that looks you right in the eye and says ""I love you."" with the kind of sincerity that assures you she'll wipe your ass if you can't. With kind of love that allows you to entertain the possibility that you might be wiping hers and that's ok. With the kind of love that makes you WANT to get up, even after the games are boring. Man, that shit's a worthy trade.

And now you see...I'm a sappy old fuck and I'm not even 28 yet. How things change."

Swim was a nervous 14 year old boy when he met rasta, very timid, shy, and just totally shy. He was a wreck. But one day after smoking points with his friends he met Rasta and they got to talking, Rasta developed a crush on SWIM, but SWIM didn't realize that. One day SWIM messaged Rasta and they got to know each other and that went on eventually to them getting together. Rasta was experienced but SWIM was new, he did his first everything with her, from an actual serious kiss, to sex, and eventually SWIM and rasta found out Rasta was pregnant. Swim only had sex with Rasta once, maybe 3 times by the time she found on she was pregnant and didn't announce it Until Rasta ""found.out ""3 months later. After a year and a half of.being with Rasta he decided to spend a summer at Rastas house to help watch their child, and because Swims father wouldn't let Swim stay due to fear of corruption and wanted to finish raising SWIM though his father let Swim visit during the week and stay the weekend. But During that summer Swim and Rasta went through arguments, Rasta pushed Swim away. Would never let Swim hold or kiss her, or even hug Rasta occasionally. Along.all that time Rasta also came up with lies saying that swim had to come complete certain tasks or a voodoo medium would make it so that Rasta never believed they dated and that Swim and Rasta only had a one.night stand but worked things out.and.stuck around each other to watch their.son, but.Rasta would supposedly believe that she wasn't dating swim, that rasta would be dating someone else. So Swim believed her, completed rastas ""tasks"" turned on his friends, his family, and everyone around him for Rasta. He loved her, but.one day a girl spoke to swim, saying he deserved better than that. That she wished she could.hug.swim, so swim felt.better, he'd talk.to that girl always, and eventually it turned into him flirting with 3 other girls, Rasta found.out, and said She was.destroyed, that Swim ignored.her and rasta knew something was going.on, even though previously swim found her sexting.other men. Swim was crushed, and rasta said they were.never going.to have sex, it just.made her.feel.better, though while swim worked until 12 at.night, rasta was.alone, and spent.time.with the boy. But after rasta broke.up with swim, swim hacked into her things, found.out she was flirting with all his friends, and sent.one.a nude while they were.dating, and Swims friends even.told.people that they were.going.to chill with rasta that theyd been flirting. Swim found that rasta was doing this before she left him, and still to this day. Swim admits, he flirted With other.women, but after his separation from Rasta. Swim eeventually got back.with rasta, and rasta would break up with swim.and get.back with him once he started moving on. But then swim just.got.tired of it all and couldn't handle rastas pressure anymore and split.from her and wants.to see his son. Rasta proclaimed that her actions were from all the voodoo and if she'd burn a book everything would.be okay. Swim then didn't believe rasta at all. Rasta would call and.call and call begging.swim for a chance. Swim eventually fell for the peer pressure and got with rasta. Things felt normal again, and swim had his family back. But it just didn't seem right to swim so He told rasta the truth, and went solo to find himself, nothing was the.same to swim, he just couldn't handle rastas pressure anymore.
Now again Rasta is calling his phone, texts swim all day begging swim for his attention "

It sounds strange and irrational I know. Because if you were even close to dying one of those nights, you would've eventually woken up in the ER, with an IV needle sticking out of your arm right? But what if you weren't close to dying. What if you DID die. And all of this, what you perceive as reality, is the so called ""afterlife"".

Kenya's my country of birth, and this news seriously upset me. It also made me all paranoid about sexual assault. A combination of that and reading too many Facebook and Reddit links made me far too on edge and alert to fall asleep. I turned all the lights off, but found myself feeling really scared that an intruder was going to get in and kidnap or rape me, so I turned one lamp on. I finally did manage to fall asleep at 1:30 despite my edginess and paranoia, but then at 2am, someone opened my door, said ""sorry,"" and then closed it. I swear this happened and I didn't imagine it. It was a girl's voice, so it must have been one of my female housemates. I don't know them very well yet and didn't see the person's face. However, I don't see why either of the two girls on my floor should have had any reason to open my door. They know it's my room and not the toilet! I have now locked my door, and I'm more pissed off and embarrassed (I sleep in my underwear and my room is a mess) than scared. I intend to leave a message on the house whiteboard first thing in the morning demanding an explanation for such behaviour. For now, though, being a combination of pissed off, panicky, and mortified is preventing me from getting to sleep, and I have to be up in 5 hours for a singing lesson. :( Someone help me get to sleep, please...

Ill see darkness, not that cloud passing over the sun, dimming the light, or even the darkness of night but that cold lonely deep voided darkness akin to what drifting through space would be like. I hate that darkness, the dreamless void, because in the end I know some dream happened but I can't remember it.  Thats why I like nightmares. Its rare I have them,  those terror filled moments when im trapped in my own head for time I can't determine,  not a void but a horror show.  Being chased by an unseen force,  or worse whatever my mind can twist up that night. I have a personal preference for my nightmares. I have a recurring nightmare with the ocean swallowing me alive,  the tides seeming to throw me into the air sending blade like vines shooting into me. I feel all of it but thinking on it now I miss it. See my nightmares are the only things I remember,  those beautiful heart stopping horrific nightmares.

619,"How can I get over my fear of a certain race of people? To exclude defamation I shall not reveal the specific ethnic group so do not ask. 

I do not want to be a racist, but there is one (minority) ethnic group/race that I am paranoid or nervous about, because they are said to crave blood - in fact they are somewhat infamous for it. Some sources state the motive for the ritual torture/cannibalism was revenge for mis-treatment and persecution, others state a medical cause. The victim was always an 'outsider', and a stranger (they selected a random person they could capture).

This is a minority ethnic group, but there have been at least 150 established cases of them luring and preying on people in this manner, since the 10th Century. What was left of the (blood-drained) bodies was discovered, and the murderer(s) confessed.The aspect which disturbed me the most was the fact that these people would pretend to be trustworthy, and lure people (often children) into their homes where they were never seen again. Cases of this still happen though not often. There is a town in Russia that has a high population of these people, and 3 years ago 5 missing children's bodies were discovered full of holes and slits - their bodies had been drained of blood. I live near this town.

So as you may tell I have a problem trusting these people, I am naturally paranoid, but I really do not want to be racist, how can I not feel bad around these people? I wish I did not watch this documentary which concerned this phenomenon, and also included a (realistic and gory) re-construction of a little boy being killed via exsanguination (after having his throat cut) followed by having his blood drip into a basin to be drunk."

But I spent the rest of the night watching videos, listening to music and I got it out of my system. I'd actually managed to lay in bed an hour, and honestly while the stories shook my nerves, I wasn't going to lose sleep over them. 

Until I noticed a grouping of lines on the wall above my dresser. I keep a whole bunch of crap ontop of my dresser - photos, mugs, ect. I have a few glow in the dark objects so I didn't think much of them at first. At first, I thought it was just some ambient light coming from outside, so I shifted my curtains to make sure there was no light coming through.

The lines didn't leave, and I was sure they were something glow in-the-dark. I couldn't fathom what object might be causing this, so I turn on my bedside lamp, and am startled to find there is no object there, it's just wall. My walls are a plain, light blue. Nothing special about them.

I turn off the lamp, but I can't ignore the lines. I put on my glasses, and they're still there, clearer this time. I finally get up close, and this is definitly no illusion. As I walked past, I thought it was a reflection, like a mirror, because as I moved the lines shifted. I wave my hand infront of them - no shadow. I turn on the lights, illuminating my entire room, and they dissapear. Definitally glow in the dark. I turn off my lights again and they reappear. I touch them, and get up close, and for a split second I think I can make out some kind of symbol.

That's when I freak out. Why are there glowing lines on the wall in my room? And is it actually writing? Keep in mind, my nerves have already been shaken by the UFO thread, and this just brings it to a whole new level.

So I turn on every light in the basement, I slip on pants, and I pace around with my heart pounding. I'm too scared to make my room dark again to examine the lines. Instead, I've turned on my computer, put on some music. The invisible lines are behind me right now. The rest of my family is asleep, and while I've sent texts crying help to my brother, he has school tomorrow and has probably turned off his phone. I will most likely not be sleeping tonight, because of those goddamned lines. I hope they're still there tomorrow so I can examine them.

Working in a farm, making friends with genuine people, hard working people. Leaving Los Angeles would be nice, I guess.

Now that the whole mental distress has been poorly written out, there is one more thing keeping me from sleeping. I sleep in a two bedroom apartment, and I share a room with my grandmother. She snores as if she was trying to warn the moon that there is a chance it might get hit by a meteorite sometime soon. I tried talking a walk, I smoked a cigarette, I meditated, and I even took some Nyquil. 

I don't know, but this night is either going to be productive and long, or unproductive, and long. Anyway, I ranted. Thanks for reading.

I am a lover of sleep and a damn good insomniac.  I lost my job today and I am just trying to keep myself together so I can get another job and keep living.  I've been playing the day in my head and I wish I had told my previous employer two things.  One that individuals in my group were using travel expenses to obtain gift cards for free food over the weekend and that their timing sucks.  My best friend's mom's funeral was Sunday and they fired me Monday.  I was numb from the other day and all the driving I did, they sit me down and now it's Tuesday and I need to sleep and stay productive.  I feel better writing about it.  Thanks to the OP for creating the subreddit I am off to attempt sleep before I meet with unemployment tomorrow.  If anything else can't sleep and can provide me with any advise, I recently moved to mass and am completely ignorant about the next steps to take.

- like clockwork i️ wake up at 2:00am 4/7 nights a week and am not able to fall back asleep for 2 hours if at all.

My main issue is the way my thoughts constantly loop as i lie there.

I decided to make an album of music that constantly looped, changing very slowly over time  as nagging thoughts alter slowly in my mind during my bad nights. Most of it was done very late at night/early in the morning.

2165,"Been dealing with on and off insomnia for five days now. My 27th Birthday was on February 22nd. On that day, I got into a car accident with my mom driving and it completely threw me out of a loop. Wanting to enjoy my birthday despite the car accident, I decided to smoke a bit of weed. I've always been an anxious person and used to be on medications for it like Valium (Benzos), but I got addicted to them and as a result had to quit. I hadn't been on meds for a few years, and I even hadn't smoked weed for a few years either. The only thing I ever did was drink a bit, but I was never an alcoholic and only drank one Four Loko can once a week.

Then my mom tried to drive me to college in another car, but it had the brakes go out and we had to go take it to the mechanic almost immediately. I was absolutely scared, and was scared of the car accident before.

Not only that, but the last time I smoked weed was 17 days ago. I've only smoked on my birthday a few hits from a joint, then on the 25th of February I smoked a few more hits. Then on March 1st I smoked my last bit of weed and got a bad trip. Since then, I have been really struggling.

My social worker who I see for therapy is leaving in two weeks to take another position. I myself am not feeling okay, as I'm going through heavy fits of insomnia. I had a Math exam Monday, and while I know I shouldn't of done it... I had to take 25 mgs of Trazodone from my mom just to sleep and take the test in the morning as a one-time thing. Anytime I go to my Math class now, my nerves immediately spike and I have a panic episode. It's my only class and I'm doing well in it, and I didn't have this problem before the car accident. I lost a huge support group of online friends before my birthday, which really hurt me far worse after the car accident.

I've tried cutting caffeine out of my life right now, and I haven't had any alcohol in two weeks. Yet I still cannot get any rest whatsoever, and I tried following the instructions to a tee. I took a lukewarm shower before bed, I ate three meals for the day, drank water all day except for two hours before bed, and this just has not gone away like I'd hope it would. I try to turn my phone off and everything, but my mind is literally just begging me to get some form of rest that isn't happening. My body last night kept jolting awake, as if it didn't want to sleep. It's hard to stay awake and focus now, and I have my Math class again tomorrow. I tried guided meditation to help me sleep at night, but it didn't work at all, although it does relax me. I just get out of bed after 20 minutes,

I assume what I have to do is just tough this out like I did before, but it's so difficult with all of this going on. I'm currently trying to reestablish my circadian rhythm, but I'm also trying to do deep breathing as to not let the anxiety overwhelm me. If it's not one thing, it's another.

2168,"Is CBT-I/sleep restriction making my insomnia worse? I signed up for a six-week CBT-I (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy-Insomnia) course after reading about how effective it is for managing insomnia.  However, ever since I started the sleep restriction component of the course, I've been sleeping much less than I was before and my anxiety levels have gone through the roof.  Before I started it, I was averaging 5.5 hours a night (albeit fragmented and not the best quality), and now I'm down to about 3 fragmented and poor quality hours a night.  I have a six-hour sleep window from 1 am to 7 am, which I think is generous based on other people's sleep schedules I have seen online.  I've thought about asking my therapist whether I should reduce it, but I think that would actually worsen my problem.  It's only been a few days and I feel like it's complete and utter psychological torture (as opposed to simple tiredness or discomfort, which is what I was expecting to feel).  I'm tearing up and having a hard time breathing just thinking about it.

My problem is that I obsess all day over whether I'm going to sleep during my allotted window and then can't fall asleep or stay asleep during the window due to the anxiety.  It's the same way I felt before beginning therapy, but on steroids.  I've been unproductive at work, half-assing or skipping my workouts, either avoiding social situations or leaving hangouts early because I'm too tired to engage, and crying on and off all day due to the frustration, anxiety, and exhaustion.  I was not like this before starting CBT-I.  I try to get out of bed and read at night when I can't sleep, but I can't focus on my book, and my thoughts race and I cry a lot (including as I'm typing this).  I feel very sleepy around 11:30 pm or 12 am but force myself to stay awake until my designated bedtime of 1 am, and by that time, the desire for sleep has completely fled and I'm stressed and psyched out.  

It seems like most people whose experiences I read about online were able to fall asleep and stay asleep for anywhere from 4-5 hours after the first couple nights.  They reported that the technique actually removed the pressure to sleep for them.  Everything I've read points to the overwhelming success of CBT-I, and I haven't read about anyone failing at it.  This is adding to my feelings of being ""broken"" and unfixable and it's absolutely devastating because I really thought this would work for me.  Am I doing something wrong?  Should I change the way I've been doing things?  In the alternate, has anyone not succeeded at CBT-I and found success with another technique?  

I am seeing a therapist, who is a pleasant person, but seems to be formulaic in her thinking and hasn't tailored the course much to my needs up until now.  I expressed my reservations about how sleep restriction therapy would make me feel to her, but she made me feel like I was being uncooperative by not being on board with the idea right away.  I know I should be directing these questions to her, and I will during our next session, but I've been lurking on this sub for a bit and it seems like people are very supportive on here so I wanted to see what people thought."
2169,Haven't been able to sleep much more than 4 hours every night for the past year. Every night when I go to sleep I just lay there looking at my wall for like 2 hours until I can't stand the boredom anymore and start watching YouTube or eat something. I've tried most breathing and concentration techniques and played countless different ambient noises to see if one worked.  I can't go to the doctor for a diagnosis therefore I don't have any prescriptions for any sleeping pills or melatonin (not sure if you need a prescription for this one). I've tried some over the counter ginseng vitamins  and my brothers prozac but none helped much. Looking for advice. Currently 3:40 and have to get up at 6.
2170,"Potential Insomniac?? So I've always had problems with sleep-  I remember going through all 3 years of Middle School with less than 6 hours a night and then I'd ""crash"" and sleep 10 hours on Friday and Saturday.

The summer before High School I got super depressed and would sleep 12 hours a night, and then in high school- poof, fine. No depression, 8 hours a night, all 4 years.

Almost immediately after I got out of high school I started having issues again. Just starting up late, waking u early, 7 hours a night then 6, 5, and this has been over 6 months now. Then we get to the current situation.

For the last 4-5 weeks now (this'll be the 5th week) I wake up, don't sleep at all that night, stay up until 8-10 pm the next day, sleep until 5-6am and then repeat. I go a break the weekend before last and actually slept 10pm-6am two nights in a row!! And then instantly snapped back to this.

I know you're not doctors, and if you are I know it's against your code of ethics to diagnose someone but- from someone who's questioning and is concerned, does this sound like any of your all' experiences? Those of you who have Insomnia or don't? Either way, I just want some answers.

And no, going to the doctor is mostly out of the question. Too expensive and my parents just dismiss me, not like it's matter. I wouldn't afford the medicine and I wouldn't take it either- I'm just too stubborn/forgetful haha."

Tonight though is different. I have been laying down since about 9:40ish. Not so much tossing and turning, just... nor falling asleep. My usual tactics, reading, day dreaming, meditation... nothing has worked tonight. It's now almost 2 am.

Lately though it has stopped working, probably due to tolerance, so I'm looking to try out Zopiclone and/or Trazodone.

2174,"I can't remember the last time I've had a full 8 hours 25/m, I'm prescribed Adderall 30mg XR and 15mg IR. Have been for about a year now, and on lesser dosages for over 3 years now. My sleep issues started becoming more apparent in January 2018 that's when my Psychiatrist put me on Ativan, then Klonopin 1mg where I'm at now. Aside from that I work out 3 times a week, started working in my full time job a year ago, and it seems like ever since then my sleep cycle has gotten worse and worse. My biggest hurtle at night is simply falling asleep to begin with. This takes hours or from what I perceive it doesn't happen at all. I've been doing mindfulness, meditating, tried every over the counter Vitamin Supplement that are available and nothing seems to help. Even on the weekends when I don't take Adderall it's still the same issue. Very rarely Benadryl works, and Valerian Root also gives me incredibly pleasant dreams. But in my day go day life I feel like a shell of a human. I can feel all the proper sleep I haven't been getting. Everything is so bright, my mind is always perpetually racing. It's actually crazy im able to manage myself at work after getting any sort of recognized sleep, and by that I mean you can tell that you fell asleep.

I honestly wonder most of the time with my mind being so preoccupied playing out random stories and scenerios in my head if they are dreams or me being awake and making them up. That's the other thing to. So bizarre. The klonopin at this point does absolutely nothing and on top of that gives me brain fog and makes my memory horrible. I've tried Seroquel before and that stuff knocked me out wonderfully but again that has its tolerance issues also. I've been offered that in that by psychiatrist, I might persure that.

2176,"Any sleeping pills that aren't anti-depressants? I can't take antidepressants, I was on them my whole life up until 18, whenever I take them, they fuck up my life, make sleeping really difficult, give me super fucked up dreams (on top of my already daily super fucked up dreams), and I don't like the programming feeling they give. Literally every time I go to the doctor for a sleep aid, I get a different anti-depressant for sleep. I don't think most doctors actually pay attention to the counter-indicators related to each medication as well, meaning you'll basically sacrifice all other aspects of your life for that one ailment to be relieved but end up worse than you were to begin with.

So I have a friend who is more prone to panic attacks than me. Never having had a panic attack before, I could only sympathize. ""Must be rough."" Yeah. No kidding. 

I can't remember the exact hour this all happened. Probably around 1 AM.  I attempted to lie down on my bed, and the very instant my head hit the pillow, my heart started racing. My thoughts were rampant and worst outcomes immediately made the forefront of my mind. I think the only reason I didn't go completely insane was because I had taken some diphenhydramine HCL (Zzzquil), and it was starting to come into affect. The whole thing lasted between 5-10 minutes, but it felt like forever. I now empathize with anyone who had or has panic attacks. I had never had them prior to last night.

The problem is that I can't explain why I had the panic attack. Was it from an induced anticipatory sleep anxiety? It seems like the most likely explanation, but I'm not ruling anything out. I also start college again today (back from my Spring Break), and there's this big exam. Could that be the cause? Also, I have experience with loneliness, small bouts of depression, and of course anxiety. I remember feeling lonely last night before I fell asleep because I have this longing for a significant other, but no valid options. Been that way most of my life. Maybe all of these factors are the cause?


What are your thoughts, fellow redditors? You guys are more experienced than I and could use some opinions. Thanks in advance. Since I'm taking an exam later today, I'll make the possibilities that come to my mind multiple choice.

Why did I have a panic attack?

A)  Anticipatory Sleep Anxiety

B) The start of college coupled with the big exam

C) Loneliness and depression

I've struggled with insomnia since I was a small child (8 years old is when I really stated dreading bedtime). In college it got worse and I wrote this song that would mimic the headspace of racing thoughts and desperate attempts to fool myself into sleeping, but also as a self-deceptive lullaby ( I've found ethereal music with heavy bass and reverb have helped)

2184,"Anyone else experience this situation? I have sleeping problems far back in to my middle school days. Currently reaching mid-twenties and still having this problem here and there. 

As I get ready in bed and just when I hit the point of deep sleep, my brain all of a sudden says “hey let’s do this then you can sleep”. At that point I may or may not fall asleep till about a few hours/minutes/seconds later, when in my head my brain is repeating the phase “hey let’s do this then you can sleep.” (It doesn’t get loud but it is in a loop)

So for example, one night at 11pm my thoughts told me “let’s try doing a push up then we can sleep.” I some how got an hour of sleep after pushing (pun intended) that thought away. But the thought kept going in my head and I woke up. I try to ignore it but at this point it was almost 4pm and I really wanted a few more hours of sleep. So got out of bed, attempted 3 push ups, laid in bed and instantly knocked out.

For the past few days though, my sleep has been decent, without even the need for sleep aids.

Writing down a to do list and addressing all your anxieties was really helpful.

I write down everything that i have to do or think or worry about for the next few days, so my mind has less to worry about. I write down all my thoughts, worries, and anxieties, everything.. until i have nothing left.

After doing so, when i lie down, My mind is mostly quiet, since i’ve already exhausted everything. It really helps curb down all the anxiety and stress that i never noticed i’ve built up.

Anxiety and stress makes your body release high amounts of adrenalin and cortisol, and weirdly so, more when you’re sleep deprived, which makes it impossible to sleep.

It sounds weird and futile, especially when you’re desperate already and all you really want is something to finally knock you out.. But it has been really helping lately.

Numerous studies also suggest exercising while sleep deprived has harmful effects, such as slower recovery of the bodies muscles and CNS, weakening of the immune system, and in the long term causes overtraining, a dangerous state for the mind and body to be in.

I’m so frikin tired and I can feel how sleep my mind and body are. But every time I start to doze, my body has a “sleep start.” 

I know this happens to everyone every once in a while, but it’s been happening to me constantly for the last two weeks. And it’s EVERY time I start to doze. 

I’m miserable. I’m depressed. I don’t know what to do. 

My iron is low, and I’ve been on supplements for about two weeks now. My doctor just told me we should give the supplements for time and if not, maybe I need a sleep study.

I saw a similar post a while ago, and I would like to try it out.

I'm 32/M, and I've been dealing with sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia since late September (my dad died, work is irregular, post-travel blues, changes in dynamics with my closest friendships, etc.). I've been trying SRT since December, but the different medications I was on made me too lethargic, and when I got off them, I had anxiety attacks again in the mornings. Now, I am getting more stable emotionally with the help of yoga and can keep a consistent wake time again. 

I could use someone to motivate me, and who perhaps needs some motivation from someone going through the same thing, and who's willing to commit to their schedule.

My behavioral sleep specialist and I are looking at me going to bed at 1:00 AM. and getting out of bed at 6:30 A.M. for the next two weeks. Without medication, it takes me 1.5 to 2 hours to fall asleep, and I sleep about 3.5 to 4 hours. 

Let me know if you're interested. We can talk once a day over email, text, Reddit chat, or WhatsApp (if several people would like to support each other, we can form a WhatsApp group). We would let the other person know that they've kept to the protocol and exchange tips to manage stress, anxiety, and sleepiness during the day. As for timezones, I am in Ohio, so it's EDT. We can work around that, so no worries.

If we have similar sleep issues, it would be a more ideal match. Thank you in advance!

2218,"Confidence at an all-time low It's been a little over six weeks since I've slept and my confidence has completely plummeted. I rarely engage in social activities and find myself going out strictly for work (I'm a freelancer). I always make up excuses when friends invite me out. When I go shopping I usually stare at the ground and avoid eye contact. I feel like I've aged 5 years. I have dark spots & lines under my eyes and I swear my face has gotten thinner. As an already thin bald guy I joke that I look like the grim reaper. 

I met a woman in late January and it was going really well but I've essentially stopped communicating with her due to sleep deprivation and zero confidence. I've never had confidence issues with women and consider myself relatively charming & witty. Now though? I don't even feel like I'm the same person. I keep telling myself I'll message her when I get a few nights of sleep but of course that never happens.

Ironically, my career is actually going relatively well and I'm finally gaining some traction in my field. The problem is when meeting new clients I'm so self conscious and awkward because it feels like my brain is only functioning at about 70% and also I'm constantly wondering if they notice how stressed/tired I look. Furthermore, sleep deprivation has killed my motivation and drive. I have to force myself to finish projects or even start new ones.

I no longer have any excitement about life. It's like I'm going through motions everyday, never actually feeling good or happy. I used to wake up and at least feel content. Now? Each day blends into the next and I sort of sleepwalk through daily routines.

2226,"What's your go-to response for the ""just drink tea"" folks? I have come so far in fighting my insomnia. I get upset when I have days of sleepness but I also have to recognize that getting good sleep is now the norm for me while I used to hardly ever sleep at all. First, I dealt with a fear of sleeping due to childhood abuse and putting down my guard equating to more abuse. Then, I had a very stressful job and academic experience that rarely gave me time to sleep. Now, my life is much less stressful and I am going to therapy.

I know I still have a lot to overcome in dealing with the roots that caused my insomnia. I am a very open person about my past and my current struggles, which I feel is beneficial for me although it does provide more opportunities for responses that might not necessarily be helpful.

But it is really frustrating encountering the ""just drink tea"" folks. Yes, some holistic approaches and focusing on routine might be helpful. But it's hard to keep a routine if I might be up till 5 am struggling to sleep one night and doing much better another night. I *wish* just drinking a cup of chamomile tea and going to bed at the same time each night were a guaranteed recipe for good sleep.

Whenever I stay in a hotel room, I tend to have a very hard time sleeping. Either I'm awake all night (it makes me super anxious that I wouldn't be able to get up and pace or do something else, since someone else would be sharing the room and trying to sleep) or I have really bad hypnagogic hallucinations (I get these often but they are very bad in hotels because of the new setting, tends not to be very dark, lots of little lights, random sounds, etc). My hallucinations almost ALWAYS involve me waking up and thinking someone has broken into my room, so I'll say things like, ""Holy shit, there's someone standing over there!"" ""Someones looking in the window."" etc. Can you imagine sharing a room with someone you don't know and trying to explain this without scaring the shit out of them?

2235,"HELP and advice needed, sleep after truffles  Hello,

almost 3 weeks ago I took a recommended dose of shrooms from a well-rated shop in amsterdam. I had a bad trip despite me prepping a safe space/mindset. It lasted around 3 hours and managed to prevent a panic attack. Afterwards I slept like a rock.

Since then my sleep has been fucked to hell. A week later I could not sleep an entire night, but that was because of anxiety. The anxiety has almost fully dissapeared after I saw a therapist and doctor. During this 3 week time I have gotten only about 4 days of good sleep/slept almost throughout the night.

My ""default"" nowadays seems to be that I fall asleep like normal and sleep 4 hours- wake up- go back to sleep- sleep on and off, waking about each hour until I cant go back to sleep any more. The sleep after my first awakening is shallow and bad quality. I usually get a total of 5-6 hrs when before the drug I could sleep in for 10 hrs. I often have vivid dreams which I hate, they make me exhausted.

I already live a lifestyle of a balanced diet, excersize 2-4 times per week, and have a stable job. I have only had caffeine twice since the trip, I am currently trying meditation but I am bad at it.

The doc visit was short so she only gave me anti-anxiety meds which I have not taken, because to me that is a self-solvable part of my issue. My concern surrounds my sleep. I have searched online and found some people in an old forum that had the exact same symptoms I have...and later they wrote that the problems persist years later. This freaks me the fuck out because people claim that any long term issues after psilocybin use dissapear after some weeks/months. what is the truth?! If I knew this could happen I would never had taken the risk in the first place! The science around hallucinogens seems completely biased and i am truly pissed!

I have been considering contacting a sleep doctor but that may be difficult or impossible in my city.

2236,"I woke up at 7pm yesterday, missed work, am still awake at 12pm today. It is truly a mess. It's been months or maybe even a year since I had a nice sleep schedule. I should probably mention my work schedule too. I have been working at this company for 9 months, where there are a cycle of morning, afternoon and night shifts. It changes every two weeks, so just when I'm getting used to going to bed at a certain hour, it changes. It's my only option right now so I try to keep up. There have been times that it gets easier to just switch the hour by staying a little later but for the last two months I've been going through hell. Every time I try to sleep I just keep rolling around in bed for more than 2 hours before I can actually fall asleep.

I tried everything. Reading, meditation, staying awake until I'm about to pass out, drinking chamomile tea, stretching... I don't feel hunger much so I thought maybe that was it, I get hungry until I go to bed, so I try to eat like 2 hours before. Some of them worked once or twice but there never got to be a third successful attempt for any of them.

I do sometimes overthink that I need to sleep, so there's that. Sometimes migraine keeps me.

The thing is whenever I put my head on the pillow and try to sleep, thoughts just run around and focusing on the positive, trying to keep my mind away from daily challenges never work. So I have to keep myself busy until I drift off.

Even I fall asleep any time from now, I won't be able to make it to the appointment or fix the hours to wake up at Saturday morning.

For the past 2 years I have been convinced I had ALS, AIDS, Pancreatic Cancer, Fatal Insomnia, Parasites, Ear Cancer, Intestinal Gangrene, etc. Now, for the past month I have been worried about Creutzfeldt Jakob's Disease (dementia that kills you in months) I initially worried about it cause of a bout of depersonalization..and found it was a symptom so I was stuck on it. Then that went away and some other symptom would come about...like tremor or forgetting the name of something. Both those resolved a few weeks ago.

For the past 2 weeks, my sleep has been out of whack. I usually go to bed around 12/1am and wake around 10/11am. My husband had been away for a week and I always sleep like crud when he is not around. 

I ended up in a pattern where I couldn't fall asleep till 5am, 6am, 7am, 8am, 9am, then 10am. For the past 5-6 days...I sleep from 10am till 2/3pm which is technically within the normal range in terms of 'amount' of sleep. I have been trying desperately to sleep at midnight or even 1 but I will just lay there with my eyes closed, not feeling it at all. I can lay there for hours.. and hours. It doesn't help that I am having closed eye hallucinations EITHER. In the dark, in general, I see blobs and stuff...which is normal vision fluff for people in the dark. When I close my eyes, those blobs change to images. Sometimes they are triangles or bunches of moving shapes and sometimes they are people, realistic scenes. It looks like....if  you stare at something for a long time and then quick close your eyes... you can still see it pretty vividly for a second right? It's exactly like that. It isn't imagined, I can see it on the backs of my eyelids...and when I open my eyes in the dark too! It doesn't last a long time, maybe a few seconds. If I stare at it it morphs into other images, if I don't it goes away. 

This happens to me every time I try to 'force' myself to sleep and even more-so now cause I worry about it before I even 'try' to sleep. I lay down and go ""what if it happens again, am I dying? Does it mean I have something wrong with my brain?"". It's like... I see it is 12am and I reluctantly go to bed..I just have that fear in the back of my head. Then a image pops up and my heart starts racing like crazy cause I am scared . Once I DO fall asleep, those images are a thing of the past. Like, I can wake up, go pee, come back to bed, and go back to sleep without issue. I don't know if it is cause I am consciously 'looking' for these...so therefore they pop up (?) I don't even know if that is physically possible. However, I do know that when I am relaxed (like when you wake up)..the hyperawareness for those images is just gone. I just wake up normal and it just doesn't happen. I was looking up this phenomenon and I see ...SO many people on like, Yahoo Answers, dream sites, here, etc ask about ""images I see when closing my eyes"". I probably found like...30 hits? And I would say 75% of those people complain about images they see just when merely closing their eyes BEFORE trying to fall asleep, and they see the images projected onto their eyelids... like me.

For the past 2 days I have had 'brain farts' I suppose. I keep correlating them with the images I am seeing at night and I keep thinking hallucinations + dementia = CJD (which technically it does).

 

 For instance.﻿ I was in the bath and couldn't remember which faucet handle was cold/hot. Like I thought about it before I did it BECAUSE I was nervous about how worried I'd be if I picked the wrong one. I turned on the left handle thinking it was hot water but it was cold water... then I got scared. After my bath, I checked my weight on a beam scales (which I use a lot) and the notch bit on the end (that you use to determine whether to move the slider down or up) was down and I questioned whether I move the slider up or down to balance it out. I figured it out pretty quick and it was like a 'duh' moment.. but for that 1 second, I forgot. So I panicked. I also was watching Family Feud and the question of ""what is something your mother let you do, that your wife won't"" and I kept confusing it with ""something your mom didn't let you do that your wife does"". ﻿I also confused a goat for a donkey...and an otter for a beaver. Last week I was playing poker online (which I do all the time) and it came to my bet and I got totally confused for a second..like I had 100k chips and the bet was 2k and for some reason I questioned what 2k was..I just stared and contemplated it (isnt that odd?) It is a fast paced game, each player has 5 seconds hold/fold. I obviously figured it out right away..but for that second, I was lost! Afterward i panicked and did an online mathematics test (algebra, geometry, percentages, etc) to make sure my brain was working right...and my answers were almost always right (and i did every single equation in my head...i didn't use paper or a calc at all). Today I had 1 thing happen, my husband got some Pad Thai today and mine had these unique, awesome, 1 inch wide homemade noodles in it, they kinda looked like pieces of dough. Tons of bean sprouts, white onions, meat, etc. I acknowledged the noodles before i started eating...right? I was sitting with my husband, watching tv and I bit into a bean sprout thinking it was a small noodle...but it was crunchy, so i dug my fork to find the noodles underneath and then it hit me.. I realized I totally just blanked out on the fact I had the homemade noodles already in it. It was a total duh moment.

Now I am flipping myself out thinking I ACTUALLY have sporadic CJD..and the only way to diagnose it is a post-mortem. I am only 31.

For the last year I've been struggling with some kind of new type of depression which has resulted in me being a lighter sleeper and waking up in the mornings, before I'm fully rested, so I'm almost always very tired and feeling rubbish. Sleep quality is also reduced. I'm taking St Johns Wort.

I have the opinion that given the right nutrition and lifestyle all these problems should resolve themselves.

2247,"Do you feel the same? Soooo....this is Sleep Awareness Week....  
It seems like when a person has really been through something and comes out of it in victory, it creates a beautiful moment to pay it forward and help others who are still on their journey to their breakthrough – whatever that may be. ❤️  
For me, it’s sleep. I had HORRIFIC insomnia for over 12 years. Like REALLY bad. I would be up 12-14 days, couldn't nap, couldn't sleep AT ALL...then I would finally crash...for 1-2 hours. That's it. It led to disease, adrenal fatigue, gut issues and more.  
I was just reading an article and this year’s Sleep Awareness Week theme is ""Begin with Sleep"".   
As I was sitting here, reading what this theme is all about and what they are going to be touching on this week, (the benefits of optimal sleep, its effects on health, well-being and safety) I was thinking about what this theme would have meant to me 3, 5 or 10 years ago.  
When I dealt with horrific insomnia for over 12 years, I felt at times like it was going to take me out.  
As I was thinking about the theme for this week I thought ""So what?""...  
What do I mean by that?  
Well, that theme is all great for someone who sleeps good most of the time…someone who may not get enough sleep because of their own decisions (staying up late with friends, working late, etc. because it's what they want to do).  
But I’ll be honest with you.   
That theme would have almost felt hurtful to me when I was going through all those years of wanting SO badly to sleep…longing to be able to close my eyes and drift off to REM, literally willing to give up everything for one good night of restful, peaceful sleep.  
So as I was reading this article, I thought of you.   
I want you to know that someone hears you.   
Someone understands.   
And someone is standing beside you whispering in your ear that there is hope.   
There is hope that you will sleep again.   
There is hope that you will get your breakthrough and get the victory that I have experienced just last year.  
I know it may not seem like that today. I know a voice inside your head may be telling you otherwise.   
Don't listen to that voice.   
Listen to me instead. I don't have all the answers but I do know things can get better.  
Don’t stop moving towards your victory.  
Don’t ever give up or give in.  
Just remember my story. A simple girl from the Midwest that was in a horrible place not too long ago had a turnaround and is now sleeping and you can too.

Even in the rare case that I do fall asleep I'm still woken up 3 or 4 hours later and struggle to fall back asleep. I don't understand it, I'm young, I eat right, limit fluids, avoid alcohol and caffeine, exercise, multivitamin, you name it I've tried it. I just don't know what to do anymore.

2254,"food and supplement sensitivities behind insomnia Hello insomnia community.  I'm turning to you because a) you understand how horrible things can get, and 2) you have a lot of collective wisdom and wide experience not sleeping.  Here's my predicament...

I had severe insomnia for about a year, but that was 16 years ago, when I was suffering from severe agitated depression. I know about sleep hygiene, restriction, CBTi, and all the sleep herbs and drugs under the sun. Now I am happily medicated, although I am experiencing cognitive decline/impairment)   That may be from 10 years of Ambien 6 years ago, or from Paxil, as I've just learned. :-(

My insomnia now is sporadic, and I've discovered that LOTS of things keep me up. Some are typical: MSG, American ginseng,  caffeine (even small amounts of chocolate), stimulating movies, evening meetings, disagreements, traveling. I used to get raging insomnia before my period. Some things are weird: any lotions that ""stimulate"" anything (like collagen, cells, or hair growth), turmeric supplements, fish oil (even a piece of salmon for dinner!), ketogenic diet, Ginko biloba, fortified breakfast cereals, and other things I can't remember.

Most of the time, the snapshot is of something I stared at a lot that day or simply saw that day .. like playing solitaire on my phone and then I see like ...a photorealistic image of all the card rows (in detail), or simply the cover of a movie I had looked at that day. A lot of times, I also see it if I open my eyes (but then it fades away faster) It isnt bothersome, I just notice it.

For me the ""episodes"" (or so I call them) happen in waves. I sometimes go weeks sleeping pretty decently, and then out of nowhere comes the horrible wave of no sleep. When it gets bad NOTHING helps. I have tried everything most people suggest: melatonin (my body laughs at that), Ambien, natural substitutes for sleep meds, Marijuana, working out to tire my body out, etc. When the episodes are mild the weed or ambien will do the job, but when it gets out of control I just have to endure the sleepless nights.I fantasize about a normal restful night's sleep and dream about the day I wont have to down a shit ton of chemicals to knock out. I think what it comes down to is my brain won't shut off at night, and the constant random thoughts that pop up refrain me from sleep.

Klonopin is the only medication that knocks me out, but my psychiatrist has been trying to wean me off of that. I have horrible side effects with trazadone and antihistamines can mess with my stomach and make me feel nauseated.

Sun night to Mon morning,  after 0 sleep even with antihistamines, I felt horrible since I was hyped up on antihistamines AND had had 0 sleep. I bought some red wine, drank a bit, and took a 4-hour nap last night and then fell asleep again from midnight to 9 AM.

I have heard so many warnings about alcohol, from my developing a dependency to my experiencing liver damage to it causing restless sleep.

I have to keep plastic wrap to put over my glass since I can never finish it before I fall sleep.

2272,"As a physician, I get many parents that are sleep deprived and asking how to get a better nights sleep. Here are some tips you can try before you try medications **Cross posted from:** [**r/sleep**](https://www.reddit.com/r/sleep/)•Posted by[u/LifeofDrMom](https://www.reddit.com/user/LifeofDrMom)

All you parents out there probably know the importance of a good nights rest. Without it, we are more cranky, irritable, and our mental health suffers. There is something called “sleep hygiene” that I recommend to all of my patients, young and old, who are having trouble sleeping. This is usually the first step your doctor will recommend before reaching for the prescription pad or any further testing. For people with insomnia or sleep deprivation the best proven treatment is not with medication but actually specialized cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia. Sleep hygiene is a habit that you can start to form at night time to help the brain “shut off” so to speak. Because our brains are active and busy throughout the day, its hard for our brains just to turn off when we want them to.

Sleep hygiene is a set of behaviours you can implement at bedtime to help your brain shut off and get a good nights rest.

Parts of our society also contribute to peoples having difficulty sleeping – screens from iPads, iPhones, laptops, and TVs are a major contributor. These screens emit a type of light (blue light) that actually interferes with our hormones in our brain (melatonin) which disrupts our bodies sleep-wake rhythms. As a result, its more difficult to fall asleep at night.

What can i do to sleep better:

Create a comfortable sleep environment that is quiet, clean, and dark! Make sure your room does not have light coming in during the time you are asleep.

Don’t use your bed for anything but sleeping (sex is the only exception to this). Relax for 90 minutes before bed – no stressful conversations, intense tv shows, or working really hard.

Never go to bed hungry – if you need to, have a snack.

Go to bed at the same time every day, and wake up at the same time every day (this one is hard – especially when your on call over night at the hospital, but do it as much as possible because it is very important). Even if you get a crummy nights sleep the night before, still try to get out of the bed at the same time the next morning. Over time, with this your sleep will become more regular.

Get active throughout the day. Try and get at least 30 minutes of heart pumping exercise. Preferably at the beginning of your day, but for sure no later than 2-3 hours before you go to bed as this will prevent you from winding down.

Avoid alcohol – alcohol disrupts your restful stages of sleep, so although you might fall asleep easier and even sleep more, you will not spend your time sleeping in the restful stages which will make you much more tired the next day (anyone whose ever had a hangover probably has experienced this).

Don’t smoke, but if you do try not to smoke several hours before bed. Nicotine stimulates the brain and can make it more difficult to sleep.

Get as much natural sunlight throughout the day! This will help regulate your sleep-wake cycle. If you live in a part of the world that gets light at all hours (for example – Iceland in the summer time) – you will want to black out your house from light during the night and in the 2-3 hours before you wind down for bed.

Go to your doctor and have them review your medications – some medications can prevent people from falling asleep (like thyroid medications, and medications for ADHD). Likewise, some medications can make people sleep throughout the day (like medications for the heart). Optimizing medications that are interfering with your sleep may will help.

If you have difficulty with sleep, avoid napping throughout the day (unless you are a toddler). Napping throughout the day can throw off your sleep cycle making it more difficult to fall asleep, and stay asleep, at night.

Sleep hygiene is a process and you do need to be patient! Hang in there, be persistent and consistent with the changes you made!"

Little background. I always had bad anxiety. Bout two years ago I started to get insomnia while working 3rd shift. Went to the ER after a two day sentence with no sleep. (Biggest waste of time) but they gave me Atarax 25mg. Being a wimp, I'd brake them in half. Most nights it would eventually get me to sleep. Then someone suggested melatonin to me. I bought 3mg of those and same story. Broke them in half.  This went on for about 3-4months. Then I stumbled on to something about magnesium deficiencies. And how insomnia is one of the symptoms. Along with anxiety and a few other symptoms that I just happen to have. So my ass googled foods with the highest amounts of magnesium. Went to the grocery store and got to it. And it really started to help. I ended up getting off 3rd shift and  then my sleep drastically improved. For a good few months I slept great. Then I started having issues again that was pointing towards possibly having a magnesium deficiency so I been dealing and stressing over that. Which brings us to this past Monday where my sleep started to go down hill. I got a lot of sleep over the past weekend. Then Monday night I only got around 5 hours. And it's been declining ever since. Now I'm lucky if I even get 3. The only Atarax I have left is old. I have some Lorazepam 0.5mg that I've never taking. And melatonin 3mg that I tried taking last night but didn't help. People keep suggesting Tylenol P.m or NyQuil, none of which I've taking.  Any suggestions??"

2302,"Anyone dealt with insomnia from coming off Mirtazapine/Remeron? I did an accelerated taper to get off Mirtazapine because I'm doing a new drug therapy trial and can't be on antidepressants. Now I'm lucky if I get five hours of sleep a night. Part of the reason why I went on Mirtazapine was because of sleep issues but now it feels like it screwed up my sleep even worse coming off it. Right now I'm on about 10 mg of Melatonin and 50 mg of Hydroxyzine and that gets me to sleep but I still wake up early.

Has anyone dealt with something like this? Does it get better? FYI, I've been off Mirtazapine for a little over three weeks. Any advice would be much appreciated. Thanks in advance!

Edit: Also, if you are going or having gone through these type of issues when tapering, what dosage did you start out at before your taper? How long have you been tapering? Also, what's your taper schedule been like? Thanks!"
2303,"Anyone had success with a non-standard prescription sleep med, if only for a few days? I have DSPD, Delayed Sleep Phase Disorder. Since my mid-teenage years, sleeping before 2-3 AM has been an impossibility for me. I'll keep this short because I'd imagine not being to sleep at all sucks far worse than my situation.

For my job, I need to change my hours drastically for a few days. My psychiatrist has prescribed me ""the usual suspects"" for past similar (but shorter) situations, and none have worked: Ambien, Lunesta, Sonata, Trazodone, Seroquel, Doxepin, Mirtazapine, Rozerem, Belsomra, melatonin, and lots of OTC/herbal medications. 

 I looked at drugs.com and surprisingly found lots of medications I have yet to try. So all is not lost. Have any of you successfully had a good night's sleep even if only for a few nights on any prescribed sleep medication not on this list? Have any failed? All experiences welcome! I know the ""none of us are doctors"" disclaimer, but others' experiences will really help here, as my doctor has told me to do some research myself as to what might help.

Remember, I will only be taking this medication for four nights at the most. Then I will return home and can return to my unusual circadian rhythm. Thank you!"
2304,"I've become extremely paranoid the second I attempt to sleep Okay this isnt the best place to post this but i cant think of anywhere else to post this. So recently (last 2 weeks) I've been unable to sleep until the early hours of the morning because I am absolutely paranoid something is in the house.

My bedroom is above the sitting room and all our animals are always locked in the kitchen. There's a bird nest at the corner of my room in the gutters but I know what they sound like. There's no attic either so no real chance of critters. 

When I start settling down for the night I hear thuds and noises, almost like someone just mooching around in the living room during the day. They're the same sounds like someone picking up or putting down a tv remote or sitting on the couch. The tv is always off and same with any console. There's nothing that can really be making noises down there.

I'm a big skeptic too so I don't really believe in the paranormal. And even if I did there's nothing that's happened in my house to warrant that sort of activity (the house is relatively new and we knew the owners before us). But sometimes I hear shit when I know completely that no one could actually be down there

I've become paranoid to the point of breakdowns in the night and always get up in the night to walk down the hallway to find both my parents and my brother asleep. Animals too. I never really muster up the courage to actually go downstairs tho (cause lets face it im a rather small woman in the case of something being there). 

I have honestly no idea what to do because it's stressing me out so much and I'm constantly anxious. I don't know if it's auditory hallucinations possibly manifesting due to school stress (I have big exams coming up) or what but I feel  like I'm going insane. My mom thinks I'm just anxious and need to exercise more or whatever but idk. 

What do y'all think?? Is there any sort of solution??"
2305,"Seeing vivid images every time i drift off Like I will lay there, just kinda drifting off...having my imagination take over (which is normal) and then BAM i get a 'flash' of a persons face. Not just a flash, but like...it stays there for like a solid minute in the absolute most vivid, detailed way. It is like literally, physically looking at a photo. I open my eyes at this time and it is still there, just as clear. Then it fades out. I try and sleep again and it does it again. O have never had this happen before but it seems routine for me the last week or so. Like multiple times a night. Am i dying or going nuts? This doesnt seem like normal going to sleep inagery if it happens a lot and sticks in my vision even when opening my eyes."

2309,"My body's saying 'Let's go,' but my head is saying 'no' So I've started experiencing a whole new level of hell with insomnia. In the last few months, especially when I'm really tired, I am sometimes entering this weird ""sleep"" where I can feel my body shut down, but my brain is still running normally. It's so weird. When I feel it happen, I can feel the vasoconstriction starting (my extremities all get very tingly, then almost numb, but not unpleasantly) and I can feel all my muscles relax. My breathing becomes slow and relaxed like it does when you fall asleep, and every physical part of me feels as though I've entered into sleep.

Except my brain. My thought processes still run as usual. I could be thinking about going to work, grocery shopping, etc. It is the most bizarre sensation to have my body be asleep, but my brain be awake. Additionally, I've experienced sleep paralysis in the past, but this isn't it. It's something else entirely. And I get bored. Because consciously, I'm just fucking laying there awake while my body sleeps.

Has anyone else experienced this?"
2310,"It's not working. Everything. All useless. Nothing can push me through the night. I tried every other pills, dozens of them, and nothing came out of it.

I am lost. I don't know what to do. Scars, or consious sufferings.

And all I can say is, yeah."
2311,"My experiences with insomnia (tips from a recovering insomniac) First of all if any of you suffer from acute insomnia and haven't yet seen a GP - go see one. My biggest mistake was that I was too stubborn to go to the doctor, when I suffered from stress-induced insomnia.

&#x200B;

The following is a couple of experiences I've had battling my insomnia. They might work for you and they might not . Insomnia has many faces - figuring out what triggers your insomnia is the first step towards treating it.

&#x200B;

(If you don't suffer from mental-health issues or respiratory diseases, you can skip the following two paragrahps).

&#x200B;

As mentioned my insomnia started when I was going through a stressful time in my life. I had too much work and there was an imbalance between workload and spare time. Therefore, if any of you feel like things are out your hand, that you have just too much on your plate - take a break. When I found out just how stressed I was, I sought out help from a psychotherapist and gave myself a six-month vacation to calm down and recover. This helped me immensely. Your mental health is alfa-omega when dealing with insomnia, so do not hesitate to get psychotherapy.

&#x200B;

Second of all, I suffer from asthma and allergy, which means I use steroid-inhalers daily. The side affects of these vary individually. I found out that they have an arousing affect on me, so I started taking my medication earlier in the day.  Another implication of having allergy is that I have very sensitive sinuses and get a clogged nose very easily, which in turn made me breath through my mouth instead of my nose, which then made me wake up with dried out mouth several times a night. To counteract this I started using a presciption nasal-spray and started breathing more through my nose during the day. The latter may be counterintuitive, but the logic is this: how can a vital organ of the body function, without it being used? Think of it as a muscle - they grow when they're used and wither when not. As I looked in to it, the connection between breathing and sleeping is also very well known. E.g. when you focus on your breath you stimulate the prefrontal cortex of your brain, which regulates emotions and that might help you to relax, which is why mindfulness meditation work for some. So if you're suffering from respiratory issues - go see a GP.

&#x200B;

The most effective thing I implemented however was CBT. Shit works. Mainly for me it has helped regarding the anxiety that I got every time I went to bed. Now if I feel uneasy or unable to sleep it's okay, because I know, that if don't fall asleep within 20-30 minutes, I just get out of bed and do something that I enjoy and that is also relaxing. Like reading a nice book or taking a shower. CBT has proven to be the most effective treatment for insomnia. In studies it has been found to be more long-term beneficial than medication. As CBT is so often mentioned on this page, I won't go any further into describing it's benefits and principals because it's mentioned a lot on this sub, but seriously if you haven't tried it yet - try it. You can find all the information you need regarding CBT through a quick google search.

&#x200B;

Blue light: Do not use your phone or computer in bed and at least one hour prior to sleep. Your circadian rythm is heavily dependant on the balance between light and darkness. Try out som blackout curtains aswell to block out the light that might wake you up in the morning. Sunglasses are also very useful in blocking out light, when you just have to watch a game of late night sports or a good movie. F.lux is also helpful in limiting blue light.

&#x200B;

And there's one last thing which I've found to be helpful: when you go to bed find a comfortable position and then just lie still. Don't move whenever you feel an urge to do so. The logic behind this is that just as being physically active make you more awake - the opposite must be true. Physical inactiveness should make you more sleepy. It's a theory of my own making and therefore it might not work for you, but try it out.

&#x200B;

Lastly, to anyone out there feeling like life just isn't worth living. Hang in there. You have so much to live for. Don't let insomnia get the better of you, and I for one believe in you and your ability to change your life for the better. Seek comfort in the fact that you are not alone and there will always be people on this sub to support you, when the going gets tough.

Edit: Forgot to mention caffeine and nicotine. There's a very common misunderstanding regarding how long caffeine affects your sleep. When people say that caffeine only affects your sleep for 5-8 hours, they're actually thinking of the half-life of caffeine, which is 5-8 hours. Therefore if you get 300mg of caffeine by noon you'd still have 150mg in your system by the time you go to sleep. My advice is to not drink coffee or other caffeinated beverages after noon."
2312,"daylight savings can eat shit already was awake bc can’t sleep and have to be up at 7, now daylight savings hit and i lost another hour :) :)"
2313,"I gave in and got Ambien. The results were not as expected. My cardiologist who is also board certified in sleep medicine was alarmed to see I only sleep 2-3 hours the few days I was in hospital. He questioned me on whether I was just uncomfortable in the surroundings but I laughed and told him I never sleep more than that. 

He was shocked and said how bad that is, and he made a note of it. Offered me low-dose, one month Ambien to work on my sleep and then we’ll start aggressively attacking whatever is keeping me up (dozens of labs, sleep Study if I want it, checking hormones finally but first electrolytes iron etc etc). So I happily accepted, battled with my insurance to cover it, and hopped into a bed after a long day. 

And waited. And waited. Finally knocked out at 2am and woke at 7, assuredly an improvement however slight but not what I had expected. A friend said she was on 10mg I’m on 5 so maybe that’s why? Anyway. I’ll take it, but it’s no magic pill. Hopefully the extra sleep will help me clear my head and be more focused on fighting my health issues. 

Much love to all my fellow sufferers. He’s Ivy League educated and laughed when I said my PCP said mild potassium and magnesium deficits couldn’t cause insomnia. He says they can, do maybe that should be checked too? Just an idea for anyone with an uncooperative doc like I had prior. I am anemic which used to keep me sleeping 7 hours a day but now it’s turned on me. Still anemic, 20 Years off and on and no longer can sleep at drop of a hat. "
2314,"Sleep restriction therapy - Can your body adapt to it and make insomnia worse? My girlfriend’s insomnia has recently gotten to the point where she now doesn’t sleep at at during the night. She has tried to do different aspects of CBT, like not being in the bedroom before bed or using her phone past dinner time, but she still couldn’t sleep. 

So recently, she started going to bed late and getting up early. After a few nights, she actually got a few hours of sleep; the first time in a while. 

However, the following nights were sleepless, again. She actually doesn’t feel as tired in the morning as she did before, though she still has a hard time going through 9 pm - 12 AM. 

Can the body adapt to it and actually require less sleep? And how long. Does it take to see beneficial effects to your sleep? She has been doing it for over a week, but not much more and she’s already feeling discouraged because of what I described. 

Also, how should I feel about that? We’re not sleeping together anymore because she can’t sleep next to me and I understand. However, yesterday, I had 5 hours of sleep and I felt completely drained, but I felt bad because she wasn’t showing that she felt drained, though she had close to 0 hours of sleep. And I sleep very well and so easily. It often makes me feel bad to be tired after sleeping so much, compared to her.

2315,"Insomnia and keep waking up after dreams finish I've had a lot of issues with sleep over the past 5 months which led to me taking sleeping pills for a few weeks, followed by lorazapam and mirtazipine (remeron) - both of which I only took for 2 weeks and then stopped. 

I now find myself unable to fall sleep for hours despite feeling sleepy and being near the point to where I usually would drop off to sleep and remain asleep. After a few hours I'll enter a dream (or what feels like a dream, sometimes it feels like a dream in a wakeful state) and then wake up as soon as this dream has finished and it's only been 20 / 30 mins. This will happen throughout the night : dream - wake up - dream - wake up - dream - wake up. 

The periods in between waking up and falling back to ""sleep"" again can also be lengthy too.

I don't want this to be a setback for me. I have experienced insomnia for 5 years. When the first time I had it, it have similar symptoms like this one. At that time I couldn't fall asleep like at all maybe an hour or two per night sometimes nothing at all. It was the worst time of my life. I pushed through with no meds. Nothing. I don't even know how I did it. And now the symptoms is coming back again and I don't know what's wrong. I've been to doctors, plenty of em they don't know what's wrong with me. My symptoms consist of brain fog, extremely sleepy even though I did sleep, legs feeling dead when I wake up, mild headache, neck pain, my menstrual cycle stopped ever since my insomnia started (Yes, I have to take medications for it).

2317,"Insomnia suddenly getting better Hey there!

A couple of weeks ago I started to fall asleep at night without even noticing it, and it's been like that ever since. 

A bit of background: I started having insomnia over four years ago. I was writing my dissertation at the time and working a lot overnight. I work much better at night, but then at 7 am I'd have trouble falling asleep. So I started taking Ambien to sleep on those days. At about that same time, my partner started snoring louder than ever. I mean, it was a nightmare (ironically). He got surgery, but the problem never went away completely and his snoring would still keep me up. After a while I decided to go back to my normal sleeping hours to see if that would make things better. It didn't work. And so, the insomnia became a constant in my life.

Ever since I would only be able to sleep a full nights sleep after taking Ambien. No specific thoughts would keep me up, I was able to really relax up to a point of almost being in trance, but then I would open my eyes, need to pee, feel uncomfortable, too hot, etc. I wasn't kept up by anxiety or worries about my dissertation, for instance. So much so, that after it had been accepted and I was finally done with it, I still wouldn't sleep. 

I didn't understand: how could other people do it? I tried everything from tea, yoga, meditation and mindfulness, acceptance techniques, ASMR, aromatherapy, no blue light, exercise regularly during the day, you name it.

But then, about four weeks ago, I started sleeping naturally again. Just like that. I remember waking up in the morning and thinking ""what the bleep just happened? When did I fall asleep?""

The only thing that had changed recently was that I started CBT again. But it's weird, 'cause I still hadn't had any time to implement the techniques the therapist suggested. And I've been doing nothing special, no meditation, no nothing. Just going to bed.

I still don't know what exactly happened, but hey: I sure hope it stays like that!

2318,"Late night thoughts: the worst part about growing up is realising that all your idols were wrong. I know this is not the conventional thing to post on here but I thought it would be helpful for me to keep a log of the thoughts that keep me up at night, so here it goes. As a child I used to idolise my father and my mother, only to grow up to realise that they’re severely flawed human beings like the rest of the world. When I was a teenager I turned to the one place I could to find a role model: film. This one film in particular stuck with me; it was called Into The Wild. Christopher McCandles was my absolute idol at 17 years old. I remember I couldn’t wait to come home back from school and watch the story of his life from my laptop. Now, 2 years later, I realise that he was wrong about a lot of things. His whole philosophy, no matter how right he may have been, is the reason he’s dead right now. It makes me wonder, is everything I’ve ever admired or aspired to be just bullshit? Does growing up mean you have to let go of every fantasy you’ve ever had of things getting better and just let your life happen to you, one disastrous moment at a time?"
2319,"I created my own technique to fall asleep, and it's working! Hoping this helps others! I have tried many, many things to help me fall asleep at a reasonable hour regularly. I came up with this idea and it has been showing really positive results for me! I feel like I have taken control of my sleep! Let's do this:

Hypnagogia is the experience of the transitional state between wakefulness to sleep. During this transition, the mind can create a wide variety of sensory hallucination, the most common being visual and auditory, but can also be tactile and nonsensical thoughts.

For the sake of this technique, we will only be focusing on sight and sound.

Visual experiences can range from bright flashes, random speckles, lines or geometrical patterns, to a nonsensical recreations of physical reality, similar to what you experience in a dream.

Auditory experiences vary in intensity from faint impressions like white noise (babies sleeping to white noise might be helping them reach the hypnagogic state), to loud noises, like knocking, crashing and bangs, to sentences being spoken or someone saying your name.

 

The Technique

This technique involves tricking the mind into believing it has entered the hypnagogic state of consciousness, so it can take the next step and allow the body and mind to enter sleep mode.

To trick the mind, you must simply create the experience of Hypnagogia inside your mind. The easiest to recreate is the visual experiences. 

The first step is to close your eyes, and completely relax your eyes and eyelids.

Next, visualise the moving patterns you would see in a kaleidoscope. Rather than with bright colours, make the geometric patterns grey and dull. Mine appear more like dark swirling clouds. Focus only on this visual disregarding the minds random thoughts, just as you would focus on one thing only during a meditation.

Once you can visualise this, the next step is to allow yourself to step into the scene happening inside your mind. Leave your physical body behind and feel yourself in your non-physical body inside your mind.

This alone should be enough to create a momentary shift in your reality that feels much closer to sleep. 

The final aspect you can add is the sounds, or rather lack of sounds. Focus your hearing on the scene you have created in your mind. You should experience silence or a very low dull hum. This will help you fully immerse into your kaleidoscope scene. 

Try this every night, and work on holding the visual for longer periods of time. For the first week you might only be able to hold this in your mind for a few seconds before your mind interrupts you. That will be long enough to fall asleep if you keep trying, although it may take 20 attempts. Keep trying when the distractions come up.

Once you have began to pay attention to the hypnagogic state, you should start discover different visuals that you experience naturally as you fall asleep, and you can recreate these as they may work better for you.

2320,"Guys a question about Quetiapine & Lamotrigine??? Hey guys im back

 So I had a terrible case of insomnia & anxiety that happened in late jan. I posted on here as well what I was experiencing. My sleep was gone and it almost drove me mad lol....since then I've been put on meds for the first time, which still scares me.

 My question. The doctors said that they want me on Quetiapine 25mg at night for sleep. And they want me on Lamotrigine 25mg in the morning. They told me its not addictive. They said that they want me on this medication until my anxiety can get back to normal. Are they lying? Or is it possible to get back to your normal self threw these medications???

 I had this same type of thing happen to me in 2010. And I beat it threw exercise & breathing. But I think the difference now is that I'm working now.

And then during the day I'm too tired to engage in meaningful social interactions or activities. I have to spend at least an hour in the gym every day to get at least some sleep and after that I'm too tired to do anything. Last night I did not have enough energy to even shower.

Like since I can’t focus on anything, they just move rapidly and keep my awake. So like the title says, I will have my eye lids shut but my eye balls will be constantly moving around, as if they need something to focus on but there is nothing to focus on. It’s actually exhausting. I’ve never really had this problem up until this last year. It’s like I don’t have this problem, until I think of the problem and then it just doesn’t go away. I usually just give up on sleeping because it is so frustrating. It has nothing to do with me not being tired enough to sleep either. I’m always really sleepy when it happens.

But as I grew up my mental health got worse and worse due to trauma and issues in my home life. Anyways around the time I turned 21, my mental health and insomnia had gotten so bad I ended up attempting suicide. I got to a point where once I didn’t sleep for 2 days straight and that was scary af...i was hospitalized in September of last year and put on medication and things got better but not perfect. Its been a few months and things improved a lot. I was told I have borderline personality disorder, major depression and generalized anxiety. Now lately I’ve been doing well except the past 3 nights I honestly didn’t sleep that bad. But I always wanna overanalyze my sleep. Normally the past few weeks I had been more depressed so I had been sleeping so much. Then suddenly I started waking up earlier and I started being obsessive about my sleep again which gave me anxiety. Last night I couldn’t sleep so being the anxious person I am I went down the rabbit hole and started reading about fatal insomnia and I know I shouldn’t have because this happened to me before and I know it’s not good to look at this things. Anyways I tried to sleep and I eventually fell asleep but I truly don’t remember how much I slept. I don’t feel sleep deprived tbh. I always feel sluggish bc of my depression so that’s normal. I think I slept brokenly. I just don’t know I’m so anxious. I wish I could take more ativan but my doctor isn’t letting me. I need some reassurance please. Does life ever get better?

2347,"Can insomnia be a way to get attention ? The insomnia keeps going and I don’t get crazy over it as much anymore, but I’m TERRIFIED of going to sleep. Because the worst is feeling like you’re about to sleep, and then suddenly you’re awake again.

So I just stay in bed reading on my phone even though I’m kind of sleepy because I’m terrified to turn off the lights and just stay there forever and nothing happens.

I was looking forward to this weekend that I have organised but unfortunately I already know what it’s gonna be like : pretending to have fun when all I want is to shower and sleep. Even though I know I won’t sleep but still, that’s all I can think about.

Maybe insomnia is a way to get attention ? Not in a whimsy way but more as in people who have been neglected or abused in their lives and they start developing things like anorexia or self harm...
Sometimes it seems like the subconscious will speak through the body asking what it needs that way because it never got it in normal situations. Like they didn’t receive care or love and being sick is the only way the psyche has found to get this care and love if that makes sense.

If you can’t sleep your health deteriorate and people then have to notice you.
I have no idea how this kind of problem can be solved though.

2356,I’ve just developed an irrational fear that I will never sleep again I truly hate it. Is there a cure please help me.
2357,"A method i’ve found for having a more restful nap... the “Xanax nap” One trick i’ve found after dealing with chronic insomnia for 4 years is what I call the “xanax nap”... Just a low dose of Xanax is needed (0.25 - 0.50mg) and there’s no need to fall asleep during the nap. Just take a Xanax and then lay down for 30-50 minutes. After doing this I genuinely feel rejuvenated every time (and it only works if I take Xanax before the nap) even though I never actually fall asleep.  So somehow the Xanax is making my naps more restful.

As a side-note... I DON’T recommend taking Xanax before bed because that can lead to dependence. Remeron is a better option I think."

When I wake up at 3 or 4:00am for 7th day in row, I usually just read some more books till 6:00am, feel tired then fall back asleep for an hour or two.

For the last 4 years i’ve had chronic insomnia (and lost two awesome jobs because of it), and i’ve been able to get restful sleep every other night (thanks to Remeron 15mg)... but on bad nights I have to spend the day taking “naps” throughout the day (except i never actually fall asleep during these naps, so not sure if they’re technically “naps”). I just can't get myself to fall asleep during a nap. Also, once i’m up (usually 6-7 am) I’m unable to go back to sleep (or “sleep in”)... so are there actually people here that have chronic insomnia but are able to fall asleep during naps in the daytime?

I think the cause of my insomnia could be because of being threatened by a person with a gun because ever since that happened my brain seems to be “stuck” in fight-or-flight mode to some extent... but maybe not.

I’ve been suffering with insomnia for the past year. I originally had trouble falling asleep and staying asleep. Now I can fall asleep fine at 10pm but wake up a couple of times then when it gets to around 3am, I have absolutely no hope in getting back to sleep. In my mind I’m already thinking about work and how horrendous it will be if I don’t get back to sleep. Then I start basically counting down the time in my head till it’s time to get up.

I’ve tried various different things my rooms dark, quiet (ear plugs) and comfy. I’ve tried hypnotherapy, calming music, natural sleep aids, prescription sleep aids zoplicone and amitryplene. They all had a similar effect, they helped get me to sleep but didn’t keep me asleep.

I try to exercise regularly but I feel so drained all the time it’s seems such a chore.

Most recently I’ve been referred to a non respiratory sleep disorder clinic. But I’m unsure this will help where it says “The majority of the patients presenting with insomnia have some psychiatric disorder such as depression and anxiety. Since we do not have resources to manage primary psychiatric problems, we encourage that such patients are referred elsewhere from primary care.”

I’m 99% sure mine is related to stress/anxiety so don’t really understand why my doctor referred me or wether to even book an appointment with them where I don’t want to waste there time.

I’ve got a telephone consultation for CBT (Cognitive behavioural therapy) near the end of the month that I’m hoping might help.

It’s got to the point now where it’s affecting every aspect of my life I start the day absolutely knackered, I look so drained all the time and it’s even rapidly increased my hair loss which makes me more stressed and anxious! Work is a struggle, I never feel ‘on the ball’ anymore, I kind of feel in my own little world. I’m a lot more snappy which is causing arguments in my relationship. I love exercising but when you’ve had 3/4 hours sleep and have been at work for 10 hours it seems daunting. I do manage to drag my self there almost every other day still. But very rarely feel energised enough to give it 100%.

I’m hoping CBT will help change my thought processes and stop my overthinking and I’ll be able to overcome this but until then I was just wondering if there is anything else I could try ?

I’ve considered trying weighted blankets where a lot of people seem to have good results with these ? But I get fairly hot during the night and all of the recommended breathable ones are from other countries (I’m in the UK).

Three weeks ago when this all started I managed to come across SFI (Sporadic Fatal Insomnia) and I've obsessively looked into it and it's become a serious fear I'm having. I'm now afraid to sleep. I'll admit my sleep got worse after googling everything about it. I know it's extremely rare and almost statistically impossible that I have it. Yet, the more my sleep declines,the more fearful and real it feels that I have it.  My pupils aren't miosis,yet I keep thinking about how badly I've been panicking,losing sleep rapidly(especially this week) and loss of appetite. I've got migraines,and  see ocular flashes. I'm burning and sweating when I wake up as well as panic. And now my chest burns when I lie down.(maybe it's because I haven't eaten?) Sometimes it feels like I'm having a concious seizure. My brain feels foggy, my body is weak and exhausted. I'm very sleepy and tired. I just want to know that it's just my anxiety and that I'll be okay once I get a grasp on it. I am so far down the rabbit hole of severe panic and sleep deprivation that I can't convince myself I don't have it. I'm scared and just want to sleep normal again. This is just too much."

2401,"WOULD APPRECIATE ANY kind of help!!! Feeling hopeless at the moment. I have a question about antihistamines. Diphenhydramine hydrochloride to be specific it is an ingredient in bendaryl and nyquill. (Short. Just skip to last paragraph) Skip to the last paragraph if you’re not interested in reading the whole thing.

Hello guys, I’m desperate honestly and i need a quick fix at the moment because i have an important exam on Monday and this is a fucking nightmare.

My GP referred me to a sleep specialist i’ll see him in a week. I asked him if I could use antihistamines occasionally till my appointment and he says it’s fine.  

Anyway I usually get tired after 12-14 hours of staying awake just like a normal human being but I simply cannot sleep. So every single day i get extremely tired and im unable to sleep and sadly i cant even study and be productive bec of the tiredness. I have no issues with sleeping 8 hours straight my issue is just falling asleep.

My issue is that i cant sleep at a normal time. Even if i force myself to stay up the next day I noticed that i still can’t sleep at a normal time despite being tired. I’ll give you an example let’s say i get sleepy and im ready to sleep by 6am i cant sleep at that time because i have college. I go to college get back home  and i still cant sleep! I have to stay up till it’s past 12am in order to do so. If i slept comfortably without forcing myself to get up my sleep will keep on shifting forwards every day.

My GP told me it is ok to use antihistamines (diphenhydramine) occasionally im just wondering if it would work if im not sleepy? Would it work if i took it after 12 hrs of staying awake or do I have to be a little tired? I know everyone is different but i also know melatonin and valerian root for example do not work for sooo many people. Im assuming antihistamines work for almost everyone. So when is a proper time to take it? 
 
EDIT:  When I said “sleep comfortably without forcing myself” i did not mean sleeping in. I simply mean if i get 8 hours of sleep everyday my sleeping WILL keep on shifting forward. I can only get 8 hours of sleep during the weekend. During the weekdays I force myself to wake up for college so i get less than 8 hours "

I currently do shift work, up to 18 hour shifts, sometimes not getting home until 7 am or so. I then may be working again at 9 am a day later. I sometimes do long shifts like these on no sleep whatsoever. I've been prescribed Zopiclone 7.5 mg a number of times for use before particularly important days - and it works pretty well. I'm looking to get a 9 - 5 job as clearly this line of work isn't a good fit for my insomnia. I'm also looking to move to an expensive city, so would like to do some shift work on the weekends to supplement this. My problem is that if I go to sleep at 4 am one night, I can't fall asleep earlier than 4 am any night following this - until I do an all-nighter to reset my pattern.

I was thinking that I could work 9 - 5 throughout the week, pick up the odd late evening shifts on the Friday/Saturday, and then, every Sunday evening around 11 pm, take Zopiclone to put me back on a good pattern for the following week. Rinse and repeat.

Is this an awful idea? Would I become dependant long-term if only taking it once per week? And would any GP actually prescribe this?

I don't know why I've developed insomnia this time (used to have it in college but that was years ago). There's been no change in my daily schedule and no new stress.
I do all the proper sleep hygiene stuff. Screens are off at least an hour before bedtime. I get up at the same time every day(7am), go to bed at the same time every day(9pm). I don't have any caffiene after noon.

 This hasn't changed yet I can't fucking sleep. Melatonin helps me fall asleep but doesn't prevent me from waking up. Taking it more than a couple nights in a row makes me depressed. Other sleep aids like unisom make me feel drugged for a whole day after taking it.

I’m not sure what could be causing this. I sleep on a wedge pillow and avoid eating right before bed due to a history of reflux...I feel like being elevated would reduce my chances of reflux causing this but idk. I’m worried if I mention it to my doc she’s gonna send me for a sleep study which might now show it because this only happens every couple nights or so. Either way it’s terrifying and I wanna know if anyone else has dealt with it.

2406,"Using new Fitbit to track what helps me sleep and what doesn’t. It’s helpful but depressing... And honestly kind of creepy how accurate it is. For example last night when I actually got some rem sleep I kept waking up from nightmares and falling back into them, it was bizarre, and all tracked too. I don’t know how but it was startlingly accurate. 

I’ve been tracking exactly what I do vs how much sleep I get. Does anyone else do this? Do you find it helpful? I found that on the nights I take ambien, I don’t get much more restful sleep than the nights where I don’t. I almost always take melatonin, and get about 3-5 hours, almost all of that time spend in the light sleep stage, periodically walking up. The past week I’ve been extra depressed and exhausted, but my sleep didn’t feel abnormal (for me).  My watch told me I was getting about 10-20 minutes of deep sleep per night, and always less than an hour of rem.  70% or more spent in light sleep. 

Last night I was having manic episodes followed by crying so rapidly that I thought I was losing my mind. So I took one of my emergency Xanax, that I usually save for airplanes (I travel a lot to visit family). I got a whopping TEN HOURS tracked. Two of those hours I was awake in the middle (see mention of nightmares above).  But still that is eight hours!!  I never get eight hours. Two hours of rem, one and a half hour of deep sleep. How can Xanax be more effective for sleep than ambien? 

Of course, the dangerously addictive and hardly prescribed drug is the one that helps the most.  I have a cousin who was addicted, downing pills and chasing them with vodka every day.  I know the risk is real.  I’m still a little blown away by how easily I went back to sleep after I woke up (that also NEVER happens, once I wake up in the early morning that’s usually it and no more sleep will come). Has anyone experienced anything like this? What does it mean??

This insomnia has become problematic for me and many others, but I fear I might have something worse that I have come across on the internet, a brain disorder known as ""sporadic fatal insomnia"". I am unsure if it would be far-fetched to assume I would have this disease, I don't have a family history of ""fatal familial insomnia"" which is a familiar disorder to the one previously mentioned. All I know is that SFI is hard to detect and would require countless of money to be wasted just to get a yes or no answer to a very rare disorder that only a small number of people have it and it's currently uncurable.

2417,"Waking up everyday at 4-5 AM suddenly since 3 weeks. Hello all,

3 weeks ago, for no apparent reason, I started only sleeping until 4-5 AM, without the possibility of falling back asleep where as I would always be able to sleep until my alarm at 7 (I go to bed at 11 every night). It seems that I was a bit more anxious during this time, gf is overseas for a few months, I obviously miss her, work, etc.

After a few days I would also be stressed when I'd wake up again at the same time and after 10 days of not sleeping and being ABSOLUTELY miserable, affecting very much my work and day to day routine, went to the doc, who prescribed the smallest dose of Klonopin to take before sleep to take the edge off.

It worked. I wasn't feeling any more anxious than I usually would, but the sleep never came back. Went back to the doc, told me to up the dosage, and I asked for some blood work, even though she was fairly sure it had nothing to do with it. Upping the dosage didn't work (so I went back down, and only on off days) and blood came back good, except a vit D deficiency (magnesium was supposedly fine, although I've read here that many people take supplements?). I was prescribed 10000iu once a week for a month, and I also take 2-3000iu every morning (it is only sold as 1000iu tablets in canada).

I'm still not sleeping a full night. I miss it so much. Falling asleep at 11 sharp and just waking up to the sound of my beautiful alarm (you really do start missing the alarm). Now I don't feel as exhausted during the day, I'm guessing my body adapted? But I'm still definitely in a constant state of tiredness and therefore lower motivation. I've always been a fine sleeper, although I always needed a strong routine. My sleep hygiene is pretty good in my opinion (no screens, shower to relax before bed, reading, etc., and it was much worst before this episode started and I never had an issue prior). Tried working out hard, no difference, and the lack of sleep definitely doesn't help my workout performance.

So I'm now turning to you guys. What do you suggest I try? Seems my body can't go back to its old rhythm. Seems early awakenings are a symptom of depression but I don't feel depressed? When I get a few hours where I'm not tired I feel absolutely 100%, but the lack of sleep definitely hurts my motivation."

2424,"Natural ways of curing insomnia?? Does anyone have any idea what are the natural ways to beat insomnia? My mom suffers from insomnia mostly on account of her being a very sensitive and light sleeper. Last night I sprayed some lavender oil over her blanket and pillow before she went to bed but she said the smell kept her awake all night. 😂 I don't know what went wrong because lavender seems to help me, I guess so I thought it would do the same for her. But apparently not. Anyway she's also strongly against taking medications for her insomnia. I tried convincing her but she just don't budge. 🙄 
I really don't know what to do. She wakes up tired and cranky and it's come to a point where it's starting to effect her health. And it's not like she remains idle through out the day, she has an office job and returns at 5 every evening. So she's pretty much beat by the end of the day. But somehow she just can't sleep.

2426,"The Bedtime Story Method Longtime insomniac, here. I've recently hit upon a method for getting to sleep that has been pretty effective for me so far. It may be weird and too idiosyncratic to be helpful to others but I thought I'd share!

Basically what I do is get in bed, turn off the lights, and tell myself a bedtime story, the exact same story every night. At first I used to run through the whole thing and start over but lately I never even make it to the end before falling asleep.

In my case it's a story I made up (sort of a fanfic based on a book I love) but I think it could work just as well with, say, a favorite TV ep you've seen a million times. Just close your eyes and begin ""watching"" the story, the more detailed and immersive the better.

I think it works because it's interesting and enjoyable enough that it pulls me in and distracts me from the hamster wheel of anxious thoughts but familiar enough that it kind of runs itself and I have no need to find out how it ends.

It's probably somewhat akin to mediation. I used to try to use meditation techniques like picturing a beach or a floating balloon or whatever but those never worked to distract me from my thoughts for long. A familiar but enjoyable narrative works better for that. 

Anyway, feel free to try it! Nowadays I get a little sad that I never make it to the end of the story! :P"
2427,"My Advice For CBT I have been really angry at CBT in the past, because it didn't work for me.

That was because I had a serious sleep disorder, and my Dr's didn't really know how to deal with it.

So I'm going to share my advice on CBT. 

It works for people who are otherwise healthy, and who are causing insomnia through bad habits. 

But it can KILL someone, and yes I really mean KILL someone who actually has a physical sleep disorder. 

&#x200B;

CBT focuses on not worrying, it says that anxiety is a wave that will crash over you if you just relax. And this is true for MOST people. However, if the insomnia is a symptom of a serious disease, it CBT will drive them right off a cliff. 

&#x200B;

Thats why I want to share some advice about it. 

\#1. Try it yourself, if it doesn't work go see a Dr. 

\#2. If you Dr sends you into professional CBT, make DAM sure you get screened for physical conditions  that can cause insomnia BEFORE therapy. Those include; Blood thyroid and blood iron disorders, Breathing disorders and allergy/sinus problems, epilepsy and restless leg syndrome. 

\#3. Tell to your Dr if you bed partners have ever said you snore or your limbs jerk. 

\#4. Discuss a contingency strategy with both your Dr. and your therapist. What happens if this doesn't work? Who do we escalate the problem to?

I feel like taking my life. In mid december I had the worst flu of my life, it lasted 3 weeks to recover. This is when I started to get bad anxiety thinking it will never go away. After the flu, I quit cold turkey 2 substances I was abusing (kratom and phenibut) which give rebound anxiety and insomnia as withdrawal effects, that was 7 weeks ago. My sleep started to get worse and worse. My boss told me my productivity level was too low as I was not performing. I called out a lot, I am one more strike from getting fired with also adds fuel to the anxiety fire. At first I had regular insomnia, then it turned into this weird thing where my body would fall asleep easily but i'd be awaken by a jerk or a jolt, followed by me breathing fast and heart race. This would go on all night. I tried getting meds from a doctor, he claimed I was an addict and thought I was still taking the kratom. He would not give me sleeping meds. He did give me lexapro but after 3 days of taking it it has made my restlessness and insomnia worse, so I am quitting. I don't know what to do at this point. I have to go to work tomorrow and work all day, I've been sleeping 3 - 4 hours a night if that. I'm dead tired but cannot sleep and wired with anxiety.

I went to see a urologist last week to finally address this longstanding issue, and she casually mentioned a possible connection between my Trazadone and overactive bladder. I feel kind of stupid for not having thought of this myself, because right around when I started the Traz (6 or 7 years ago) is when these bladders issues began. I think I was just so relieved to finally be prescribed some sort of sleeping med that I didn't even make the connection. I guess I also have been ignoring the fact that it ultimately hasn't even been giving me a solid nights sleep for years now. Anyway, I would LOVE to hear if anyone else has had this same symptom as a result of Trazadone!! I'm starting to go crazy with the combination of insomnia + peeing a thousand times every 24 hrs.

2466,"Anyone else start hallucinating if you get no sleep at all for more than 24 hours? I start to get quite bothersome auditory hallucinations if I go about 30+ hours with no sleep at all. This really sucks when you have chronic insomnia and it’s therefore highly likely you will go such lengths of time with zero sleep.

I recognise that they are hallucinations but I still worry that I’m going to say something that sounds crazy and ask my co-workers who is playing music or whatever when no music is actually playing. I think I might have musical ear syndrome as I’ve always had problems with my ears and hearing. However, the hallucinations only really become an issue when I’m sleep deprived.

If you look it up, the condition is basically your brain trying to compensate for hearing loss, which results in you misinterpreting background noise as music. It often sounds like someone is playing a radio in another room. I’ll hear all kinds of random songs (country music, rap, pop) that don’t even exist. I’m kinda proud of my brain for being able to make up new one hit wonders to follow me around all day, but it can be quite bothersome. Because the idea of someone playing music in another room is no where near as far-fetched as schizophrenic hallucinations (such as a single, disembodied voice saying hurtful things about you), I often question whether or not the music I am hearing is real. Because sometimes it has turned out that someone actually was playing music. Usually I’ll assume it’s not real just to be safe.

Does anyone else have this problem with hallucinations caused by sleep deprivation? 

I’ve also experienced visual hallucinations once or twice when I went about 50+ hours with no sleep. I recognised these were hallucinations as well, because I knew that the assignment I was proof reading on my laptop didn’t usually morph into a post-modern watercolour painting of a tropical bird."

2479,"5+ years insomnia sufferers? Hi all. I wanted to reach out to people who've had chronic, long term insomnia. I've had it for almost ten years now, and it started pretty early in adolescence. My main problem is falling asleep, but I've also had periods where I struggled to stay asleep, and recently I've been waking up earlier than I would like. I was on Melatonin for about the first five years, working myself up to 10mg until that stopped working. Eventually I was put on Trazodone and have been using it ever since. I find Trazodone works great for me, sufficient at least, but if I ever forget a dose or sleep at a friend's house I always go back to getting 2-3 hours of sleep.  Occasionally when I smoke or drink it gets me sleepy but it either isn't enough to put me to sleep or I wake up after two hours unable to fall asleep again. 

Has anyone with such long term insomnia ever gotten better, or is it just something you've learned to deal with? I always wonder where mine comes from. I vaguely remember having a period of constant nightmares before the insomnia started, and when I started taking Trazodone for the first few weeks I woke up in a cold sweat every morning, and had a decent amount of at least ""stressful"". Sometimes I feel as though my psyche has an aversion to sleep, and don't know how to fix it. Really just curious about other experiences. I could definitely have it worse, but the idea of this going on forever is frustrating to say the least. "

I bring it up because yesterday I got home from work at 5:30, ready to nap for a little or maybe go to bed at 9 and wake up early, feeling rested.

Okay, so I've been on this thread a couple of times now, especially on the times where I couldn't sleep at all. I'll give you guys a bit of a backstory on what went on.

About a couple of months ago I started to wake up in the middle of the night, for no apparent reason whatsoever. It was weird, as I generally went to sleep pretty fast and I never really had this sort of issue. I figured ok, its probably normal. So I tried to go back to sleep, but I could not. It was about 3am when I woke up and I needed to wake up for 7am for school.  I was awake for most of those hours, until about 6am. I go to bed at 11PM, and on that day I had about 4 hours of sleep, which is pretty bad. During that time, I was anxious and stressed over the fact that time was running by so fast and that I needed to get to sleep. I also was calculating how much time I had left, and that only kept me even more awake. I had previously known breathing  exercises, particularly the 4-7-8 method, and that did not work at all. On the next night, it happened again. Woke up at 3, didn't go back to sleep until half past 6. I thought I was going insane. I genuinely thought that I had a sleep disorder.

So on that day, I decided that it was best to take some sort of sleeping remedy. In the UK (I think in the US also) there's these pills that you can get called Nytol, which are like these herbal tablets designed to keep you calm and to get you to sleep. This was the first time that I ever took this, and I was getting worried that it was going to happen again and again and that I would become dependent on Nytol. Took it, and I had a good night's sleep.

On the next night I didn't take Nytol, to see if I could go to sleep without it. On that night, I slept completely fine. The next night I slept fine. The night after that. It all seemed like it went away.

That was until about three weeks ago, where, out of the blue, it happened again. The exact same scenario. Woke up at about half past 3, couldn't get back to sleep. I was so worried to the point where I cried myself to sleep at about 6am as I thought that it was all going to happen again and that I had a sleep disorder, even though I had previously asked my dad who said that I didn't meet the signs of insomnia, as insomniacs tend to find it hard to initially get to sleep whilst for me it's really easy.

On the next night, I took a Nytol and thank god I was fine and I had a good night sleep. A couple of days later, I went to go to see my therapist, who deals with my stress and anxiety issues, for which might have caused these sleeping problems. I told him about it and he said that it's normal to have these sorts of issues when you're stressed and anxious, and that's what started to paint the picture as to why I was having these issues as I was stressed over the amount of work in school and that I was stressed and anxious over how long I had left to sleep.

He then suggested that I should use a breathing exercise apart from the 4-7-8 method, which is known as ""box breathing."" Apparently, he told me that it is used for when soldiers have to keep calm on the battlefield. As well as sleep, it could also be used for other things as well, such as keeping calm for when you're nervous or when you are stressed for example.

Here's how to do it, in case some of you don't know.

Step 1) Breathe in to the count of 4.
Step 2) Hold your breath to the count of 4.
Step 3) Exhale your breath to the count of 4.
Step 4) Hold for the count of 4.

He told me that once you do this exercise for at least 10-15 times in a row, you should feel relaxed in no time. So, on that night, I was a bit anxious over a test that was on in school on the next day when I went to bed. I used this method for about 20 counts, and I somehow surprisingly went to sleep until I had to wake up at 7am. I didn't even wake up! 

Ever since then, my sleep schedule has been getting back to normal. I implement this method for every time that I am either stressed or anxious for when I have to sleep, even when I'm not sleeping at all I use this method to calm myself down. 

I think the conclusion to this would be that if you ever find yourself in a situation where you cannot sleep at all or for when you wake up in the middle of the night and when you can't get to sleep, the best solution for you is to use the method of box breathing, to calm yourself down and to get yourself some well needed rest. 

Another factor would be to use Nytol if you can, it's not as powerful as more advanced sleeping pills but it does help.

Also, try not to check the time on your phone when you wake up in the middle of the night. It will only make you worse as you know how much you have left to sleep. "
2491,"I used to have chronic mild insomnia, and going to bed gave me anxiety. Here's the exercise I learnt that triggers sleep reliably for me. I now take about half an hour to fall asleep on a bad day. That's good enough for me, given what I was used to, and I'm optimistically confident that I'll fall asleep faster in time.

I used to have chronic mild insomnia: I used to take an hour or more to fall asleep each night. Waking up in the middle of the night was crap because I would take ages to fall asleep again and I would only fall asleep by the time I needed to get out of bed. 

The following routine worked for me. I don't have any chemical imbalances (that I know of) and I guess I fall into the category of people who ""forgot how to fall sleep"". I used to be terrified of the dark so I deliberately tried to stay awake every night as a kid, watching the lights of the car headlamps stretching across the wall. It was kind of lonely. That's probably how the insomnia started. Since I started the following routine, I've been 2 years free from chronic insomnia. 

1. Focus: I find it easy to fall asleep in front of the TV, but the moment I move to the bed I'm completely awake again. So annoying! I can fall asleep in boring lectures, but I can't in bed. Focus leads to sleep. I focus on the feeling of my blanket .

2. Focus on whether my posture is comfortable and adjust accordingly. Start from toes and go all the way up to the top  e.g. Are my feet in a comfortable position? If not, move them. Knees, hips, elbows, is hair in my face?

3. Relax my face. Relax my forehead, eyebrows, inner corners of my eyes, relax nostrils, corners of my mouth, lips should be slightly apart, tongue, jaw, cheeks

4. Full breathing. Very key. This technique can be googled. 

5. Start to focus more on the out breath than the in breath.

6. Feel how my body is becoming more heavy. More and more heavy...

7. Focus on the full breathing.

8. Focus on the out breath.

9. Feel my body getting more heavy...


There are other things that would help minimise insomnia, like relaxation exercises in the middle of the day. But I work full time plus I'm lazy, so I skipped all the advice about not using phones before sleep or doing more sport. The above routine alone works for me. That said, maybe those techniques could help others.

Reddit has been amazing and opened my world. It's saved my ass in times like when I left a massive mark on the ceiling and got advice on how to fix it before my SO got home (magic eraser peeps!) and opened my mind to other ideas (r/philosophy). I love reddit and I owe reddit. This is probably the only topic where I have something real to contribute, so any questions please feel free to fire away.

It’s almost 4:30AM and I have a test in just about 5 hours time. Please please suggest a way for me to fall asleep at least for the two hours that I can. Even an hour would be fine, I just need some sleep or I’m gonna go insane."
2512,
2513,It's selfish but i wish i had insomniac friends Or foreign ones or someone who would be up at this time of night so it isn't so bOring omg ahah. I used to go and find people online and that was fun for a while but it's so emotionally exhausting I wish I could meet up with someone who cares about me at this time of night so it'd be less frustrating. I wish I had friends in general tbh. The ones I do have don't care v much about me and if they do it's because they feel bad. Idk I just gave myself until next Tuesday to get everything sorted and I'm more of a mess than ever. I haven't even done these essays I have to do but I cant function enough for anything I write to make any literal sense. I fucking hate this. I think I give up I'm just going to take some of the stuff I have left and not care about the hangover lag tomorrow. Im getting so fed up of this I want to sleep but I really don't want to wake up tomorrow.
2514,"I have finally been able to sleep for a full week without interruption, however every time I sleep I wake up more tired then when I last slept. So, after a long while of suffering from shitty sleep and waking up throughout the night, I have finally gotten it under control for a bit, and actually slept for 12 hours straight the other day. If you want to know what helped me, I started going on walks before bed, stopped keeping my brain so active 3 hours before bed (where that were possible), stopped mindlessly browsing the internet, and listened to [Ethoslab's early mineraft lets plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHngf-CKCzk&list=PL1523184A958895EF) who has a voice more relaxing and soothing than Bob Ross himself. He's a great entertainer as well. Edit: should also mention that this took a while to work, but the routine is what helped the most. Sleeping in a different bed also helped because I believe I started associating my overthinking with my other bed. Double Edit: Taking vitamin d in the morning was also a big help.

However, I've run into another problem, which is that I feel miserably tired in the morning, every single morning, and this only goes away to a certain extent throughout the day. I'll kind of feel like I'm in a constant dream-like state, and when I want something, say a laptop that is right in front of me, I will find myself staring at it for a couple seconds before actually grabbing it. Or sometimes I'll just be wandering around aimlessly, not knowing where to go or what to do, however I still function just enough despite this to live a semi-normal life with my mothers help.

I also get that feeling you get when you're in a dream where you feel that you want to run or hit something, but can't because you're too weak. I will feel this constantly.

Perhaps the most weird thing, is that I caught myself half asleep one night, moving my arm around, and grabbed a cup of water that was on my night stand and knocked it over on to me. I only fully ""woke"" up when the cold water reached me and I sat there in bewonderment at what the hell just happened. I've had memories of me thinking incoherent things to myself throughout the night too and will mix up my dreams with reality.

I had a sleep study done six months ago and was told I had no condition, so I honestly don't know what could be causing this, although I didn't have these symptoms then. I actually felt better when I wasn't able to sleep than I do right now, not that that makes it okay to not sleep, but it is very worrying.

I am a senior from Parsons School of Design currently working on designing a set of products for people who experience insomnia for my graduation thesis. I began this project knowing that my grandmother, age 85, experiences periodic insomnia and would not talk about it. So many of my friends experience this problem in varying intensity. Worst of all it is a personal struggle...

I have been researching and coming up with ideas for months, as well as speaking to a psychologist. I don't personally experience insomnia on a weekly basis but I am here to listen.

Currently I have two directions for my design:

1. Using sleep tracking technologies and sensory relaxation to promote healthy napping practices to restore energy in the day
2. Using sensorial cues (smell, sound, light, heat) to create an environment for serial diverse imaging (a randomized imagery for people to drift thoughts away which psychologists have developed)

I can elaborate on my ideas further if anyone is interested.

2530,I haven’t slept through the whole night in years and I’m so fed up with this never ending exhaustion I’ve had problems sleeping through the night since I was a child and everyone thought I’d simply grow out of it. I never did and over the last 6 or 7 years my sleep has slowly gotten worse and worse. I average about four hours a night and don’t know how I’m still alive; been running on an empty tank sleep wise for too long. As a kid it was the nightmares that kept me up and woke me up screaming about three nights a week. As an adult it’s the stress of everything I have to get done during the week. I also suffer from adult night terrors where I scream audibly and even get out of bed and run around screaming in my sleep. I know a main cause of this is stress but I can’t just stop being stressed out like people so unhelpfully recommend like there’s some magic switch I can pull. I’ve tried every over the counter sleep aid and melatonin is virtually useless on me. I don’t know how much longer I can go on like this.  And on top of everything else the stress of not sleeping is making it harder to sleep!
2531,"Insomnia makes me so desperate I just want to jump off a fucking building 2:35 and even though I’ve been sleepy all day long and was sleepy a few hours ago, it’s over now : back to being tired but fully awaken.

The worst about insomnia is that when it becomes frequent, it makes you scared to go to bed, scared to turn off the lights because you can feel this is going to be another void of just waiting laying...
And that just makes everything worse, the apprehension of sleeping (not sleeping).

Ok I’m not going through this again. I’ll just drink a pill.

I can notice the sleepy feeling simply vanishing, just like that and it makes me want to cry and shoot myself till I’m fucking dead sleep.

I thought maybe I was just this kind of person who doesn’t need much sleep. But not at all. Once I’m asleep I can’t wake up before 10-12 hours.

Once I had tried to deprive myself of sleep every single morning so that I feel totally sleepy at night and just drown. It didn’t work. I ended up not being able to wake up, sleep 10 hours or more and then the cycle came back.

And having my husband snoring next to me creates just more frustration and stress. He lays and in seconds he’s completely asleep. I envy that.

For some reason some days are fine (or maybe the reason is the 4mg of tranquilizer...). I just sleep like everyone. But that’s like once in a fortnight.

I just don’t know what to do anymore but ask for some sleeping pills. Because the pills I’m drinking now are for bipolar disorder. They make you moody and suicidal the next day it’s awful. But it puts you to sleep at least.

It has so many negative impacts on the everyday life. I’m not moody just sleep deprived.

The stress has never left me since I was a toddler and I honestly just want to kill myself just so I can stop that.
I don’t hate life, I’m just sick of my body being so constantly tensed and awake, shoulders up, touching my nails constantly, hands and jaw clenched, jumping of surprise everytime someone approaches me.
I used to bite my nails to blood since kindergarten until high school.

I also follow a strict sleep regimen so that I regularly get 8-10 hours a night. The problem developed about a week ago, suddenly I found myself barely able to achieve even 3 hours a night at most. I immediately stopped taking the stimulant, as that seemed like the most logical thing to cause it. Currently it's been a week without the stimulant and there's no change, I can't think of any other causes either. I continually get 0-3 hours of sleep per night, it's beginning to cause serious issues. However I am worried that if I bring this to my psychiatrist then my stimulant meds will be stopped. The meds help so much with my ADHD that a week without them plus insomnia has already impacted grades quite heavily. What is the best course of action in this situation?

2537,"Getting good results with a weighted blanket! I have suffered from insomnia for 30+ years, but have just begun to sleep with a weighted blanket on me. It has greatly helped me fall asleep, stay asleep and sleep more peacefully.

It holds the sleeper down and very still, like when a parent holds their baby as the baby falls asleep. This stifles involuntary or even voluntary movements. I think psychologically it also tells the brain to be still, as well as the body.

They come in various weights. The one I have is a bit too heavy, actually. When I put it entirely on top of me (three nights ago), I felt suffocated. However, I now just put half of it over me, or just a diagonal edge of it, and it works great. I feel so much clearer headed, less irritated, forgetful and groggy.

He’s not a terrible sleeper and has long stretches where it’s a non-issue, but I find it very difficult to control my anger when we’re in a phase like this.

2541,"Anxiety around trying to sleep? Is this a thing? I’ve always had trouble sleeping for as long as I can remember. For many years now, my preferred method of getting to sleep has been to just stay awake doing something until I’m so tired that I can barely keep my eyes open and I know that I will almost immediately fall asleep as soon as I try. This has been my only surefire method of getting to sleep for a long time, but it has obvious problems. Luckily I’m at a place in my life where I rarely need to get up early, but that isn’t always the case and it’s resulted in a very haphazard sleeping schedule.

I think I’m scared of two things. When I’m stressed, I don’t want to be alone with my thoughts. I’m terrified of lying awake, stressing about work/relationships/etc. and not having anything to distract me so I just keep doing pointless shit on the internet until my eyes start to protest.

When I’m not stressed. I get scared of all the tossing and turning I know I will inevitably have to deal with. I don’t think I ever learned to “switch off” once I get into bed.  If I have something to think about that isn’t stressful, then I’m fine. I enjoy having the wind down time to think over my day/week. But if my mind is blank, I know I’ll just lie there bored for hours, watching the clock and trying to resist using my phone.

What I do, before bed, is that I listen to an audiobook to learn foreign languages. I’ve found audiobooks like the “The Paul Noble approach” or “The Pimsleur method”  are pretty good because you don’t need to put much effort memorizing words. I think the reason it puts me to sleep is that it utilizes some brain power, so I’m tiring myself out, and also, since my mind is focused on creating sentences, I’m not getting anxious over sleep.

2548,"Insomnia is a systemic problem and must be treated that way Every year, a new study documenting a rise in insomnia sufferers. 1 in 4 develop it per year. 30% of Americans suffer from it. 10% experience it chronically. Lost productivity cost us $63 billion a year. It’s a major factor in motor vehicle crashes.

But we need to stop looking at each sufferer as if they exist in a vacuum. We live in a time where, for the first time, younger generations will make less than their parents. Jobs are demanding more of us but giving less in return. Studies have shown that if Americans were paid for emails and phone calls they took while “off work,” they’d actually need to be reimbursed in the thousands. Younger generations have been found by studies to be “work martyrs.” That is, they don’t take sick days or vacations because they’re so worried about proving themselves and trying to avoid getting fired. Less and less space is given to self-care. And we’re all addicted to technology because the technology trains us to become dependent on it so we continue investing money in it. And all of this stress and chaos leads to a hyper vigilance that prevents us from falling asleep. Try to address it, and we’re failed by a lack of adequate healthcare. I have begged doctors for a lost decade of my life to help me with this problem, only for them to tell me medications are addictive and move on without a solution. It did not matter that I told them I started missing classes or work because I could not operate a vehicle. It did not matter that I told them I was injuring myself because my balance and reflexes become impaired. It did not matter that I told them I was only guaranteed sleep on Friday night because I had nothing scheduled on Saturday, and that I often went through weeks with only one decent night’s sleep. I’d just receive a dismissive “deep breaths” or “turn off your devices before bed” or “have a warm glass of milk,” as if things so minuscule could begin to combat any of those sweeping sources of stress I mentioned earlier.

The consequences of long-term sleep deprivation are real and severe and research backs that up. Yet doctors ignore complaints of insomnia. Probably because they don’t know how to cure it. Probably because they’re focused on the individual.

My question is, how do we shift the focus from the individual to the culture? How do we start transforming a society where we’re all supposed to be emotionless robots pouring all of our energy into our increasingly demanding work?"

- practice healthy sleep paterns.
- try to be as social as I can.
- Try not to worry about anything!
- not to force my sleep and if I get it I get it. Have to start thinking of sleep as whatever.
- participate in my daily normal activities again before insomnia got a hold of me.

2553,"Positive thinking and living in the moment is key!! Easier said than done, I know but if you have anxiety please read. I’m constantly worrying that having insomnia would cause this and do that to me, but after seeing a few students in my class have anger and anxiety, I thought to myself, “If I die tomorrow, would all this worry have been worth it? NOPE!

So if you get anxiety because of that, just live in the moment and not the future because you never know what will happen! LAUGH, joke at everything and just laugh honestly. Enjoy the present feeling of whatever your doing and embrace every second. 

Quite honestly this approach may help me fall asleep, but I don’t care as much. If I don’t sleep I’ll just get up and go to work and enjoy the day, talk with my coworkers, make work fun. It is what is ! :)"

Edit for clarity (my response to a fellow redditor): Haven’t brought insomnia up to my doctor. I’m a relatively new patient of hers bc I’m new to this area, and it just feels tricky to bring up a new problem every time I see her. I feel overbearing and like a hypochondriac... idk. I mean I know people go to the doctor seeking meds for meds sake, rather than for an actual illness... but I’m afraid of her assuming thats what I’m doing, if that makes sense."

My brother is in hospital right now with Pancreatitis (most likely caused by alcohol use).

He uses melatonin also to get whatever sleep he can. 
He suffers from hypnic jerk as well as insomnia and this seems to be a large part of the problem. We have also both had a very difficult life and I'm sure he has some wounds that would possibly heal or at least benefit from talking to a professional about these things. 

He seems very willing after going through what he has to try to make some real differences in his life. I can't help feeling that he will lose faith and interest in a healthier lifestyle if he doesn't start getting some results with his sleep pattern.

The Washington Post recently ran an article saying that such patterns contribute to memory loss, and a variety of other mental and physical health problems (many of which I'm increasingly finding in myself), and it exhorted the reader to see a doctor.

But, during those 9 years, I've seen four different doctors, including two sleep specialists, and none of them helped me. The advice ranged from ""that's normal"" to ""it's not normal but it's not a problem"" to ""try some ambien"" (which made it worse). A sleep study produced nothing beyond ""you don't have apnea.""

Overall I feel dehydrated (even though I drink plenty of cold water every day), dry mouth, dry skin, itchy, tingling, sensitive to any kind of touch. I suspect caffeine may be partly responsible for this because apparently it’s dehydrating. But then again I’ve heard people say it’s not really that dehydrating at all. Then I’ve thought maybe it’s my salt intake, but then I’ve heard salt actually prevents you being dehydrated.

It started with some restless sleeping and middle of the night awakenings and within a few weeks I developed an anxiety disorder and spiraled into the endless cycle of being anxious over not sleeping and not sleeping because I'm anxious.  This resulted in me being unable to fall asleep and unable to fall back asleep when I woke up. Starting near the beginning of February I started taking an anti-anxiety supplement that works fairly well and I have no issues falling asleep.  However, I cannot stay asleep more then a 2-4 hours.  Then once I wake up I have a very hard time falling asleep.  

I don't know if this is due to stress or another cause.  I've had bronchitis since New Years as well but that has been treated and alot of the mucus and chest tightness has gone away but still pops up due to the cold weather.  I'm not sure if I have developed sleep apnea from the bronchitis, as I definitely have more trouble breathing when I like  down, or if something else (like anxiety or stress) is making me unable to sleep.  I'm really not stressed or anxious about anything in my life except the insomnia. Any insights or advice on how to fall back asleep would be very helpful.  Thank you."

I end up just lying in bed thinking ""I need to sleep otherwise I'm going to have another shitty day tomorrow.""

Currently I am researching other properties of the cannabis plant and in this video I heard the doctor state at 14:20 that ""in low doses CBD is alerting and kind of keeps you awake. At higher doses it is very sedating and cause you to sleep.""

Before I get overly excited and start calling this the miracle cure I will do this for the next two weeks and update my experience.

It is great to hear a medical doctor suggest CBD as well, as this idea originally came passively through scrolling on reddit.  


Edit:   
As I know people are not interested in inhaling smoke/vapor I am wondering if anyone would be willing to experiment with taking CBD before bed orally. 

If you are new to CBD, what you would be looking for is a 20:1 or greater CBD to THC ratio.

A 30ml bottle I would recommend at 500mg of CBD for the whole bottle (or greater). This equates to 16mg per ml (a full eye dropper is a  1 ml)

I would recommend a full 1ml for your first time to determine effectiveness - then if it works on the second night reduce to half a ml to again determine effectiveness. 

Under the tongue the onset is supposed to be quicker (40 min - 60 min) some people hold it there for several minutes.

Otherwise if you mix it in a drink or just swallow it onset is usually around 90 - 120 minutes. 

Take the CBD an hour before you crawl.

PANIC.” then getting out of bed and reading until I felt tired again. Over and over and over again until I finally gave up since I only had a couple hours left until I have to be up.

As 8AM grew closer, I could feel my mental capacity draining. I was so tired. I wanted to sleep but I couldn’t. By the time I had the exam in front of me, I could hardly even add two numbers. I couldn’t even read the prompts without forgetting what the last two sentences told me. I completely bombed the test. The only plus side is I was able to fall asleep almost instantly that night after not having slept for that long. That felt incredible. 


My insomnia has been getting worse and worse over the past year. It’s always ruining my life. I just want to be like other people who are able to use their full mental capacity. I want to be able to sleep. Or, at least have the option to sleep. People almost boast about pulling an all-nighter because of the homework they put off until the last minute. I pull an all-nighter because my body makes me. I’m so good at managing my time, but it doesn’t matter because I waste all that time waiting to be asleep.

I hate you, insomnia. I just want to have the same opportunity as normal people. If I was able to fall asleep fast like everybody else, I could get so much sleep. If I could sleep, my brain would be strong. During the day, it’s like someone took my “brain power” slider and moved it down to 60%. When I do get a good sleep (maybe once I month), it makes me so sad because I remember what it’s like to be able to be at full cognitive ability.

I woke up 3 times to pee, and ended up waking up at 5:30 am and not even trying to go back to sleep. I plan on trying 100mg tonight, and taking it with 3mg of melatonin. Should I even try?

2671,"I want to quit pot, but when I do, insomnia returns! Hello,

This is my first post here. It might be a bit long, so thank you very much for anyone who actually takes the time to read it. :)

So, I've dealt with insomnia for years. Sometimes it gets horrific, with me getting 0-3 hours a night consistently for long periods of time, but generally, I sit at around 4-5 hours a night with a couple 6-7 hour nights every once in awhile. 

Ok... So, this is how I was before I started vaping cannabis a few years back. I'll sometimes even do the 5-6 hour a night thing while I'm vaping cannabis, but I do get quite a few 7 hour nights, and, yes, even an 8 hour night sometimes. 

All of this changes as soon as I quit. It's weird, because I quit once for 6 months the last few years, and I was getting 4-6 hours a night then. Not this time!!!!!!!

I recently decided to try and quit again, and I started out getting 5-6 hours of sleep a night. I figured it would be like the last couple of times I quit and just stay at that level, but it did not. It got really bad this time. Like it used to be, a long time ago.

I made it 26 days just out of pure determination. Near the end, I was losing my mind, and it was also having an effect on my girlfriend, who lives with me. We live in a fifth wheel, and there are no separate rooms. It's a smaller fifth wheel, and I was losing my mind having to try to lay still in bed for hours, all while I am wide awake not sleeping. I would finally get out of bed and just have to sit in the dark and read a book on my kindle (with the blue light filter on, of course). I would try to meditate also, and I would, but I would still be wide awake. 

I spent the money I would normally spend on cannabis on herbal sleeping remedies and melatonin, but I tried to sleep naturally for quite a few nights because most of that stuff just stopped working after a couple of times. Near the end, I was taking valerian, melatonin, L-theanine, magnesium, and whatever else I could, and they were having zero effect. Luckily, my girlfriend mentioned Benadryl, and I took 100mg of that to ensure I would fall asleep. That seemed to work for a few days, but I knew I couldn't take benadryl forever, and I had the memories of that nightmare of being wide awake constantly all night. 

So... after a lot of hesitation and being very upset about the fix I was in, because I like how I feel otherwise when I quit cannabis, I went ahead and got some. It's legal where I live, so it's easy to get. I vaped some and easily slept again. Uggg.... The big thing I did notice was that my dream state changed like night and day. As soon as I started vaping again, I remember zero dreams. A small part of the reason I quit in the first place was so I could get more into lucid dreaming, but after running into my old insomnia again, I realized just getting freaking SLEEP was important. 

Anyhow... Thanks for listening. I don't know what I'm going to do. When I quit vaping, it's like a fog lifts, and I get parts of myself back that I haven't been in touch with for awhile. I can think much clearer, and things just begin to feel sharper and clearer all around. I'm a writer, and I found that when I quit, it was much easier after a few days to think of words to use and ways to say things that were more difficult before. My problem... I eventually barely sleep at all when I quit, and, like I know some of you know, it becomes a nightmare. Massive anxiety thinking about laying there in bed again, in the dark, without being able to do much, less I wake my girlfriend and dog up. Dreading night time and having to try to sleep. 

I couldn't believe how tired I was without being able to fall asleep at all. One night, I kid you not, and I know some of you have experienced this, I would literally nod off and then wake back up immediately. It kept happening all night one night. I know I might have sleep apnea, but if that's the problem, then why isn't it a problem when I'm vaping pot? I mean, wouldn't it still be there? 

When I'm vaping pot, I wake up usually once because I have to use the bathroom. Some nights, I'll wake up more than once. It's not perfect with pot. But, there have been nights where I didn't wake up once, that I remember. 

I don't know. I now have this magnesium L-Threonate stuff, too, that I paid too much for and have been taking it for a week and a half. Maybe it's been helping? Don't know because I have been vaping. However, I noticed when I started vaping again after quitting that I am sleeping better than I did before I quit. Yea... who knows. Maybe the magnesium? I also bought this chin strap dealio that might low-key help with sleep apnea. I haven't tried it yet because I've been sleeping fine. 

The thing is, I want to quit vaping cannabis! I had no idea I was going to go on this long, so thank you for listening! Any advice or thoughts would be appreciated. Thank you very much insomnia community! "

Instead, the psychiatrist has prescribed me Fluvoxamine because she says the real root cause of my Insomnia is anxiety. She has decided this after fifteen minutes of chatting with me.

I come to find out, after doing some research, that one of the common side effects of Fluvoxamine is INSOMNIA. Well what the hell? It's almost as if she didn't listen to a word I said. And I don't want to take an SSRI.

The feeling I got from going to this Psychiatrist was very much like- you're a broken person, and we're a factory that fixes broken people. We find the problem, give you some drugs, and push you back out the door. They didn't take into account any of my thoughts, needs, or feelings. I felt as if I was a mere statistic. As if they were hurrying me along in their meetings just so that they could get to the next one.

I am really disappointed that I have not been able to find a mental health professional that actually feels like they are ""on my side."" I really tried to be forthright and go along with the process this time, and instead they just prescribed me some drugs and kicked my ass out the door.

I believe that the insomnia and headaches is due to high cortisol. I have tried using magnesium oil, rhodiola, holy basil, ksm-66 ashwagandha to lower cortisol but I have not felt much of a difference. I have felt a difference in headaches when I take the supplement called seriphos which is supposed to lower cortisol, but I have not experienced a help for maintaining sleep.

2709,"Eating much less sugar seems to have helped my insomnia massively. I've been an insomniac since I was in my early teens - I'm now 35. Like most people reading this, I've been through all the tortures of insomnia; the effects it's had on every part of my life have been enormous. I've also tried, over the years, all of the commonly – and less commonly – advised measures to help beat it (with the notable exception of CBTI because it's never been available to me). For a long time I've been settled in a not-so-happy middle ground of accepting frequent poor sleep, and self medicating sleeping pills (valium, lorazepam, and clonazepam are currently on my bedside - I try to avoid using these as much as possible, but it's kind of comforting to know that they're there)

&#x200B;

I've always had a sweet tooth, but never went totally crazy on sugar binges. I'd say my sugar consumption has been about average for someone from The West, or even on the lower end of the scale, considering how much sugar is in many people's diets.

&#x200B;

Recently I've been reading a few articles by people who'd cut down on, or cut out entirely, their sugar intake, and who wrote about the range of benefits they experienced (mainly fewer mood swings and more energy, but also less worry about the health risks associated with eating too much sugar). I don't think any of them mentioned better sleep, and I wasn't reading these articles with my insomnia in mind. But anyway, I started cutting down on how much sugar I eat, and I quickly saw a correlation between the days when I ate less sugar and the nights when I slept well, and the days when I slipped up and ate my normal amount of sugar, and nights when I slept badly. I do still have a pretty sugary iced coffee every morning, but apart from that I now snack on things like nuts, beans and roasted peas, and I try to resist sugary things later in the day. In fact I try not to eat anything containing added sugar after about midday.

I certainly can't say for sure that eating less sugar causing me to sleep better - it feels like it is, but it's only been a couple of weeks. But, in that time I have had a couple of nights when I went to bed thinking ""yeah, I'm not going to sleep well tonight - I  can just *feel* it"" - I'm sure all insomniacs know that feeling, and it's usually pretty accurate. Well, since cutting back on sugar, on those nights I fell asleep quickly and I slept soundly. And most nights since I've started eating less sugar, I've had the sleeping habits of a normal sleeper. My body tells me when I need to go to bed, I go up stairs and get ready for bed, read a page or two of my book and get drowsy. I put the book down, close my eyes and then shortly afterwards it's morning! All without sleeping pills.

&#x200B;

What's interesting to me is that from what I recall it's never been suggested to me to cut down on sugar in order to sleep better – not by doctors, nor by any of the numerous articles and books I've read on insomnia. I just Googled ""best ways to beat insomnia"", and none of the articles mention sugar. But now that I think about it, it makes perfect sense to me – to the point where feel pretty stupid for not thinking of it years ago! Some people could surely be less tolerant to high-sugar diets, and it could affect their sleep. Also research shows that insomnia increases the likelihood of developing type 2 diabetes later in life. I've not read any of these studies, but the obvious question is could it be because the insomniacs studied ate more sugar, or had a lower tolerance to the sugar in their diets?

&#x200B;

Anyway, I just wanted to share this in case it clicks with anyone else. I'm only a datapoint of one, so I really don't want to get anyone's hopes up. Believe me, I know what it's like to try something new to beat insomnia, only for it to fail. But maybe give it a go if you're an insomniac. There are other major benefits to eating less sugar, so even if it doesn't help your insomnia, you'll be making a positive change to your overall health.

&#x200B;

I'd love to know what people think. Has anyone been advised to eat less sugar because of their insomnia? Has anyone tried this and found it to be effective, or tried and it hasn't worked?"
2710,"Paying for CBT is a Scam, don't buy into it Its really really simple logic.

2711,"I'm so, so tired.   

I'm sorry, a long ramble is coming up, I just need to vent. I'm so tired I feel like I've got a fish tank in the place of my head, dead fish glooping inside.

I've had a shitty summer, fall, and now winter.

Really, I've had trouble sleeping most of my life. My mom, now in her late sixties, likes to tell stories of how I was such a sweet, sweet baby, but I'd lie awake all night, just staring at the ceiling, and then sleep peacefully only during the days. Me, I remember curling in bed under the blankets when I was below double digits, reading by flashlight because I couldn't seem to sleep and it was making me anxious.

As an adult, I'm bipolar, and I'd be okay with being bipolar I think if I could just sleep. If I could just sleep like normal people sleep. If I could go to bed at 11PM and shut my eyes and be asleep within an hour or two, hell, if it just took four or five hours that'd be okay too, I guess. 

For years, I gobbled down every sleeping pill the doctors cared to throw at me, and it made me pathetically miserable and didn't do much to help the problem in the first place. Sometimes they'd help for a few weeks until I'd adjusted and then I'd feel worse off than when I started. I think zolpidem was what was nicest on my brain except when it gave me weird, hallucinating trips and I had to stop. A number of ineffective meds later, I was on Flunitrazepam which knocked me into inky orbit but made me feel like my mind had turned to sludge - it didn't seem like sleep at all. After I realised that a friend had molested me while I was passed out, I had a meltdown and decided that no matter how hard and how ugly things'd get, I'd find a way to live without sleep meds because I didn't want to live like that. I threw it all away. Then caved and got new pills - continued for a couple of months with no more luck... then threw them away again, and now haven't touched the stuff for three years. 

Sleep is shit. It's absolute utter shit. Therapy doesn't help, though I tried. Even when I'm in a period of relatively good sleep, the mere concept is such a point of anxiety now. The bed is a warzone of tossing and turning and sweating and churning, and my internal clock keeps ticking away towards the hour when I know I need to get out of bed. When someone comments that I look tired and I tell them I've had a bad night, and they agree that they sometimes have a little trouble sleeping and I should try some tea before bed or why not meditation - I feel this horrible, trembling envy that makes me nauseous, but I smile politely and say \*thank you\*, and \*I'll try\*.

If I'm lucky, if I have zero plans the next day, if I've been out and the weather was nice and I got plenty of light, if the bed seems extraordinarily comfy, if the cats are cuddly sweethearts, if my limbs feel heavy and soft, if I'm not too tired and not too fearful and not too alert nor too sluggish... I might sleep. Might be eight hours - might be four. I'll take whatever I get and be damn grateful for it.

So, I dont believe I have insomnia. I have a couple bad nights for no reason , but they're not constant enough to be considered something. However, I will occasionally have clusters of bad nights that cause me to because heavily nauseated in the morning.

As a description of the ""nauseated"" feeling I get, I feel a lump in my throat, like a trapped gas. I'll be constantly feeling like I'm about to throw up, to no avail. I'll tend to burp up stomach acid. If I end up throwing up, it'll be a mucus, not actual stomach acid, due to it not burning up my throat. Then my airways close up and I almost suffocate but that isn't special to this scenario.

2725,"Marijuana changed how I sleep, and why you should try it (Shorter summary at the bottom) 

I’ve had sleep problems since I was at least 13 or 14. Not as bad as some, but it makes it so I can’t fall asleep for at least 1-3 hours on a typical night. Some nights, I have such bad anxiety that it feels as though adrenaline is being pumped directly into my blood stream. It often can ruin the good day I’m having, and make my life miserable. As I grew later into my teens, like many, I experimented with weed, and found that it lowered me into the gentle sleep I’d been so desperately wanting for years. Before this I’d tried: Meditation (multiple types, white noise, sound frequencies, melatonin, reading, warm drinks, and other sleep aids. Nothing seemed to work, and then suddenly I discovered this awesome plant that can help me do something I’ve never been able to do well. 

Marijuana is actually legal in my state, but for various reasons I can’t have it be detected in my blood stream. So I finally found something that works extremely well, and it even helps remove my anxiety, but I’m prohibited from using it. I’m not even using it recreationally at this point, just smoking a small amount before bed like you would take a sleep aid in a pill form. I don’t know, it just doesn’t seem fair to me. I guess that’s how life can be though. Oh well. 

This all being said, if you have access to safe legal marijuana and haven’t tried it as a sleep aid, do it! It seriously could have changed my life in that regard. If you have any questions at all, feel free to ask me!

I'm not sure what to do because I feel like if I don't get sleep I'm gonna go crazy. I don't know if I should sleep in on Saturday or not. Any advice is appreciated. Thank you!

BTW Im in the process of getting a psychiatrist but thats gonna take a week. I just need short term advice for this week."
2739,"What I did to break out of my year long episode of insomnia I really hope this helps some of you. This list is LONG. I was desperate, so I tried a lot of things. I would recommend you don't try them all at once as it could get quite expensive, and this way you'll also learn which ones actually work for you. Here to answer any questions you have, so fire away :)

Bit of background on me: I've been waking up at around 3am almost every night for the past year, and not sleeping the rest of the night. Since about August of last year, I developed sleep onset insomnia where I could not sleep at all the whole night. Needless to say, it was driving me to the brink of insanity. Over the last two or so weeks, I've managed to steadily improve my sleep quality, falling asleep faster, waking up less, and falling back to sleep faster too. I know how debilitating it can be to not get any sleep so I wanted to share how I managed it in case it helps y'all. 

In the interest of full disclosure, the Amazon links *are* affiliate links, but if you’d rather not click them I’ve listed the product names as well.

* Sleep at the same time every night — preferably before 11pm, which is when we get a cortisol 'second-wind'. 10:45 seems to work for me. If you don’t feel tired before 11pm, keep trying to get out of bed earlier until you do.

* Go to the doc's if you haven't already and get some blood tests done to check your iron, vitamin D and B12 levels — my levels of D and B12 were horribly low (I live in England where there's hardly any sun, and am veggie). If you're low on any of those vits, get your supplements in.
The ones I use are sprays, so they're quickly absorbed:

 * [BetterYou Vit D spray](https://amzn.to/2HYFCOW)

 * [BetterYou Vit B12 spray](https://amzn.to/2TIqRRG)

* One hour before bed, I take Magnesium Citrate, L-Theanine and 5-HTP. These are all well known for lowering stress levels and improving sleep. **What really changed the game for me was having a bite of a cracker or a small piece of bread after to make sure I swallowed them down properly.** It makes such a difference.
These are the ones I’ve been taking:

 * [Solar Magnesium Citrate](https://amzn.to/2THaWn3) — these ones are pretty big so I take them first so as the other pills push them down. You need to take two, or however many of the ones you’re taking gets you to 400mg.

 * Hello Pure 5HTP + Vitamin B6 — they’ve stopped selling this brand on Amazon now, and haven’t tried any other brands yet, but again you’ll want a dosage of about 400mg.

 * [Solgar L-Theanine 150mg](https://amzn.to/2Bmdwrq)

* Not sure if you can get these outside of the UK, but I’ve been taking two of these 30 mins before bed. Not recommended for asthmatics, apparently, because of the grass content, but I’ve been fine with them so far. The grasses are super high in antioxidants and are meant to act as a kind of precursor to melatonin production. I didn’t notice any benefit at first, but after about 3 weeks I noticed an improvement. Expect more vivd dreams too.

 * [Asphalia for Natural Sleep](https://amzn.to/2HVCWSs)

If you wake up at around 3am as I do, you probably know that it’s adrenal fatigue that’s causing that. If that’s the case, the next two points will really help:

* Bad sleep more than likely points to an unhealthy gut. I’ve been working on this by eating more fermented foods (apple cider vinegar, kimchi, kefir or yoghurt, sourdough, etc.), along with these, which encourage probiotic growth:

 * [Synergy Organic Chlorella](https://amzn.to/2SdkbhO)

* Avoid refined carbs, sugar and caffeine, especially in the afternoon / evening. It’s very taxing on the nervous system and causes our cortisol to spike. In the same vein, don’t leave it too long between meals — keep your blood sugar consistent.

 * [Yerba Mate](https://amzn.to/2BpJgM4) — I’ve been drinking this stuff every morning for about 10 years — no jitters, just a smooth buzz. High in L-Theanine too.

 * As a big bread/pizza fan, sourdough has been my friend (see previous point).

* Don’t be temped to check the clock at night, but if you want to record the times you wake up, I keep my phone on flight mode next to me, face down, and I just take a quick screen capture when I wake up. No need to look at the screen when you’re doing this. You can just check your cam roll in the morning.

* Maybe this won’t be so popular with the menfolk on here, but putting a drop of jasmine oil on your wrists is a great natural sedative and promotes GABA production. In studies it’s been shown to be [as calming as valium](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/7881819/Smell-of-jasmine-as-calming-as-valium.html). YMMV.

* Drink some kind of ‘sleep’ tea that contains Valerian / lavender / hops / etc. about 2.5 hours before bed. I like this one:

 * [Pukka Night Time tea](https://amzn.to/2RKMSxx)

* Use a good quality sea salt or Himalayan pink salt in your meals, especially if you have restless leg syndrome, as you may be low on potassium and magnesium. I also take it in the morning with some water, as it’s supposed to normalise blood sugar and boost digestion (which both help you sleep). Normal table salt won’t do as it’s been stripped of its minerals.

* Get moving during the day, but don’t exercise in the evening. Walks are good, especially in the late afternoon (helps to regulate our circadian rhythm). When I wasn’t sleeping at all, all I wanted to do was lay on the couch all day but that won’t help you. Something aerobic and grounding, like Power Yoga, kickboxing or running is great.

* I use blue light blocking glasses when on my tablet/laptop at night. If you’re super sensitive to blue light, I’d suggest getting one with yellow or orange lenses. They’re about twice as powerful as the clear ones. The pair I use are:

I was told I could take Melatonin by my doctor. I followed the instructions. I did not see any warning for this either.

If you take Melatonin every day, after a period of 2 weeks to a month, you begin to alter your sleep wake state.

After about a month and a half of use, I went from falling asleep at 2, sometimes 4 at the latest. To falling asleep at 7 or 8 in the morning.

It was not until I was researching a cocktail I was going to make that I stumbled upon a forum which talked about the side effects of daily use.

Edit:   
I saw a sleep doctor the other day, and my perspective on melatonin has been altered a little.

Apparently melatonin from companies like Jameson, Swansons, etc are garbage.

The doctor recommended I take 1mg of good quality melatonin every night, and do light therapy in the morning in an effort to adjust my Circadian Rhythm.

2750,"Am I developing insomnia? For the past two months, I’ve had a problem almost every night - I fall asleep just fine, but wake up consistently around 2am or 3am (with the exception of tonight only, it was 12am for some reason) and usually cannot fall back asleep. I have no issues falling asleep in the first place, but once i wake up in the middle of the night I’m pretty much up for good, unless i’m lucky and manage to fall back asleep about three or four hours later. I’ve only slept entirely though the night a handful of times throughout the two months. I’ve been seeing a biofeedback doctor to help me fall back asleep, which is the reason why I am sometimes able too. Anyways, please let me know what you think. It doesn’t sound typical but maybe is a variation of a sort, my dad developed insomnia when he was my age so perhaps it runs in the family. Please help me out! "
2751,"Geodon Withdrawal Hell I take a high dose of Geodon at night and rely on it completely to fall asleep. if my nightly dose doesn't absorb right, I go into withdrawal. The main symptom of Geodon withdrawal for me is total insomnia. Some nights everything works right and I fall asleep a few hours after taking it. Other nights it doesn't work at all and I have to take smaller doses several more times in a bid to knock myself out. I've been up til 8 am twice in the last week and was luckily able to fall asleep finally by then.

I can tell it's not working tonight. The problem with the drug is it needs to be taken with food, and it's very finicky. If I have too much food or fluid in my stomach when I take it, it doesn't work then either. If I don't have enough food it doesn't work. Sometimes I do everything how i think it should be done and it still doesn't work, like tonight.

Last week I missed a day of work and school because of this. It's probably going to happen today as well.

I'm completely held hostage by how this medication behaves. My life is on hold. I told my psychiatrist I'm going to wean myself off of it whether they want to help me or not, I'm done. I'd rather go back to how it was before. I had insomnia but it was never this bad. I can take other psych meds. I'm willing to risk a manic episode to get off this medication.

I have yet to meet a doctor who truly understands how this drug works and how the withdrawal affects me. None of them have any answers or solutions except to prescribe useless shit like Vistaril, which literally does nothing for me. I've found when I'm in Geodon withdrawal Ambien also does jack shit.

I'm really struggling with this."
2752,"Having trouble sleeping? I used to have it really bad in 2018. These are the things that I tried We all suffer from Insomnia for different reasons.

In 2013-2014 I had to sedate myself with several sleeping pills because all I would do is lay in bed thinking about these horrible people I had to deal with at work. The day I got let go - I slept like a baby that night.

I have been on sleeping pills for 15 years due to chronic pain. Last year I went without any sleep aid until August when my Insomnia became severe. They put me on multiple medications (anti-depressants) because these AD's had 'sleepiness' as a side effect. Amitryptline (sp? ) is the only one of these which had an effective sedative sleep aid. This year I am back taking 3.5 - 7 mg of zopiclone every few days when I really need to be asleep at a specific time.

Moving along.

In order to get better sleep you need to build yourself a system, and then repeat it every night, and eventually your body will understand that you are building a sleep routine which will eventually put you to sleep after practice.

&#x200B;

There are several things that you can do.

\- buy red light bulbs and put them on a couple of your lamps. After a certain time, turn all your lights off, and turn the lamps with the red bulbs on. What you are doing is simulating sunset, which is supposed to send a signal to the brain.

\- drink camomille tea it offers a calming effect, and it tastes good.

\- meditate or practice breathing techniques

\- make a list of things to do tomorrow, or if your head is active, write brief notes

\- take scullcap vitamin as well as Magnesium glycinate

\- look into CBD products, or even THC edibles- listen to hypnotic sleep stories Interglatic space travel by Lina Grace is on youtube.

(I encourage you to download it to your phone and not listen via youtube as you will get wake up by advertisements)

Finally, while you are in bed. If your mind is going just count every inhale as 1, and every exhale as 2, stop when you get to 10, and start at 1. You mind cannot count and think endlessly at the same time.

This will reduce the blue light that is emitted from the display (will not change color of your screen during gaming sessions for those gamers wondering - you know why you can't sleep. ;) )

I ended up cutting my toe on a sharp edge of furniture right as I had taken my meds to sleep. Literally was on the way to bed.

I sometimes add a natural supplement,  E.g Melatonin or Valerian in hopes it would aid in keeping me asleep but is rarely successful. Haven't had a full night sleep in months.

2771,"GUYS, it could be a microbiome related problem! I just wanted to point this out as I’ve been exhaustively (ha) searching for things that cause my insomnia, and only now did I came accross the idea that it could be an issue with your gut microbiome. These tiny guys are intimately intertwined with the brain play a huge role in your mental health. Alterations in them can even change your personality. Furthermore, chronic insomnia damages these microbiomes, which can very well lead to a self fulfilling cycle if left untreated. Specific kinds of bacteria play different roles and can be more effective than medicine.
I wish I could provide better information but I’m not the best person to talk about microbiology. It’s worth doing some research on the topic if it hasn’t crossed your mind before.

2 weeks ago, i had an extremely stressful sitiuation due to overthinking wich led to me not sleeping well one night. Ive always had from time to time 1 week in wich i would not be able to sleep well, would take a lot for me to fall asleep and i would wake up a lot, and then i went for weeks or months sleeping well. In the past i fell asleep so easily that one time at an edm festival in the middle of the crowd i just sat there and fell asleep. I once slept 2h straight in the middle of a techno club. In the front row of an hockey match, the list goes on. So basically 2 weeks ago i had that night i didnt sleep well and i thought ""well just my short insomnia kicking, 2 days and ill be good"", i literally sleep so bad that i week sometimes i fell asleep at 8am going to work at 11 and then i would take a nap afternoon. Then i decided to go one night with little sleep so i could have better sleep the next night and that happened. The week after, i would take 10 minutes to fall asleep for like 4 nights in a row , and i would sleep 7/8 h a day easily. But then it came again, i ended up falling asleep only after 4h on thursday at like 8:30 AM, didnt have work so i slept until like 13. 4:30h of sleep, not insanely bad but no reeeally bad. Next night i fell asleep in 20 minutes and sleept like 11h. The night after i stayed up very late with friends but when i got to bed i just fell asleep in like 10 minutes (i was high-ish), slept only 5:30h but i was like 6h on bed so it was good. Now the past night i went to bed at 1:45AM with work at 11:30AM, and i fell asleep literally 5h later at 6:45. So the problem here is, when it seems like its going away and im starting to sleep well, it always comes back. Always. I always have that night where i feel extremely anxious about not being able to sleep, where i feel unconfortable, where i just feel i just want to sleep but i phsically cant. Any tips? I was thinking of buying a melatonin supplement thats cheap and has some extra things like valerian root and stuff , its sold here near my house. I would pop that in the nights that i was not being able to sleep. But i was thinking of a way to fix this a little bit better.

One more thing, some of the nights that took me 3/4/5h to fall asleep, i actually kind of fell asleep in like 20/30 min but then after 2/3 minutes in an semi-unconscious state i would wake up and get a spike of anxiety mixed with anger for interrupting my process of falling asleep, wich would make me really awake even after 10 min earlier i was just almost falling asleep."

I've been lurking on some subs for quite a while but decided to finally post my thoughts here, specially after reading how many people are/were experiencing what I've been through. I'd like to apologize in advance for any typos since not only english isn't my mother language, but I've been feeling shittier than ever.

Anxiety and OCD were always inner struggles for me, and I had a very traumatic month last year in August,  which for the first time on my entire life, greatly affected my sleep. At first, I was merely waking several times a night, but not experiencing any kind of sleepiness or fatigue during the day. 

Eventually by september, it escalated to the point I could ''sleep'' for 9 hours and wake up like I hadn't slept at all. It kept going worse and worse, until somewhat stabilized. I feel my approach on exercising had a role on that. I still woke up feeling I hadn't sleep enough, but was tolerable. During this time my OCD kicked in stronger than ever and, as expected, my anxiety also made me paranoid and thinking I had the worst of diseases (Hi, Fatal Insomnia!).

My doc requested a sleep study (which sucked, slept for barely a hour lol) and there it was: my sleep was a disaster. Yeah, no shit, right?

Since then, boy, It's been one hell of a ride. I've been through 4 meds by now, seroquel being the lastest. It does put me to sleep but not only I get the weirdest dreams but also fucks my daytime sleepiness even more, and I feel like a robot sometimes. She says it's temporary and will stabilize. 2 weeks and nothing, yet.

What really sucks, though, is that now my sleep is crappier than ever. I've tested 2 days without taking any meds and I'm getting a very weird tingling behind my eyes sometimes and waking like...10 times a night, again. I'm not much as active as I was back in september so definitely exercise might help again.

For someone who never, NEVER, had any kind of issue sleeping besides OCD and Anxiety since childhood, this sucks. Hard. I think i'll ask for another sleep study to rule out narcolepsy and i'm considering a keto diet to fight my sleepiness. My quality of life has been greatly affected and honestly although there are worst things out there, I don't deserve this and I'll fight it to the very end.

There was one 3 month period when I was in my early 20's when I was a lifeguard - it was the best I've ever slept in my life, and it gave me a glimpse into how non-insomniacs must feel every day.

What made that job unique was that I was outside, exposed to direct sunlight, for upwards of 8 hours a day. The books I'm reading all say the same thing i.e. exposure to sunlight in the morning and during the day helps keep your body synched up with your circadian rhythm. The book I'm reading currently suggests going for a walk or run when you walk up to get both exercise and sun exposure, but if you can't do that then to sit by a window with the sunlight hitting you.

It currently being winter in the north eastern U.S. going outside in the morning is hell (freezing) but I can easily sit next to a large window with sunlight directly hitting my face. 

After some paranoia about the effectiviness of this I googled around and found a few random articles claiming that sunlight filtered through a window pain doesn't help at all.

I'm apt to believe these books I'm reading and not random articles from no-name websites, but I am now paranoid about whether what I'm doing has proven effective or not.

Here's the vid I use, https://youtu.be/\_28E4C881J4 there are other dark screen videos on youtube, but I love the sound of this one, and the best thing about this is that when this video plays there is no advertising, or pop-ups, or any of those other things which can instantly ruin the moment and set you right back to square one!  


I put this on my phone, close my eyes and listen to the waves. I then use a technique I read about a while back which is a kind of meditation, where you relax your body in a very concentrated way, starting with your feet, and progressively working your way up your boady, relaxing your muscles in one area at a time until you reach your head.  


Once I've done that I have fully wound down, and I concentrate on listening to the waves.

&#x200B;

I haven't gotten my insomnia diagnosed yet (though that's a goal this semester), but basically I sometimes just don't sleep until 5 AM or so. Most of time, difficulty falling asleep or the fear of not getting enough sleep because of early morning obligations causes sleep anxiety, and can lead to panic attacks (I'm pretty sure I have both anxiety and insomnia, not just one of them). When this happens, the anxiety and insomnia just feed off each other. If I try to sleep early, that often makes things worse, giving me sleep anxiety because I'm trying to sleep but can't, and in the end making me sleep less. So If I have to wake up at 7 AM for classes, it's often better to just try to sleep at 1 or 2 AM than say 11 PM because I'm less likely to have trouble falling asleep, at least on my current sleep schedule. I haven't really figured out how to move my sleep schedule earlier because of this, but I suppose I could try explicitly overexhausting myself and then sleeping early, but that has a risk of being overexhausted and THEN not sleeping.  


So I'm trying to figure out how to best approach this. Should I try to shift my sleep schedule (which is extra hard because I'm about to move to a timezone 3 hours ahead), or just accept some nights will be crappy? If I try to shift my sleep schedule, I'm worried it just simply won't work and just cause unnecessary anxiety and sleeplessness. If it works, I won't be able to do things like hang out with friends late (and by late I only mean like midnight), because that could throw it off and I'd have to start over. But doing things like that is just a part of my lifestyle, and I would hate not being able to go out like that.  


On the other hand, it doesn't seem particularly healthy to just submit to getting less sleep the nights before my recitation. It will probably take a toll on my teaching abilities, and could significantly decrease my productivity for the entire day. As a grad student, submitting to that kind of routine would be extremely difficult and hinder my research (which is the most important part of my degree). In this case, I also might have to drop my 9:30 AM Tuesday/Thursday class to ensure I can get sleep on other days, even though I'm very excited for that class, and it might be relevant to future research I do.  


I know you guys can't answer this for me, but does anyone have any thoughts? Any similar experiences? I'm planning on getting a therapist to help me with this, but I probably won't be able to get an appointment for awhile. So I guess I'm on my own for a bit.

2804,"Correlation between sleep quality and potatoes Hello my insomniac friends. I made a very interesting discovery today. I have very inconsistent sleep patterns... I go through phases where I'll only get 4 hours of sleep a night, and then phases where I'll sleep somewhat normally. I started to take inventory of what I was doing/eating during these phases and discovered that one of the only differences is that during my good sleep phases, I eat a lot of potatoes.

Sometimes I buy big bags of red potatoes and eat a few (boiled) every day. I'm a broke student so it's a way to save money while also staying healthy. They're also very filling. But sometimes I don't buy potatoes and guess what happens? My sleep turns to shit. 

My guess is that I have a deficiency of some kind that is being corrected by the potatoes. I did some research and found  some articles about how potassium relaxes muscles and increases seratonin. So maybe those are factors? 

Anyway, let me know what you guys think. I just wanted to add, exercise has also helped my insomnia a lot overall, so I can't give potatoes all the credit. "

I noticed that my exercised muscles felt residual soreness unusual for me, performed poorly at the gym and had not recovered to the extent that they usually do.

2819,"My personal story, ending insomnia/narcolepsy shame, and some reading material. Hey all,

**(Skip to the TLDR's if you don't want to read the whole thing)**

Personal story first.

I've suffered from chronic insomnia all of my life. It had a debilitating effect on my ability to perform academically through the time I graduated high school. College was the first time I was able to excel academically almost entirely because it was the first time I had an incredibly flexible schedule - I woke up pretty much whenever I wanted, I spent almost all of my time in social interactions with friends or classmates, and I spent much of my time outside (sunlight being the major factor for keeping your circadian rhythm in tact).

Since leaving college about a decade ago, I've found that the lifestyle of a career professional has been much closer to 1st - 12th grade than to college in terms of how conducive it is to sleeping well. You can't wake up whenever you want when you need to be in the office by 9. If you're a PMer (someone who's genetically predispositioned to waking up a little bit later in the morning) employers couldn't care less. Suddenly you spend all of your day (and often much of your night) staring at tech devices that blare wakefulness-inducing blue light into your eyes. Suddenly the ability to excersize on a daily basis becomes a struggle - in college it's easy to pop into the gym every day between or after classes - when you have a 9 - 6 job plus a commute, it can be a challenge. Arguably most important of all, you lose your freedom to spend your time outside, bathed in the sunlight that keeps you and your circadian rhythm in perfect harmony - instead, many of us spend our time in dim offices, hidden from sunlight, the sun having gone down by the time we venture outside, and instead spend the night in our homes in full (artificial) light.

None of this will be news to anyone browsing an insomnia subreddit.

**TLDR - The work life of many modern, career professionals are not conducive to sleeping well.**

All of that said, my career over the past 8 years had, at times, suffered heavily because of my insomnia. One of the worst aspects of it was how little control I felt I had over the my condition. Our culture and our media alike consider/portray people who need special sleep considerations, who take naps, who are often sleepy, etc as lazy, and as having personal failings. People who naturally have no issues with sleep are praised for a state of being that they never had to fight to achieve. It's all felt incredibly unfair to me at times.

Two years ago I started what should have been my dream job. It was, at first, until I started managing a few new (but natural) stressors in my life, and suddenly my insomnia (as it always does) immediately became 10 times worse. I had also started the job mid-Spring, so my first 5 months in the job were in the hot, sunny parts of the year, during which managing my insomnia is always a bit easier (I'll try to spend as much time outside as I can during these months, which goes a long ways towards helping keep my natural sleep clock on track). New projects and a new relationship combined just as winter was kicking in to create a perfect insomnia-storm.

It took me another year of suffering, but after my then-partner encouraged me repeatedly to take my mental health more seriously, and after starting a kick of reading books on the neuroscience of sleep, I decided to start taking ownership of my condition. 

I'd undergone a sleep study at a hospital a few years earlier. It lasted all night and into the afternoon the following day, and they diagnosed me with narcolepsy. To this day I'm somewhat skeptical of that diagnosis, but the point was that I had a medically diagnosed sleep condition. I was also seeing a sleep specialist at the time who, after multiple consultations, agreed I was suffering from chronic insomnia.

Point being, I had a medical condition. If I had any other medical condition that left me utterly physically, emotionally, and mentally debilitated at times, especially if I don't manage it, I would garner sympathy from friends/family and understanding and accommodations (ideally) from employers. But as I said earlier, our culture tends to frown on people with insomnia and often chalks them up as lazy. After some careful thought I decided to stop suffering in silence.

**TLDR - My career suffered for years due to insomnia, and I kept my condition largely hidden from friends, family and employers**

First, during my weekly one-on-one with the director of my team, I matter-of-factly informed him that I have a medical condition, that it isn't life threatening, but that I have medically diagnosed narcolepsy and chronic insomnia, that I see a specialist and have had this condition my whole life. I told him that it might just mean that I need to take the occasional mental health day and keep a somewhat more flexible schedule to help me manage the condition. I also told him that I have the condition managed, and that it generally has no impact on my work beyond needing an occasional mental health day to recover if I'm going through a period of time when it's temporarily become worse than usual. 

To my relief, he reacted the same way that I imagine he would have if I had described suffering from a different medical condition - he was very understanding, he thanked me for letting him know, he expressed some honest but polite curiosity about my condition, and told me to please take a mental health day when I needed to and to let him know if there was anything else he could do to help.

Since then I've maintained a fairly flexibly work schedule and I'll take the occasional mental health day when things get bad. That director left my organization a few months ago, and this time, rather than waiting, I had the same conversation with my new director right away - the conversation went the exact same way. She was understanding, offered to help any other ways if I needed it, and was politely curious.

**TLDR - I finally took ownership of my medical condition, informed my employers, and everything went very well**

Not hiding my condition anymore and informing people I know that it's a serious condition has led to me feeling much more confident about my ownership over my sleep. Over the past six months I've started reading a few books related to sleep efficiency and not getting a sufficient amount of sleep that I'd recommend everyone read.

These two are fairly well known, so there's a good chance you've all already heard of them or read them, but in case you haven't:

1) Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams 

This book by neuroscientist and professor of psychology at UC Berkely, Matthew Walker, delves exhaustively into some of the most recent research on understanding why we sleep, what we gain from sleep, and what we lose when we don't sleep enough. I'd highly recommend starting with this book to understand how high the stakes are when we think about our insomnia. It outlines in detail the deleterious effects on our mental, emotional, and physical health when we don't get enough sleep.

2) Sleep: The Myth of 8 Hours, the Power of Naps... and the New Plan to Recharge Your Body and Mind.

This short and highly accessibly book by professional athlete sleep trainer Nick Littlehales is written with the intent to help train yourself to sleep as efficiently as the athletes that he trains. I'd highly recommend reading Why We Sleep prior to, or in conjunction with, this book. I found myself taking copious notes while reading it and am now trying out the sleep strategies that he explains in the book myself. Based on the title I was skeptical going in (worried it would advise the fact-free, mythological strategy of sleeping 2 hours a night and scattering naps all day), but I've found it incredibly helpful. The author doesn't wield pseudo-science or fake, ""here's how to sleep in 30 minute increments 4 times a day and day and live forever!"" mantras. The advice is factual, practical, instructive, and achievable for anyone who wants to give his advice a shot. As the author openly states, he is neither a doctor, not psychologist, nor neuroscienctist (for that you need to read Why We Sleep), but he is acutely familiar with the most recent science on sleep and therefore makes no outlandish claims. I couldn't recommend this book more, it's been a life saver for me personally - and this is coming from someone with a lifetime of insomnia and who's tried a thousand strategies already.

**TLDR - If you're suffering from insomnia I recommend reading the two aforementioned books, in the order I listed them**

My insomnia is nowhere near ""cured,"" but after taking ownership of it and being unafraid to let me condition be known, I've found myself more optimistic than I have been in a long time. If you suffer from chronic insomnia or narcolepsy yourself, I couldn't encourage more that you take ownership of it, understand it's a serous medical condition, and don't be afraid to request accommodations when necessary. The more of us that do, the more normalized it will become.

Thanks for reading

We recently moved back in with my parents to take care of them (they are both ill, one terminally so). This has only served to exacerbate the problem as there are more \[sick\] people making noise at night in her vicinity. We took her to a doctor and she was diagnosed with insomnia. It was a huge 'a-hah' moment for us like of course it was insomnia the whole time but now we are navigating the solutions - so far with little luck. The generic form of ambien didn't help. Rozerem didn't help either. Now we're on to trazodone with fingers crossed. I guess I should mention she has tried exercise in the past and it never made a difference. I've also ordered some noise-cancellation earplugs since her major issue seems to be waking up to sounds at night, but I seem to remember a few years back she tried that and it didn't work either.

But now I'm graduated and I am expected to be up at the crack of dawn for things.

I have taken melatonin to help me sleep sometimes, for an exam for example. And it helped. However this night I took 2 melatonin sublingual tablets and after 5 hours of laying in bed I still cannot sleep although my eyes and eyelids are tired.

I don't know what to do and I don't want to get prescribed sleeping medication because those do more harm than good from my research (I just graduated with my bsc and one of my profs is a neurobiology phd and she only had bad things to say about sleeping pills when I talked to her about my issues).

I have tried countless times to reset my sleeping schedule. Staying up all night and then going to sleep at 9pm or so. But I will still sleep in the next day even if I go to bed early, thus making me go to sleep late again.

I don't know what to do and I could really use some advice. "
2828,Special insomnia For the past 2 years I've had massive problems sleeping when I know I've to get up early the next day for let's say a lecture. Most of the times I don't even sleep at all when this happens. Does anyone relate/know how to cope with this?  
2829,"Why does it take me an hour to fall asleep my whole life? My whole life I have had this ""problem"", I haven't really considered it a problem until recently. I'm 20 now and sometimes I just want to fall asleep fast, but my body never does. Never in my life have I fallen asleep in under 30 minutes unless I took a pill or was drunk off my ass. What is there to do? I already take too much medication I don't want to add another pill to my daily routine. I exercise almost every day four 2 hours in the gym, I drink my last coffee at 3 PM. 

This is my current routine: Go to bed at around 10pm on weekdays, watch TV for 3-4 hours, try to sleep at 1 AM and only fall asleep around 2AM. Wake up at 10AM. I also have restless leg syndrome but it only bothers me when I'm sitting not in bed. Anyone have any ideas? I tried white noise, it doesn't work I can't sleep with it on."

It makes me question the possibility of some environmental element effecting our sleep. I have had issues for over a decade, but in the last 3 years I have seen an extensive amount of discussion regarding sleep loss.

I suffer from sleep issues.. Used to have Insomnia. But since I have not been employed for awhile, I always fall asleep at some point.

I have sort of developed a routine. Was experiencing sleep hangovers from the med and have made an adjustment.

My routine now is at 9pm I am taking a scullcap vitamin, plus 250mg of Magnesium Glycinate. I also take half an immovaine (zopilcone - which I have just started using again but am not going to take every day), and I take a 10mg of amitryptiline.

From there I smoke some concentrate before bed. Eat half a cookie, and then the rest of the cookie (edible) right before I fall asleep.

If I do not time it right, and I am not asleep within an hour my legs start aching and then I have to get out of bed and smoke more concentrate. This usually ends up waking my mind up. Recently someone mentioned CBD concentrate for sleep and that it worked for them - that is next to try.

And this is where we are now.

Hopefully my legs will be quiet long enough that I can fall asleep.

2833,"Anxiety or sleep apnea? Hi all! I've recently come down with a very odd sleeping problem! It started Sunday night so I am on day three of this. Basically what happens is that right before I fall asleep and my body is relaxed, I unknowingly stop breathing and my heart begins to race to like crazy triggering an adrenaline rush that wakes me all the way up. These episodes are very scary and feel like I'm having mini heart attacks. It doesn't help that it was happening EVERY time I almost fell asleep each night. I know it sounds like apnea but there is no obstruction in my throat or nose that could cause this. I am worried it might be central sleep apnea but the sudden onset is very concerning.

Of course as you can imagine this has caused horrible sleep and high anxiety. Sunday night I got around six hours which is actually pretty normal, Monday I got five though but now I'm down to four. My chest and diaphragm feel tight and sore, breathing feels very weird right now even standing and walking around. My body is VERY reactive to my anxiety though as i CANNOT fall asleep when my tinnitus spikes. I have no history or heart or breathing problems although on random rare occasions I will catch myself holding my breath if I'm concentrating or exerting myself.

I've had this happen twice only in the past, and only when I was very stressed. My only prior stress cause was money but that's been resolving itself over time. So now I get to be worried about sleep and breathing/heart problems. I work anywhere between 8-10 hours a day so I NEED my sleep. Going about my day as a walking zombie at a warehouse is no good! If you guys have any advice that would be much appreciated. 

Oh I should mention I do have health insurance and have read that many insurance companies cover sleep studies and CPAP machines but I have very little time to go to the doctor. I am worried I will get no sleep during a study and then the next day at work will be terrible. I am doubtful they do these on the weekends.

TL:DR: sudden onset of potential sleep apnea has me worried!

2838,"I sleep better when I'm depressed Hello,

It's 2 AM and I can't fall asleep though I really tried. I should be up by 6:30 which leaves me with 4 hours of sleep at best or avoiding school tommorow which might lead to me getting kicked out eventually but I'd rather sleep for as long as I can so I am able to function for a longer period of time (and I had some issues with probably?? a low blood pressure yesterday and I almost passed out and it's more likely to happen when I am sleep deprived and I don't want to feel like that tommorow).

While trying to fall asleep, I found out there might be a pattern in my sleeping habits. When I am depressed, I usually feel numb and I have no problems to fall asleep unless I'm very anxious but that's rare when I am in the depression state. But when I feel okay, maybe even too excited and hype for no reason, I can't fall asleep if my life depended on it. Like now.

It started last year after I was very I'll for a month. I started doing stuff and sports and suddenly at night when I wanted to sleep I got this really hard heartbeat and maybe some faster heartbeats (I felt they were hard and flat) plus I have to pee every half an hour and not just have to but I do pee a lot.


This was so bad that I couldn't sleep at all for several days. After a few days I started hallucinating and randomly crying or screaming and dreaming of murder the people around me.

I got an ecg at the doctors office and an ultrasound of my heart. Everything is OK. Thyroid seems okay too. Then after a while it went away and I decided maybe it was from my illness.


The first weekend of January it started again. Got prescribed melatonine and heard ""it's normal it is just stress"". Melatonin didn't help because I am tired as fuck but the hammering in my chest keeps me from sleeping.


Then it went away. Sadly after only two weeks (last Friday) it started again. I am absolutely sure that it is something physiological because I have an active life, nearly no stress, a strong support system and am overall just happy with my life. 


Please, has anyone the same symptoms? I am tired of doctors telling me ""go do sports"". Sorry I did so four times last week. And I do sports hard. Maybe it is something food related? Or hormones? It is hard to not give up when the doctors don't take one seriously...."

2846,"I was skeptical, but I've had some early success with CBN+CBD After trying lots of things both natural/OTC (meditating, indica dominant weed, melatnonin, unisom) and prescription (Ambien, doxepin) I looked into CBD which lead me to CBN. Smoking an indica dominant strain didn't seem to help me much- it still tended to make my mind a little busy. I'm no scientist, but apparently your body processes THC into CBN which is the part that makes you tired.

My cousin told me about this product called Gossamer Dusk which is a full spectrum CBD oil with especially high levels of CBN. They've got a spiffy website full of information, it could be junk science for all I know but sounded plausible so I gave it a shot.

I've used it three times now and the first two nights I slept for 7 hours (!!) which hasn't happened in ages. I definitely felt a sedating and calming effect, but obviously it's subtle because it's not a psychoactive. Last night it wasn't quite as effective and I only got around 5 hours, but I blame that on having to work until late which always throws me off.

I've also been trying to do 30 minutes of cardio a day to make myself more physically tired which I think is helping. I'll check back here in a week or so and let you guys know how it's going, but wanted to share my excitement with good results so far!

2848,"Insomnia/fatigue I went to a sleep study and found out I have chronic insomnia. But its not the insomnia that keeps you up at night, its the kind where its in the middle of the night, and I don't even wake up. So there is not much I can consciously do about it, except right before I go to bed, but that wouldn't increase the quality of sleep.

My therapist thinks its probably my anxiety. She may be right--in part. But I can't take medication for anxiety because it is a downer, it makes me more sleepy. So to take care of my anxiety means I have to take care of it through therapy, which is ok.

So I tried making my life more structured. Its fairly recent. I'm trying to avoid naps during the day (usually, if there is a lot going on, my body just shuts down, its not really a choice). Im drinking more water. Im going to eat more by making meals for the next day and a half, so I have no excuse to miss my breakfast. I am trying to make myself do so much during the day that when it comes nighttime I knock out. All of these have helped--in the short term.

This past week, I managed to make everything I have to do efficient. Streamlined the homework, the chores, the food intake. It all worked. It was meant to allow me to hang out with some friends for a whole day. And I did. It was amazing, I missed them so much. It was on Sunday.

I was exhausted yesterday, but I pulled through with some work. I avoided a nap that I really really wanted, and I fell asleep at 1am, not 2. But this morning, when I woke up, everything was wrong. My whole body felt like it had sunk into my mattress. I feel weak. I have a headache. My eyes hurt. I'm trying to get myself to move faster and take care of important responsibilities so that I don't have to buy groceries very late at night, but I don't know what's going on. And its disheartening. I feel mentally more excited because I had a fun time two days ago, but its all wrong. I tried to get up but fell asleep on the couch. How can this be sustainable?

Now that it's my 1 year anniversary of rarely sleeping, I feel like my insomnia is never going to go away. I've tried so many different things such as marijuana, 2-3 different sleeping pills, melatonin, bali kratom, and a bunch of other stuff that I can't remember off the top of my head.

In addition to all of those different medications and drugs, I've installed blue light filters on all my devices, read a book for 1-2 hours before bed, and avoid all caffeine throughout the day. On top of that I've been going to the gym regularly and it still isn't enough to knock me out at night.

Anytime I ever ask for help or express my will to book an appointment with a psychiatrist or something they blow up in my face and make me feel like complete shit.

Through all the mood swings, not being able to think clearly, and just the total helplessness I feel from this I don’t know if things are ever going to get better.

I've had problems falling asleep for the past decade or so, so that isn't anything new to me and I've always slept pretty well once I actually manage to fall asleep. The last 2 weeks I've been waking up multiple times a night (usually at least 5-10 that I can count) drenched in sweat but freezing cold and curled up in the fetal position.

However, I found that talking to people that I love before bed will help me fall asleep quickly like a baby. I FaceTime my mom, best friends or even long lost friends. Of course it doesn’t work every time! But I would recommend you all to give it a shot tho. Is a good opportunity to catch up some old friends.

Just read a post on here that mentioned trazodone.

This is one of the few sleep drugs I've tried and the only prescription I've refilled for years simply because my Dr promises me it's not habit forming.

It does knock me out if I take 150 - 200 mgs which is the most or more than the Dr says is safe... But I never wake up feeling rested when I do cave and take it.

I do wake up feeling relieved that I've slept, but that's about it. Sometimes I throw up in the am and it only seems to happen when I've taken the trazodone.

Also, it always gives me like, insanely vivid dreams - I wake up remembering lots of dreams from the night before, and those dreams feel like they went on for days or even weeks. 

Anyone else get this? Normal sleep doesn't make me dream.... But then, I rarely get normal sleep."

After I got cleaned up with alot of help from other people, I couldn't sleep well for at least 6 months. I went years where being busy during the day helped alot along with exercise. This year, my work schedule changed to swings and overnights. It seems like the overnights are taking their toll, as recently my sleep patterns have gotten worse. I work two jobs and the second is a part time job in the field I love. I work in IT at night and my exercise routine has died down to almost nothing. If I have a 8AM meeting for the part time, I get stuck awake as I've had trouble waking up on time in the past for meetings early. This week has been the worst in a bit, where I'm waking up in spurts when I do doze off and after eating, wanking, etc. 
Have you folks also watched your sleep pattern degrade due to work load/pursuing a goal? Did it become unhealthy like this?

2891,"I feel so alone-I never met anyone with my sleeping disorder symptoms If there is anyone out there with my issue?  I would love to hear from you, but I've been searching for years and haven't met anyone with this disorder or the way I feel the next day after not getting several hours of refreshed sleep. In my mid-late 20's, I started having severe sleeping problems. I would wake up to early and feel totally unrefreshed-it didn't matter if I slept 8-hours straight, the next day I felt and now feel like I have the flu, no energy, and unable to perform my job even though I love it. I am now 48-years old and I have several other factors and weight gaining drugs I'm on due to a kidney transplant besides my sleeping meds, which are Elavil, Zyprexa and Prozac combo medication, and Klonopin up to 2-mg as needed. At first and for many years, after being hospitalized,  the Elavil and 1mg of Klonopin was the ONLY thing that helped me sleep and I tried everything. if I started having a problem feeling unrefreshed on Elavil, my doctor would up the dose and I was normal again. I am not normal. I currently take 150mg of Elavil each night and was also put on 25/6 mg of fluox/olanza, which is Prozac and Zyprexa together (6-mg of Zyprexa). Yes, I gained weight from the kidney transplant and the fluox/olanza, but pretty sure it's the olanzapine/ Zyprexa, which causes weight gain. (other than my kidney antirejection drugs I need to take to stay alive). The Past three nights, I've woken up every two hours and took a 1mg klonopin with some warm milk to fall asleep again and then another 2 hrs later and so on until it was 8 or 9am and I had to get up. Even thought the Klonopin put me back to sleep, I am so tired and my face is broken out and feel so alone. I've never been able to sleep even 6-hrs straight and feel the least bit productive the following day. So, taking all the Klonopin, which used to work to put me back to sleep for a few hours isn't making me feel like a normal, but just tired individual and I don't mean groggy. If I wake up groggy from Klonopin, I have a cup of coffee and would feel just fine. Do you know how you feel when you are extremely sick with the flu and you just have to stay in bed until it ends? Well, that is how I'm feeling day after day from just not sleeping well. I've heard of some people not sleeping at all for a day or two, but they still feel someone normal but have a regular tired feeling like they are going to doze off. When I'm extremely tired, I still can't fall asleep. That never happened to me...it's always really bad and I can't function at all. I've lost jobs over this thru the years and thank god I have a supportive loving husband because I don't know if other normal people would have put up with my sleeping problem and more importantly, how horrible I feel when I'm having sleep issues. Can anyone out there even relate? I'm told I could probably increase the Zyprexa, but major weight gain will be an issue and between feeling awful or being fat, I would rather die. I've already gained 35 pounds from my kidney meds (Steroids) and these sleeping meds. I don't know who or where to turn to anymore-I feel like I am extremely unique to feel like I'm dead when I don't sleep well. I've have sleep apnea tests and it came back normal, although my husband says I snore loudly. Can anyone relate? I feel so alone? It's not my diet and when I'm sleeping well, I'm on my treadmill daily for one hour everyday. Thank you for listening to my very long message and I hope someone out there has a similar situation-It is pure hell. Thank you, Diane

Noticed however that the temperature was warmer than usual, hovering close to 22 degrees Celsius and I had ignored this. I set out to lower it, and slept better the following night. I lowered it yet even more, and was so cool at onset that layering sheets wasn't sufficient. I had to grab a comforter. It took me 2.5h to finally sleep.

Finally was at 5-6 hours of swell a night. Doctor doubled my dosage and for the first time in a long time I was sleeping 7-8 hours a night with minimal interruptions.

My condition means my self-esteem and confidence are so low, with high severe anxiety and mood disorder and brain that thinks sleep it a fucking drug that you don't want to get to tolerant to or get iwthdrawals, like waking up feeling every cell in your body alive. I mean I enjoy walking around with my cells heated and stressed, confused and wants a shag maybe after being awake 70 hours with its friendly associate ""sleep-deprived mental state"", a natural aphrodisiac, social lubricant, sure to win any birds approval if it weren't for them pesky ""sleep"" things other people do. I mean I enjoyed it when younger, spent a lot of time alone in bed for number of reasons, ending up having semi-buddhist self-realisations like controlling dreams, manually waking up from dreams (arguable), surviving parents with 1) No skill to attend to emotional struggles as men as supposed to be strong for women like my mom and sister, his mom, his sisters, heck the fucking Queen and Tina Turner all had this ""odd, different,chaotic, self-doubting, paranoid, avoidant, terrifying, beautiful and blissful side to them. Women always confused me as I talked to them like men but apparently thats being weird or retarded. I've learned with therapy, time, medication, lsd, weed, the internet, proffessor Nutt,Eckhart Tolle, Dr Gaba Mate, Jordan Peterson and  Avoidant Personality Disorder, GAD, dysthymic, chronic insomniac with a fortunate outlook on life, just, at , this, moment. Tomorrow I'll be wishing to be friends with the birds in the park again and I'm not ready to settle my social status ego as crazy park man, juicy lucy, Red Bull subversional experiment no#19387616, a sad man with troublesome problems (look at him hes look at nature lol! That's only for creeps, Perv!). Joking, I make jokes since my dad was someone who could break the moment of a family tragedy with laughter from a source I could only assume comes from a frequency (or just nothingness, k, I've got Tinnitus and a keen ear for loud noises and things I can't make sure that I've not went psychotic. of  infront of everyone by saying ""ocial attempt to communicate for no other conscious reason than engaging with people again, the internet is that beast that can social relieve you or repeat traumatic patterns from the past, activating your stored memories (without conscious realisation, you thought about it too much in the past and as an insomniac I can't remember to brush my teeth everynight! How could I be so gross? Should I judge, shame myself? When was I last shamed for being gross and how did it feel? Maybe in school group of friends, your parents giving you responsibilities tp help you with life, or yet another bried honest care for their son that isn't just to keep shame away from the family ( Insomniacs been through too much pain not to have awakened *spit special overpriced sleep relaxing tea our*. How can one human who gets no sleep become so mentally ill but ingenious in regards to treating a health condition regarded as simply avoidable and choice driven, to the unfair tragedy of our condition, which most others in my experience equate with a mild headache in the morning solved by [societal programmed respone, evidence biased on selection, funding and appeal to societies psychological fear of past government (and many current) axioms of control, deceit and subversion, their true interest in human life gone at the latest realising politics, choas, order corruption and desperation are recipies for levels of hell greater than missing the latest episode of the Simpsons, sports, gossip, meme everyone experienced while you wondered if being a highly educated cog in the machine of an orchestrated dance of emotional negativity designed for civilisations compulsive need for more rather than a fundemental return to the child you were before you were forced into dynamics that danaged your health and daren't stir the boat...

or else...

I startle from sleep as I'm falling asleep, nervous system rapidly jumps gears, relaxing takes ages, maybe not enough time to return to base before your next plight.


 I feel open (very rare, sorta weed helps! This isn't a weed dominant post its alright Mr/Mrs threatened person, reactionary or trying to value and burden civilisations psychological and emotional load (spiritual too, but nm that)) to keep its unimaginable complexity. Experiantial and high school graduate level insight on some Drugs, Psychonaut, Insomnia, Depression, anxiety, severe, chronic, treatment resistance, shame, spiral of despair, loniliness (yash I'm gotta say sexually at least. Good looking genes but brain rerouted and damaged by cross generational traum, genetic causes, I'll clean my flat (Or half at least so main room, toilet, hall, bedroom presentable. Shove every fucking thing in buckets and amazon boxes in their reminded of the times, future (Very pessimistic about future, cyberpunk, dystopia, mad max, fallout, fifa 11 (ahh my last of those shitty buy every year games, still... if I had friends that played I'd pay it for the experience, even battlefield 1943 that shitty plastation store game with faint reminders of the glory of old battlefield games (all best personal game memories come from games that communities are toxic, then you start walking around the residence silently looking at everything like god is making everything a fag that should just not exist pls. I'm human and teammate abuse/rejection is primordial and experience induced trauma for me, but I'm not revealing much about my true ills for redditors to put their finger in the proverbial wound and swiggle it around just for shits, because as I have come to learn, and you may be dubios or straight disagree, humans have became a sick species, unaware of its own tragedies running from cognitive torture, just for a few seconds, like an addict to finding peace (chaos and order are inseparable and peace is a state of no mind attained by very few in our generations), and it's no wonder... We come from thousands of years of extreme suffering and strength.

I'll stop talking Jordan Peterson and/or Eckhart Tolle (if you have suffered you have a very low risk and high reward just to research and contemplate their teachings)  to stop focusing on aggresive thougts through no fault of their own. No one really, deeply wants to endure more suffering that they already have, and I'm guilty of bullying a few kids to up my social status when the moment presented its like a cat pouncing if not interested) and their unique moments of pleasure from spotting enemy boats, dolphin diving and nades spammin.  

Got myself some, benzos, some weed,tobacco, and tasty treats. Some alcohol, yet still awake for 3 days last week with anything but an microsleep when I lost awareness in dizziness for a sec. Trying to drag they buses and trucks the ""strongmen"" tv show do in the mind. 

Anyone else feel like that analogy for your brain and ego to admire a little self-wortj?  Not even a little huh, mind to busy. 

Making mistakes at work due to sleep deficit in a chicken fast food retailer Average 3 hour sleep including before theI got the Sat and weeks/months/years before it (avg mind, but a very static sleep chart on my phone so the GP, mental health staff and Docs, nurses and Psychs/therapits xx After those days awake, last weekend, I Drank 2 botlles of white trying to knock myself out to sleep on day 2/3 but not too harsh, Didn't work and sobering up from ""heavy"" alcohol binge to see the sun in the dawn is Achy and bland. 

Paracetamol, Caffeine, Neurofen help me start my new job a months few monthsto sleep related disorders... Not putting the counter for fried chicken your just made and dropped in the fried (an automatic rare mistake). Followed by breading chicken incorrectly.  tried  plus ssris ish types but not enough it seems.

Biggest effect for managing the mental illness were srris (would have went in normal day life,worse under stress like work crazy anxiety knife in hands nuts)was vaping weed to treat my anxiety/mood (which yes if you use low or mix with tobacco won't zonk you.

Diet is a riot 5 stones in 3 years, 19 bmi unhealthily thin to borderly obese at 29.



We don't get the care we need and deserve as truely suffering a horrendlously life alterating condition. How has people with severe chronic insomnia i.e 3 hours a night average.

 Went to NHS psychiatrist and got told ""your body will fall asleep when it needs to"". I almost laughed out loud. My type is getting hypnic jerks/myclonus as relaxing and falling asleep, waking after what 1 hour? Expected to treat my Anxiety and Depression and all this shit through behavioural models which had failed through trial and error.

Leaning over to the dark net now getting to grips with benzos and their addictive tendensies. Modafinil and Pregabalin have been the most important off the net, and Phenibut. Tianeptine sulphate not useful enough although a nice high with withdrawal worse that opiates and tianeptine is an antipressants AND opiate.

I've read stuff about benos. Their suffering withdrawals worse than any drug, yes even heroin and crack. Just tried to get a little bit of sleep before long work hours in a kitchen by popping a cheap pill. Still judging their use/wprtj pver negatives, not spent much in w/ds and chronic use/abuse for 2 weeks now.

Got some LSD too, Class A I know but I'm not woried overworked police officers will care, and if they do the cost wouls sick trash for them, and I use it for therapy and mental health issues. hmm. no invites copers.

Note; Just got back from the shop and dude, I was having so many thought patterns I jump around the place like a asslym seeker in EU cpuntries. (are these attempted jokes banned? Soz if are pls no perma. Probably would want to be a comedian in the future yikes comedy so bland literally women comedians would just end up attacking each other and then jump on a political party.

I love women. I love men. I love all. LSD and cannabis let me see women as equals and against the bigger religions views etc. I used LSD to try treat my insomnia and mental conditions, it showed me something I couldn't describe, only at 50uq for me it was potent maybe im sensitive. I seem morphin which freaked me haha but next time maybe ill have more introspection before jumping for some xanax and burying my  head in my pillow like a huffy 8 year old trying to manage the terror this lsd can cause. Perception changes are fucking enormous people. I took weed and realised ""Comedians are usually sad I wonder what they do ! "" I searched Jum Carrey, and found Eckhart Tolle. I disagree that you can just be in the present moment like a choice, I think he is over optimistic in our ""pain bodies"" momentum it carries through the collective unconscious like that first time you fire your bay blade into that shitty pastic arena thing.

I'm not going to fix this post I'd usually just delete this shit now but hey may some Pepega autismo incel tragic son of a bitch like me will enjoy this sht. Also reading with weed might help. Lsd and reading is.... I wouldnt like to do it yet anyway. Lsd made me love everyone and further forgive women in my life who cause me pain like my mother and other relations. We are all one. Naw, Im no psychotic im just 3 days sleep deprived trying to extrapolate a shit tonne of ideas from my head and a general low self esteem in my writing pride because its anonymous anyway I'll just delete it if its faggy (no offense just the happy faggy as in, your a fag because ur not giving that old women your seat. Not the gay. Also I was probably internalised homophobic before lsd, but now im like who gives a shit 

Also that knife shit about going nuts thats no worry no call the popo if i was gonna kill someone id of killed my mother when i was 11/12. What the fuck must she have done to me, I remember the verbal, emotional, psychological abuse but to want kill her the damage she was doing to me might have been worse than some physical kinds.

Fuck her. But I forgive her. Her intention was never to harm me, psychopaths are very low percentage chance, and categorised as illness too and even psychopaths can restrain themselves just like a horny incel that wants to rape. Im not afraid to talk about this sht cus I talked to many mental health professional and the general concensus is 90% of people think completely fucked up things but, anyway, mr/mrs autismo that read this whole thing. 

If ur a  hot grill message me, I'm not going to get catfished im fairly paranoid and extensively edgy as it is, and tbh, if a girl added me on the internet I'd probably block them just like on league of legends because my mind and emotions goes fucking nuts. What to say? Am I being cool? Is she into me? Am I thinking to much? Yes, ok. Focus on breath. I'm cold. Oh dude if this girl is into me it be so hot. Shit im fantasing about a girl who just wants to playt a game with me im so fucking sick. She made a joke with a kiss mark, is she flirting? Do I make a move? Shit shit shit. Fuck this get blocked noob hehe i play teemo jungle next 20 games fucking reeeeeeee.

I'm ok lads. Ok that one really concerned person reading to see if I say something anymore fucked up, who do you think you are dealing with here? If you draw are on diaviant art or something i l ike that sht hit me up.

3 days Ive been up dude. Have to buy my own etizolam, will knock me out whenever I use it thankfully but without it its just awful. Being up for more than 3 days without sleep is a drunken, stumbling, slurring, brain farting, -20IQ, but I probably more chance of getting a grill like this than with 9000 hours sleep how sad. Talking about girls again fucking get out of me man I know ying and yang are cool and all but, shit man, evolution make it hard - literally - to not think about women when a depressed, alone, never gf, over school age, mentally ill, internet diagnoso autismato certified by Dr Nick!  Childless, relationshipless, my therapist says this is actually a good thing for me because id be taking on others problames but (fuck if reddit has a character counter im going to be pissed I dont want to edit this crap im spewing out intuitive Kappa all over the place.

So right, no gf or kids, die alone etc a lot of western scariest thing. But you know, with meditation and Buddhism (not stricktly tied to the institutional buddhism) you can find peace within yourself. I dont want to be 50 getting boners when I go outside to get a fucking apple. Jesus christ, it slike im 14, im on high dosage ssri paroxetine kills sex drive, still get fucking boners reeeeeee. cant fucking use them feelsbadman.

would you ever become gay in a situation like this just for comfort and sexual pleasures etc? Im like 97% straight just and prostate massage froma  cock would be nice based on my own experiment but the smell is not a fucking cinderalla or jasmine its a fucking gragas or santa after running around the world delivering presents when his dog with the red nose is sick. Women smell so nice, heres a spicy story. I was living in halls up at a close uni to mine, and everyone was out on break, so I got super horny tried to enter a girls room and holy sht... the door was open. I walk around hoping to find a nice dildo but I find out something disappointing, its  a pair of panties absolutely drenched in female pheremones. Fuck, im not gay. Gay would be so easier dude i hate women cus of my mom and sister. Trans is just like, its hot porn but , i mean yeah id like to do it irl if she is hot but.... Im not fucking C9 Sneaky that dude makes me uncomfortable he makes me question fucking eternity and space and everything when he dresses like a cute girl and I want to fucking judge him since i got bullied at school and my parents would judge me but damn id probably fuck him.

there it is, Like it may feel nice but the smell of guy, sweat, semen, dude, im a guy and that shit just aint pleasant or... sexually satisfying. 

Anyway insomnia fucks people up man. I see shadows at corners of eyes past 40 hours awake. I dont give a fuck about that shadow people sht its too drama and unstimulating for me. Ive seen fucking hallucinations. I downed this liquid once at a party at uni campus to impress a girl, no idea what was in it, fucking burned my nose drank 500 ml of spirit could have died but yolo haha xd. I spent time in college observing !alphas! and they just reckless smash shit up fucking retarded johnny bravo motherfuckers, Im more of a Tyler Durden myself. Watched that film on lsd the other day, it was great until I seen how it was basically Hollywood dictating what is really from fantasy, trying to pull you in, tell you what is real isnt, pulls you in again. fuck that shit man. 

That dude has insomnia in fight club. I love that sht. Its sort of an ego identity. Im meditating frequently when I can, obviously not right now shit went down at work didnt want to get pushed around like bullies did in high school fuck sake lose a job 10 years after high school still quit a damn good job, because of the kitchen staff were fucking amazing. The stories, the lifestyle, cant fucking remember their names on Facebook and my old phone broke with their numbers.... so mad. So what, I cant remember names, dont judge me. I dont know why i cant remember names. 

A name is like, identity. Human 1, Human 2. Mother, father. Baby, Adult. McDonalds, Burger King. Trump, one sec im gonna hit some weed not hit in like 9 hours dude./ Nah im not taking a hit yet, want to wait till im queuing  up in league with my teemo jungle sheeeet weed dude hahah so cool ahaha. Actually only tried at 25, after everything else failed. and it showed me the spiritual side of life with its perception changes. It fucking saved my life. I fucks with me,.. She, fucks with me. The downs, the paranoids, the anxiety, the weed hangovers, but damn. So what if people become lazy stoners and sit around... guess what, they wont. Sitting around is fucking BORING. As a depressed medically sick note autismo gibs not having my job anymore at kfc sucks ass. I miss it, but I dont miss any sort of letting some bitches and wanks verbally rub their nutsack on my face just to keep happy a bit. I need to find their names dude and get some one on one, the stories of others, not just boring college people. all the same shit, REAL people living at 48 working at fucking kfc in the kitchen. Now thats the guy I want to talk to.

Women. If my dick never got hard for women, I'd probably like less of them. fair statement, would go both ways. I like their... emotions, fuck its hard to differentiate when your dick in your brain spazies out when you try think about a girl man im fucking neutring you dude nah im not chill my .... no, racism is... it can be funny if it isnt bullying, like joking amongst buddies. Taking the shit outta each other. Im watching some korean lol streamer called Rush, and he keeps calling americans fatty burger faces. Now thats funny, im uk and im shit teeth yellow and drink tea, but from scotland too so im a ginger FREEEEEEEEDDOOOOMMMMM  intoxicated drunk Irish singing partners grandad. 

But women,, fuckkk. Guys are funnier dude, I laugh and joke so make dudes. Some women are out of this word funny, but they aint the comedians on tv they are real life Holemies. I added the girl my sister works with right, if thats you then go ahead message me btch but Im not going long term I do not believe in it humans are fleeting energy dancing between chaos and order and chaos and order cannot fucking stay together especially my parents man.

I cant even remember them fighting but im so sure i used to cover my ears with my pillow to hear them stfu. I told my dad about my mums over abusive behaviour, he says stuff like western daddy dad, chin up, look after your mum she doesnt mean it, sticks and stones (I want to puke at that sht, id rather get my arm broken than this suffering of my soul if feels like im not alive or dead but again in the middle, suborbatory or some sht whatever that christmas thing is.

I want some homies to talk to, and hollies. Im white so i dont get black culture too much i dont listen to rap music except nicki minaj she is best rapper. Anyway, Queen were a great band but Coldplay I fucking loved dude. Their first album, sends me away from my pains and merges with the pain of everyone feeling the same frequency of pain and says ""its ok to feel this, we are here together, you are not alone, you can calm down your nervous system"" where as my body now is like fuck you this is my nervous system bitch overclock this son of a gun lets go fucking nuts.

Ofc this is the id that Frued refers to in his psychotherapy works, the id, subconscious and conscious.

My central nervous system is like... fried man. Fucking might as well be a chicken at least id be tastier. Like wtf man i have to take an ssri, a newly invented drug to not kill myself? What would I have done 100 years ago? Fucking, I'd probably have killed myself or alcoholic. My mums Dad was alcoholic, died from liver alcohol damage. My mums brother was a heroin addict, died 6 months after his mum died (my mums mum, my gran, blood relative). My poor mum. My poor uncle. Heroin man, he got into weed at 12 and then into heroin just naw fuck society. I'm on a razors edge between the same fate. Tried Codeine I hate that warm euphorice hazy sht it reminds me of Breaking Bad scene floating and sht and hell naw I prefer benzos but that sht meant to be worse than heroin withdrawal. going to get off them soon when I get back into meditation.

I tried self medicating in Novermber after I asked a Psychiatrist twice for help, twice 2 years ago, plenty of GPs. I respect benzos are dangerous, I havent withdrawn from any yet just some etizolam and vals to help that rollercoaster of xanax (never used) style ups and downs with th short half life.

Met a guy on the bus the day before I quit KFC. was going to hospital with 30 vals for her. He said ""I bet you think im just some annoying cunt hurry the fk up and stfu get out my way"". I looked him dead in the eye (I was on a bit of Etiz tbh so that helped me not freak out) and said ""I see everyone as the same"". His face paused, eyes locked on me, expressionless. I wonder if anyone had ever told this man he is loved. He looked fucked up by drugs. Ive stopped teh description cus as I said internet is  aplace of everyone and maybe drug kings reading this sht like yeah boy i got a new homie to smack up, so hell naw I want to work for Jessie Pinkman tho that crew was sound (Glasgowegian term: Sound = cool = No problemo = Love thy neighbour). Id watch that show again just the drama is fucking booorrrinnggg second time walters wife and my hatred for women man fuck me it gets toastie in my nervous system it wants to fucking flying of the face of the earth to fucking Neptune to cool down a bit. Dude im pretty sober now, this is just insomnia and my autismo mind. Im sorta high IQ, my mom says im pretty. My dad says im smart. My friend says im funny. Some girl says im so big, girls, thats a compliment we want to here man our fucking chimp brain implodes and we feel like Zues pounding the mother earth (my greek mythology sucks sorry if it sucks reference).

I'd like to hug a girl, sure whatever sex is great but not without complications, id like to share silently, explore, meditate, just fucking be without wanting something all the timee. But where are these girls, and where the fuck is my self-esteem dude gimmie dat back dats mine bro. I feel my mom took my self-esteem, crushed my soul with her black heart and death vibes with her postnatal depression, furthter depression, chronic anxiety and just taking that shit out on your kids is shit. 

I got into trouble at school a lot, wait sht, talk about women again. boobs are nice, bagina is nice, butt nice, leg, feet, hand, neck, head, hair, only bit  women i dont like i probably her poops and her brain. But thats not fair just a quick joke man, shes a man-eater look out boy here she comes. What the fuck did she do to me. I've always been shy, sensitive I think, but, just, crushed in confidence. I loved my dad so much I didnt want anything in my life to harm him. My mum..... she told me she bottle fed me cus breast feeding too sore, dont know significance but I understand. Again I forgive my mother for everything her childhood sounds shit, alcholic dad never home, emotionally abusive mom with .. having a fag lads. Dont smoke just during high stress cus i dont get addicted and confident i can quit, quit job at kfc cus bully managers, girls im a steal come get me. Actually dont im scared of you all i know the potential for girls to get into my emotional ""heart"" and wreck it ralph for funsies, well not funsies its fantasy acted out in reality unfortunately of suffering. 

Dude ive had dreams of cutting dead bodies up for art like on Dexter, necrophelia, stupid fucking freudian big fucking black trains cus i went on 4chan al last summer and always blacked pictures fuck that site its funny tho seen a random soldier steal a tank like on gta never for reported to national news dont think but was unreal. he was drunk he was just trollin bro, lighten up usa. fucking, soldiers. I wont say much. I dont know if the deep cia etc really care about da normie or da autismo internetster or just care about his/her paycheck cocaine and probably lighting up a jay. I mean how can a deep state person start a family, its suicicde dude. We all the same family. if earth blows up, we reconnect with the univerese. the tragedy of self-conscoius life ends. something else happens.

If I have a family holy shit id love my kids so much it would hurt me, i might e ven suduko cus of current mental illness in future relapse, or wife is like my mom in which case i fucking take several lines of cocaine, go strippers, shit what else you do in gta, fucking dirt bike to top of mountain and jump off and glide, steal a plane with a horse with no name and 9/11 into home street to say what up to my mates.

See I fucking, well, i didtched all my homies i grew up with. most of them got into hard drugs, my best mate is now blind, blinded by his gf smacking him with a phone into a coma. i fucking seen him in the indian shop the other day, i was in there with him. he didnt know i was there. I didnt talk to him. That cunt bullied the shit out of me when younger, maybe my mum fucked up but this guy took out my butt plug and shoved it somwhere nasty like... clintons pussie? yikes. dude politics is fucking something man, this timeline, putin, trump, brexit, shit is suck tho so much suffering.

so

so much.

If I talk shit for 28000 words then come to this realisation then its worth to me man, its a shit truth tho. life is suffering.

#on lsd, i felt for 30 mins at the peak of the trip in a place of no where. i didnt feel anything inside me, no soul etc.

~I was like ""go get some water"" and then the body was like ""why dude"" and so I just stood bent over in one position for 30 mins my legs in pain but again my brain say ""im in pain bro quick gimme some luba luba from yo moma"" but  I just accepted it and stayed silent, still, present, eckhart tolle id take his dick. buddhas too i tihnk althought probably lot of shit going on in tibet with gangs and that sht he has to support or help  i dont know.

hey cia, mk ultra only read a little bit but you wanted to use them on soldiers in war like nam? cod world at war/black ops 1 story was fucking cool man mason the numbers reminded of mk ultra like shit. good story line. Im mentally ill so I could be getting sent 5g signals to fuck me up oh shit dont say it noo immmmmm gooinnggggggggg.......







hitler? why are you in heaven? Like dude I know you had mother issues like me, you wanted to be artist and you werent good enoughs o shit dude, i seen ur paintings and they were good i thought, keep your head up. I know your dead and shit but we are all fucking one. Im no nazi, no isis, no  anarchist,  shit what am I. Awakened? Spiritually? Do girls dig that sht? Its a pretty painful experience like it aint pretty realising time is eternity and always now and everything else in mind is an illusion, perhaps consciousness itself. I mean as long as I get sex tho right. High give my bros...

chap ... chap ...

Are you Mr Blue? 

why yes and you are?

Im mr going to round house kick you into your mirror cus you knocked my daughter up.

wel sheet the condom just kill it man its no fun get abortion.

Is abortion bad though, like really. I dont think so. I kill life everyday by being alive. organisms die in my bodies defence. whatever idc.

Suicide though, like what the fuck. I mean im doing alright just now i suppose, cant complain (3000 word complaint btw)said to my therapist suicide should be allowed, its not fair on the patient.Why do people have to stay alive, there is nothing in meditation or in the state i felt in lsd that said life is a must. On that LSD dude, I tried to move but either my mind said or I realised ""I dont have to mve"" but I was like dude lets go lets take a piss man and my conscoiusness was like like ""no, you watch this, shut up, learn, just, be"".

So I did that and I grew from it. being in pain and being alright? Pain an illusion? So many less medications. I want my brain back dude. Most people I was competing with in my classes went on to get degrees and are doctors, laywers, sceintists and Im fucking, worked in mcdonalds could keep it down, kfc twice nope, deliver china man food nope, help old women with their shits and food no that was too hard but most rewarding. cex was alright just bully manager was a bint although, w.e. I want to play teemo jungle man. I want to level 2/3/4 gank all lanes with red buff and smite, spam laugh, raise emote and mastery.

I also want to say.Space. Everything. Emotions. People. Just breathe.. All we know for sure is our most ancient know and this is of breath, maybe. shit i need some meds or somethin getting bit dizzy. sht what is it.diazepam i think just 5mg should do.its only 10am//// what the fuck. I mean ill take 5mg of valium sure but kinda sucks seems like a sorta intense w.d.

Pregabalin was interesting, good and bad. good it fucking works mate if you like Phenibut then this will give you some extra resilience that according to Jordan Peterson you would have if you didnt get shat on your whole like mentally. Mums job to raise childs mental. She should of protected me ebtter. Now I play childrens video game, over 6660 hours. 900$ down. free game, how did fiddle even lose. WTF is the toxicity in this game im feeling anxious, I used like 3mg etizolam like 10 hours ago so hey its probably that, i take so valium or some etiz or that drug clonazepam i got to stop spasms in my sleep. 

Dude meditation when you get into it is better than any drug. Its just getting past the point of using drugs to get by man.      Fucking vision if fucking up man like i close my eyes open then room spins. Alcohol does that, maybe gaba drug, prob etiz couple hours to go for pregabalin, shit this sucks.

dude i better not be illt or  osme sht.

i feel like sht, but since that lsd i well...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, im fucking nodding dude. i had 3 cups coffe 2 modafinil.

Microtransactions and loots, fucking dlcs, season passes, give me a full fucking game like I used to get with the customisation built in and not all about graphics ok man? GTA4 story was great and the airport was so much fun on multiplayer, I watched DansGaming and Forsen on twitch.tv play gta4 again and as an adult and like 10 years old that sht was still releveant and entertaining as fk.

Yeh, that shit, bright lights sucked and headache.

Auto women are becoming a thing, they have to be banned, absolutely. Im fucking mi5.mi6 and my population dont need the drama and mindless stress and pain that keeps them confused and wagecucking to pay for the worlds shitty karma.

On that, what the fuck are we all thinking. Immigration at level never seen. Total culture shift in 1 generation. Once white dudes stop going to football and get all tribal on peoples ass theres gonna be gangs popping up. I mean there already is drugs gangs from asia and rape/child sht from middle east north africa right? I dont know what to say about that.

Dude insomnia is a killer illness literally. Look at my delerium, well most just excess mumbling autismo (no sure reddit is ok with calling anything stupid anything other than ""stupid"" which is double standard, stupid people arent stupid by choice, its discriminatory and we have a duty to look after stupid people). Some people think of masterrace of high IQ, I mean like, skt want 5 fakers, argentina want 11 messies even in goal that dude run up the post overhead kick from the bar to save penalty.

I said i took 5mg valium right?hmm. I have been up for 3 days, typing like a true autismo right now. My mom even asked if I thought I might be autstic last year, I mean I understand her concern, but that fact she caused the majority of my psychological damage, well her, Chris, Dad wasn't perfect he got scary and sectarian and I want to see him actually, need to get my benzo right can be having fucking shitty lsd trip at 10am 8-9 hours after dropping about 4 mg etizolam, kindling perhaps.

Phenibut is suchan awesome substance, Phenibut, Caffeine, (no order) Modafinil, and Pregabalin dude. I was meditating (just breath concentration focus  meditation on breath no gomba stomp awoooa throat swallowing shit and while I noticed little to no changes over the month, when I stopped, dude I fucking felt psychotic the thoughts just coming in like whot he fuk you think you are my mother? who didnt respect my personal boundaries as a child treating me as a secondary human being rather than an actual person. Fuck man. Life. Its not her fault. She had her own trauma. Now her son is using benzos to try fucking manage mama mia!

Anyway pregs was good to 450mg for a few weeks when i was meditation, my back started to like give up in strength and my body jolted away, this was super intrusive to my meditation and triggered me. I wanted to get back down to 300mg or 150mg but as soon as I started dropping the dosage my sleep went to shit and I already had insomniai so that was fucking fun jesus. Got etiz to make sure, twice a week , i can get some fucking sleep fo im not up for 80 hours working 3./4 shifts. Alas, feel kinda memory fucked after etiz and foggy, might be better just stayin up. Phenibut, coffee, modafinil, paracetamol, ibuprofen, propranolol. Great kit for you to have to do stuff when you get no sleep. Also working twice a week, Phenibut gains no tolerance used twice a week and no more vast majority of people. So you take that befoer you sleep and you wake up ready to go to work regardless of shit mood and sleep.

I’ve tried every breathing exercise on the planet, drunk gallons of chamomile tea, taken a million “relaxing” showers, the usual basic shit. If my body decides it’s not going to sleep, there’s nothing I can do. The only thing that has ever worked is sometimes I get so upset that I cry so hard that I throw up and then after that sometimes I can get an hour of sleep. But lately I can’t even cry, I just lie motionless for eight hours until it’s time to screw up another day.

Part of my job sometimes involves scuba diving, usually early in the morning. So I can’t use sleep drugs or alcohol to make me sleep, or hit myself in the head with a cast iron pan (if I could I’d probably be an alcoholic by now). I don’t know what to do.

2923,"I'm so /tired/ of Insomnia Get it? *Tired* of Insomnia... ayyyy

But that's the thing though isn't it, I'm *not* tired. Not at all. I'm pretty sure I could go days without feeling sleepy if I let myself. 

I first had trouble sleeping when I was a tween. I was showing signs of aggressions and was starting to get lower grades in schools so my parents took me to a doctor who (after a few tests and scans) discovered I hadn't been falling into deep sleep / getting any REM sleep for a *long* time. It was resolved easily enough when I just stopped drinking any caffeine at all and went on medication for ADHD, Anxiety, and Depression (all of which I was diagnosed with as well at that time), but the doctors said I'd have still some brain damage because of it (which is extra great considering I already had that from a head injury year prior).

As a teen I actually hardly ever had a problem falling asleep, no more than the average person at least, but I would still choose (like the dumbass I was) to only get a few hours of sleep a night. I didn't realize how lucky I was to even have the choice.

It wasn't until I got into college that it really got bad. My anxiety spiked my freshman year which made it really hard to fall asleep. I figured I'd try to take melatonin, but, of course, after only a few days of taking it every night I became dependent on it so I'd need to take more and more to feel anything. I remember there were times that I could have gone days not feeling tired or sleeping if I let myself. After fainting in my dorm in the Spring, my roommate convinced me to see the on campus doctor. To be honest I hardly remember the appointment I was so out of my mind, I just remember her basically telling me what I already knew and offering to give me muscle relaxers and me denying it. However, one thing good did come out the appointment. After that appointment, I ended up skipping my classes for the day and just going home and I got the *best* four hours of straight sleep I'd gotten in months. After that I was finally able to start sleeping again. Until last semester that is.

Last semester was likely my worst semester health wise. I was having a lot of physical problems as well as mental and it eventually lead up to insomnia again. I would wake up every few hours with feelings of guilt and stress and self-loathing and spend another few hours getting myself to fall asleep again. My psychiatrist eventually prescribed me Trazodone which REALLY helped oh my god it was like a miracle drug... until I tried to go off it.

I started having the same issue I had with melatonin, needing to keep taking more to feel sleepy. My anxiety has gone down quite a bit this semester so I figured it wouldn't hurt to see how I went without the medication for a while. Oh boy did I realize what a world of hurt I was in. I do not feel sleepy AT ALL and I've only been sleeping for an hour or two at a time for weeks. I've started to write it all down in a journal and I get, on average, 6 hours of sleep a week, occasionally I'll even get a dream. Even now when I've resorted to taking benadryl and even melatonin (which I *had* sworn off after last year's predicament), I only feel delirious and loopy, not sleepy. I've started to develop eczema and my hair is falling out so this morning I decided f\*ck it I'm going to the pharmacy to pick up my trazodone refill and I'll try to slowly edge my way off of it because obviously going cold turkey isn't working.

Anyway, most people on this subreddit have super similar stories so it's not like this is anything special. I'm very sure I'll be fine eventually. I'm really just damn frustrated that this keeps happening, and I'm sure it'll happen again.

Thanks for coming to my Ted Talk.

**BACKGROUND:**  I'm a 30 year old, bodybuilder, never had problems with sleep outside of NOT being sleepy at the right times and being an occasional night owl. Long story short, did a huge diet switch to keto (which, due to the lack of carbs, causes a large reduction in water weight, and a huge loss in minerals), and eliminated pretty much all vegetables. I went mostly carnivore and planned to slowly introduce foods back in to experiment and see if I had any food intolerances. At the time I had no idea how important electrolyte balance was and wasn't focusing on them. Ultimately I became severely magnesium deficient to the point of developing heart palpitations, unexplained irritability, and severe muscle cramps. At the time, I wasn't working and ostensibly had no major stresses in my life. I saved up a ton of money in my graphic design job in the previous year and was essentially ""coasting"" after being laid off to focus on myself and rebalance mentally. Ironically enough...it lead to the darkest, most traumatic experience I've had thus far in my life (more on this later).

My big mistake was underestimating the stresses I was putting my body through. For starters, the ketogenic metabolic change is a HUGE stress. Imagine eating the standard American diet (high carb) for 30 years and suddenly stopping... Now, I don't wanna get into the science because there are plenty of resources detailing this already, but a massive metabolic shift occurs when switching to low carb, which depletes a lot of minerals and can cause you to feel awful for a few weeks. It's called the ""keto flu"" and is extremely common with first-time keto dieters. I went through this, but on top of that, I kept up with my heavy workout regiment. This was borderline overtraining. The kicker is this: a lifetime of playing high-stress competitive games, working out all my adult life, and barely eating magnesium-rich foods meant I was already low magnesium, but the recent keto change seemed to be the final nail in the coffin that pushed me into severe deficiency and caused more serious symptoms. 

This eventually triggered a panic attack that came out of nowhere. My guess is that the heart palpitations (which I had for about 3-4 weeks) constantly worried me and eventually triggered panic attack symptoms. Normally I'm emotionally resilient, and very stoic. I've had short bouts of depression through most of my adult life, but nothing I'd called ""clinical"". other than that I've had no mental health issues, no anxiety, nothing. And yet somehow...a panic attack snuck up on me. This is when I learned how important minerals were. When it came, I thought I was having a heart attack and that I was going to die, so it was traumatic. Went to the ER, did an overnight stay, and the typical panic attack rigamaroo where you think you're dying but the doctors say you're 100% fine and that it's all in your head. At the time I resented that, but when I got home, after the doctors found nothing, I started having panic and anxiety symptoms at home, and after a few hours of research, I realized, shit, this is actually a thing. My personality went from masculine, sarcastic, and stoic, to fearful, panicky, constantly ruminating in negative thoughts, worried, needy, emotional, etc. Absolutely NO LIBIDO, NO HUNGER, just constant fear and being way too deep in my own head to enjoy anything. That entire first week was nothing more than severe chronic anxiety. I mean, SEVERE....I was in fight-or-flight from the moment I woke up, 'til the time I fell asleep. The entire week I was getting horrible sleep 1-2 hours at best, then waking up from shortness of breath and elevated heart rates. My heart would start racing every time I went to sleep, or even thought about sleep, and this eventually developed into a form of sleep anxiety where my brain learned to associate sleep with fear.

This is when the real problems started. A full week later, after a week of awful sleep, I was severely deprived, so I attempted to go to sleep, and for 16 hours straight, the same thing kept happening. I'd lay down, heart would start racing, body would go into full panic and fight-or-flight, and I'd be wide awake from the stress hormones, and eventually calm down 15-20 minutes later to be SEVERELY EXHAUSTED, rinse and repeat. This has never happened to me before, and I legitimately thought my brain was broken. I couldn't fall asleep for the life of me. Even lying in bed for 2-3 hours straight, perfectly still, my brain just couldn't shut off. This is when I found out what ACTUAL insomnia was. I desperately wanted sleep more than anything, but couldn't get there no matter how hard I tried, and the worse it became, the more nervousness and anxiety I built up around it...which of course works against you. I used to think I was an insomniac when I stayed up all night playing video games 'til 6am and had to wake at 8am, but NOPE, not even close... now I knew what real insomnia was. The 16 hours ATTEMPTING to sleep eventually drove me crazy, and sent my panic and anxiety into overdrive. I ended up calling 911 begging and pleading with them to find a way to put me to sleep. 

If you told me two weeks prior that I'd be pacing back and forth, sleep deprived, panic-ridden, talking to myself, ruminating, catastrophizing, and slowly becoming suicidal, I would have laughed in your face, yet that's exactly what happened. This taught me that ANYONE could become ""crazy"" under the right circumstances. I was eventually released from the hospital with a trazodone prescription the next morning around 8am (been up for roughly 40 hours now) and eventually ended up passing out around 12pm for about 1-2 hours of awful sleep.

The trauma of everything spiraled into insomnia and severe sleep anxiety for the next few weeks. I lived my life in 30 to 40 hour panic-ridden ""phases"" with maybe 2-3 hours of sleep in between for the entire first week. It was awful. At the same time I decided I needed to beat this, despite feeling like total shit, panicky, fearful, etc. I had enough presence of mind to go on a strict protocol to fix everything and return back to normal ASAP. Below is what worked for me.  


**HOW I GOT BACK TO NORMALCY FAIRLY QUICKLY:** 

**NOTE:** The panic attacked happened December 21st, second ER visit with the insomnia freakout was December 28th and today is January 20th, so it's about a full month later. Chronic anxiety, heart palpitations, and insomnia are pretty much gone. I'm sleeping every night for 5-7 hours, which compared to before is amazing. Even bad sleep is better than no sleep. My life is mostly back to normal and I can function and do my daily activities fine, and after 3 weeks, I can actually laugh again and enjoy life. WOW. It's still a bit fresh so it can still take me up to 2 hours to fall asleep at times, but I eventually always pass out, so I no longer worry about it. I've made big changes however and I'll detail them below.

**1. It is absolutely crucial to make sure your magnesium intake is very high.** If you have anxiety, your appetite probably isn't the greatest, and even if you're eating a healthy diet, you're likely to be magnesium deficient simply due to soil depletion and the fact that none of us really know if our foods are growing in mineral-rich soils. This is why I highly recommend supplementation of this crucial mineral. I use 'Natural Calm', and take 300-600mg daily. Why so much? Because I'm also a bodybuilder and am using what you'd call a ""therapeutic"" dose to recover from the traumatic panic/anxiety episode a few weeks ago caused by a severe deficiency, and many expert think the USDA RDA of 400mg is way too low, ESPECIALLY if you're going through a high stress period. This helped TREMENDOUSLY the first two weeks. You literally can feel a calming sensation take over you, and your thoughts become ""lighter"". Magnesium pushes calcium out of cells and nerve tissue so you're less reactive to stimuli, if that makes sense. The biochemistry is explained, but there's no real way to explain it to most people other than it feels like magic and takes effect very quickly. It felt like my body was so starved for this nutrient that it gobbled it up and put it to work immediately. My palpitations disappeared in a day after I started supplementation. It took a bit longer for everything else (because it's also partly psychological) but it helped tremendously with being clear minded enough to take a more objective look at the anxiety and insomnia.  


Go on Amazon and look at the countless reviews for the various magnesium products and you'll see thousands of people raving about magnesium's positive effect on their mood,  insomnia and anxiety. If you can't supplement, add a few mag-rich foods to your diet. These include bananas, avocados, dark leafy greens, nuts, seeds, spinach, etc.   


There's boatloads of clinical and anecdotal evidence out there on the associations between magnesium deficiency (which is extremely common) and stress, anxiety, insomnia, sleeplessness, irritability, etc. so don't overlook this mineral when you're having these symptoms. There are numerous lectures, articles, interviews, and talks as well. Hit up YouTube, and do some searching. If you want a comprehensive overview, I'd start with Dr. Carolyn Dean; a well renowned and highly sought after expert on magnesium. Magnesium Deficiency 101 - Dr. Carolyn Dean: [https://youtu.be/3td7\_91UwrU](https://youtu.be/3td7_91UwrU)

&#x200B;

**2. Force yourself to eat at the same times ""daily""** (obviously you're living your days in phases with insomnia, hence the quotes, but try to eat regularly) and try to go to sleep around the same times daily. Absolutely no stimulants for obvious reasons. Yes, you'll be tired, you'll have brain fog, you'll be hallucinating, and getting through the day will be rough, to say the least, but you'll be ruling out any deficiencies, as well as working on your circadian rhythm so that you naturally get tired around the same time daily. With constant eating of nutritional meals, you'll be setting a good nutritional base for your body to produce what it needs to produce in order to relax and eventually fall asleep. Do not trust your hunger because it's impaired right now. You NEED FOOD. Do not allow yourself to degenerate any further nutritionally. You will NOT be hungry, but you can chew and swallow, and as long as you can do that, you can't give up on yourself.   


Also, note that ""relaxing"" isn't just an automatic thing, or a ""lack of"" action. You will need to feed your body the right foods so that neutrotransmitters, and various cofactors involved in the parasympathetic nervous system can become active and in balance with your sympathetic nervous system again so you can rest peacefully and get further and further away from the anxious states. 

&#x200B;

**3. Do all the generic sleep hygiene stuff;** switch devices to yellow light, only go to bed when you're tired so your brain associates sleep with your mattress, restrict your sleep to specific hours, don't obsess about the time or obsessively track hours slept, make sure your room temperature is comfortable, etc. I don't need to expand on this because it's repeated ad nauseum here, but the goal is to stack every possible card in your favor so you can wind down and fall asleep.

&#x200B;

**4. THIS IS VITAL. Do not convince yourself that you have ""insomnia""** or go into bed thinking you're going to have trouble sleeping. Even if you've been professionally diagnosed. Doctors don't care about you the same way you care about yourself, so keep this in mind. You're one of many patients to them so you need to take control of your own health, and sometimes that means completely rejecting their advice and diagnoses. You need to tell yourself that you're simply going through a rough period and sleep might be difficult, but you're fine. I can't stress how important it is to psychologically believe that things are fine and/or will get better. A major component of insomnia for people who suffer from anxiety is the very anxiety around not being able to sleep. The anxiety compounds the issue and it thus becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. It's one of the many cases in humans where if you believe it's a problem, it WILL be a problem. 

You need to find a way to, over time, decouple the association between sleep and whatever negative delusional spin you're putting on it. Do not predict the future with false and irrelevant evidence from the past. A bad night of sleep, or no sleep the day before does not mean it's going to repeat in the future. This is highly ILLOGICAL, but your brain won't care about this, it will force those thoughts on you. Be aware of your own cognitive behaviors and beat them out with clear, logical thinking. Obviously, this will be difficult since emotional states cause us to think delusionally, and insomnia along with the accompanying sleep deprivation will make it worse, but the big takeaway is to realize that you can't really trust your brain at this time because it isn't functioning properly and is under a lot of stress. This process can take time, be patient with yourself, especially if you think nutrition might be a factor. It's vitally important to remember that YOU CAN FALL ASLEEP. EVERY HUMAN HAS THIS ABILITY unless you have extremely rare genetic disorders or severe nutritional deficiencies that can EASILY be corrected.

You need to realize that it's ENTIRELY NORMAL to have problems falling asleep for days, weeks or even months at a time. Your case is likely NOT UNIQUE, and many millions of people over millenia have suffered and successfully recovered from this disturbance. It is scary because it is happening to YOU, but take comfort in the fact that it is also common and treatable. This is not blind hope, or lying to yourself, these are FACTS THAT YOU NEED TO CONSTANTLY REMIND YOURSELF OF because your brain will already be doing a great job of bringing you down with negative thoughts. You must truly believe that you're going to get better and fix the problem, while taking every possible step you can to move the dial in the right direction towards progress. 

Take comfort in the fact that many people have sleepless periods like this for various reasons. Stress, nutritional deficiencies, terrible diets, anxiety, grieving, depression, breakups, divorces, etc. It's crucial to remember that all psychological stresses will diminish over time and you will return to normalcy. Your brain is constantly adjusting towards homeostasis, so YOU WILL HEAL IN TIME. YOU MUST KNOW THIS. Don't get obsessive over how long your recovery is taking, or set arbitrary goalposts (e.i. ""I should be fine in a week""). Take things one day at a time. 

Also be aware that stress depletes magnesium, which is responsible for reining in ruminating thoughts and relaxing you. Again, I urge anyone with insomnia and/or anxiety to do ample research on magnesium. It is absolutely a life safer. Here's a really good video emphasizing some of the points made above: [https://youtu.be/ZGFVxQiLH8k](https://youtu.be/ZGFVxQiLH8k)

&#x200B;

**5. Last part is to remember that falling asleep is an automatic and passive act.** You can't force it. This is the biggest mistake I made when I first encountered insomnia. You need to simply achieve a relaxed state while drowsy, and your brain will do the rest. Think back on previous times you fell asleep and note how you didn't do anything special. You closed your eyes, perhaps started thinking about the day or fantasizing, and eventually fade out. I had the biggest trouble with this for what seemed like an eternity, but eventually learned to simply stop worrying about getting sleep. Close your eyes, relax, let your thoughts wander to daily stuff; sex, work, social interactions, family, future plans, women, men, wherever your natural fantasies lie, and it eventually happens...you wake up, and the next thing you know it's a couple of hours later. 

&#x200B;

**IN CLOSING** I know this is difficult, and this is probably oversimplified, but it's important to not get frustrated if you don't get instant results. You will get better a little bit at a time. If you slept fine in the past, there's absolutely no reason to believe that you won't sleep fine in the future. There's a reason why cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia is so effective, because truly, for many of us, it's in our own heads. The human brain is an amazingly powerful and complex organ, and its power is such that it is also amazing at self sabotage. Keep this in mind when dealing with negative thoughts. I've also found it helpful to not AVOID negative thoughts. Write them out and or follow them through to their endings in your head. At times you realize how hilariously delusional many of your thoughts are, and how unrealistic they are. If you can find humor in them, the fear lessens, and they end up as ""processed"" thoughts. That thought can no longer bother you. Hence why facing your fears and confronting your negative thoughts works so well, because, in truth, the vast majority of our worst fears **NEVER COME TRUE**. At the same time, it's important not to over obsess and be in your head all the time. DO seek out distractions and ways to get your mind off your issues, but not to the point of total and complete avoidance, as avoidance reinforces fears.

2962,"Incurable insomnia Ok, this is probably gonna be a long post but I'll try to keep it as short as possible.

Anyway, in October 2015 I suddenly (almost overnight) developed an insomnia. Well, I like to call it «non restorative sleep» rather than insomnia because most of the time I can fall asleep in moderate amount of time, not real quick, but it doesn't take long either. The problem is that most of the time I do sleep at least 6 to 8 full hours, but in the morning it is nearly impossible to wake up to the point where I try to come up with a reason to not go to work at all costs, but then I get out of bet in the last 15 minutes, brush my teeth, take a quick shower and go to work. Every single morning it feels like I've slept for an hour. The sleep is just totally unrefreshing.

I've tried lots of medications, including zolpidem, zopiclone, alprazolam, bromazepam, quetiapine, mirtazapine, trazodone, chlorprothixene, amitriptyline, gabapentin, vortioxetine, agomelatine, phenibut, buspirone, melatonin, even marijuana. Probably some more which I can't remember. Even quite large doses and/or mixing drugs doesn't help. If I take 200mg of quetiapine (Seroquel) + 10mg of zolpidem (Ambien) or 1mg of alprazolam (Xanax) + 7.5mg of mirtazapine (Remeron), it knocks me out insanely fast, but the feeling in the morning as if I had slept just for a brief moment is still there. Nothing, literally nothing helps. I was even prescribed 50mg of agomelatine although the maximum dose is just 25mg. No effects or side effects. I was prescribed 200mg of gabapentin, took 600mg and it's the same — no effect whatsoever. The drugs which help at least a small amount are alprazolam and zolpidem. When I take those I wake up slightly more refreshed. Everything else is useless.

I tried mindfulness meditation, cognitive-bihavioral therapy, I did blood tests for stuff that can affect sleep, my blood pressure, blood tests and general health are almost excellent. I've tried herbal medicine and various teas. I've changed 6 psychiatrists and everyone of them just prescribes different drugs that don't do shit while charging insane amounts of cash. I don't know what to do.

The important thing is... I do have a 12 year long history of major depressive disorder. But it has never interfered with my sleep before October 2015. I don't even feel \*that\* depressed. What I do have, though, are intrusive thoughts. I worry about everything and almost every night I dream of usual day to day things (about my car breaking down, about some work issues etc., just the usual stuff, no nightmares).

The fuck is wrong with me? Is anyone else in the same boat? It's a nightmare to live like that every single day, my cognitive and motor skills are quite impaired, the fatigue is unbearable and just a general feeling of tiredness is always there."

I'll wake up hours later with the notification ""Missed alarm"" every single morning. I literally have to get dragged out of my bed every morning just to wake up. My mom constantly tells me to sleep earlier since I can't get up. Every time I try to sleep early (I mean like 14 hours before I wake up, which I can never do since I'm only capable of sleeping if I'm actually tired, so I only sleep early if I'm sleep deprived or had a tiring day. Seriously, I sit in bed for straight hours at a time and get no closer to sleeping. I've given up at this point.) I constantly wake up in the middle of the night, and sometimes I can't fall back asleep.

I also shared a room with my brother. He kept telling me that I would stop breathing while I was sleeping occasionally, and I've heard from others that I snore very loudly. I'm guessing sleep apnea but I don't know.

I usually become very sleep deprived to the point to which I’ll sleep for a very large amount of time 10-12 hours as all the lost sleep catches up to me. Being sleep deprived is just normal to me now I’m used to it, although it definitely is affecting my motivation for college and being social. I’m pretty introverted so socialising with friends and sometimes family can be hard when sleep deprived most of the time. I have tried to use substances such as weed and alcohol to sleep but it is never really effective. I would try sleep medication but I would be taking them everyday and idk about that. Ive just decided to embrace it I thought I’d just vent a little to some people that probably understand.

2977,"Anyone else suffer night terrors when you manage to fall asleep? It's been about 10 minutes since I woke up and i can only remember a dog, a big house, and background TV, but I know I was terrified and my best friend woke me up (in the dream). I texted her thanking her but I can't recall how she brought me back anymore. My upstairs (duplex) neighbor had also texted me asking if I was ok because I was screaming. All I remember was being in a big house and not being able to use my arms or legs, I sort of just flopped from a couch to a floor and was terrified that I couldn't call for help. I did use booze to get to sleep because I haven't had a good rest in days and I know it exacerbated the terror. It's like give in and use substances or sleep for a half hour at most, I chose wrong tonight."
2978,Bliss The past 3 days I haven’t slept one bit and today I slept for 10 hours ! I woke up feeling so good . Crazy how people can sleep normally everyday 
2979,"What’s your sleep like,let’s exchange story to feel better I am getting a average for 5 hour of sleep for the past three weeks.I have been insomnic since September 2018,how is your sleep like?What can we do about it?
I just pooped in a 7.5mg midazolam and still couldn’t sleep"
2980,"self-experimenting with approaches inspired from scholarly articles - for hot / maintenance sleepers My searches frequently yield articles suggesting that select manipulation of skin temperature can improve sleep in a myriad of ways. I've tried to reconcile some of these and frankenstein together a strategy with which to experiment. I'll share a few noteworthy links and what I've tried so far.

I've poured over Skin Deep from top to bottom, as it's filled with interesting bits. Concludes that ""*In young and older subjects without sleep complaints, proximal warming resulted in deeper sleep and suppressed wakefulness, whereas distal skin warming enhanced REM sleep and suppressed light sleep*"" - proximal being trunk and limbs (legs, arms, torso), distal being hands and feet. Also, ""*Of note, the sleep-enhancing effects of slight warming cannot simply be attributed to changes in comfort, since we previously demonstrated that the upper limit of the manipulated range is in fact perceived as slightly less comfortable*"". -- https://academic.oup.com/brain/article/131/2/500/407617

This article echoes some things, then begs the question - ""*An important question is whether skin temperature control to promote sleep would be necessary at all? If one examines time lapse videos of sleeping humans, it seems evident that people, during brief arousals from sleep, apply behavioral thermoregulation by kicking away the blankets or duvet to expose limbs to the cooler environment alternating with covering oneself to create a warm microclimate. But what if this behavior is somehow compromised? Or what if there is a deficit in the conscious or unconscious evaluation of the most appropriate temperature. It has never been evaluated systematically whether nocturnal thermoregulatory behavior differs between insomniacs and people without sleep complaints. We have an indication, however, that at least some phenotypes of insomnia may not recognize the most comfortable thermal microclimate that is conductive to sleep [71]. Interestingly, these observations were recently supported by our finding [5] that the severity of their sleep complaints correlated with structural abnormalities in the part of the orbitofrontal cortex that is essential for the evaluation of comfort [27, 73]*"". -- https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00424-011-1042-2

A pretty cut and dry study suggesting that bedding warmer for the lower half of our body than the upper half is more beneficial for sleep onset than bedding warmer for the upper half than lower -- https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140139408963694 

And finally, in warm environments, we benefit from local skin cooling of our neck and back. It's unclear if this persists in cooler ambient temperature -- https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ina.12428

The last one throws me off as one would conclude the back is part of our trunk and thus a proximal area. Maybe the upper back and neck are better off cooler. For my part when I overheat I tend to feel it most in my back, and I overheat easily. But then, excess cool will do the same and in my recent experience I believe leaving the trunk too exposed has backfired. 

Like the first study, I tend to sleep in an environment steadying around 20-21 degrees Celsius. What I've done for a few days straight is as follows:

-just prior to sleep, rinse neck and head in cool water
-stack more sheets on my upper legs, and less on my upper body

The results have been frustratingly wild. On the first night, I felt so cool I quickly gave up and slept with the comforter, though waking hot later than usual, prompting me to wonder if I had lowered my core temp more efficiently, leading me to dissipate less heat into the bed and therefore overheating later. On the 2nd night, I slept for 6 hours straight, before making a small adjustment and falling back asleep. On the 3rd, sleep was mediocre. Last night, it was terrible. However, my first wake up was once again later than usual, about 4-4.5h in. Could not reach comfort after.  

One issue is, as one article suggests, we make microadjustments in our sleep, and in that state it becomes difficult to manage an assortment of bedding appropriately. Sheets fall off, we pull too much over ourselves, it bundles up in the corner, etc. 

I had been running with the idea of specifically targeting my upper legs. This does seem to have some positive impact but I've been so inconsistent with it and can't help but wonder if there's a more efficient way. As a hot sleeper I tend to fold an extra sheet and just use that alone, but it has to be just the right sheet and temperature to work well. I also try pre-warming my feet. There have also been nights where I successfully slept with the comforter several hours at a time and here I wonder how that could be when I usually wake hot. One thing I haven't tried is a gradient from bottom to top, but I expect since we lose plenty of heat through our feet it's best not to cover that too much. The way I imagine it, most people sleep with one sheet and one comforter, then throw off the comforter from their upper half in their sleep. 

I'll continue trying some variation on this. If you have similar experiences or want to try it yourself, please share your results. Do you exhibit efficient self-regulation at night by adjusting covers? How do you tend to layer, then adjust?

2981,"These are the scariest times... It’s those times when your up for like 3 days and still don’t feel tired.

Your anxiety is through the roof and your thoughts get scary.

- Will I pass out and wake up in a hospital with tubes in me?

- Will I die in my sleep?

- Has my Brain somehow lost the ability to sleep?

Of course it always ends the same way. You finally pass out, sleep for like 14 hours and wake up feeling like a million bucks lol. 

But when your sleep deprived it’s so scary. "
2982,"Was hoping for more sleep This week was rough, I had two nights of no sleep and the others I was getting about 2-4 hours. Thursday night I finally managed to get 8 hours. I woke up yesterday (Friday) feeling great, and thought the insomnia cycle was broken for now, that I'd at least get a few day of real rest before it started again. That's usually how it works for me. But last night I only slept 2 hours if that, and I feel like this week will be a repeat of last. I'm trying to stay positive, at least I can usually manage a couple hours a night. But the stress and lack of sleep is starting to get to me. 

Edit: words are hard"
2983,"Has anyone tried Rozerem (ramelteon)? I was wondering if anyone has tried Rozerem? It works on the melatonin receptor. 

I'm kind of at the end of my rope with the insomnia. I'm currently on Seroquel which works beautifully for sleep. The only problem is I've put on weight (40 lbs) from it and my cholesterol and triglycerides are through the roof and I now have fatty liver. I've tried to lower my lipids with a low carb diet and taking lots of niacin and niacinaminde. They're improved but still high (triglycerides down from the 400's to the 200's). So, I'm going to ask my doctor to switch me to another sleep medication. 

Any advice is appreciated!"
2984,"Ugh. It’s going to be one of those nights. I’m so grateful for sleep the last couple of nights. But the insomnia is back tonight. 

There is a crazy windstorm happening outside of my window. The sound of the swirling wind sounds like the swirling thoughts in my head. There is a tree branch tapping on my window. The fallen tree leaves are rustling against the patio door.   Every now and then there is a gust so strong  it rattles the door. That just rattles me more. 

Maybe it’s the wind, maybe it’s my mind.  Either way, I’m losing hope that I will sleep tonight.

2986,"My insomnia is getting exponentially worse. So I woke up at 10:00 pm last night,some one called me and woke me up(grrrrr) been awake since then. 

 Previously to being woken up I was up for 3 days straight. I just can’t sleep, it’s 9:00 am and I am considering calling in sick. I know anxiety makes insomnia worse and life has been stressful last few months, and I feel like my body is refusing to sleep. It’s like when you are full and some one offers you food? Yeah not going to happen. This is weird. 

* Background I’ve had insomnia all my life but it feels like I’m speeding towards something and I can’t sleep. "
2987,I’ve done everything I can think of I go to bed at generally the same time. I read for a bit before going to bed so I’m not looking at a screen. I take melatonin an hour before bed. I have a journal where I write things down so I hopefully aren’t thinking about them. I do breathing exercises. I try to control my temperature so I’m not too hot or cold. I got maybe 4-5 hours of sleep last night. And that’s become usual. 
2988,"How do you deal with insomnia that’s caused by a fear of insomnia? I had a mental breakdown about 8 months ago and ever since have developed chronic insomnia  that is fueled by the fear of insomnia. I’ve been taking Xanax to fight this but I want to get off meds and sleep naturally  again.

It’s just the THOUGHT and WORRY that I might not be able to sleep that keeps me up. Anybody have experience with this?"
2989,"Anyone have experience with late waking insomnia? For those who aren’t in the loop, late waking insomnia is typically when you wake up earlier than you should and you’re unable to fall back asleep, but you don’t have trouble falling asleep in the first place. I’ve taken Amitryptaline for two years but I got off it recently due to its antichlorigenic properties, but now I really need something else to keep me under. Anyone have any advice?"
2990,"In bed with my best friend Insomnia An important day is approaching, the next morning. It is important to leave a good impression. Lights are turned off and blankets tucked in. As the eyes close, an eerie feeling approaches and eventually joins the bed. It begs attention but is being ignored. Bright light is created as an attempt of causing distraction. Time and time again efforts go in vain. Unknowingly the time is almost up, without getting peace of mind. Light shimmers through the curtains, no eyes were closed, the dawn of a new day is here.

2991,Help 2 hours last night. Exhausted all day. Now it's night time and I can't sleep again.
2992,"doctor prescribed me the tricyclic antidepressant ''Amitryptline'' for insomnia, 10 mg. does it have terrible side effects?? i always knew AD's could be more trouble than good. so i am very lucky Zoloft has worked very well for me. i'm on 200mg for OCD. i used to also be on seroquel which was good for sleep mostly but the side effects were just terrible, that ''zombie effect'' was a nightmare and the fatigue, sometimes i would take seroquel and feel detached from my body and very tired but still be unable to sleep. almost like getting an anaesthetic in the emergency room, and while it makes you so so drowsy, the pain is still there. so i want to start taking this Amitryptline tomorrow night, will the side effects be as bad as seroquel?

2994,"Melatonin making it worse? I've been taking 6mg of melatonin for the past week and a half. My problem before I took it was falling asleep but I could stay asleep fine but now I'm taking melatonin I wake up several times in the night and struggle to get back to sleep bit getting to sleep is kinda okay n9w? A bit of a difference but it doesn't make me feel tired, I kinda just have to force myself asleep. My therapist told me that I may have been taking it at the wrong time as for the first few days I took it half an hour before bed and it did nothing so I took it at around 6pm because I figured if I took it earlier I'd fall asleep when I wanted. Last night I didnt take it just to test what it'd do. It's 2:40am currently and I'm wide awake. I don't know why this is happening. Nearly two weeks ago I couldn't get to sleep so was put on medication for it and now suddenly I can't stay asleep? But I'm still wide awake during the day, I yawn a ton throughout the day but I don't feel tired at all? I don't know what to do. I've never called (got my mother to call) my psychiatrist because of a problem with any of my medication but I see her next in 3 weeks and I really don't want to wait that long and have 5 hours sleep every night when this time 2 or three months ago I'd get like 12."

2996,"LIQUID 10mg Melatonin! I plateaued after 8 years of trazadone and didn’t want to turn to other medications. I tried melatonin in pill form up to 10mg in addition to trazadone and still didn’t notice a difference..... until I tried liquid melatonin. It has changed my life. I never believed something natural could help. I’ve actually cut my trazadone mg in half after 8 years because of how much it has helped. I’m not sure I’ll ever be able to completely cut out trazadone, but the liquid has helped tremendously. Just a tip! "
2997,I got someone to write a 25 page eBook about insomnia is there someone interested in read it? I would love to have someone to read the book and to get some feedback.  
2998,"Please help I used to have really bad insomnia when I was a teenager, but it’s been a while since I’ve had a spell. Tonight it’s back, because my mind won’t stop obsessing over something that recently happened. I feel extremely sad about it, but I can’t stop thinking about it. It invades all of my thoughts.

2999,"Time? What happened to time? Fellow insomniacs, when you decide that fighting sleep is a waste of time and you stay up around the clock to try the next night, you ever notice that 7am very quickly becomes 7pm? I hope I'm not the only one."

3001,"Sudden Insomnia I don’t often have insomnia, but there are periods when I can’t properly sleep for weeks. Every time is like a first one, I keep worrying about all the same things. Incurable diseases, life worries, mood swings. Worst is I’m feeling wide awake and my anxiety makes me second guess my own mind, thinking I’m loosing it. I slept 3 hours a night before. I’ve been to ER a few nights ago and they gave me some stuff, so I slept for 6 hours restlessly. 

Later doctor gave me Opamox, Olanzapin and Tenox. It helps, but now I’m worried if there is a worse condition that I’m just patching. I don’t think I’ll be able to be completely okay until I sleep soundly under my own power. It doesn’t help that I have some weird flu as well. 

Anxiety and insomnia feed off each other. Anxiety leads to fear, fear leads to anger(being angry feels better than afraid), anger leads to being alert and awake, being alert and awake leads to suffering.

Recently I have been having sleeping issues. I have no problem becoming sleepy, but as I am about to drift off I get a random quick jerk, almost like a reflex reaction and once I get that jerk I am wide awake, then 5 mins later I feel I'm about to drift off, and boom, I get another one. This will happen all night and I literally have had 2 nights with zero minutes of sleep in the last 5 days, and last night it was happening again so gave in an took some Ativan which put me to sleep, but I definitely don't want to take Ativan.

Last night just felt like I was half asleep half awake the whole night with no more vivid dreams however both my mum and girlfriend said I was snoring at points during the night.

Because I need my eye mask, white noise machine, and get annoyed if he's on his phone while in bed when I'm trying to sleep, because the way he moves around is different than when he is sleeping/going to sleep.

I can hear at a much higher frequency than other people and I hate it - I can hear whistling even with multiple doors shut, I can hear through cupped earphones that are supposed to cancel out sounds. The sound of my boyfriend snoring keeps me completely sleep deprived which is causing tension in our relationship. Normal earplugs fall out or fail to really seal off the highest frequencies - I can even hear cell phones charge. What is this?

I try to force myself to sleep in the night but I am more wide awake. Now even when I do manage to get some sleep around 4am till 9am I feel groggy and exhausted all day. 

It gets to about 7-8pm (used to be 3-4pm last week) and I just get this overwhelming urge to sleep. The more i fight it the worse it gets. I hit the pillow and I cat nap (mini episodes of micro dreams but still feel awake) and wake up jolted from anxiety because it worries me why im overwhelming out of control tired. Gets to about 11pm I panic and find myself staying up.

Am I the only one here whose going through this sort of insomnia? "
3012,"I sleep sooo much better when I go to bed with an empty gut This may not apply to everyone as I have IBS, but if I go to the toilet before bed and empty my bowel I sleep a whole lot better. I’m talking deep sleep, waking up refreshed and being able to sleep in if I want.

Unfortunately it’s really hard to get this to happen reliably. I have both constipation and loose stools but generally I’m constipated after dinner and for the rest of the night, and even when I do use the toilet there’s no guarantee I’ll get everything out.

Magnesium citrate has worked very well before to get things moving, but also gives me horrible smelly gas, and sometimes makes my tummy feel uncomfortable.

Coffee helps move things along but of course the caffeine is counter-productive to sleep.

What has worked very well sometimes is eating a good amount of salad with dinner. All that fiber makes me poop a lot very soon afterwards. I’ll feel completely emptied out (sometimes) and sleep like a champ. But fiber can be quite harsh as it goes through my digestive tract, so it’s not ideal.

I’ve always found that having a full gut before bed makes me feel hot, uncomfortable and restless. I’ll sleep like shit. With an empty gut I do not feel hot, uncomfortable and restless.

3013,"Ambien long term use I've always avoided any regular medications but nothing in the world has allowed me to consistently sleep well then Ambien. Despite some horror stories it doesn't seem toxic and for me low dose 5mg works as good as when I started it.

What's funny is that she says she has sleeping problems, she made them sound just as bad as mine, but truthfully I don't know how she functions. 

For anyone interested I have what is referred to as terminal or multiple awakenings insomnia. It's a real blast, and sometimes it's even accompanied by nightmares about home break-ins. On most nights however I will just wake up, look at the clock in despair, and then go back to sleep. That's something I'm thankful for, I never have much trouble falling asleep. I used to have a whole different kind of sleeping problem, where I could never fall asleep until the wee hours but now I can fall asleep just fine - it's the staying asleep part that is really troublesome though. I might wake up 2-3 times a night. What's great is that I'll often make 8 hours of sleep by the time I wake up, but it's broken into all these chunks that any benefit of a deep sleep is now evaporated. I'm never sure when to get up anymore because I am always tired, and always wanting to catch a little more sleep. It gets to the point where I'm now getting up at 10 am and feeling groggy as all hell - which doesn't even begin to describe it. My god, the brain fog is the absolute worst of it. I can handle being tired, give me 4 hours straight - I'll take it. Give me 8 hours in blocks and I'm fucked pretty much for the entire day. I feel like my head has been run over a train, not that I know what that's like, but I imagine after that your head would be quite useless - well that is what it's like. You can't even begin to think straight. It's akin to be shitfaced, except your sober, and you feel like your nerves are on fire. Everything is irritating. Every question is nagging, and invasive. You can't drive for shit. Up is down and left is right. You try to watch something, play something, but you feel as dumb as a rock. You become this half-version of yourself who can never really be present in any moment. Holding a conversation is like doing gymnastics and your memory is so poor you have to make 6 references just to remember whose name you were trying to say a moment ago. As a writer it has completely crushed by ability to be creative. It makes writers block look like a bitch because this wall is fucking nigh impenetrable. I'm lucky if so much as a creative blip graces my mind because it's mostly just a black void when I'm like this. There's more of course, I could keep going, but you don't deserve that.

The whole reason I got into fasting is because I wanted better health and brain function but it dawned on me recently that I haven't had a full, uninterupted 8 hr sleep in....I honestly don't know.

3023,"It's so frustrating that there is no clear cause for true insomnia I have never heard a satisfying explanation for why some people have insomnia and others don't.  Sometimes I have thoughts while lying in bed, but other times I'm totally in a state of meditation yet completely awake and unable to sleep, so how could racing thoughts be the cause?   I also have seen a psychologist and I do not have an anxiety disorder or depression, although I do have anxiety and depression at mild levels.

I kind of relate to this article.  When I had my sleep study, I remember thinking I was awake for much longer than they said I was according to their measurements.  Perhaps this, combined with an obsession and anxiety around sleep itself is what causes insomnia for some people?  Of course, delayed sleep phase could be another cause...or contributing factor, but for me I can still have trouble sleeping no matter how late I stay up.

3025,"It's all in my head I've never had problems sleeping in my 20 years of existence.

Until one day I tried going to sleep while a bunch of my friends were over partying in my dorm room and they kept me up for hours. I had an assignment due and decided that since I wasn't going to get any sleep I may as well work on that assignment. Living through that next day was horrible I felt like complete shit and for some reason I put tons of pressure on myself to have a good sleep the following night. Despite being super tired and staying up for 30 something hours I couldn't fall asleep due to the pressure I kept putting on myself. I ended up only sleeping a few hours and suddenly I had major anxiety just about going to sleep. This problem has continued on for a couple months and while I sometimes get 8-10 hours of sleep there are many nights where  I lay in bed for 4 hours heart racing putting extreme pressure on my self to fall asleep. It seems as though the more I want it the harder it is to achieve. I feel like if I didn't have these thoughts I could sleep normal again

Additional info: Once I fall asleep I'm fine, if I wake up in the middle of the night to pee I lay back down in bed and fall asleep instantly because I don't have any thoughts provoking my sleep anxiety.

If you guys have any advice for me that would be appreciated."
3026,"I just. Can’t. Stay. Asleep. Hey everyone. Let me start off by saying I’m not currently diagnosed with insomnia, but I’m really considering seeing my doctor about my sleep issues. All my life, I’ve been known for being a night owl and an early bird. It was all fun and games when I was a kid so I never really saw it as a problem, but as I got older, the lack of sleep really started to have negative effects on my ability to function during the day. 

My first step was changing my bedtime routine. I’ve tried the whole sleep hygiene thing. I’ve tried sleeping in the dark, sleeping with the hallway light on. I’ve tried reading instead of being on my phone before bed, as well as just quiet meditation. I’ve tried going to bed on a full stomach, and going to bed on an empty stomach. Nothing seems to make a difference. My main issue isn’t falling asleep, it’s staying asleep. Most nights I fall asleep within 10-15 minutes, but I just can’t seem to stay asleep most of the time. I usually wake up probably around 5-10 times at night, and a lot of the time I find myself wide awake at 3-4am unable to fall back to sleep at all. 

So far, besides attempting to change my sleeping habits, I’ve tried some otc meds. I’ve tried melatonin. I started at 5mg and made my way up to 20mg. honestly had high hopes for it, but I felt absolutely nothing and my quality of sleep stayed the same. I recently tried diphenhydramine, and not only did I sleep like shit as usual, but it gave me weird dreams when I did sleep. Apparently it’s not meant to be used long term anyway, and my problem is nowhere near temporary. 

Do you think it would be a good idea to talk to my doctor about this? Idk if I should really schedule an appointment over this. I feel like I might just get a lecture about staying off of my phone before bed or something. Maybe this is a dumb question, but are there actual sleep aides (possibly otc) that can just be taken long-term and are more effective than repackaged Benadryl and melatonin? People just looove to recommend essential oils and crap but I’m looking for a way to improve my sleep, not carelessly throw away money lol. "

3041,"Don't have an imsomnia, having sleep trouble and have a few questions - amitriptyline 10mg Hi, to preface this i'm a young healthy male in third year at university. I eat well, workout and have a good social life. My sleep has been bothering me since I can remember, I can't remember the last time I fell asleep and woke up well rested, it must be over a decade ago. No matter what time I wake up in the morning I fall straight back asleep, I don't really wake up I turn off my alarm half asleep and go back to bed, this process can repeat for hours. 

For example, last night I got in bed at 1:30am and read a book, my alarm was set for 11:15 (I had class at 12:00), I woke up at 14:00 feeling tired, I can't remember my main alarm going off - which is extremely loud and my phone alarms don't even stir me. I'm a very deep sleeper and feel tired most of the time.

The same process repeats itself  a lot and I usually wake up in the afternoon.

In first year at university one of my friends gave me a 'sleeping tablet' (amitriptyline 10mg) the following few days/week after taking this was one of the best I can remember. I can remember feeling tired at 11pm and waking up naturally without an alarm at 7am which doesn't sound like a lot but made me so happy, I also didn't feel tired lying in bed. Upon waking now if I don't get out of bed immediately I fall back asleep but back then I lay in bed on my laptop without being tired. This lasted for a few days and I felt so energetic and ready to take on the day. 

I constantly think about those few days where I felt good and want to do something about it. I searched for sleep and amitriptyline which led me to this sub.

I think amitriptyline is also used for depression however I don't feel depressed, I know if I can get this sleep problem under control nothing will be holding me back.

I wanted to ask if anyone had a similar problem to me and how they solved it?

I tried anything that was supposed to help. Trazodone worked pretty well for a good 6 months until I started getting intense heart palpitations. CBN, CBD, Lunesta, Flexeril, NyQuil, and l-Tryptophan would work every now and then. NyQuil was the best, but I'd build up tolerance fast (and was worried about my liver.)

I noticeably felt more hopeless and didn't have the initiative to do much of anything.

Magnesium l-threonate is the only form of magnesium that works in putting me to sleep. I would advise first-time users to use caution, because I read a thread saying that it makes some people feel like they're on speed!! But for me, it puts me right out. I don't know why.

I take the carrot juice to reduce inflammation and to give a slight blood sugar spike that the body needs to get to sleep. The Magnesium l-threonate works just ok without it, but with it it works consistently in putting me out. 

I'm not sure if putting the cell phone on airplane mode actually helps, but I read some Medium article saying there was a small study in Germany that said it helped sleep. In any case, it helps me turn off all need to contact others during the day. I thought ""well, it can't hurt.""

After both of these and many other med failures, my psychiatrist had me do a genetic test to figure out which medications work best for me, and it turns out that every single traditional sleeping medicine they tested with my genetic makeup basically does jack shit: I metabolize all of them ridiculously fast and build huge tolerances almost immediately. Also learned that Morphine doesn't affect me...


However, alternative medications to those have never been successful for more than a few months at a time without needing major dosage changes or complete replacement. Ativan never really helped me sleep and good god I am never taking benzos again, fuck those. Mirtazapine worked alright for about 4 months until it stopped and I had to double the dosage, which ended up causing a lot of problems for me during the day. I take Hydroxyzine for anxiety but it's never been helpful for sleep. I've been on Seroquel (25mg, lowest possible dose) for a few months now but it too has since stopped working. OTC stuff doesn't help, neither does pot. Lifestyle changes haven't really seemed to be effective. I've also been on several other medications for depression & anxiety over the years that have absolutely fucked my brain chemistry even further (if you want some seriously fucked up dreams and like shaking constantly, check out Abilify)

3059,"Do you have insomnia characterized by vivid dreams and waking up frequently? This is what fixed my insomnia. I was inspired by 11ellie7's post because it sounded very similar to my own experience. My Insomnia was caused by a super-sensitized dopamine system resulting from ingesting a micro-dose of adderall. Now if you research this people will deny this can actually happen but when i look at peoples anecdotal reports they sounded very similar to my own. **So I went about fixing my insomnia with having  a sensitized dopamine system in mind**

When this first happened I would be lucky to get 3 hours of very light sleep in a night with vivid dreams. I resorted to taking benadryl to get more rest. This would result in about 5 hours of light sleep with extremely vivid dreams and frequent awakenings. Needless to say I was still exhausted.

*What finally worked for me was...*

**Magnesium Citrate or Glycinate- 400mg**

This one i'm sure you have all tried or are currently taking but when i forget to take this supplement I definitely notice. It's much harder to get to sleep without it as you can get 'restless legs'. I would say try both of these forms of magnesium as some people say citrate worked for them when glycinate didn't and vice versa.

**Noni Fruit Capsules- 1500mg**

This lowers your dopamine.

**L-tryptophan- Varying Dose from 3 grams to 500mg**

This is the most important supplement to my sleep as this converts into serotonin and melatonin. I still struggle with getting the correct dosage as I have needed less and less over time. I assume because my dopamine system is normalizing. When you take too much you will sleep like a rock and wont have a single dream but when you wake up you will feel like you haven't slept all. When you don't take enough you will experience frequent awakenings, you will have trouble getting to sleep and you will have vivid dreams. I started out needing 2.5 grams but right now my sweet spot is at 750mg. I can tell because I am still dreaming but am not waking up in the middle of my sleep. 

**Watching what you eat.**
I wont pretend to know why these foods keep me up but they do...
Soy sauce, smoked food like pulled pork, caffeine (obviously), alcohol and whey protein.

This altogether is what finally let me start feeling rested in the morning. If i miss any one of these supplements I will have problems with my sleep. 

So while you may not have had a bad reaction to adderall like me, you may still have a problem with your dopamine system. I'm curious if this can work for anyone else out there with similar insomnia to mine. 

Note: Im not a doctor im just an idiot who took adderall wrong.

3067,"Getting barely any sleep I was diagnosed with initial insomnia by my psychiatrist and she prescribed melatonin. But I think the melatonin has now affected my ability to stay asleep? Ever since I started it (last week) getting to sleep has been slightly better but not anything super noticeable but now every night I wake up multiple times and it takes hours to get back to sleep. I'm not tired I just have to force myself to not move and keep my eyes shut until I fall asleep. It's really frustrating but I don't want to not take the melatonin because then I'll be up till past midnight (when I usually would be asleep by 10) staring at the ceiling, super miserable.

I recently came to know about how horrible benzos really are in the long run and I really want to get off the xanax now and find other solutions maybe. I’ve consulted this one homeopathy doctor twice in the past, once for anxiety and once for insomnia and both the times I got relief within 15-20 days.

3071,"Need some advice (please be helpful) Good afternoonoon:

I’ve been reading along on this subreddit for a couple of weeks and thought I’d reach out for a little advice.

I’ve had issues sleeping (falling and staying asleep) for as long as I can remember.  I am currently in my mid-30’s.  I suffer from a severe cancer causing chronic blood disorder for which I am on two chemo regimens and have had a brain tumor and multiple strokes.  However my sleep patterns were dysfunctional before that began 10 yrs ago...but that diagnosis made it worse...being in and out of the hospital.

I have an interesting, intense job (despite my health) where I work from home and 1-3 days a week, take phones calls for 24 hrs straight and when needed, drive or fly out to hospitals for urgent consults in a rare specialty.  The next day, I am off and can rest.

The days I do not take call, I can take something to help me sleep, a z-drug and usually a muscle relaxant.  However, these are becoming less effective for me and are only lasting 3-4 hours.  If I take it at 10, I’m up by 2:15 wide awake.  I know by nature I tend to sleep best between 5am-10am but have to do a morning check in for work at 8:45 am.

I cannot take anything to help me sleep on the nights I work in the event I have to go somehere and I cannot fall asleep spontaneously...it can lead to 3 days/nights a week being awake for 24-36 hrs awake.

My doc is aware of this but his answer is that due to my illness, I have high inflammatory markers, which cause people to be stimulated and have a hard time sleeping...his answer is the meds.

These last few weeks, since the meds have been less effective, I have been struggling about what to do and want to see what else I can do to fall asleep without them and get spontaneous cat naps.

I know CBT and sleep hygiene is the best thing for me...but in this scenario, how to I attempt it?

I really need to focus on short bursts of sleep. Should I be waiting all through the night to get to 5am to lay down? Do I do productive things? What do I do for 8 hours between 9pm and 5am?

Any advice would be helpful.

I often go to bed at 10-12pm. But wont get to sleep until 5-6am. I often find my self almost asleep, with my eyes closed I can begin to hear sounds, and see visuals as If I'm dreaming, but I'm definitely still awake.  This make me end up waking up at like 11am-1pm sometimes.  I also find myself itching as im about to fall asleep, so I always jump up and run to put some cream on so I don't tear my skin apart.

How do I fix this? After reading a lot I'm going to try CBT and limiting my time in bed from 10pm-7am, even if I happen to not get to sleep.  The problem is that when I miss out on sleep my skin goes bad, so it can become an endless cycle. So I might use high strengh topical steroids at the same time while doing this?

I take 8mg of tizanidine 25mg of amitriptyline and 3mg of melatonin and it typically gets me to sleep in a few hours. Recently though it took me 4 hours. I went through everything I was taking and couldn't figure it out. I realized my new calcium supplement contains vitamin D. I looked it up and was surprised it caused insomnia in most people. Also lucid dreaming which I experienced.

So watch out because this stuff is POWERFUL. Look through any multivitamins and other supplements you're taking. They say only take it in the morning but I had to stop taking it all together because I'm so sensitive to it. I know a lot of doctors prescribe vitamin D as an antidepressant aid.

Ever since middle school I've had terrible sleep hygeine, eventually getting into a ~6 month period of <5 hours a night and no sleep 10% to 30% of the time depending on how bad things were at the time. But recently, for the last month or so, I've actually managed to overcome this by sticking to a schedule and not deviating off of it at all, with consistent electronics curfews, bedtimes and hours I need to be up making breakfast. Ideally the schedule would be getting me around 10 hours of sleep a night but I'm getting about 8 currently. But even after getting decent sleep for weeks I still feel very tired all of the time.

While visiting my in-laws around Christmas, I felt so desperate to be around people (husband works a lot) I asked if I could stay for a week or so. Being alone is awful when you're sleep deprived, in my opinion. They were generous and offered a month.

I ended up staying three weeks. While I was  there I developed a routine; PJs by 8, a certain TV show by 9, in bed by 10, melatonin at 10:30, and audiobook at 10:50. This was aided by the fact that my in-laws went to sleep early as well and are generally very calm/easygoing people. I went from 2 hours a night to 5-6 hours a night. Most nights I'd fall asleep around 11 and wake up anywhere between 4:50 and 5:50 AM. They had extra bedrooms I could switch to and a spacious living room I could sit in if I was awake. They were very welcoming in that they said I could even utilize the downstairs gym to wear myself out. I never needed it though. 

I arrived home earlier today and as soon as I stepped into the apartment, I felt queasy. Once they left, I started crying. I miss them a lot and have wished on many nights that I could just live with them permanently.

When I miss one nights sleep or get less than 3 hours, I am completely unable to function the next day in a few ways. I am unable to follow even basic conversation, I can’t safely drive, and the worst of all for me is that I become extremely suicidal.

3085,"Thoughts I found comforting, for my fellow insomniacs. Thought I would share a few revelations that have personally helped turn everything around in my struggles with insomnia. I hope these are useful for you.

To start, I’ll give you an analogy. Trying to get sleepy is a lot like trying to get hungry or thirsty: the body wants what it wants. 

Lets break this analogy down further: say someone’s saying “Ugh I can NOT get thirsty.” You’d imagine the helpful suggestions would be “have you tried taking a spoonful of salt?” Similarly for hunger: “have you tried looking at pictures of food?” 

Sure, you can take pills for all these things. And what those would do is just hijack the brain’s system to force-command these urges.

But the real point in this analogy here lies in how essential (and inevitable) these urges are 99.9999% of the time. In other words: you WILL fall asleep. It’s a guarantee.

Worried about being in that 00.0001%? I, too, was worried I would never sleep again. I was so worried, in fact, that I ended up not sleeping a wink one night and then having a full (and busy) day at work the next day.

And you know what happened? I was fine. Sure, I was delirious and loopy as hell, but the effect also felt like being drunk. I somehow did an even better job engaging with coworkers and getting my work done because I was too spaced out to overthink it. And then, racing home with a pounding heart and freezing cold wind tunnels, I found myself crashing for 12 hours.

I faced my worst-case scenario for the day and saw there was nothing to be afraid of. And now, instead of performing a million rituals before going to bed and taking every pill and supplement under the sun, I’m just going to trust my body to do its thing, and get comfortable in the meantime.

Got that pounding heart? Those racing thoughts? You can do something about them. The breathing exercises really do help.

And here’s that other ingredient that helped me: trust your body. Trust your brain. It’s gotten you this far (shitty brain memes notwithstanding) and is not just going to up and peace out on you.

Hope this helps."

When I started drinking alcohol I started getting 7 to 8 hours, and for the first time in my life I was able to snooze. That was a huge accomplishment for me since I usecto literally sleep 4 to 5 hours and jog for an hour and maybe sleep. 

 Now I've been cutting down drinking and I average 6 hours of sleep, but I can never get that last hour in. 6 doesn't feel right while 7 is perfect. I can squeeze a nap in and feel good, but that will frequently make me go to bed later and then a bad cycle starts so I avoid napping.

I often suffer from communicating to myself in my head when I lay my head down and I stumbled upon this technique of speaking e x t r e  m e l y slowly--thinking the same thoughts, just making them come out very slowly in my head or mind. I continue to talk and say the same things (sometime negative or concerned or something similar) but I just force it to come out very slowly in a very dramatic manner--just like slow motion in a movie--very exaggerated. I don't know how but yes if I practice this, it causes me to tumble into sleep in a matter of a short time and I hardly remember the process of falling asleep after that. Whereas before I would toss and turn and think about the fact that I haven't fallen asleep yet.

The second exercise in this video I don't use as frequently because I don't suffer from imagining scenes that keep me awake as much as I suffer from ideas and words spoken in my head from concerns or dresses, etc.

Just to give context to the severity of my sleeplessness: My insomnia and apnea lasted several years and was very acute. I even occasionally abused over the counter medicines (NyQuil, Advil PM, Diphenhydramine--the antihistamine ingredient in Benadryl). I tried changing my diet one way and then another, exercising, not exercising, alcohol, marijuana, sex, sleeping outside, all sorts of peculiar stuff--anything to help at all without having to go to the doctor (didn't have access to healthcare at the time).

I find heavy, exhausting, mixed exercise routines (like burpees, jumping jacks, push ups then pull ups) in a drill-like routine helpful but--just like others people--I find it impractical to require myself to exercise every day just to be able to fall asleep easily.

Reminder: This technique isn't meant to be used in replace of doctor's orders or prescriptions, but someone else may find this technique useful in calming themselves down when thinking continually and nervously during bedtime.

Happy sleeping."

But for the past few nights it's been the same thing, I wake up every hour (doesn't even feel like I'm asleep) with either really vivid dreams or just feeling like I had my eyes closed for an hour (like I'm stuck at stage 1) and I'm genuinely terrified that I won't get any more deep sleep because it's sFI as I feel like I've got the other symptoms such as shakiness and trembling in my limbs. Or does this seem like typical symptoms of anxiety powered insomnia? "
3111,"I've been awake 27 hours and Anxiety is destroying me :( I have currently been awake for 27 hours and I have a massive headache and I feel extremely on edge and Anxious. I wasn't able to sleep last night as I got home quite late and then had a firealarm drill as soon as I got into bed. By the time it was all over it was 6am and I hadn't slept (I had been up since 9am the day before). I have tried for the last 8 hours (its now 1:30pm) to desperately get some sleep because  my Anxiety is really putting on the verge of tears with this. However I am unable to fall asleep which is increasing my Anxiety. It's already starting to get dark here and I am so fearful that I will not be able to sleep tonight either.

How do you guys deal with this? This insomnia is bad enough but my GAD is really pushing me over the edge here. I know in my head that I need to try and remain calm and tell myself that sleep will come eventually but I am seriously finding it hard to do this. My Anxiety keeps telling me with each hour that goes by 'you've been awake 26 hours, now 27 hours' etc

This is absolute hell.

3116,"An insomnia related dump I first established my insomnia as a kid. My parents fought for years while it was time for me to go to sleep. Then there was bathroom related sleep issues as I got older. I was afraid to get up an use the bathroom because I'd get yelled at. So I'd hold it for as long as I could. Then I think I passed that particular anxiety to my kid. Then as a teenager I was just simply prone to being awake later and later and later. Then I discovered alcohol. That put me out eventually. But affected being normal and awake during the day. 
Then nicotine helped me fall asleep. But both drinking and smoking aren't considered decent visas for a teenager. So nix that, mostly. Laying awake at night became a thing. Like it is now. 
Fast forward a few years and I met my wife, had children and started working in prison. My wife, being bipolar and untreated for decades had the same insomnia issues. Hence, my insomnia became our insomnia. And we both developed a tolerance for alcohol, and over the counter sleep aids. 
Add time, stress and weight gain to get the dreaded sleep apnea. Left, untreated for. Years. Add anxiety to the already anxious mix and throw in a healthy amount of severe clinical depression and you get my nearly current mix.
I get a CPAp. Which helps. But now I'm afraid to fall asleep without it. And I dont want to go to the bedroom and toss and turn and ruin my wife sleep. So now I'm afraid to go to sleep for fear of waking her up and not being able to sleep myself. 
Kids get older, work and family life demand that I function best working graveyard shift. My anxiety gets worse, my alcohol use helps me develop gout and my kids cant just get up and take care of themselves. So I gotta wait to sleep and feel certain I'll get the sleep I need to be able to sleep.
Ambien helps immensely. So did klonapin. I Overdoesed on klonapin and ambien and alcohol last year so my doctor stopped prescribing me the klonapin. 
I convinced her to keep me on the ambien. I overdosed this weekend on ambien and alcohol. Not on purpose, like last time. Not on purpose. So now I expect her to take me off of that too. 
My psych on the other hand has me on seroquel, hydroxazine and a regular anxiety medication. The seroquel makes me fat. And so does being fat makes me fat. 
So I finally get the right amount of A. relaxation. B. Sleep meds and C. The time to adjust to all of it only  overdose this weekend. 
Now I'm afraid to sleep, fall asleep, stay asleep, get enough sleep and still A. Function like a responsible adult. Fuck. Isomnia. "

I occasionally have flare-ups where nothing will get me to sleep until like an hour before I've got to be up. But also it doesn't take much outside stimuli to keep me from getting sleep.   

I use pot edibles and a bit of melatonin (low dose) as sleep aids. But if, say, somebody is talking or listening to music and it's just on the edge of my hearing, it's enough to keep me up. If I put earplugs in, the feel of the earplugs is enough to keep me up. If I run white noise, the white noise is enough to keep me up (and doesn't completely cover the voices.)

3135,"SUCCESS STORY: I cured my chronic insomnia. And you will too. I wanna tell you my success story. And I did it COMPLETELY DRUG-FREE. Before that I want to mention 2 very important things:

1. I had extreme chronic insomnia for 2 months (1.5 hrs sleep/wk), I really believe this method that I’m about to describe would work for over 95% of you. I wouldnt make a statement like that lightly.
2. When I first started it all looked so hopeless - few success stories. I thought I was screwed. I came to realise, this is only because of 3 reasons: 1) people are too strict with their schedules (A 24 hour schedule is the worst idea ever for a chronic) and make it unnecessarily hard on themselves 2) doctors are too quick to prescribe drugs that at best mask the problem 3) those who succeed rarely share their experience.

So once you try this method and succeed PLEASE report back on here, so others have some insight and hope.

MY JOURNEY:

(***TLDR version of the cure at the bottom of this post if you're impatient)***

***Cause***: Moved to new apartment - lot of construction work in the day and lot of noise in night from parties. I barely managed to sleep the first few nights, and after the 4th night couldn't sleep whatsoever. Thereafter, I shifted to a quiet dark nice apartment. But the sleep did not return.

***Month 1 and Month 2***: I was sleeping 1.5 hours a week. Brutal. Tossing and turning almost all the time every night never falling to sleep. Chronic insomnia (both onset and maintenance). Became highly anxious, terrified and depressed which made things worse.

Last 2 weeks of Month 2: I tried many things (meditation, breathing CBT etc, didnt work) but a few things helped. These steps helped me get from 0 to 1 hour of sleep per night:

I decided to completely eliminate my anxiety, stress and depression in the day (without drugs). NO DRUGS NEEDED. I succeeded at doing this by:

\-----------------------------ANXIETY SOLUTIONS---------------------------

1. Cancelled all my jobs (jobless) but I’m a freelancer so easy for me (could get back on the horse any time).
2. I found watching 6 whole hours of comedy before my “bedtime” **very very helpful.** If I felt down in the day I would watch comedy then too. Impossible to laugh and be anxious simultaneously.
3. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT: I trained myself to never think of the insomnia in the day. Any time a thought about sleep or insomnia entered my mind, I switched my focus to something else.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Still only 1 hour a night of very light sleep. In fact I would wonder if I even slept that hour.**

***Month 3:*** Another former chronic insomniac advised me to try stay awake for 36 hours and crash to bed as it cured his insomnia. But he was also additionally using Gabapentin drug, which was not an option for me. *My first thought when I heard this was “Yeah yeah. I’ve gone an entire week without sleep before. No use”.* **But then I thought to myself “maybe it matters if you’re wide awake vs awake but with your eyes closed”**. So I decided I was going to try the 36 hour thing , but with my eyes wide open. Could only last for 27 hours.

It worked! Or so I thought.

I slept a full 6 hours the first night. Next few nights went to bed at the same time hoping i was cured. Bad news: 2 hours on the second night and 1 hour a night thereafter. But, this was the first time in months I got REAL sleep. Previously even the rare “sleep” I had gotten was sh\*t\*y ultra-light sleep. This new sleep felt like I had been knocked out cold and woke up as if I came out of a coma. Very satisfying.

***But the experience showed me one thing: If I stayed awake long enough, eventually I would crash. I could live with having to stay awake for 27 hours then sleep 6 (33 hour cycle).*** It would certainly be miles better than my current state of sleepless living. More importantly, I realised that if this worked, I could reduce the awake time gradually week by week and end up in a normal 24 hour cycle. And that’s exactly what happened and cured my insomnia.

I knew 27 hours awake was overkill. After some trial and error, I settled on the following pattern for the next 10 days:

\------STEP 2 TEN DAY PERIOD----------------------

* Staying wide awake for 21 hours FROM THE LAST TIME I GOT OUT OF BED. No naps, no lying down. No you cant count the last sleepless hours in bed.
* Getting 3-4 hours of amazing deep sleep and then unfortunately, automatically waking up
* Going back to bed and getting a broken light sleep here and there over the course of next 3-4 hours.

\---------------------------------------------------

From the very moment I started this, I felt amazing every day. Zombie insomnia was instantly gone!! I was 98% back to normal in the daytime. Felt just as sharp, alert and active as my pre-insomnia days. FROM DAY 1!!

The quality of the two legs of sleep kept getting deeper and deeper everyday. After those 10 days,  I reduced my awake time by 0.5 hours every 5 days. Now I’ve settled on 18 hours awake + 6 hours of sleep (24 hours total!). I go to bed at the same time and wake up at the same time on a normal human cycle. Not had a sleepless night since I started. cured!

So what should YOU do given my experience? My suggestion would be the following (LEGAL DISCLAIMER: I’m not a doctor or expert, nor I do not claim to be  on the internet, so consult one before trying anything I say)

**TLDR Summary:**

**STEP 1: Stay fully wide awake (eyes open, not in bed) for 36 hours. Sleep as long as you are able after that. It may be 2 hours or it may be 11 hours. Dont worry about that. Doesn't matter much in the long run.**

**STEP 2: Thereafter, for 10 days do what I did as discussed in the “STEP 2 10 DAY PERIOD” section above. Also, do not skip STEP 1. Its important, dont ask me why.**

**STEP 3: Reduce awake time by 0.5 hours each week until you are down to a normal day cycle.**

**While doing this:**

1. **Eliminate any source of stress and keep the anxiety/depression low. see my tips (see anxiety solutions section above).**
2. **Sleep in a noise free, light free (pitch dark room) and avoid foods that might cause indigestion/gas.**

Best of luck to you all! Remember you to report back when you succeed!

If you have any questions, ask away!"
3136,"Do any of you usually dream when insomniac? So I went to bed last night at 9:20 and turned off the light at 10 pm, having woken up at 9 am on that day. In hopes of being productive I set my alarm to 6:30, closed my eyes and tried to sleep. 

This was one of the weirdest nights I had.
My feet were freezing, I rolled around for an hour looking for a comfortable position, and then a million thoughts came to my mind, followed by the weirdest dreams. I must have fallen asleep somewhere around midnight, perhaps, and ""woke up"" feeling so hot that I had to take off my socks and roll up my sleeves (it's winter here and my room is very cold). After cooling off and trying to fall back asleep... the alarm rung... After beeping for half an hour (?) I turned it off and slept, trusting I wouldn't stay in bed late, and between waking up and dreaming I finally got up from bed at 8 am, feeling energized. This time it did feel like a sleeping. 

Checking the sleep cycle app, I woke up at about 5 am. The weirdest parts are that even when I manage to sleep 8 hours straight I never wake up this energized, it took me no effort to raise from bed. I also usually remember the dream I had right before waking up but this time I remember clearly most of the dreams throughout the night, like I was never really asleep. 
How can this be???

3137,"Favorite sleep aids? I'm looking for some new sleep aids to try, preferably ones that have no hangover the next day. What are your favorites? Here are ones I've tried and my hangover rating: 

* **Melatonin**: (no hangover) Up to 10 mg, both immediate release and long acting. 
* **L-theanine**: (no hangover) Up to 1G. A little bit of a calm feeling for the first couple of hours the next day...doesn't impact cognitive function for me so I wouldn't call this a hangover. 
* **Magnesium Glycinate** (no hangover): Up to 1 G. A little relaxed the next day, wouldn't really call this a hangover. 
* **Benadryl** (moderate hangover): Up to 50 mg. Feel mild cognitive impairment for most of the next day, also get mood impairment (crabby and irritable). Don't like to use unless absolutely necessary.
* **Kava** (mild hangover)**:** A bit spacey for the first few hours of the next day.
* **Unisom** (doxylamine succinate) (moderate hangover): Up to 1 tablet, mild drowsiness/cognitive impairment for most of the next day. No moodiness unlike Benadryl which is strange since this is also a gen-1 antihistamine. 
* **Trazadone** (severe hangover): Up to 50 mg..this stuff knocks me out and knocks me out bad...definitely the big guns. However, I'm borderline non-functional the next day..very spacey and poor working memory. Mood is great though. 
* **Ambien** (severe hangover): Up to 20 mg...I have a love-hate relationship with Ambien. Things are very enjoyable if I stay up on it, but I always feel like shit the entire next day both energy wise and mood wise...I basically feel like I haven't slept, even if I got 8 hours. I'd rather get 4 hours of sleep than take this stuff and get 8 hours, that's how crappy it makes me feel.
* **Lunesta** (moderate hangover): I've only taken this a few times but I definitely remember feeling a bit spacey the next day. Not as bad as Ambien since I wasn't crabby but still didn't really feel rested.

I'm amazed at how well it's working. Usually when I wake up in the middle of the night after 1-2 hours sleep, I lay there anxiety-ridden and never fall back asleep. The weighted blanket calms me down so that drifting back off isn't a problem.

I'm only 19, but the past 6 years of my life have been absolute hell. I've been wracked with debilitating OCD issues, a slew of general anxiety issues, and bouts of insomnia that come at the worst times. I've felt pretty constantly isolated from my family, friends, and fellow human beings because of all of it. 

I'm posting here on /r/insomnia because I'm currently having sleep troubles myself. I've gotten probably 3-3.5 hours total in the past few days. I have a massive exam tomorrow that I've been trying to study for, but chances are that I won't do that great, and one of my grades for this semester will be in jeopardy. 

What I want to say is this: whatever you're going through is only temporary. Be positive. Smile. Try your best at whatever you're doing to get by. 

I know it's corny and cliche and the like, but it's true. I guess it's the pragmatic side of me, but no matter what you're going through, it will not last forever. Every second of hell you've gone through is one less you will have to go through to recover, and it's another page in the history book. Every sleepless night is one less you have to soldier through. Recovery can happen, it's out there. 

We've all been there. We feel so bad that it's like we're on the edge of the abyss. Hell, we probably wouldn't care if we fell into that abyss and ended it all either. But every second you suffer there is another footstep towards controlling your life, controlling yourself, and making your life the best it can be. 

6 years, man. But I trudge on. Despite my lack of sleep, my crushing anxiety, and the night terrors that I'm dealing with, I cracked a smile in the shower earlier. It's amazing what a bit of positivity can do.

 I'm not dreading tonight, or tomorrow night, or the night after. Sleep will find its way to me, and I'll be ready for it. I'll continue the CBT plan that I'm rolling with, try my best to comfort myself and relax, and maybe I'll be able to get some restful hours in. Maybe not, though. Maybe I won't get any in at all. Which is cool, because sleep will find me when it wants to.

I've been dealing with BAD insomnia for 8-9 years. I'd become totally dependent on ambien and klonopin to get any sleep and I'd still wake up hours too early and feel like crap or have that medication sleep hangover. These last 3 months have been amazing. Now I'm at the spot where I have to be careful about slipping out of this positive habit. I've done these kinds of things before with cleaning up my diet and exercising. I put off meditating two days ago and ended up falling asleep without having meditated that day. While it's great news that I slept without it, meditating is hard work and I felt the little kid in my mind go, ""Hey maybe you're cured and don't need to do all that sitting with your eyes closed."" But that's the trap, I gotta keep doing what got me here.

I should note that I did two vipassana meditation courses way back in 2005 so that may have helped me know how to guide myself while sitting. I basically sit on a pillow on the ground with something soft under my legs. Close my eyes and focus my attention to the breath going in and out of my nostrils. My mind wanders and I bring it back to the breath. I also try to relax my brain. You'll see what I mean when you try it. I can actually feel my brain ease up when I notice it, sort of like how we clinch our teeth when we're anxious without noticing.

It's similar to not being able to stomach food or water, every time you eat or drink you throw it up, it's a neccessary bodily function that doesn't work in our bodies. Lots of people apparently deal with insomnia but i highly doubt it, i think most people exaggerate, they think a bad night or two a week is insomnia, a bad night every night is insomnia, 3-4 hours everynight, living everyday like a corpse just going through the motions, no sense of humour anymore, nothing worth smiling for, incapable of logical thought and an abysmal memory, pounding headaches and blurred vision. It is used as a method of torture, yet we have to endure it daily, our bodies are torturing us daily, starving us of one of the most basic human needs.

Yet it is never taken seriously. No one ever understands just how horrific it can be, ancient egyptian hieroglyphs record a lament for ""three hells"" one of which is to lie in your bed and not sleep. I have slept 3 hours a night for 3 days now, 9 hours of sleep in 3 days... around the same amount a normal person would get in one day. But if we bring it up we are looked at with disdain for being dramatic and neurotic because ""everybody is tired"" it is something people can't comprehend because they can just lie down and fall asleep. Insomnia ruined my year last year and i spent time talking to mental health professionals, took antidepressants and even started to hallucinate as i was so sleep deprived. I work a physical job as a bricklayer 40 hours a week. I have considered suicide, i have asked myself what kind of quality of life i can have with this illness, can i endure this for the rest of my life? The answer is absolutely not, it has sapped every bit of happiness from my life and if i am still dealing with it for years to come, i am certain that suicide will be the only answer.

4210,"How I cured my insomnia with one simple trick (unironically) My insomnia has been especially bad these past few months, with me often only sleeping for a few hours per night and sometimes going 2 or 3 days without sleeping at all. As a result, I've been doing a lot of experimentation and I've finally found something that works.

Everybody has different reasons for their insomnia, but mine was mainly that I would go to bed and my brain would be in overdrive. I just wouldn't be able to stop thinking about a million things at once. My brain was very easily stimulated, with activities like brushing my teeth and washing my face dooming my ability to sleep. I also liked to watch television in the evenings and did not wish to stop doing that, but that was another source of stimulation. So what was I supposed to do?

Well, I have not stopped doing any of those things. I watch TV from 9-11PM, and then go upstairs and do whatever I need to do; brush my teeth, wash my face, put pyjamas on, etc. Once that is done, I come downstairs, dim the lights, sit on the sofa and just... think.

I just sit back and let my brain do whatever it wants. That is the trick; to let it take control and cycle through whatever it wants to process until it has purged and tired itself out. After an hour or so of thinking, I go upstairs and can sleep almost immediately.

I have been doing this every day for a week and I've slept for 10 hours each time. I go to sleep at 1 AM and naturally wake up at 7, and because I have nothing to do, I go back to sleep and wake up at about 10 AM. I know that it is bad to oversleep, but I am just used to not sleeping at all, so I'm relishing in my newfound ability.

(I use this in conjunction with other classic insomnia practices, like exercise and using my bedroom exclusively for sleeping. I also used to be kept awake by a need to urinate; I've solved this by drinking regularly throughout the day, including the evenings, and having my final drink at about 11. This means that I go to the toilet a couple of times during the 'thinking hour' and do not need to do so when I go to bed.)"

1. Make sure you are sleepy, don’t force yourself to bed if you are wired up..there’s no use of just laying there. This shouldn’t be difficult anyways if you have sleeping probs tho obviously lol.

2. Lie down and just play your day out in your head. Be super detailed from when you woke up in the morning to the present (if you even make it through the whole day without knocking out first). Seriously be as detailed as possible!! Ex: i first woke up to your alarm at 10 am, then the dog ran downstairs and you pet it  for 10 minutes and took them out, then came back inside and brushed your teeth...

Be as detailed as possible and use your imagination to play it out in your mind, just focussss on your day, don’t even think about sleeping.  Don’t stress yourself trying to remember things either!! Just play your exact day through your head. This may not keep you asleep but for anyone w problems just falling asleep initially this works wonders (:

Don’t go to bed early. Even if you need to wake early, stay up until your eyes struggle to stay open. I typically go to bed at 9/930 and have a TERRIBLE time trying to sleep. Since my first meeting with this program, I’ve been staying up and reading until about 11:30 and I’ve had a much easier time passing out once I lay down in bed. 

The logic behind it is my natural sleep cycle is “stubborn” — meaning it’s not changing to a 9pm to 5am no matter how hard I try. Accepting that I don’t naturally get tired until 1130 or so really helps stave off the sleep anxiety."

I'm so thankful I decided to give it a shot- Insomnia sufferer of 13 years I'm 28F and I was diagnised with insomnia and anxiety when I was 15.  I had a prescription for Xanax but got way too dependant. I couldn't even leave the house without them. That stuff was amazing. Someone could tell me the house was on fire and I'd be totally fine with it.  So I stopped thus beginning a long cycle of unhealthy methods of sleeping. From 15-18 it was the xanax, 18-now sleeping with the TV/phone (Netflix, Hulu) on helped me snooze but I never felt rested. Sometimes it was just annoying and then I couldnt sleep at all. I'd stare at the popcorn ceiling and pick out shapes and pictures. I'd get tired of the same shape so I'd go lay on the other side of the room and stare at the ceiling over there. After recovering from a cold where I was taking flu medicine I just started regularly taking flu medicine.. lots. Every night. They never seemed to put enough in a box of Nyquil so I bought big, cheap bottles of Benadryl. For the last 2 years or so it's just been me and my Benadryl. A few month back I started noticing that it wasn't really working as well.  Sometimes it would hype me up! That never happened before.  Still some nights it would work and I'd sleep well. I started to have even more anxiety about night/bedtime/sleep. Would it work tonight? 

I longed to fall asleep naturally, under tge covers, as easily as everyone else did. In February while browsing online and saw an ad ona sidebar with information on weighted blankets. Interesting. They were pricy but I was desperate. I broke down and bought one for $120. It's 12lbs and I could've cried the first morning after I had it. No pills, no night time tea,  It was amazing. it's not hot, it's not confining. I still move freely but more so changing positions to sleep not from being uncomfortable. I love this blanket and I would recommend this to anyone looking to try something new. Even when I need to recuperate from work I come home and get under my blanket.  I immediately feel relaxed and the whole day washes away. I still have nights accompanied by sleepless, of course,  it just comes with the diagnosis, but even then I'm relaxed about it. I'm able to lay and relax instead of my eyes wide open and my mind racing.  Even that makes a huge

On the other hand, if I have an interview the next morning, or the first day on the job, my body goes into panic mode and I simply forget how to shut off. Maybe it's lack of confidence in my sleeping ability, or trauma from past insomnia episodes.

I've jeopardized a few good opportunities during this unemployment stint, and it sucks because I really need some income! How does one calm an overactive mind?"

4256,"There is hope! Hi fellow former or current insomniacs,

My insomnia has gotten so much better/practically nonexistent recently and it's giving me lots of hope. I want to share some of the recent findings with you guys hoping that you may find some use in it!

My history with insomnia: Never been a good sleeper, but in the last 2-3 years it has gotten really bad. I'd get about 2-4 hours sleep per night. Usually I'd fall asleep only to then wake up after 1-2 hours and then either not get back to sleep at all or get back to sleep only a short time before the alarm went off - mixing that with a really physically demanding job has made me grow lots of gray hairs (and I'm 32!) and has sucked a lot of joy out of my life. This has been my situation until just a few weeks ago.

 What changed?

I went to a 7 day Zen retreat. No speaking, no phones, no reading and other distractions. Just lots of sitting meditation, walking meditation and working chores, as well as the occasional consultation with the monk who ran the whole thing (non-profit by the way!)

I was pretty anxious about not being able to sleep during the retreat and then having to be alert all day from 6a.m. until 10pm. (definitely not my normal schedule, too). I asked the monk about sleeping issues, and he said ""When you go to sleep, JUST SLEEP!"".

I thought to myself, ""oh great, here we go, great advice from a non-insomniac...as if it were so easy"". It kind of sparked a lot of rejection/almost anger in me. Similar to a lot of things I've read on this subreddit when people get offended by non-insomniacs naive advice (""Just try camomile"" haha)

However, as the days went on, I really got the point of it. In this tradition's teachings it actually applies to pretty much everything: ""When you wash the dishes, just wash the dishes"", ""when you chop wood, just chop wood"", etc etc...""NO DELUDED THINKING!"" he would often say. When I asked what kind of thinking counted as ""deluded"", he said ""pretty much ALL thinking, since most of it comes from your EGO"".

In those 7 days I started to see how scattered my mind actually is. And I was shocked! I mean, I realized that I can barely go for a second without my thoughts wandering off, or thinking about anything but what is happening RIGHT NOW! Not what's happening in my EGO (anything that is about me, myself and I. what I like/dislike about this and that thing/person/situation), but just what is happening in your general awareness. It took several days of not having any distractions to really see the busy nature of my mind, and how eagerly it wants to judge things or situations (such as for example lack of sleep, or fatigue during the day) as either positive or negative rather than just letting them be what they are.

Here's the practical implications: A few days into the retreat, I started having the best nights of sleep ever. Incredible. Many hours of deep sleep, and that was in a tent, on an uncomfortable camping mattress!! I woke up happy and refreshed, full of joy. I'm now back in my apartment, sleeping on a real bed, and here are some of the insights I have to offer from taking on the new mindset in my busy life and seeing some of the roadblocks to good sleep. Although they are from my experience, I feel like they may apply to a lot of you guys too. I've been on a steady road of recovery from insomnia, so the ""advice"" I'm giving out here, I'm giving to myself too because they include some of the pitfalls I still step into occasionally:

1.  BE HERE NOW! This is a 24/7 practice and it's tough cause we've been increasingly ""programmed"" to not just ""be here"" but rather be everywhere all the time and think about 1000 things. Getting into a habit of being fully present in the moment, no matter what it is, creates a less cluttered mind, hence better sleep.  If today you feel really shitty cause you have no energy, and you have to do some annoying task, just be present with it. Don't fight it, don't hate it, don't internally or externally whine about it, don't resent it, don't wish you were somewhere else, but just DO it, just be there. it's just an experience. Not all experiences have to be good, not all days have to be full of energy, nothing is ever exactly the way you wanted it to be and that's ok..

2. Routine helps. I know you've heard this one before, but do your best to give your body some kind of timeframe for sleep. However: Don't obsess about it, cause that just causes stress and more useless thinking about your insomnia that will get you nowhere! 

3. Stop telling people (perhaps with the exception of this subreddit and your doctor) that you suffer from insomnia. You're creating a self-fulfilling prophecy and making it part of your identity. It doesn't help when you become known as the guy/girl who doesn't sleep well. People will ask you ""how's your sleep"" all the time, and you'll be thinking about it all the time, rather than relaxing your mind about the whole topic and letting sleep eventually just come naturally.

4. Follow the often-mentioned guidelines for good sleep religiously but non-obsessively. Just do it without questioning at least for a while and relax in the process: Enough exercise, good diet (more complex carbohydrates, less protein in the evening), less sugar, less caffeine, learn to meditate (plenty of apps, books, teachers for this these days) but mainly: NO SCREENS A FEW HOURS BEFORE BED! Your phone is both feeding your busy mind and exercising a habit of HEADINESS rather than being in your body/ learning to relax. Maybe change your attitude as to WHY you're doing these things. Cause it's not all about sleeping, it's just as much about not destroying yourself, living a better life, staying healthy, not wasting the miracle that is the fact that you're alive on staring into an LED screen for most of it. Maybe it helps not making Sleep the ultimate target but rather a natural side-effect of this new lifestyle.

5. Eliminate WORRY! catch yourself when you do worry, and let it go. Switch to a more beneficial mode, such as gratitude for whatever is good in your life right now.  If not, you just perpetuate the cycle. This applies of course to laying in bed and worrying about not being able to sleep, or not having enough energy for the upcoming work day. Everybody's different, so find YOUR way of changing your attitude in those moments. Just don't do anything stimulating such as using your phone. Personally I've just gotten into a habit of meditating whenever I can't sleep. I could imagine that journaling could help for some people too, or going to another room to stretch a bit and relax your body. Sometimes I'll sleep for 2 hours, then meditate for 30-50 mins during which I can often clearly see how busy my mind is - it's like ""HA! no wonder I woke up! so much unprocessed data""- which I can then let go, thought by thought, feeling by feeling, until I just relax again and sleep. Your body/mind is waking you up for a reason. Whether that's a physical or mental cause, maybe before you get annoyed/frustrated, just LISTEN to your body/mind and take it as a pointer towards improvements on the way to a better future. After a few weeks of this, my mind is now not so busy, unless I've really screwed up during the day, which is usually due to point 1 (not being present).

6. Finally: Forget it all! This is probably the most challenging and your ego may fight it(and me?) a lot: Forget all you've ever heard about sleep. Forget your opinions on how many hours you should get, whether or not it's ok to wake up during the night, forget about the newest scientific findings for sleep, the newest supplements, the best sleep-hacks (although some of them are useful, they are short term fixes, so don't get attached/addicted!),  forget how much other people sleep, forget the word INSOMNIA. So maybe you've lost your way a bit, just come back to natural sleep little by little. Let it happen. I believe that the more you can learn to mentally and emotionally LET GO during your daily life, the better your sleep will be in the long run. Don't expect immediate results, but also don't exclude that possibility. Nobody said it was easy, nobody said it was hard. You may sleep really well tonight!

Ok, hope this helps some of you find better sleep eventually! Please be kind and patient with yourself, and don't beat yourself up about your insomnia!

Some final thoughts:

Don't buy in to your self-created limits too much (I can never sleep, I'm going to be like this all my life, if I don't take X mg of melatonin I can't sleep, etc etc). Tame your opinions on sleep, calm down your thinking, and then maaaybe you can actually JUST SLEEP one of these days. It could be tonight, or in the very near future.

Some of you are going to find this idea really challenging, but: It is completely possible for your insomnia to evaporate from one day to another. I think it depends on how attached you have become to it. Some people can actually just let go. Others may need to do something in order to let go of it (for example if you have a severe trauma, or a physical issue, then you would go see a doctor/therapist and have it sorted out and have them help you let it go). If you read this and you become angry, saying ""BULLSHIT, I've had 15 years of insomnia and NOTHING helped"", then I believe that's your attachment right there. It's like you've married your insomnia, it's a terrible abusive marriage, but you keep on holding on to it, blaming everyone else for a situation you are in some ways perpetuating or allowing to rule your life rather than getting to the root cause of the problem and finally just moving on.

No matter what the original causes, I think all of us here on this sub have in varying degrees developed something like a HABIT of insomnia. Let's keep supporting eachother to QUIT that habit. Relapses are normal, maybe we can also just accept that and find a better attitude towards those sleepless nights.

I wish us all increasingly more restful, deep sleep in the days months years to come!"
4257,"“Sleep Hygiene” Something that makes me so frustrated about having insomnia is when people give advice about your sleeping habits and before bed activities like ok listen Linda I put lavender oil on my wrists and temples. I drink chamomile lavender tea. I put my phone away hours before bed! I keep my sleeping space cozy and tidy and all that biz. And if I’m in bed by 10:30, I’ll be asleep by 2:30 and awake by 5. When people insist it’s just your sleep hygiene or whatever it’s so frustrating because it feels like your fault for not being able to go to sleep and even now with medicine, (100mg trazodone) it takes me a while, and sometimes if I’ve had a good streak while on my meds and my sleep is getting better, I’ll go without them one night and I realize that without them I won’t sleep at all. 
When I first went to see doctors about my insomnia I didn’t even feel believed and it felt awful.

4270,"1 Hour of meditation DAILY really working Hello, fellow insomnia sufferers. I just wanted to share what's been helping me. I've dealt with chronic insomnia for about 7 years, maybe more. It sucks. For me it's a brain buzz. It doesn't matter how exhausted I'd be I'd have that dreaded brain buzz. It's tied to anxiety but I've never really cracked the case. I did talk therapy for 10 years. Therapy was good for my overall mental health and helped me accomplish many goals but I never had that a-ha moment where my sleep issues resolved. Over the last couple years I've gotten more and more dependent on ambien and benzos to get some sleep. Although they'd put me to sleep I'd still have issues with waking up too early and feeling like crap. They'd usually only get me 4-6 hours when I'd need 8-9 hours.

Before I had insomnia, back in 2005, I did two Vipassana meditation courses where you go on a silent 10-day retreat and do a somewhat guided meditation for 1-hour increments, 9 hours a day. It was super hard but I did it. I still remember how good I slept. It didn't matter if I was thinking about all of my life's problems I would lay down and zonk out beautifully. I remember that on the end of the last night they let everyone talk again. Everyone has a lot to say. I was standing in the hallway talking to a guy and although I was enjoying the new freedom of talking I vividly remember feeling this intense ""MUST SLEEP NOW"" feeling come over me and I had to excuse myself to lay down quick. Those are the kinds of moments I would envy in my friends who never had insomnia. Healthy brains seem to just shut down at night.

&#x200B;

Anywho, I just wanted to share that I recently moved cross country and decided to turn over some new leaves. One goal has been to wean myself on sleeping pills and give meditation a fair shot again. I'd dabbled in 20 minutes a day over the years but would fall off the wagon after some sleepless nights or whatever. Three weeks ago I committed to 60 minutes a day. I break it up into whatever timing works for my day. 20/20/20, 30/30, 10/15/20/15. I put in ear plugs, sit on a pillow on the ground, and focus on the sensation of the air entering and exiting my nostrils. My mind naturally wanders and I nudge it back to focusing on the breath. 

&#x200B;

It's been working beautifully. I have not felt the need to reach for the ambien once during October. I can feel the brain buzz going way down. I know it's early to call it a victory but honestly I've been taking ambien almost every night for as long as I can remember. I'd get anxiety that I would not get any sleep if I didn't take a pill. Meditation is hard work but it's been paying off. As most of us insomniacs do, I evaluate the quality of my day by how much energy I have and how refreshed I feel. This month has been 3x better than August and September. I've dozed off naturally and stayed asleep most nights. I've had a few times where I wake up in the middle but I have not had that DREAD feeling. I stay calm and kinda meditate in bed on my back. I usually fall back asleep. But will note that there was one night where I did not get great sleep but I still felt pretty damn good the next day. It felt like the time I'd invested in my brain had stored up and I was able to run on reserves.

I've always had a problem falling asleep.

Any safe tips to help me actually fall asleep without worrying if I'll wake up the next day or not?"
4273,"Sharing my success story after 8 months of debilitating insomnia. It all began on December 26th, 2013. I had spent 7 nights at home for the Christmas holiday and it was my first night back in my own bed. It should have been a good night's sleep but instead I lay awake all night. That's odd, I thought. The next night was the same. After 5 nights in a row of no sleep I could barely function. I called in sick to work. This was the beginning of 8 months of pure suffering.

I've always been a poor sleeper. I'm unable to sleep in hotel rooms when traveling. I have always had extreme anxiety about sleep. I would walk to the bedroom like a death row prisoner on his way to the gas chamber. I truly feared the bedroom that much. If there was an event of any significance the following day it would be virtually guaranteed that I would not sleep. 

I have stood downstairs in my house in the pitch darkness, my wife sleeping peacefully upstairs, and shed tears of pure frustration and anger. What other people take for granted became an absolute nightmare for me. After a sleepless night I would drive to work in a zombie state dreading the long day ahead. I began to avoid social functions because I was too tired to hold conversations. I would schedule my personal life around sleep often waiting until the last minute to commit to plans depending on how well I had slept the previous night. I felt completely helpless and trapped. I suffered terribly.

Finally after 8 months of this I broke down and scheduled an appointment with a sleep psychologist. I was extremely skeptical that this would work. How could it help to just talk about sleep? Would the doctor have me attempt lame breathing exercises? Trust me when I say I would never have scheduled this appointment if I hadn't been suffering so badly. I finally broke down and put it on my calendar.

The first thing the doctor had me do was begin to fill out a daily sleep log. Each day I'd enter what time I got in bed, what time I turned off the lights, how long it took to fall asleep, how many times I awoke during the night, what time I woke in the morning, and what time I actually got out of bed. I'd also rate how I felt each day on a scale from ""feeling terrible"" to ""adequate"". This log began to reveal all the things I was doing wrong and helped put me on the path to success.

The first thing we implemented was sleep restriction. It turned out that I was spending too much time in bed attempting to sleep. If I had a bad night I would attempt to make up for it by going to bed early the next night or sleeping in the next morning. This was the worst possible thing I could have done. I learned that I could increase my sleepiness by reducing the time I spent in bed. I had been getting in bed around 10:00 PM and rising at 7:30 AM. I immediately changed my sleep schedule. I would go to bed at 12:00AM and rise at 6:15AM. This was a major lifestyle change for me. However, after just a few days of this I found myself feeling tired when it was time to go to bed. Getting up early was difficult for me and for the first few weeks I still felt very tired. But soon I found myself nodding off at night. I hadn't experienced that in months. By forcing myself to get up early I began to feel tired and ready for bed at night. This was a major step forward.

The next breakthrough technique I learned was called stimulus control. Before beginning this program I had mistakenly thought this referred to controlling stimulus like television or other bright screens before bed. Actually stimulus control refers to controlling the negative stimulus that reinforces sleep anxiety: the bedroom. I learned that the worst thing I can do is lay in bed awake. This was creating negative associations with the bedroom. It was actually the quiet bedroom that I was afraid of and not sleep itself. The program dictated that if I did not fall asleep in 30 minutes I was to get up, go downstairs, and read a book or do some other activity until I felt tired. I was not to return to bed until I actually felt tired. I began to view laying awake in bed as corrupting the bedroom and creating a toxic environment. If I wasn't sleeping I wasn't staying in the bedroom. 

The first few times I tried stimulus control it was very difficult. It was hard to leave the nice warm bed and go downstairs. It was difficult to force myself to read a book when I felt so tired in the middle of the night. But I was doing something active about my insomnia. Hell, if I was going to be up all night at least I was in control now. I was choosing to be up all night. I was not letting my insomnia control my life. This was a very empowering perspective. Each night if I had not fallen asleep in 30 minutes I would get up, go downstairs, and read until I felt tired. On a few occasions this meant reading all night until the sun came up and I went to work. The day would be long and difficult but when I got home I would not go to bed early. I would wait until my normal bedtime at 12:00 AM. Slowly, surely, the combination of sleep restriction and stimulus control really began to work. I strung 2 nights together with good sleep. I strung 3 nights together with good sleep. It was nothing short of a miracle.

The last major breakthrough I had was cognitive. It was a new way of looking at my insomnia. I would not let my insomnia bully me. I would stop avoiding social engagements and other events if I hadn't slept. I would force myself to participate in life even if I had not slept the night before. I would feel crummy. I would have a headache. But I would face my fears and usually things would go alright. I'm still working on this today. When I have important work events or social events the next day I become very fearful that I won't sleep well. But I know I will show up and I will do my best. I know it won't be that bad. I know there are ER doctors out there saving lives on very little sleep. I know that I will function. This helps reduce my fear of sleep. I tell myself it's not the end of the world if I don't sleep.

Yesterday was my last meeting with the sleep psychologist. I am now on my own and doing well. I still have bad nights every now and then but I feel empowered with my new tools and behaviors. Everyone's sleep issues are different and this might not work for everyone but I wanted to share my experience and what worked for me. I cannot explain in words how much I suffered during my 8 months of terrible insomnia before I finally broke down and sought professional help. I hope I never have to revisit those dark days.

I now have quite a decent job but every sleepless night leaves me exhausted, I sometimes can't even look at myself in the mirror because I feel like I look like shit, my skin doesn't look well and I have bags under my eyes, sometimes I don't even know who I am, just like that dude from Fight Club. I relate to a lot of the stuff mentioned in that movie.

I ""wake up"" aggressive, tired and desperate, then it gets better over the day but as soon as I get closer to going to bed it becomes worse and worse.

Insomnia is one hell of a condition because it is able to cause so much mental and physical damage.

"
4292,"do you sometimes question whether you actually fell asleep or not? After a few days of not being able to sleep, I finally got around 7-8 of sleep. (or at least I think I did?) I'm fairly sure I actually fell asleep but the recent episode of insomnia has me questioning if I actually was able to sleep or not. Does this happen to you?"
4297,Does anyone else get a vibrating sensation in the body when sleep deprived? I am going on 30 hours of no sleep and the familiar feeling of low serotonin is accompanied by a vibrating sensation in my entire body. It reminds me of the feeling you get from a nicotine buzz. I get it everytime I go a night without sleep and I never acknowledged it until today.
4298,"Can’t sleep because of death anxiety. I’m still young, but for some reason I get so paranoid that I’m going to die in my sleep. This is part of the reason of why I stay up all night. I feel more comforted sleeping in the day than I do at night, which I know is stupid because it makes no difference."
4299,"I have insomnia but I also have a bright future One day, I won't need any bullshit drug ,medicine,hormone ,plants whatsoever .

One day, I won't have nasty headache in my forehead and furtherly, I will forget how was it.

One day, I will start to sleep like my past, times that I  even didn't know that people may have trouble while sleeping ; times that I didn't know there is a thing like insomnia.

One day, I will have the power to manipulate my bad feelings-thoughts in order to break the cycle .

And one day, I will start to sleep like a child ,like a baby . "
4300,Better at falling asleep when not in a bed I find when I'm on the couch or even in an tiny airplane seat I'm weirdly much more able to fall asleep than when I'm in my very cozy bed. Can anyone related? I'm thinking I might associate lying in bed with sleeplessness
4301,I finally slept in It’s been almost a decade since I’ve been able to sleep in. I usually get up at 5 am every day with no chance of going back to sleep. I was pretty late today but this is a big W for me. 
4302,"When I complain about my insomnia & sleep anxiety, no one ever takes me seriously. I always hear “just close your eyes and you’ll eventually fall asleep” or “it’s simple, just make sure to not use any electronics” like they don’t think I’ve tried everything in the book. 

Insomnia to me is much more than just not being able to sleep well. Insomnia is laying in bed miserable for hours with the worst anxiety stomachache of my life and knowing tomorrow is going to suck because I’ll be exhausted. Insomnia is having to call off work because I haven’t slept in days. Insomnia is being so anxious to lay in bed at the end of the night because I’m not prepared to go through this again. 

I’m writing this coming off about 20 minutes of sleep all night. I’m exhausted and I’m tired of being told that this is a simple fix."
4303,"A simple exercise that helps me fall back asleep. Came across this while reading Choose Yourself by James Altucher. It helps me to get back to sleep when i'm worrying at night. Hope some of you can benefit from it too!

Here’s an exercise for those who typically wake up anxious and paranoid at three in the morning: instead of counting sheep to get back to sleep, count all the things you are grateful for. Even the negative parts of your life. Figure out why you should be grateful for them. Try to get up to one hundred."
4304,"Sunrise Appreciation Thread It’s the only good part of insomnia. Seeing the world wake up is cool. Even better, it’s a sign that the night is finally over and you can stop tossing and turning and go on with your day. It makes insomnia slightly less awful."
4305,"If you are young and feel this overwhelming activity in your mind, you are not alone. And it is a long journey 32 male here.  And 1:20 am.  I own my own company.  I must meet a client at 8 a.m.  i will. And I will do amazing. Tired or not. 

I have suffered insomnia for over a decade.  I have learned to embrace it when it strikes.  It usually comes in week-long intervals. With months in between strikes.  It is part of me. You must stay mentally strong.  You will not be able to support loved ones with a week mind."
4310,"I’m crying in bed at 5:30 am, third day on a row where I just don’t sleep I just don’t know what to do. I can’t shut my brain off. I didn’t want to take sleeping pills again but I wish I had one. I work as if nothing happened the next day, but I have crippling insomnia. Whenever I do sleep it’s just 4 hours at best. I have a bunch of weird but common symptoms and whenever I ask doctors they have me do some hormonal and blood tests and nothing shows up. Slightly high TSH hormone, and extremely low vitamin d and b12,m. They want me to do the alcat test ( I feel like I’m being scammed out of $1,000 usd honestly) and I don’t know what to do next 

I read that a guy finally ended it after not sleeping for days and it hit pretty close to home. Why can’t I be a normal fucking human? "
4311,"I don’t know why but during my insomnia I get this really powerful urge to just go outside and run. When I can’t sleep, sometimes all I want to do is grab my clothes and go out for a run. Is that insane? "
4312,"Suicide seems very rational considering I’m not compatible with society I’m not sure why the universe would fuck up and create something incapable of functioning properly. I’m seeing my inability to sleep get worse every day, and my mental health is in rapid decline. Doctors can’t help me, the one medication that used to work no longer does anything. I’ve stood out in the yard at 7am staring into the sun for an hour completely naked and read until bedtime without looking at a screen. Nothing works, I can’t sleep, I can’t hold a job and I can’t  seem tonight do anything with my life. I want to check myself into a mental hospital but I know it wouldn’t help. Suicide doesn’t seem like the most logical option at this point, but it’s unfortunate that I’ve wasted this much of my life without anything to show for it"
4313,"To all insomniacs I wish you some rest tonight. Life sucks enough as it is and not sleeping, well that just absolutely worsens it. May you achieve even a few hours of sleep. god knows you all deserve it. Keep fighting the good fight, good days do eventually come, just don’t give up. Best of luck to you all"
4314,"Doctor told me to just ""get over"" my insomnia I couldn't believe it. She literally just deadpans to me ""I just think you need to fix your sleep schedule""

I found myself having to explain that if it hasn't been fixable in 20 years, for not only me, but my mother and my grandfather, it's not exactly a matter of willpower...

Yes, I can ""go to bed"" and cut out all caffeine. Doesn't change the fact that I will just be awake all night some nights and nighttime is always my most productive artistic time.

I couldn't believe a doctor could make such a logical error. Her contract is getting sliced off the clinic budget so she's been progressively bitchier every week since then. Anyone else meet a doctor like this?

I wasn't even seeing her for insomnia just a general checkup and I just mentioned offhand that I hadn't slept last night which lead to the discussion.

4319,"Loneliness is the root of my depression. Even when I’m with people, I still feel alone. It’s like there’s this empty void inside of me that will never be filled, no matter how hard I try."
4320,"After 4 years of insomnia, I have narrowed it down to where I can get a consistent 8 hours of sleep every night without drugs. In order of impact:


1) Lack of wakefulness during the day (★★★★★) Being sedentary, sucked into the phone or working on the computer all day without being outside and moving will make it more difficult to get a full 8 hours of sleep. As soon as you feel tired or sleepy get moving. Get a standing desk, do stretches, jumping jacks, go for walks every few hours. I'm not talking exercise but that's important too (see #2). The less tired/sleepy you are during the day the more you'll sleep at night. You only have so much melatonin in a 24 hour period to use so use it all at night. If I don't actively try to move I can expect frequent awakenings and a mistaken feeling of restfulness after 4-6 hours.


2) Lack of exercise (★★★★) If I don't exercise for 1-2 days my anxiety can be stronger. Expect jumping, intrusive thoughts when laying down to sleep. Just about to drift off and then BAM, intrusive thought. My solution to this is simple. I get out of bed and do 5 minutes of intense exercise. Push ups, planks, squats, etc. Once my heart rate comes back down after about 20 minutes I drift off with zero intrusive thoughts. But normally all I need is 20 minutes of light cardio daily to reduce anxiety.


3) Stress (★★) Often caffeine induced for me. When I have the inability to concentrate on tasks I know I have overloaded on the caffeine. I'll have jumping, darting thoughts and can expect difficulty falling asleep. Meditate or just take a break and relax after work creating a wider gap between work and relax time. I am now a decaf coffee drinker.


4) Flour for dinner (★★) For me eating wheat at dinner (pasta, bread, etc) can create bloating and discomfort which causes restlessness and a lot of tossing and turning.


Other then that I practice good sleep hygiene which I am sure everyone on /r/insomnia is aware about and if you aren't this is something you should read about first. I've also read this book and it is spot on:

4327,"Anyone else feel physically irritable all the time? It's not even my mood sometimes, my skin and muscles just feel irritated. I've never felt like this before insomnia started, even when I got very little sleep because I was studying or something."
4328,"If you aren't tired, don't even bother attempting to sleep. The only outcome is you get frustrated tossing and turning in the dark, and you make your bed a place of stress and restlessness. Sleep cannot be forced if your body isn't telling you to do it, so just chill out and read a book or watch some tv, pet your dog, anything but lying in bed for hours.

 Worrying about insomnia won't help, when you are worried ask yourself: ""can i do something about this?"" If the answer is yes, then why are you worried? If the answer is no, then again why are you worried?"

4330,"Feeling tired all day, but when I get to bed I still cannot fall asleep after an hour?! I literally dream about going to bed all day long, but when I actually do, I feel no signs of falling asleep even after an hour.

It's like my tiredness is not connected to my ability of falling asleep. I just lay in the bed, 10-20-30-60 minutes, nothing.

Also, the more tired I am, the harder I find it to fall asleep.

Nothing makes me more envious than hearing stories about how some people fell asleep in mere seconds. To me, that's impossible, not even in my dreams.

Get up at 6am, no napping during the day, feel sleepy at 10 pm,get to bed and.... Nothing. I toss and turn, unable to fall asleep for hours. I get way too little sleep and wake up tired the next morning only to repeat the same thing in the evening. Then on another day I get up at 10 am and decide to take a nap at 2pm. I get to bed and fall asleep pretty much instantly. What explains the difference in the time it takes to fall asleep when I'm tired in both situations and the bed I sleep in doesn't change?

In order of most helpful:

**What's actually happening:** This research paper (reddit messes up the link, http://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(11)01045-2 ) really pinpoints what the problem is. If you're more educated, try reading the paper. But [here's a news article on it if you can't understand it](http://newswire.rockefeller.edu/2012/01/27/study-of-fruit-fly-sleep-reveals-a-genetic-basis-of-insomnia/). Basically, the insomnia mutation gene has been isolated. The researchers themselves wanted to stay on point with it (because most researchers studying insomnia get sidetracked by something else), and the most important things to know are 1) insomnia is caused by an inability to *stimulate* certain neuron activities responsible for inducing sleep (ie. feeling ""sleepy,"" as opposed to exhausted) and 2) the behavior of this mutation causes a pattern of alternating one night oversleep and and one night undersleep for normal sleep conditions. I used to record my hours sleeping and the graph I made had the exact same pattern.

**The goal:** The idea to get a manage on your sleep patterns (I said MANAGE, they won't be perfect) is to wake up at the same time each day. There was a great video that pinpoints the solution, but I can't find it now. It was a male ASMR video from someone who's been through it before. Anyway, consistent with what my sleep therapist said, the idea is that the time of waking up is more important than the time going to sleep/ staying asleep. To accomplish waking up consistently, you need to set a time where you get out of bed and start your day *no matter what*. If you just finally fell asleep right before that, say, 8am mark, then you HAVE to get up anyway. If you have a sleepless night, this will also be your cut off for when you give up and you can start moving on. Now, this isn't easily. You will probably push your body to extremes the first week that you do this, and it will be absolutely brutal on you, but after the first week or two it will get better. Overall, the process takes about 3 months of patience. Here are some tools to help:

**Sunboxes for bolting down wake up time:** Wake up time, regardless of how much you sleep right now is top priority. This is probably the most effective long term aid. No medications, no side effects. [These can be pretty expensive](http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=sunbox) but they're worth it. You need at least 10,000 lux. If you don't already know, the lamps hit the right bandwidth of frequencies at a high enough intensity to reset your circadian rhythm by using light to simulate a Springtime sunrise. The best way to use this is to have [a mechanical timer](http://www.amazon.com/Instapark-Heavy-duty-Mechanical-Grounded-Polarized/dp/B00O3H03LW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1438605752&sr=8-2&keywords=mechanical+timer+outlet) attached to it and use it on your nightstand pointed straight at you. If you're actually asleep by the time it turns on, the light is powerful enough to shine through your eyelids and will actually light up your dreams (Fucking ridiculous, I know). This is your cue to wake up. I'd say after 3-4 weeks of constant use, your body will consistently wake up 20 minutes before it turns on. I found that after 3 days without using it, I'll fall off the schedule, though. So you need to use it everyday. Expose yourself to it for 2 hours to start. Eventually you can get it down to 30 minutes a day after a few months of use.

**Using melatonin properly to assist in actually falling sleep**: Most people don't think this works because they haven't used it daily for several months in a row. Next step, after bolting down wake up time, is to actually get to sleep. The time you fall asleep matters less, but it's still very important. Melatonin is my preferred sleep aid on the ground that it has no side effects for long term use (we're talking about the next 30 years, not a few months). The most important thing about this is to realize that the role is to stimulate those neuron activities that induce sleepiness. I set an alarm for 9pm and took it the same time every single day. I'd say, give it 3-4 weeks of consistent use before it actually starts inducing sleepiness. This is important. Most fellow insomniacs give up on it after a short time because it doesn't work, but you need to use it consistently for several weeks before your body will recognize the cue. 10mg is a good dose to start. 

**Electronics / stimulation may actually be a good thing**: I've heard the ""read a book and stay away from the computer"" BS enough times to want to shoot someone for saying it. I've found the opposite to be true. I need noise. I usually fall asleep with my phone next to my pillow playing a video that I'm content to falling asleep to. This allows you to point your focus at something arbitrary instead of letting your thoughts roam free. Over the years, I've watched several different kinds of videos. Documentaries are good, so are those 90s FBI crime shows on Discovery (no special effects, no ""futuristic"" sounds, monotone, meant for sleep), mellow let's plays of quieter games, ASMR videos, etc. Basically, first try nothing without a plot. Remember, this stimulation needs to be ok to fall asleep to at any given point. It doesn't have to be a video, that's just what works for me. But the idea is to pinpoint your focus until you drift off. 

I WILL say this, though. Avoid reddit. I've noticed that this website has very similar effects as pulling slot machines. You pull the lever (click next page) and mentally scramble around the findings in hopes of something really good, quickly moving onto the next. I can almost FEEL that dopamine rush form extended reddit use. That's the wrong type of stimulation for sleep. You need something stimulating in a different sense.

**Have emergency, non-medication sleep aids**: Say you've been trying to sleep for hours and you're starting to feel restless. If you try to focus on something, your thoughts will diverge. So I've had a few tools to help me realign that focus when that happens. You really have to just let your fucking thoughts go. Whatever you're thinking about, don't finish that thought. It WILL lead to more. Anyway, idoser's [insomnia track](http://www.i-doser.com/index.html) (can't find a specific link( worked well for me. Along with [this hypnosis video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm4wWHL9YU). Use headphones for both if you want to use those. Focus completely on the audio. If your thoughts get sidetracked, recognize it, pull the brakes, and focus again on the sound. The ""emergency aids"" serve a dual purpose. They're reliable enough for me to fall asleep to a good percentage of the time when I can't otherwise, but equally as important, *they serve as a way to confirm that you'll have a sleepless night*. It doesn't have to be those two things I mentioned, **but you want something that, if ineffective, you know you won't fall asleep that particular night**. That way you can at least get up and do your taxes or something instead of wasting time.

**As far as medications are concerned**: These usually do more harm than good, I've found. I'm sure everyone on here has heard of ambien and what it can make you do. Although these heavy duty aids can work sometimes, I've been able to avoid them for years now. The only medications I use currently are DOXYLAMINE OTC sleep aids (ie. the slightly more expensive one, the other chemical in the US isn't powerful enough). [These are the ones I use](http://www.unisom.com/our-products/unisom-sleeptabs/). About these, if you've been good on the above methods, these SHOULD work *when you start using them*. Save these for down the line, after a few months of the sunbox and melatonin. I'd say avoid prescriptions because we're looking for long term (30+ years of use) solutions. Keeping side effects at minimum is super important. That's why I suggest using only sunbox and melatonin as default. The thing about these is that the rebound insomnia hits VERY hard. So you have no limit yourself to a set time (no more than 10 days). Start with half a pill. By the end of your period, you'll probably need a full one or 1.5 to get you to sleep. Regardless of whether or not it actually helped, stop after that cut off time. The insomnia you get after stopping those is actually harder to deal with than normal, imo. Expect to feel like crap the next morning if these actually work for you, so don't take them if you're doing something social-orientated. You might feel a need to take a nap the next day if these work, avoid that urge.

**Smaller tips**:

* As far as nighttime / morning routines are concerned, they don't need to be extravagant. For night, I pee, brush my teeth, and smoke a cig. That's enough for me. For morning, I'll read the news on my phone in bed and brush my teeth. That's really it. 

* That ""after 20 minutes of not falling asleep"" rule is good, but obviously change 20 minutes to around 80. The idea behind that is to break association of laying down + not sleeping. That can be an absolute killer. When I'm in full control over my sleep, the only times I ever lie down are when I'm about to sleep, and it would take me about 30-40 minutes to do so, a significant improvement over 4-5 hours or none at all.

* For staying asleep, the rule on your diet habits (eating signals your body to wake up) applies well. If you eat something from the fridge because you're up at night, that'll mess you up probably. It's better to deal with temporary starvation than to risk messing it up. But generally, if I wake up in the middle of the night after 3 hours and can't fall back asleep, I just accept it and start the next day on a bad start. There's nothing you can really do as a long term solution. These things will happen, and you have to just deal with it.

* Daylight savings can mess you up. Every year, it screws up my bolted down schedule. So I have to prepare for the shift weeks in advance. That little hour can diverge into weeks of a messed up cycle if I don't prepare for it by going to sleep 1-2 hours earlier weeks before.

* For loneliness, I recommend Skype with people around the world. Or tinychat too. Something more than just text online. You need to use your voice / gestures.

And that's it I guess. That's all I got. This has worked well for me for several years now. Again, **this won't make every night successful, but it will allow you to manage your sleeping issues to where they cause the least possible amount of damage in your life**. I still get sleepless nights. I still have trouble falling asleep some nights. These problems will always be there, but if I get one sleepless night every 3 weeks, then that's really not that bad. I can deal with that. I also focused more on LONG TERM solutions. Taking ambien every night for 30 years is too damaging in terms of side effects. I only use the OTC sleep aids every few months when my schedule starts to drift forward too much. Melatonin is pretty safe. You can eventually drop the doe to 6mg after a few months. The important thing to keep in mind at all times is that this requires patience. If you're an insomniac, you will probably always be an insomniac. Yes, the sunbox might not do anything for you in the first month or two, but after an extended period of time, it'll start to show its effect. I know it's frustrating that you can't sleep RIGHT NOW and that's probably what you're most concerned about, but you need to give it time. For me, I'd say it took 3 months for the initial stabilization and bolting down of my sleep schedule and a total of 6 months before I was able to consistently follow through with sleeping and staying asleep for MOST nights. 

I've been doing well for years. Passed a certain point, maintenance becomes an easy habit. 

Good luck. Hope this was useful for someone out there."
4345,"Anyone else turn into an erratic dickwad when their brain wont shut the fuck up? When I get minimal sleep, which is pretty much every day, I have random bouts every few days or so where I get so fucking angry and want to slam my head through a knife.

4346,"Almost killed myself at work today I do electrical work it requires a lot of focus and since I haven't slept all week it's been hard for me. I was splicing wires together and got hit with 480volts and luckily fell off a ladder. At those kind of voltages you lose control over your muscles and you can get stuck and not able to move so I'm thankful I fell.

4347,"I fell asleep at 6am ans got up at 2pm which is a tiny success for me! Not neccessary insomniac, but I couldn't fell asleep in the evening. Ever.

Which is horrible for my life and gave me neck pain and migraine which brought me to the point to be inable to do anything and be depressed.
After another episode of 1 month of weird sleep patterns like 3-4h twice a day, today I'm finally back to what for me is a time that allows to me be active during the day.

It has got jack to do with responsibility. I can get up at 6am every morning, spend most of the day potato brained and zombie like (perma jet lag), and then when it is bed time I can't get to sleep. Even if my sleep hygiene is good. Insomnia doesn't follow your rules. if all I had to do was ""be responsible and get up at a consistent time"" this problem would have been solved 30 years ago, and it wouldn't even be a medical condition!

It's even worse when the person being such a moron is a medical professional, especially in the field of sleep disorders - you should know better!!

I know what I am supposed to be doing and I am following all the rules. It means exactly zilch to my insomnia, that's life, sometimes sh-- just happens that way.

edit:
>I'm confused. If you're following all of the doctor's advice, then how are you still posting on reddit? The number one thing they tell you is to avoid lit screens as much as possible.

This here is the problem. Someone is always making assumptions about when and why people in this situation are awake. And those assumptions are almost always factually WRONG. I'm normally away from lit screens starting several hours before bed. I do a 10 mile run so I am getting proper exercise. I go to bed in total darkness. I get up at the a consistent time, even on days off I don't need to be up (no sleeping in). But if the topic comes up, I see the same reaction you just had. When I put forth that I too have insomnia and they are just plain wrong about everyone else just being lazy or undisciplined they can't wrap their heads around it and insist people like me just must be doing it to ourselves.

> Many people would rather bitch and complain about not sleeping than actually take the steps they need to fix the problem. It's like going on a diet, you need to develop new habits and avoid old ones to succeed and a lot of people aren't willing to do that.

Sometimes people bitch and complain because nobody is willing to believe that they've done the steps and the problem still isn't gone. It is infuriating. And when I run into someone who's problem is they want to stay up till 3am dicking with facebook on their cellphone I want to smack them for making those of us with a real problem be constantly dismissed.

I noticed early on that those two days a week I would be completely fatigued, so I started taking the pills at night. Two nights a week I'd actually sleep all the way through. 

Now I take 5000iu a night along with a calcium, zinc, and magnesium vitamin which helps with absorption. Voila! I haven't slept this well, this consistently my whole life. Who knows why I have such a chronic case of insomnia, but at this point I'm counting my blessings and not asking questions. "

I tried this stupid thing suggested by my CBT-I coach app - “schedule” time to worry and just remind myself that I’ll worry then, whenever ruminations crop back up. So I told myself no less than 100 times last night, “I’ll worry about that at 9am tomorrow.” By the 70th time I could shut down the thoughts immediately.

Ive never known what its like to fall asleep in under an hour and it aggravates me that i cant be normal."
4368,"Anyone else find it much easier to sleep during the day than sleep at night? In order for me to fall asleep at night, I need to be absolutely exhausted. I can't go to bed when I'm only kinda sleepy or even very sleepy. I need to be so tired I can barely keep my eyes open. For some reason, laying in the dark at night and being unable to fall asleep gives me intense anxiety. It's been a very long time since I've gone to bed before being 100% certain I could fall asleep within 15-20 minutes. I avoid that situation as much as possible.

Up until earlier this year I was typically falling asleep around 4AM, but lately I find myself still awake until the sun comes up. Once the skies start to lighten up a little and I can hear the world outside starting to wake up, it's much easier to fall asleep. 

It's like I'm afraid of the dark, but not. I'm actually fine in a dark room, I don't think any monsters or ghosts or murderers are going to get me. Falling asleep at night just feels really dark and foreboding and oppressive and claustrophobic. It also doesn't help that most of my panic attacks occur at night, in bed, so I associate laying in the dark with anxiety and the feeling of impending doom.

I can avoid all that uncomfortableness by staying up until I can no longer keep my eyes open, but that makes keeping a normal human schedule hard. And I much prefer being awake during the day than being awake all night. The last couple months, two-thirds of my life has been taking place in darkness and that really sucks. 

Trying to reset my sleep schedule never works, either. Today I woke up at 9AM after just three hours of sleep and it's now almost 3AM and I can tell I'm going to be up all night again.

But I realized that my lack of sleep was beneficial to many of my peers. I go to a school that is crazy stressful, both academically and socially, and even though no one says anything or shows anything, it really does take a huge toll on many students. Now, since I was almost always up, I usually just had facebook open whilst I taught myself all sorts of things. And since there was almost no one online regularly at 4 am, I became the guy who people talked to as a last ditch effort before they attempted suicide. 
In the last 2 years, I have talked 37 people out of suicide at least 53 times. I used to bitch and moan about how I hated not being able to sleep, but nothing puts things in perspective quite like wondering if you'd have seen one of those kids in the hall if you weren't awake when they needed someone to talk to.

I know it's not super relevant to the sub-reddit, but one of the girls I talked out of suicide last year just messaged me thanking me for being awake when she really needed someone to talk to.  "
4377,"Does your insomnia come in waves? I work full time as a bartender with my shifts being 5hrs-9hrs and having 2 or 3 days off each week. I'll get one week up to sometimes 3 weeks that I can sleep fine or at least better. Still have to force myself to keep my eyes closes but eventually I drift off. Then I'll get a week or 2 where I get tired halfway through my shifts, but it wears off and I'm wide awake when I get home and can't sleep at all. Tried OTC sleep aids but they didn't help.

Does anyone else get these waves? Any tips or ideas to get better sleep? "
4378,"Does anyone feel like they are at their ""best"" when they haven't slept in awhile? I know this probably makes no sense, but lately I've felt like I had the most energy/was the most creative when I've been awake for at least 18 hours. 

It's very subtle but once I sort of ""notice"" in a sense that I'm feeling that type of way, I have an intense amount of energy and become very awake. It feels manic almost at times. Does anyone experience this from time to time? I work overnight 12 hour shifts and I only noticed this from being SO AWAKE after getting at it ALL NIGHT, instead of having that energy after a good night of sleep, I get it right before I need to lay back down for another night of sleep.

Also, in case anyone asks since it definitely sounds like I'm on drugs, all I ever do is smoke marijuana. I'd deem my use to be fairly heavy, but I go to work completely sober, so the two do not feel related to me. I also do not consume any caffeine while at work/any time I feel this way. 

"
4379,"Why is insomnia sometimes seen as a choice? Whenever reading about the effects of long-term sleep deprivation, there is sometimes an implication that insomnia is a conscious choice as a condition that we subject ourselves to. This particularly applies to (some) ""advice"" given in online discussion boards (ie: ""The body and brain need sleep. Your cognitive functions and general health will suffer."") Yes, this is an obvious consequence. However, this does not provide any viable solution to our problems. It's almost as if some people view sleep deprivation caused by insomnia as something akin to smoking, drug abuse, or obesity, in which the individual has considerable control over their condition. How can anyone willingly go through with this shit? What benefits could it possibly provide?

.

I. HOW I AM GETTING OVER THE FEAR OF LAYING DOWN AND TRYING TO SLEEP

1. Memory is powerful. So I had this idea the other day. What if I practiced that *moment* I am approaching the bed, get in the bed, lay down, and shut off the light? **What if I literally rehearsed it with my body and did everything I could to envision what it would be like to feel peaceful, calm, and ready to sleep? Sort of like acting. So I did. I first sat down on a chair, envisioned my bed in my mind, and pictured laying down. Feelings of dread, anxiety, etc. rose up even just imagining it. And then I pictured what it would be like to feel peace and calm about going to bed. How?** ***I recalled any of the times as a kid when I was just jump in bed and plop right to sleep without thinking about it. I asked myself questions like ""What if I saw my bed and approached my bed as a place of comfort, peace, and rest?""***
2. Next, I **literally rehearsed the action. I started at my bedroom door, approached my bed, flipped open the covers, got in bed and pretend to shut off the light, lay down my head and pass out**. I didn't lay down my head for more than 3 seconds or so...don't wanna train the body to not fall asleep, haha. **All the while, I focused on pretending I was calm and peaceful. I pictured that I had a LONG day and my bones were aching...and that my body was going to collapse as soon as I hit the bed.** 
3. Don't overdo this practice...DO NOT use this practice to *relieve* your anxiety..or else you'll start getting compulsive about it**. Limit your practice to rehearsing 3-5 times, with the sole intent of training your body and mind to** ***consider*** **a positive outcome about sleep. The goal isn't to feel better about your insomnia. It is to train yourself to approach sleeping with a different mindset.** 
4. This sounds weird, but another thing I'm doing throughout the day is approaching my bed, putting my hand on it, and saying out loud, ""This is for peaceful rest"". Sort of like a meditation of sorts. Re associating the bed with rest and peace
5. **I'm staying out of bed and not even touching it throughout the day (other than the occasional ""peace and rest"" mantra"") No laying down on it briefly. No sitting on it to put on my shoes. Nothing. Bed is the holy shrine for sleep and sex. Nothing more or less**. You'll be surprised how this mindset can make a difference over time.

4382,"Lack of sleep makes me more suicidal and depressed When I have a good sleep, I feel very well, no suicidal thoughts.

But when fatigue comes and cannot sleep, then I transform myself into a suicidal person. I become depressed, I don't care about nothing and no one, my memory and thinking is numb. And for what? I start to panic myself when I want to fall asleep. My brain is messed up.

If I didn't have this condition, probably I would sleep 7 hours continously like before.

I really wonder what the fuck is going on here. I just can't sleep. 

I started off like many of you. One night I slept at 2.30 am instead of 11. I thought that was bad (ha fucking ha). Then it was 3.30. Then it was 5.30. Then 6am sleep became common. Then I thought I had delayed sleep phase syndrome and tried to reset my circadian rhythm by staying up. It worked for awhile, then it came back. CBT didn't help me either - you just can't tell me at 7am, after I've been trying to sleep for hours, after I haven't had a full night's sleep all week, that I should focus on my happy place. I don't have a fucking happy place any more because I can't fucking sleep.

4395,"Personal list of what’s worked and what I’ve tried, hope it helps someone find their own insomnia tool kit. I should clarify, I have the type of insomnia that keeps you from staying asleep. I fall asleep quickly 95% of the time, but I’ve struggled for yeeeears with tossing and turning all night, Body discomfort, racing mind, waking up between 1-3am every night, etc. I am also female and have noticed my insomnia cycles with my menstruation cycle. It gets worse around ovulation and menstruation, every month. Fucking yay. Ladies, track your period cycle and your insomnia and see if they correlate too.

Here’s what I have tried and learned. 

Racing mind and general sense of unsettledness or unease has been a long term struggle and the most deeply effecting.  I have tried weekly counseling/therapy, journaling, meditation, self talk, and self awareness practices. Honestly, this is the hardest and most powerful aspect for me. It’s taken years. It has helped. I’m still working on it.  What I have learned is that I didn’t know myself and wasn’t comfortable in my own skin or mind. Learning who I am, thought work, and honesty have helped me address the unease and racing mind. Things that helped most: journaling and counseling, the Unfck Your Brain podcast about managing your mind, and numerous books on these topics.  Also really supportive family and partner. Meditation has also been beneficial. If I find I am waking up from repeating thoughts, I use self talk in the form of “okay, you’re concerned about XYZ and that’s important, thank you for bringing it up. But how is not the time to work that out. We will address this tomorrow, right now we will sleep.” Sometimes that helps.  I am a generally less sensitive and ruminating person now, and that has helped with the anxious thoughts. 
Medication and a good doctor. I finally have a doc I trust and like, and she’s tested me for so much more than any other doc I’ve told I have insomnia to. Tests showed I was severely deficient in vitamin D, B, thyroid hormone, and testosterone. All of these have an effect on fatigue, body aches, and insomnia. I had never been tested for any of these previously, nor did I know they were linked to insomnia. I’m now on a thyroid med, Wellbutrin (for anxiety), and take Vitamin A/D/K, B complex, iodine (I don’t eat iodized salt or other iodine rich foods), high potency turmeric (for carpal tunnel inflammation, also a contributing factor to low quality sleep), and omegas (also for decreasing inflammation).  I also have temazapam as an Rx sleep aid, as needed. I try to take it only when it’s been multiple nights without sleep, which is 1-4 times a month usually. The thyroid meds helped IMMENSELY with fatigue during the day and with the body aches. I noticed better sleep with all of these, moreso with the thyroid and Wellbutrin, and getting the carpal tunnel under control, than with the supplements.  Before the turmeric supplement I would wear wrist braces at night to keep my hands from going numb and waking me up. Those helped somewhat.
Cooler room temp, stand up fan, and Chilipad mattress topper for temperature control. Our bedroom stays 3+ degrees warmer than the rest of the house because of shitty duct planning and a too small AC unit for square footage, and central Texas hell-inspired summer temps keep our AC unit at max capacity just to stay under 78 degrees some days. I sleep best at 68 degrees and below. 68 being my absolute max in order to not wake up sweating in the night. That’s impossible during the summer in our house. The Chilipad is the only thing I’ve found that helps me stay cool through the night, and it was hella expensive for a mattress topper. But goddammit it HAS helped. 
A new mattress. We went with Tuft and Needle memory foam type mattress and it made a huge difference in physical comfort. I wake up less from body discomfort in the middle of the night. I also wake up with little or no soreness, very solid improvement. Thyroid med and mattress combined for a really noticeable improvement here.
Being okay with waking up at 3am every night.  I used to get so frustrated and angry when I couldn’t sleep through the night. Now I am at ease with the fact that I will almost always wake up around 3am. And that’s okay. I wake up, I go for a potty break, come back to bed. No more frustration. That’s just my cycle now. I don’t ruminate on it anymore. If I have multiple wake ups during a night, I try to be calm about it, go out to the couch and read a Dr Seuss book or sit and pet my dogs for a few minutes, then go back to bed. Occasionally changing where I’m sleeping has helped. If I keep waking while in my bed, I’ll go sleep on the couch or guest room for a couple hours if I can, sometimes coming back to my bed after an hour or two. Don’t know why, but changing the sleeping surface has helped some nights.
A hot epsom salt bath, or contrast hot and cold water submersion in the evening.  I am lucky to work in a facility with athletic water submersion tanks so I can do contrast therapy occasionally. A hot salt bath sometimes helps too.

Things that I’ve tried and didn’t work: 
Melatonin. Fell asleep harder but woke up even more awake throughout the night. Hated it.
Magnesium powder supplement. Didn’t notice an effect.
Bed time teas. Didn’t notice an effect, still drink tea at night though cause I like tea and the bed time ritual.
Acupuncture. Could only afford a few times a month consistently, didn’t notice a difference in sleep but it helped with other things that are unrelated.
Fan. No difference.
Reading fictional/light stories before bed/no screens. No difference, or it effected what my dreams were. 
Eye mask/ear plugs. Mild positive influence.
Apple cider vinegar and raw honey drink before bed. Maybe mild positive influence. Haven’t done it consistently long term to be sure.
Wrist braces. Occasional positive influence.
Herbal tinctures for sleep and anxiety. Mild positive influence or no effect. Varied, and haven’t used them in 1-2 years since being on Rx meds. 
Red wine. This shit wrecks my sleep if I drink it anytime even close to sleepy time. Liquor has little or no effect but red wine before bed is asking for a sleepless night. 

Well, there you have it. My personal exploration of anti-insomnia approaches. It’s been a long and exhausting road, and I still cycle through tough bouts of insomnia that leave me irritable, exhausted, and unable to cope with waking life some mornings. But I am far better off that where I was years ago, and my post-insomnia meltdowns are far fewer, with less anxiety and more pleasant mornings than not.   Hope something here helps or gives someone a new approach to try.

My sleeping has been degrading over the last couple years and has gotten to a point where I’d only get maybe 2-4 hours of sleep. I’d wake up almost every hour on the hour. I started falling asleep while driving, falling a sleep at work. It is a disaster.


I live in a huge town that houses one of the best hospitals in the country, so just about every building in my city is either a lab, or a doctors office etc. It’s a gift and a curse because i have so many doctors available to me, but a curse because either they charged too much or they didn’t accept my state insurance. I finally found a doctor but he was so booked i could only schedule an appointment every 3 months. So I just buckled down and waited. I took the sleep study 3 months ago and am just getting the results back TODAY. 


Apparently PLMD, stems from lack of iron, which makes sense because i’ve been anemic nearly all my life. 

However, he still needed to confirm this through blood work so i’m waiting for his call next week. If he’s correct which i think he is, he’s going to prescribe iron pills, and if that doesn’t work, he’s going to start another line of pills who’s dosage would increase every week until I was comfortable.

4397,"I stayed awake all night with sleeping pills only to accidentally fall asleep on the couch after drinking coffee I took sleeping pills and then laid in bed awake all night. I gave up at 5 and went to watch netflix. I took my Adhd meds and had coffee (which I very rarely drink as it makes me antsy with my Adhd meds) around 8 to wake me up and protect the semblance of a natural sleep cycle I had left. At 10:30 after being exposed to plenty of stimulants and sunlight I laid back on a loveseat and rested my eyes (note: I'm like 6'. This was not comfortable) and next thing I knew it was 1 pm and my boyfriend was coming in the door from work

Until about a week ago.

I discovered this by accident - I was fooling around in the kitchen because I craved for something sweet before bed. I took a ripe banana, sliced it open, stuck bits of 70% chocolate inside of it and microwaved it until soft inside. I had some leftover whipped cream, so I put few tablespoons on top. Decadent and delicious, just like me (hah).

Went to bed... and then, black. Next thing I notice it's morning and I've slept 9 hrs. Without waking up a single time. NINE FUCKING HOURS. I've been happy to get about six hours previously, with about 2-3 short wakeful periods in between. 

I went reading about it and turns out all three - banana, dark chocolate and fatty dairy - contain tryptophan, which is an amino acid that is precursor to both serotonin and melatonin. Exposure to blue light makes the difference which it will convert to - take tryptophan during night (or warm lighting), it'll turn to melatonin.

I went shopping and bought more ingredients, and repeated this every evening. Same results - long, interrupted sleep, finally waking up feeling refreshed. Not the most weight-loss friendly meal but oh well, I'm ready to consume some extra calories for good sleep.

Don't try to sleep - that's not how sleep works. It just happens naturally when you are relaxed and you really don't have to do anything, it happens automatically. When most people go to bed they don't think about sleep at all and that's something I had to learn to do, not focusing on it. Easier said than done but that's the solution in my opinion. Anxiety over sleep is the most common cause of insomnia. What I usually do when I go to bed is to just think about interesting things like what happened during the day. You don't even remeber the moment you fall asleep. The key is to relax and avoid creating tension over sleep. You can for example tell yourself that you don't have to sleep etc to release tension. That's one of the reasons it's easier to sleep during the day beacuse there is no expectations. Anyways I hope this helps maybe a little bit. Sleeping in a cold room is also good at least for me. "
4411,"Can days without sleep cause you to act like you are on drugs? My mum does sometimes does deal with sleep issues but it's almost as if she just doesn't want to sleep, because even though she keeps falling asleep it's like she's trying to keep herself awake. Anyway, it's like she is on drugs. She's groggy throughout the day (obviously because of the lack of sleep) but she acts like a completely different person too. Last night she was polishing a doll box, (I'm not too sure why, but she seems to clean more when she's sleep deprived too), so I quickly warned her not to do that because it could damage it, and she got really angry at me and started saying I was picking on her even though I was just trying to help but an argument started anyway. Even when I tell her that she's needing to get to sleep when I see her awake, she gets really angry also and says again that I'm picking on her. It's really stressful because I feel like she wants to stay awake since she's doing things that's keeping her awake when she's about to fall asleep."
4412,"I notice when I'm falling asleep, and the noticing wakes me up. [Update, Solved] A few days ago (Thursday) I posted this after a week of insomnia: https://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/8y9vcj/i_notice_when_im_falling_asleep_and_the_noticing/

After one more terrible night (Thursday night) I've had two good nights of sleep in a row (Friday & Saturday night) so I think I've solved the problem. Here's what worked for me:

1. I went to bed late (1 AM) on Thursday night and set my alarm early (6:30 AM) Friday morning. Thursday was another insomnia night and Friday I was a sleep-deprived mess, but this built up a lot of sleepiness for Friday night which helped me re-boot my routine. I went to bed at my usual 10:30 PM Friday night.

6. I cranked the AC and ran a dehumidifyer all day to make the bedroom cold and dry (well, less humid). I pineapple'd my long hair before bed to get it off my neck. (Sleeping with long hair down is like sleeping with a scarf on.) I also continued my regular usual sleep-hygeine stuff like white noise, pitch-black bedroom, etc.

3. I listened to Jon Kabat-Zinn's guided meditation to distract myself so I wouldn't notice the sensation of falling asleep. His voice is so mellow and soft that it didn't wake me up during that fragile falling-asleep phase. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4gZgnCy5ew  I've used this both nights and it's been working really well -- I'm falling asleep within 10 minutes like I used to. I think this has been the biggest help.

5. I went back to my old routine. During Insomnia Week I changed my routine: in the name of sleep hygiene I stopped having my usual one drink with dinner and stopped watching a re-run of old TV before bed. I started doing those things again.

Thanks everyone for the advice and thanks to the mods for this subreddit. There's so much great information here that helped me figure out the above steps. I hope I help you too.

*Sweet Dreams*!"
4413,"Spend an hour doing this, it might work for you. During a particularly bad bout of insomnia recently, I sat down and did some journalling because it was the only thing I could do with my mind to shut it up. So I wrote down all my feelings about sleep (as well as all the other things bothering me), and gradually I discovered that I kind of hated sleep and had come to think of it as a battle, and as something that brought me huge amounts of stress. I thought back to my pre-insomnia days (literally years ago), and remembered how sleep used to be something I enjoyed giving to myself. 

Then I spent about an hour writing down all the good beliefs I wanted to have about sleep instead. I recently studied this for a book I'm ghostwriting, so I knew that every statement had to be in the present tense, positive, and as though it was already a reality. I realised I needed to think of sleep in the same way as food - absolutely necessary, yet also something you give to yourself, and let yourself enjoy.

Long story short, I have been able to get back to sleep for three days in a row now which, for me, is HUGE achievement. I don't know if it will last, but it has certainly been a welcome relief. "
4414,"Anyone else’s mind race at night? I feel like I wake up 2 to 3 times every night with racing thoughts of just random things, or unconsciously start talking to myself and it keeps me up longer than I want to be. Anyone else have this problem?"

Even if I go to bed early. But when I have to get up early, I cannot fall asleep! Doesn't matter when I go to bed. Before jury duty I had to wake up at 7 am and this stressed me out so much that I got literally one hour of sleep. Anyone else? It doesn't help to tell myself to stop thinking about the next day...the longer I lie there sleepless, the less I can think about anything else than how tired I will be the next day. "
4416,"This sleep routine has saved me many nights, please give it a shot. I am 28 years old I have been suffering from chronic insomnia for the past four years or so. I used to sleep like log, but changes in my mental health fucked me up and overtime I lost my ability to sleep properly. I have major problems falling asleep and staying asleep. It is still normal for me to stay up a whole night or wake up 10 times a night.

As it is with many cases of insomnia I developed anxiety about sleep and the simple act of going to bed elevates my heartrate. Trust me I have tried many medications and life changes: meditation, elimanating blue light, diet changes, melatonin, serequel, ambien, valerian, benzos, I excersise regularly, sleep hygiene, yoga etc..

I have been working with psychiatrists and doctors. I have been very active in trying to find a solution that works for me.

Right now I have discovered the most consistent help for me has come from a simple combination: Writing a daily journal, listening to audiobooks, using medication only in emergency, and immediately getting the fuck out of bed when I cant sleep.

Let me break down these four things:

Audiobooks, Listening to audiobooks in bed is so much more superior than reading, because you wont be falling a sleep if the lights are on. Find yourself an audiobook that is interesting enough to keep you following the story BUT just boring enough that it wont get you excited. I suffer from racing thoughts caused by my general anxiety and anxiety about sleep, audiobooks help me focus on something completely and I have miracolously fallen asleep many times while listening to them. But I must stress again that dont get a book that is too exciting as this wont help you, it will only make the situation worse.

Writing a daily journal: Write down all your successes and failures about sleeping. I cant tell you how many times I have been on the verge of panic at 4am and reading my journal has really calmed me down. I have many entries where I have written ""Cant sleep on the verge of mental breakdown"" only to go the next page and see ""Slept five hours, all is relatively well"". Thats why writing a sleep journal is important, because it helps you keep things in the right perspective when you are feeling desperate.

Getting out of bed: All of us insomniacs know that feeling, you are in bed and you just know that this is going to be one of those nights. I personally notice this by how my thought patterns start getting fucked up and I cant focus my thoughts on anything anymore. GET OUT OF BED! Go to a completely different room, dont lie down just sit on the sofa or something. Do not start playing your favourite computer game because this will just add more fuel to the fire. Just listen to your audiobook, read or write.
I am not lying when I say that I barely have a single night when I dont get out of bed for a while, this helps so much. I usually go to bed at around 10 or 11pm listen to my audiobook for 10-20minutes and get out of bed for 10 minutes and then go back. Repeat until I fall asleep.

Medication is important, but as we all know they should be used very conservatively to avoid dependency. Right now I will pop an ambien maybe 1-3 times a month. Ambien works best for me, but everyone is different, talk to your doctor and get a prescription for something that works for you. The simple fact of having them around will help you calm down since you know that you will always have a backup.

Also like all sleep hygiene guides tell you: Do NOT use the bed for anything else but sleep and sex."
4417,
4418,"I got 5 and 1/2 hours of sleep last night! Success! I took one melatonin tab, used my computer for only 15 minutes, and fell asleep. It took a while, and I woke up at about 5:00 am next morning, but it worked! I finally feel half-refreshed!"
4419,"I slept normally last night. It may not sound like a big deal, but it was. I slept normally last night. It may not sound like a big deal, but it was. I went for a long walk sometime around 4AM last night. I don’t know how long I walked. An hour maybe. When I got home, I wrote a little bit and spent some time on my computer. I think I watched a game of LoL. Then I went to the couch. I realized I was tired. So I turned off all the lights, went to bed, and relatively quickly….I went to sleep. It might have been 6AM, I don't know. 

And I woke up at 11AM, and here I am, at 1130, ready to face the day.

I remember when I used to work overnights, I needed a 24 hour clock because I couldn’t tell the difference between 8AM and 8PM from a light perspective in the summer, and waking up and not knowing by the time whether it was day or not was alarming, and never stopped being alarming. Not knowing if I had slept intensely for half an hour, and would have plenty of energy for a full day, or whether I had slept intensely for 12, and would need to rush to work - to wake up, check a clock, and just not know - was so disorienting the first couple of times it happened that I just set my clock to 24 hours and kept it that way. When people would ask me why I set my clock like that, I’d just tell them the truth.

Looking back, Anton used to do that. Looking back, he used to treat time as I do now. As less than a suggestion. As something that was only relevant in the sense that you knew the world would judge you for not allowing time to treat you the way it treated them. To acknowledge how weird and abnormal it is to allow sunrise to be the reminder that you need to go to bed, and not sunset, or 11PM, or 12AM, or 1AM, like a normal person. Finally passing out at 1PM will never not feel like the act of an insane person.

4429,"Success: Finally sleeping after help from genetic testing I'm not a regular member of this community, but I wanted to catalogue my insomnia recovery for others who may find it helpful.

I carry ADORA2A (T:T). This is not a very uncommon genetic variation, but it has been correlated with caffeine sensitivity causing insomnia, anxiety, and panic attacks. What they have found is that individuals with the gene variation who use caffiene (even as little as a cup of coffee a day) have issues processing emotional stimuli resulting in high anxiety. They have also found that caffiene aslo induces insomnia. 

The caffiene acts as an amplifier, which is why it took so long for me to figure out what was going on. Some nights I slept fine, but if something was stressing me I couldn't sleep. I would wake up at 2 am heart racing and I couldn't get it to stop. I thought I was just anxious because our new baby was waking us up crying in the middle of the night, but why could my wife fall right back to sleep and I couldn't? Even on nights she didn't wake us up I was imagining heariwasher cry. 

I also only started using caffeine regularly since having kids.

Well I did my genetic testing through 23andMe and found research on ADORA2A and thought I would give quiting caffiene a try - all though I thought it was a little ridiculous a cup of coffee at 9 am would wake me up with panic attacks 15 hrs later. Well I have been cold turkey for almost a week and I have slept every single night - even if the baby cries or something goes wrong at work.

It has been a little rough coming off caffiene, but after about 3 days my headache was gone. 

It's wonderful laying down at night and getting rest. I woke up the other day and I was actually awake... insane.

At least a third of population carries T:T variation of ADORA2A. So if my symptoms sound similiar to yours, try quiting caffiene for a couple weeks and see if things approve.

However, I recently discovered something that has lessened my sleep anxiety! My boyfriend and I now call it “time for relaxing.” The other day when I was freaking out about not sleeping he told me, “you know, we never get time to just do nothing. So if you don’t fall asleep, who cares. Just enjoy your hours to lay there, do nothing absolutely nothing, and relax.

Saying and hearing “have a good time relaxing!” Instead of “good night, hope you sleep well!” has helped lessened my sleep anxiety immensely. It hasn’t drastically altered my sleep patterns yet, but I’m still hoping to see improvements. I highly recommend calling it relaxing time instead of sleeping time therefore your body doesn’t stress about the need for sleep.

Just wanted to do a quick poll - how many of you check the time during the night?

that means checking to see what time it is, or how much time has passed, at any point from the moment you go to bed until the moment you have to get out of bed.

I stopped doing this and my sleep improved.

I realized that time is only useful during the day

From the moment I get into bed until the moment I get out, there is no reason to check (saying get out because sometimes there's nothing to wake up from...)

I keep having a really hard time falling asleep as in its taking me HOURS and when I finally go, I still wake up at 3 am so I might be getting 2-3 hours a night.

I was prescribed trazadone but it doesn’t work, just makes me groggy and feel worse the next day.

I take Gabapentin and it used to help me sleep and now I think it’s giving me headaches which also doesn’t help me go back to sleep.

the funny thing is, it happens because I have very intense dreams that wake me up from the intensity. i fall back asleep, then start having this brain-power-intensive dream about running away from the cops or getting a computer virus, and wake up because of it, repeat about 5 times.

I can't have a good long dream, because dreams always wake me up. because of this deprivation of REM sleep I mentally feel unwell. it feels like a hand pressing down inside my skull, pressurized feeling, mild psychosis (hallucinating the bedroom door opening in my peripheral vision), weird thoughts such as gender identity confusion and attachment to the incel community"

Probably TMJ-type stuff, too. 

That's not how I remember it as a kid, but everything sucks when you're an adult, so whatever.

But since I started having this inability to sleep 7 days ago, there have been a few instances where I think I might have fallen asleep, including 2 hours this morning and then 2 hours again this afternoon. I had a moment where I became aware and went, ""did I sleep?"" But that's about all. No stomach cramps. No muscle crap. No really strong feeling of having slept, but a feeling of, ""well, I can't quite place the past couple of hours in terms of either thinking a lot or tossing and turning, so I guess I was...asleep?""

https://www.ted.com/talks/guy_winch_how_to_fix_a_broken_heart?language=en 

This video changed everything for me. 

He talks about how the withdrawal of romantic love activates the same mechanisms in our brain that get activated when addicts are withdrawing from substances like cocaine or opioids—so when we're heartbroken we're essentially going through withdrawal. And your memories are the only thing you can use to get the ""mini-fix"" of methadone that your body craves. 

The biggest takeaway I got from this video is: make a list about every BAD thing about the person or thing making you feel that way, and keep it on your phone. Whenever you try to think about that thing in an idealized way, use the list to remind yourself every negative emotion that made you feel. We have voids in our lives after heartbreak/loss/etc and we need to fill them in different ways to re-establish who we are and what our lives are about.

4471,"I notice myself falling asleep and it wakes me up. This has been happening to me ever since I started trying to learn mindfulness meditation, which is something people swear by not only as a sleep aid but a life aid.

The way it works is you clear your mind and don't think, and when you notice yourself thinking, you kind of ""let go"" of that thought and go back to nothingness.

This is all well and good, except now I've been trained to notice when I'm thinking, and this has caused me to notice all kinds of other things to, like when I start to fall asleep. Having ADD doesn't help, because your mind is just teeming with a million random thoughts. I don't think actual mindfulness meditation is possible for me, and maybe even damaging since I don't think constantly being acutely aware that I'm thinking is healthy. It's distracting. Sometimes I notice it while I'm mid-sentence in a conversation and get distracted by it. 

I don't know if anyone here has dealt with this, but when I notice I'm falling asleep, become aware of it, it immediately wakes me up.

I'll go through this cycle dozens of times for hours on end on bad nights. Over and over and over again, I'll doze off, realize I'm dozing off and snap myself back awake. I ought to fucking work at NORAD on 24 hour missile watch at this rate.

My life before insomnia was like so many others, busy with work, friends, hobbies, etc. 

I was very physically active, training for and competing in a few triathlons every year, and a number of 5ks. I swam, biked, ran, lifted weights at minimum five/six days a week. Living in Florida, all of this ideally should be done in the earlier morning hours before the heat and sun. 

Now that I’m unable to fall asleep until 2-3:30 am and awakening at 9:30-11:00 am, being active outside has ground to a halt, and the saddest part is that I can’t train with my friends anymore because they’re up at 5:30-6:00 am whereas I’ve probably only been asleep two hours by then. 

I feel completely cut off from life. ISOLATED. I don’t even know or understand who I am. I have tried several times to join my friends for evening workouts (done by 6:45 pm) and when I do, I pay a heavy price of tossing and turning ALL night. So, I’ve stopped that too. 

My social circle has shrunk to nearly nothing. I just don’t fit into my friends’ worlds anymore because of the insomnia. 

I asked my sleep doctor two days ago if there was any hope that I may return to a better sleep schedule and get some of my life back. He didn’t flat out say no, but he very kindly said this is my new life and I need to make the best of it.

4475,"Is anyone else ever kept up by trying to monitor the exact moment you fall asleep? I know that's sort of nonsensical, but the last 3 nights I've developed serious insomnia because when I shut my eyes and start to get that ""falling asleep"" feeling somewhere behind my eyes, I immediately think ""This is it! Here it comes!"" and then I'm awake again. At some point your mind has to switch from awake to sleep, and it's weird to think of that moment.

4484,"Sleep restriction, radical acceptance, and melatonin/trazodone/L-Theanine combo have helped me It's been a bit since I've last posted here.

I know this doesn't work for everyone.. and I'm certainly not still completely okay. There are nights where I lay there with my heart beating in my head and ears.. I still wake up once or twice which results in choppy sleep.. But I've definitely improved! And something is better than nothing, in my eyes. No more four days straight with a single minute of sleep at the moment.

After trying so many things, meditation, teas, soothing sleep videos, sleep podcasts, herbs, a huge multitude of pills before I found something that helps, breathing exercises, none of which worked for me, I have found some relief.

I've been doing the Sleepio course, and it's helped considerably. Removing the subconscious association of being in my bed = awake has been so helpful. Though the first nights, it was really rough and fucking shitty. It fucking SUCKS, trust me. I would dread and panic at the thought of the clock hitting the set hour I was supposed to try and go to sleep. But that passes, with the waves of improvement. Sleep restriction and sleep hygiene has been one of the most important elements in my improvement. CBT-I takes work.

Another thing that has helped me is to simply ""let go"".

&#x200B;

What I mean is that I've learnt to be okay with the thought of not sleeping, and I let the thoughts pass without feeding them or giving them any sort of reactions. I put my mind on blank, not thinking about anything in particular, and let my mind run. Don't focus on how scary it is to not sleep and have another sleepless day. Don't focus on how awake or asleep you are. Don't focus on your pounding heart. Don't actively try to sleep, because falling asleep cannot be done at will. Just lay there with a blank mind, letting thoughts come and go without interacting with them. Sleep comes when it does. Easier said than done, right?

That's because this takes practice. It doesn't always help me. But it helps, and it helps a lot when I'm calm and I feel the thoughts coming on. It's not as effective when you're already stressed over not sleeping. In that case what I do is that I get up, not looking at the clock, and do some calming activities in the dark/dim light such as drawing and thinking about things that make me content. Music doesn't help me (I'm bipolar so music usually rouses me and sends me into a hypomanic state) but if that helps you, go right ahead.

&#x200B;

Alongside that, I've been taking a new combo I discovered that drops me dead asleep if done in combination with relaxation and letting go.

This can vary on how hard of a time I'm having while trying to sleep, but here's what I generally take:

***Trazodone 100mg, 10mg Melatonin and 30mg L-Theanine.***

&#x200B;

When I'm having trouble sleeping, I up the Trazodone to 150mg, and if that doesn't work which is rare, I take about 25mg of Quetiapine which is a pretty low dose but the effects are amplified with the Trazodone.

The Trazodone isn't the magic ingredient here as it usually doesn't get me to sleep by itself... It works so much better in combination with something else. The melatonin and L-Theanine have been my saviors. I went two days with no sleep and eventually decided to try them out as a last hope and it worked!

&#x200B;

The unfortunate part about this is that I do feel I've become dependent off pills. I talked to my psychologist and therapist about this and they can both agree that it's fine for now, while I get my body used to sleeping at a specific hour. Hopefully this dependence is temporary. Once I feel I've established solid sleep, I'll start weaning myself off.

&#x200B;

In short, I don't believe there is an ""instant cure"" or ""one simple trick"" to fix or improve insomnia. There are things that take practice, dedication, and patience. That patience you may not have anymore, but if you're like me, you'll try fuckall whatever to get some rest every night. Different strokes for different folks. You might require a different combination of other things to put in practice. What I've suggested here may not work for everyone as I was just voicing my own experience, but I'm just putting it out there!

4485,"Is there strong evidence that chronic insomnia causes brain degeneration? As a chronic insomniac for about 20 years now I've found that my thinking and memory is terrible and its becoming increasingly difficult to hold down a job with any responsibility and expectation to engage in complex situations and efficiently problem solve in comparison to non-insomiacs. On days where I manage to get more than 4 hours sleep I do feel much more alert however and this gives me hope that I am always just one sleep away from returning back to normal brain functioning. I'm still slower than most however, but i've always had an IQ just above average so I try to tell myself that its just my genetics that limits my ability to grasp ideas/concepts than others with higher intelligence. Recently i've been awake for days at a time and its triggered some of the worst depression/anxiety/social withdrawal/brain fog I have ever been through. How do you fellow insomniacs keep going and function in a society where brain function and intelligence seems increasingly valued and have you found that a good restorative sleep has brought you back to baseline or merely tricked you into thinking that a less dumbed down state is in fact normal? Not even sure if I want to find out the answer to these questions as its more things to worry about as I try to get through the day with this crippling condition."
4486,"Can't sleep because I'm afraid of not falling asleep I've been battling insomnia for about 8 years now. Some days, I'm able to sleep fine, but whenever I have trouble sleeping one night, I find that the problem continues for many days until I'm able to sleep fine again. It's like I couldn't sleep until I get past that hurdle.

I have tried Melatonin, but it doesn't work for me. Benadryl and NyQuil (I only took this when I had a cold though) knock me out, but I don't want to be reliant on drugs. Recently, I have tried acupuncture plus some herbs that the doctor prescribed and it knocked me out too. I just don't want to be reliant on it either because insurance doesn't cover it and it's $120 per office visit.

I feel like my insomnia is psychological - I'm unable to fall asleep because I am afraid of not falling asleep. I almost dread when it's bed time. What I did notice though is I find comfort if I'm with someone who's a night owl. For example, a friend of mine recently visited and I fell asleep fine knowing she was still up. At a recent company team building, I fell asleep fine in my hotel room knowing that my co-workers were still up partying in the other room. I normally don't sleep well in hotels. My husband is a morning person - sleeps early, gets up early - and this doesn't help. He falls asleep at a drop of a hat and here I am, next to him, feeling pressured that he's already asleep and I'm still up.

I also remember the very day this all started. I was sleeping soundly and my mom who lives overseas just randomly calls me without even checking what time it is over here. I remember getting mad at her because I was having trouble falling back asleep. Since then, I dreaded going to bed. I don't even know how that particular event triggered it.

I don't really want to be taking drugs or sleeping pills. I know what the solution to my problem is - it is to stop trying to worry about sleep, but I can't seem to get out of my own head! It's easy to say to not worry about it, but it seems impossible to do. I feel like I'm going crazy. Please help.

PS - Another thing I noticed is, I'm also unable to complete yawns. Not always, but a lot. It's like I'm so tired and I feel a yawn coming, but I'm unable to complete it. It's like a half yawn because my eyes still get kinda watery."
4487,"New mattress makes me fall asleep faster So I have insomnia during stressful times but it has been getting better over the past few months. The improvements are mainly due to a change of routine and sleeping habits and recently I noticed a significant change. 
So I'm not sure if it's common or not but many of my sleepless nights were due to physical discomfort, in other words, turning around for hours to find a comfortable position to sleep in.
I got a new mattress a few days ago and guess what, I have been sleeping heavier than usual and don't leave the bed as easily as before. Of course this is not the only factor that kept me awake at night but boy did it help! I never knew it would make such a difference. I feel like I can drift off in less then an hour now! 
What about you guys, do you notice any influence of the comfort level of your bed on your sleep?

To add to that, I've been going to bed at least 8h before my alarm clock to give me a time window to fall asleep and get at least 6h30 of rest.

But last week, in another sleepless night (again), I found Dreem, a headband where we can apparently find effective audio programs that interact with your body and mind to help you relax and fall asleep faster. Here are the key Technics they found and use to improve the falling asleep stage:

Technique 1/ Ambiance

Serenity, Zen, Spirit, music for relaxation and meditation are among the most common strategies to fall asleep. Beyond popular practice, the effectiveness of soothing sounds to accelerate sleep onset has been demonstrated scientifically. These audio environments work because they produce a sound that masks disruptive noise (ticking of a clock, cracking wood, passing cars in front of the house). The excitability of your brain decreases, you let your body relax and drift into sleep.

Apparently, their technical teams have produced rich, realistic tailored versions of sound environments that are known to be conducive to falling asleep.

Transmitted by bone conduction, these sounds transport you to relaxing places so you can sleep in peace. Working in real-time with your brain activity, Dreem adapts the audio to your stage of sleepiness, until it gradually drowns away.
Technique 2/ Breathing exercises

These two features can make you focus on your body rhythm, help you slow down and gently fall asleep.

They are based on methods of conscious feedback on biological parameters, specifically here, your breathink addition to the EEG sensors, the Dreem headband contains a 3D accelerometer that captures the micro movements of your head caused by breathing and a micro-sensor (pulse oximeter) that measures the concentration of oxygen in the blood.

With these two measures, it estimates your respiratory rate in real time. From there, they have Air, a guided breathing exercise. Here, they manage your respiratory rate to reach an optimal point of falling asleep.

Technique 3/ Words

In my opinion, the most interesting feature. Rumination, anxiety, and daily worries are some of the major causes that lead to difficulty in falling asleep.

For all intents and purposes, this is the time when your thoughts, coherent and often stressful, interfere with the processes of falling asleep.

With Words, they accomplish both, prevent you from going back to your ruminations and also help you fall sleep. They have included 3 specific themes, each composed of several hundred words.

The headband will guide you to focus on the words and request you to picture them in your mind. As time goes by, the propositions randomly explore other words. As you concentrate on mentally picturing the words, you will slowly stop ruminating.

Your thoughts will gradually lose coherence. This is the signal for your brain that you are falling asleep, triggering your sleep switch, and biological processes that actually lead to falling asleep. As you drift into sleep, the words scatter and volume decreases.

4491,"Little revelation I had this morning No one cherishes sleep like insomniacs. When my girlfriend is sleeping peacefully in her bed, or my roomates are trying to take a nap, or anything. I go above and beyond to not disturb them in the slightest.

 Because I know exactly how bad it is when all you want to do is sleep, and you just fucking cant."
4492,"I've had some minor sleeping issues throughout my entire life, recently found this podcast called ""Sleep With Me"" and it hasn't failed me yet. It is basically a podcast where a very calming guy tells a story that starts off slightly interesting(enough to take your mind off whatever you are thinking about) and slowly gets more and more boring. I have been using it over the last 3  months and have yet to make it through an entire episode. Who knows how it will work for you but I would definitely check it out:

4493,"After years of insomnia, I think I found something that works (for me, at least). I've had issues with insomnia for years. Most nights, I toss and turn for about 2-3 hours while my darling bf passes out in 5 minutes. It's been very frustrating. I've tried melatonin (which helps sometimes, other times not), using f.lux to change the color of my screen (which does make me sleepier, but hasn't helped me fall asleep), invested in a good mattress, among other things. But still, I would be left in bed, unable to shut off my brain. And that's the thing: my brain won't stop talking. But last night, I think I struck on something. It's gonna sound weird, but I was out so fast afterward that I don't even remember tossing or turning (which usually I very clearly remember). 

I made myself stop thinking in words. It's something that I've been try to practice (because I thought it might help, but just turning it off is really hard). I imagine a microphone in my mind (a boxing referee's mic, for some reason - go, go, subconscious manifestations), and I turn it off. Last night though, if my brain starts to try to think in words again (which it does), I turned the words into gibberish instead of fighting to silence them. 

So it's like: ""I better not forget to blerb a doo fa blabababa uh."" I just let random sounds fill in the thought. Passed right out. 

So I'm thinking (and you can help me test this theory) that, since most of my life revolves around words and speaking (I've degrees in linguistics, math, I teach, write and run tabletop RPG games for fun - so lots of words, all the time), I most often think in terms of words. It's my most active mental state, because it's what my brain does ALL DAY LONG. Wordless thought and light visualization, on the other hand, are really strange to me. But it seems to have put my mind into a low-power mode by not really accessing my swole-as-fuck language centers. My brain, for the first time in a while, felt restive. 

So for those of you with busy minds that keep you awake, what kind of thinking do you do all day? And does that thinking loom over you at bedtime? 

I'm going to keep trying this - it's the only thing that's come close to working  for me. I hope it can help you too. :)

I frequent this sub a lot. This is probably the last thing you want to hear but I feel the need to share. I have had severe insomnia for a couple years now. 4-5 nights a week I'd get less than 4 hours and get maximum one 6+night. For the longest time i thought i was broken. Went to doctors. Thought i was hella depressed and anxious. I tried many medications and self medicated.I know this is the last thing you want to hear when youre up at 4am and thinking about getting up at 6 but IT GETS BETTER. I was convinced that I fucked my brain up for good and ruined sleep forever.

I think my insomnia was depression and anxiety. I worked on myself. I addressed the things that kept me up (consciously and subconsciously at night). I still have shit thats objectively bad and WOULD HAVE KEPT me up but it no longer does. I also took a trip.

Sleeping is a struggle for me. frankly.....being an insomniac was slowly becoming a part of my identity as weird as that sounds. I was accepting the fact that i dont/cant sleep. Id tell my friends about it. Id lurk a subreddit about it. Id take drugs with crazy side effects in order to address this problem.  I DID RELY on mirtazapine, ambien, lunesta, xanax and etizolam to fall asleep. I would have never expected to be able to sleep without even a melatonin. Insomnia is not a part of my identity and I was able to shed it for some reason even if it will only last this month. "
4505,"Only thing that helps me I’m only 23 years old but I’ve gone through bouts of insomnia for as long as I can remember. I generally live a very healthy lifestyle, I exercise a lot, have minimal stress, and eat a good diet. There doesn’t seem to be any real cause of my anxiety, perhaps it is hereditary. Anyway, over the years I have tried many different solutions including melatonin, prescription sleeping pills, meditation and hypnosis apps, and others. However the only cure that seems to do the trick is cannabis. It seems that whenever I smoke before bedtime, I sleep very good. Especially when it is an indica strain. I love weed but I don’t want to get to the point of having to smoke every single night to be able to sleep. I am a regular user, however I find that when I smoke every single day, my anxiety increases. Ideally I try not to smoke more than 3 or 4 times a week max. However it seems to be the only thing that helps me sleep without fail. Sorry for any typos I am currently typing this at 5 AM (fuck you insomnia)."

4509,"I believe thinking too much is causing my insomnia It's taken me like 4 or 5 hours to fall asleep this past whole week roughly. I believe it's because I've been thinking too much. I strongly believe that it's not because of anxiety or depression. I actually don't really have anxiety or depression at all generally speaking, and am pretty happy with my life (Sorry if it sounds like I'm bragging, I'm not trying to.) To explain in further detail, I strongly believe that my inability to fall asleep even within 2 or 3 hours is a result of me constantly thinking about things that make me happy such as: my favorite songs, favorite scenes in movies/tv shows, favorite moments while playing games, and many more other things that make me grateful and happy to be alive.) This said, this isn't doing my sleep life any favors. I've read/heard of tips from others that you need to feel bored to be able to fall asleep. The thing is, I can't think of anything for even a solid one minute probably that bores me. My life (again, I don't mean to brag at all, just wanting to say it as it is for me) has been very great for the past two years at least, and so I honestly am thinking that somehow I'm TOO happy to be able to go to sleep. I see sleeping as being un-productive and getting nothing done and I essentially never want the day to end. I just want to keep being awake and doing things every minute and hour. I'm not going to lie when I say that the only things, basically, that make me sad or depressed is when I know I should be asleep because it's like 2 AM, 3 AM, or 4 AM, but I can't, and I don't even want to. The only other thing that makes me sad or depressed, basically, is knowing that delicious food (at least to me) like Lay's Barbecue Chips or McDonald's French Fries or Sour Patch Watermelon or Flamin' Hot Cheetos are unhealthy. I honestly don't really have like any other problems in my life currently, generally speaking. I just want to fix my sleep life. I just want to be able to fall asleep as quickly as possible, like within 5, 10, or 20 minutes. :/

Edit: One more thing that makes me sad or depressed is knowing that some people are being mean to their fellow human beings  right now as I type this. Whether that be physically or emotionally or through some other means. I just want everyone to be kind to everyone at all times. We're all in this thing called life together and we all should strive to make our lives better and our fellow human beings' lives better!"
4510,"There is Hope Just a reminder to anyone out there who feels hopeless, there is hope.  Don't be thinking that you can't get through this and get back to normal because you can.  I went hard-core sleepless for over a year, multiple nights in a row of no sleep, etc.  You have to know that things change.  If you've always been a good sleeper your whole life but are in a slump right now, just be good to yourself and don't try too hard or go nuts on trying different meds.

Insomnia is an effect of feeling out of control, overwhelmed or uncertain about life.  Job loss...divorce...school problems...new house...health issues, etc.  Having trouble with sleep is not caused from a lack of Ambien or Tylenol Pm...it's an emotional issue, not a chemical issue (talking onset insomnia here).   So doing something over and above what you've always done for sleep is only going to complicate matters...it will feel fake and artificial...lying to yourself and being fake is not a great way to address sleep problems....you can't trick yourself...being fake just creates unnecessary complications, which leads to chaos, which leads to confusion, which leads to more fear.  And the circle begins.

Sleep is what happens when you feel normal, secure, and hopeful about life.  So cling to something, focus on that thing or those things that give you those sensations.  Focusing on your fears or focusing on sleep problems only makes them larger.  Insomnia is not something you fix by focusing on it or addressing it directly.    It's something you fix by focusing on something else, focusing on the things you used to focus on in life.

Your internal fears and anxieties create a tremendous amount of energy.   This internal energy must be neutralized by external energies and stimuli.  This is why many of us get sleepy/ can fall asleep more easily when the tv is on, when people are talking, when kids are playing or when a loud fan is on.   We need that stimulation.  Going to sleep in dead silence is often difficult when we're afraid.  Sometimes I sleep with three fans on and a podcast playing.

So hang in there...be nice to yourself.  Things will turn around if you just be yourself and let things play out organically.  There is hope, even if it seems hopeless sometimes.  Dark clouds will pass...fears can fizzle and insomnia can disappear just as weirdly as it appeared.  your job is to just get out of the way, be normal, focus on something else and let it happen.  Love and good sleep to everyone."
4511,"New here. Can't sleep. It's been over 36 hours now. Hi. Locomotive engineer here. Work all sorts of weird hours. Something daylight, sometimes midnights. They give me a 2 hour call then keep me there (alert and attentive) for 12 hours. Then rest, then another train the next day.  
I don't like to brag but... I'm good at it. I'm very safety conscience about my job. On the train, I have never so much as nodded.  
Unfortunately years has trained me to fight sleep. When I feel my eyelids begin to get heavy on the train, a shot of adrenaline spikes in my body and I'm awake. The thought of crashing and killing my coworkers or the public terrify me, so the adrenaline is a good thing.  
But then I lay down in my bed. I feel my soft pillow. I begin my breathing exercises. I'm in a forest. The sun is warm with a gentle breeze. Slowly breathing. I relax. I feel myself relax my leg muscles, thighs, butt cheeks, stomach, shoulders. Relaxing. Then I feel sleep... Sleep pulls my legs into the ground. I melt and become one with the forest floor. Only my toes stick up until they, too, sink below. Then my thighs. My legs have become dead branches.. I'mying down using a soft log as a pillow, and my chest sinks. My breathing is slow and my mind has given up. Just tidying up a few minor thoughts. ""Cereal for breakfast. Help kids off to school. Walk the dog. Don't wreck this damn train. Water the law.... Wait, what?!? The train?!? Holy crap! I'm about to fall asleep!! Wake up!! Wake up NOW!!"" and a bolt of adrenaline.  
My record is 58 hours. That's with sleeping pills, zquil, mediation, etc.  
Tonight, I'm not in a forest. Tonight I'm in a horse arena. The horse is Sleep. All I have to do is catch it, pet it, stroke it's nose, and hopefully it will carry me off.  But Sleep is unbroken thus far. I can touch him as he mockingly trots past me, but...  
Two chlomo, a Lunesta, shot of Zquil, and a handful of melatonin. It sounds like the recipe for a suicide victim, but it's the only thing that works.  
Sorry for my ramble. I hope everyone on this sub is sleeping, riding that crazy horse or melted into your forest.  "
4512,"One of the things that makes my insomnia worse is that I wake up to pee in the middle of the night and then it takes 1-3 hours for me to fall back to sleep. Any ways I can make it so I stop waking up to pee at night? I have an overactive bladder and I pee frequently throughout the day and at least once every night (and sometimes 2-3 times, but once is the norm). My doctor prescribed me oxybutinin but it did not help and she said if I wanted to try something different I would need to see a urologist. My insurance doesn't cover visits to specialists so I wanted to see if anyone could recommend anything for me to try at home or over the counter before I bite the bullet and go see a urologist? My doctor tells me it is normal to wake up to pee once a night and didn't seem very sympathetic, but I do not think it's normal for it to take so long to fall back to sleep and I think if I could cure my nocturia it would help tremendously with my sleeping issues. 

I do have insomnia separate from when I get up to pee, but it definitely makes the problem much worse for me. I've been taking trazadone and I will stay asleep until 3-4 AM now (used to start waking up around 1-2 AM) when I really need to pee. Once I get up to pee it takes anywhere from 1-3 hours to fall back to sleep. My alarm goes off at 6:30 and I frequently fall back to sleep right before my alarm goes off making me exhausted when it's time to get up. I think the trazadone could possibly help me sleep through the night if I wasn't still waking up to pee every night.

Thanks for your help and tips!"

4514,"Why are the mechanics of sleep so poorly understood? In my opinion, insomnia is an area where there is far too much of an over-empahsis on the psychological rather than biological causes. I suddenly developed insomnia 12 years ago and every year I sleep around 3.5 hours for 9 months and 6 hours for 3 months - I always sleep much better in the 3 months of winter when the days are shorter. In that time I've probably seen 60 doctors. Almost every one of them have immediately said stuff like ""its all in your head"", ""you cant sleep because you're telling yourself you cant sleep"" etc. Now that may be the case for some insomniacs, but not for long-term severe chronic insomniacs like myself. I have long since given up worrying about not being able to sleep and the impact that will have on work the next day. That's simply because I've had so much expereince of working full days after 1 or 2 hours sleep. I simply do not worry about it anymore. On top of that i've meditated for 10 years and that too basically gets rid of any traces of anxiety. 

So I find insomnia is unique in terms of being immediately dismissed as a self-inflicted psychological isse. I've read thousands of articles on insomnia and very rarely do these go in to the mechanics of sleep. It's usually a very superficial level about trying to relax, and the assumption is that the very complex mechanics of sleep will just take care of themselves. The most technical an article will get is usually a mention of the role of melatonin in sleep. 

So why are the mechanics of sleep so poorly understood? I have come across some papers which talk sleep at the molecular level, including details about release of neurotransmitters, areas of the brain which show more activity at night etc. But I've never really seen a very technical explanation of how sleep works at the biological level. I know the brain is the most complex structure in the known universe, but doctors know far more about the mechanics of other neurological conditions, such as epilepsy. 

Given that there are more and more articles every week about the explosion in the number of people complaining of insomnia - the waiting list in my city, Dublin, for a sleep test is now 2 years - it seems bizarre that so much is simply dismissed as ""stress"" or ""anxiety"". Think of the cost insomnia is doing to economies worldwide through sick days and work inefficiencies brought on by chronic insomnia.

It seems to me that what's required is a crowd-funded research project to truly understand the mechanics of sleep at the molecular level, and the various disruptions insomnia causes to these mechanics. 

Would a crowd-funded project such as this be of interest to people?"

4535,"My insomnia treatment success story I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember. Even going to a sleepover party at a friend's house when I was 12 or 13, I would be the very last one awake. My friends would fall asleep long before I did, and then of course in the morning I was very tired.

I had tried everything for insomnia. I gave a very brief trial to sleep medications like Ambien and Lunesta, but they had no effect on me. I was glad not to have a sleep medication addiction, but frustrated that nothing helped.

Things came to a breaking point a few months ago. I was sleeping only 4 hours a night during the week, and then 10 hours on weekends. Every work night I couldn't sleep. My boyfriend told me ""it was all in my head"" (which I knew) but I couldn't change it. I took magnesium and other supplements. My sleep routines were crazy, and if anything was messed up or out of place, my anxiety would go through the roof. I used a blindfold. I used earplugs AND headphones for white noise. Specific pajamas. I tried sleeping on the couch, basement, different beds. I had to start on my right side, switch to my left, and go back to the right. If I didn't sleep I had to go back to the left, then the right. If I still couldn't sleep, I'd lie on my stomach until I felt sleepy then back to my right side.

I was frustrated. Depressed. Dead tired. I thought there was something seriously medically wrong with me. I saw a new doctor, who recommended an online CBT program for sleep. Seriously? CBT for sleep? And why is it so expensive? I asked my boyfriend if I should do it, and his answer was a wholehearted yes. I was furious with him. Ha ha.

I knew about sleep restriction for years but never did it because I knew how awful it would be. Just knowing that I would have to do this I broke down crying multiple times in the first week, and that was just the observation week! I had an incredible amount of anxiety about restricting my sleep. I. did. not. want. to. do. it. I was too tired to restrict my sleep more. Don't make me!

But I did it anyway. I moved my bedtime back 3 hours. I stopped sleeping in on weekends. And I stopped reading in bed -- one of my favorite things to do. And the madness began. I would go to bed, not sleep, get up and go to the couch, and read. Repeat this 2-3 times. I'd finally fall asleep sometime around 1-2 a.m. I would wake up at 5 a.m. and be unable to go back to sleep.

It was hell.

But I kept at it. I had tried everything else, so I figured what did I have to lose this time? I tried to view my later bedtime as ""spare time"" and enjoyed spending it with my boyfriend. I tried to see getting out of bed if I couldn't sleep as more free time to read. I was learning things from the online CBT program, and my boyfriend was very supportive. I logged my sleep each night.

Finally things began to change. In the third week, I finally stopped waking up at 5 a.m. and slept almost to my alarm. I started getting 5.5 hours of sleep every night, but still felt incredibly tired. The next week, I began getting 6-6.5 hours of sleep and sometimes even 7. I actually began to feel refreshed by sleep!

Then the IMPOSSIBLE happened. I would lie down, and almost immediately fall to sleep. This had NEVER happened in my entire life. It had always taken me at least 90 minutes to fall asleep.

My CBT program had said that ""good sleepers don't do anything to go to sleep."" It was happening! I also learned that I do not need 8 hours of sleep and trying to force that to happen just made my insomnia and anxiety worse. I feel great on 6.5-7 hours of sleep. Anything less than 6 and I feel tired. After years of getting 4-5 hours of sleep on most nights this is such a blessing. I am so enjoying the fact that I can lie down and go straight to sleep and sleep through the night.

I did have a setback while on vacation recently. Having to sleep in a new environment and a different bed was difficult, and I didn't sleep much the first night. But I knew that I would begin sleeping well soon. By the third night, I was sleeping much better and was able to enjoy the rest of the vacation.

The most important learnings I took away from insomnia CBT:

- Sleep restriction is #1 treatment for insomnia.

- If you can't sleep within 20 minutes, simply get up and enjoy reading or another low-key activity.

- Use the bed for sleep and sex only. No reading, no cell phones, no TV, no Reddit.

- Consistent wake-up time. No more sleeping in ever.

- Don't go to bed early, and don't go to bed until sleepy, even if it's past your ""bedtime.""

- No naps.

- Resetting your biological clock takes time. Stick with it.

- Good sleepers don't do anything to sleep. 

- I don't need 8 hours of sleep. Trying to force myself to sleep more doesn't work.

TL;DR: I used an online sleep CBT program, and no longer struggle with insomnia on a daily basis.

4536,"The world epidemic of sleep disorders is linked to vitamin D deficiency https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22583560

>**Abstract**

>An observation of sleep improvement with vitamin D supplementation led to a 2 year uncontrolled trial of vitamin D supplementation in 1500 patients with neurologic complaints who also had evidence of abnormal sleep. Most patients had improvement in neurologic symptoms and sleep but only through maintaining a narrow range of 25(OH) vitamin D3 blood levels of 60-80 ng/ml. Comparisons of brain regions associated with sleep-wake regulation and vitamin D target neurons in the diencephalon and several brainstem nuclei suggest direct central effects of vitamin D on sleep. We propose the hypothesis that sleep disorders have become epidemic because of widespread vitamin D deficiency. The therapeutic effects together with the anatomic-functional correspondence warrant further investigation and consideration of vitamin D in the etiology and therapy of sleep disorders.

there is some controversy in regards to what the ideal levels of vitamin-D is. most say below 20 is a problem. some say below 40. There are some reason to believe that the levels recomended here can confer health benefits but they probably  require more attention to co-factors (magnesium, K2 etc) in order to avoid problem.

I am plagued by obsessive intrusive thoughts of dark, sexual nature and night after night I find myself wishing more and more that I could sleep. It is 6:47 AM where I am now, and it is likely I will not sleep for another hour or two.

Short of pumping myself full of meds, I am not sure what to do. I am 23 years old now, and this has been a problem since at least age 12. I am 23 and I feel like I am 33. 10 more years of this will feel like 20. Please excuse my sleep deprived rantings..

4542,"This is my new technique of falling asleep. I’m new to this sub, but I hope I can offer something productive.
I’ve struggled for years with waking up at night and not getting back to sleep but have recently discovered something about myself and my ability to fall asleep. The technique has been working well for about two months and I’m wondering if it could work for others.

The key (for me) was changing how I was thinking when lying in bed trying to fall asleep. 

The ‘aha!’ moment for me was one night being on that cusp of sleep where I was thinking about something, remembering a situation, but then immersing myself within a situation and immediately feeling that rush of my brain transitioning to sleep mode. It was then that I realized that when conscious I’m usually thinking in the 3rd person, sort of like watching myself on TV. When I’m asleep my brain is utilizing all the motor functions in an imaginary way.

It’s a little difficult to describe, but deeply imagine you’re doing something. Imagine all the sensations, textures. Don’t think, but imagine. Don’t picture, but experience.
For example things I imagine; Walking on a beach and feeling the sand on my feet and all the muscles I’m using to balance myself. Running my hand down the back of a large animal (like a horse). Swinging a golf club.

When I wake up at night now it’s usually just a five minute process of reminding myself to imagine a sensation of something and then I’m out again. 

I hope this helps someone.

First of all I would like to say that I never had insomnia like a lot of people here, my issue was not being able to fall asleep for about 2 years now, basically It would take me about 2+ hours on average to fall asleep, I was never been able to go to bed at 10 and get a good sleep, which led to a lot of alcohol which did help me, but was never a viable solution, I would drink on average 9-12 beers weekly just so I can sleep, I started abusing melatonin about a year ago, 3mg never helped, 20mg didn't always helped either, so then I started smoking weed on a daily basis before bed for about 2 months which did worked like a charm, but then again it's not a viable solution. What does work very well for me now is basically writing my thoughts everyday before bed time, basically like a personal diary, followed up by a 10-15 minutes of meditation, which is just having a a candle before you, close your eyes and focus on breathing. Even if it seems to you like nothing is truly troubling you throughout the day, you may just not realise it. I know that it's probably not a new thing for a lot of you here, but I swear that it works for me. I realised that my problem was psychological, but I never understood how to get over it. My fear was not being able to fall asleep, which indeed made me roll in bed for hours. It's been about a week now and I'm falling asleep in about 10-15 minutes, which is quite unbelievable for me, I used to have weeks of 2-3 hours of sleep per night and it made me feel like absolute shit and not understanding why this is happening to me. Anyway, now I've completely stopped with alcohol,weed and melatonin and I'm able to fall asleep at 10pm and wake up at 6, quite unrealistic for me but it is happening! I'm sorry if this method isn't new to anyone here, but if you haven't given it a try, maybe you should try it for a couple of days and see how it works for you. I wish to everyone here to find their solution eventually and live like a normal person. Have a great week everyone!"

Came upon this post by user [babysteve](http://www.reddit.com/r/insomnia/comments/26qc5o/advice_on_things_to_think_about_when_trying_to/chujgdr), and it gave me an idea. It may be a bit silly, perhaps even childish, but I actually kind of like it. First, here's what babysteve wrote about how he falls asleep:

> The key for me is to get your mind away from thinking with words. These might not be specifically to do with stress but help me not stress.
My favorite/best working ones that I've discovered recently are creating a safe place in your mind somewhere comfortable that you want to be and adding lots of detail into the visualization and even thinking about the sounds within it. Mine is a cave with a storm happening outside but I'm nice and warm and dry in my cave in front of the fire...with a blanket, and a mattress... and lots of big leafy plants around (i like plants).

This image was so appealing to me, maybe it's because I'm sleep deprived and the cozy comfort of it all is so soothing. The distant sound of wind howling. It's raining outside, but you're lying there safe and secure by the fire. There is something primal about it; something so incredibly natural that I just feel drawn to this particular image and experience.

So I thought: What if we share this imaginary cave? What if... When tonight, all of us insomniacs with our usual stress, and our invasive thoughts, and our obsessions and what not - all imagine tonight that we are lieing down in that same cave? You brush your teeth in the cave, spread out your sleeping bag. Move rocks and logs around to distribute the warmth. Huddle together, while listening to the rain. Those of us who can't sleep through the night, will promise to stoke the fire so everyone else can sleep securely. And if you have to go do a midnight pee, you walk out to the entrance and watch the starry night through the clouds. When you walk back, you thread carefully so you don't disturb babysteve, or dalsgaard, or any of the other insomniacs who are all lying in the cave.

Insomnia can be a lonely experience. Maybe we should join together, and share that space within our minds. We can make an /r/insomnia cave where we can all return to, when we are stressed and can't sleep. It can be as detailed or as simple as you like. So you're officially invited to lie down by the fire tonight! No need to be scared of predators; after all, at least one person is bound to be awake to spot them!

Wonder if people will like it, or if I'm just going nuts because of sleep deprivation again...

EDIT: Also, maybe someone could draw the place, and we could share what we did in the cave and so on. Make it familiar, and something we share. Talk about our struggles finding it, or perhaps tell a story about how we built a piece of furniture to put in the corner of it, to make it more comfortable. Personally, I'll make a huge pile of firewood tonight. The cave is big enough, so I'll store it a good way inside - it will be so big that we won't have to worry about firewood for a long while."

I'm the type that would eventually get to sleep after 1-2 hours, but wake up intermittently during the night. I would lie 10 hours in bed in to scramble 7-8 hours of sleep in total... This screws with your circadian rythm and your melatonin and cortisol production will be completely off... For me this is exacerbated by short days during the winter. I tried CBT-i, more specifically sleep restriction, tbh CBT-i is pointless without this component.... It did work but it's excruciating to keep up, if you want to be really strict, and honestly you need to be.

&#x200B;

The combo of restricting your total bedtime to 7 max 8 hours however, did work well when combined with Re-timer glasses I started wearing in the morning as soon as I woke up, for about 30 mins. These glasses are great. They blast any melatonin that's left in your body out, giving the body the signal that it's daytime. As a consequence, you WILL feel tired when night comes. All in all, it complements CBT-i very well and you will get results more quickly, without having to stick to bedtimes of say 5 hours or even less..

&#x200B;

Therefore I greatly recommend this strategy, more than taking melatonin directly...Taking melatonin masks the underlying rythm disfunction. On top of that, the sustained release version can seriously mess things up since slow metabolisers of melatonin will have residual melatonin during daytime. I'm not at all against the use of supplements, but you should get the fundamentals of sleep hygiene in order first. This strategy may also make tapering off a med a lot more doable..

(for context, I fit every NHS listed symptom: https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/insomnia )

It's weird though, since I'm used to having it (when I have a good sleep, I wake up in the morning like ""OH MY GOD WHAT THE HELL"") but I'm not sure whether I should even BOTHER doing anything about it now! I was prescribed sleeping tablets at one point, but I read the possible side effects and was just like ""I'll stick with my lack of sleep thanks fam"".

But over the years I've learned how to almost get rid of it completely, and have figured out ways that might be able to help you get some sleep (without medication). Before I start, I may be saying things that could be obvious, but some could benefit...

The most important thing is: Do. Not. Over. Think. Sleep. If you go into your bed at night thinking ""Oh man, I really need to sleep tonight"" Or ""I'm going to try to sleep tonight,"" you're just going to cause yourself to think too much into sleep itself. Remember, **sleep is supposed to be completely natural**. If you have the intentions to go into bed thinking about sleep, you won't get it. You must let go, pre-occupy yourself with something else. When the feel for sleep comes on, just let it happen.

A big thing to note is the temperature of the room. If it's too hot, you will have a harder time sleeping (at least in my case). Another thing is, don't use your phone at all during the night (unless you have f.luX, a blue light filter). Oh, and absolutely do not eat anything after 8 PM. Only drink water.  If none of the above works, I reccomend completely leaving the room and going somewhere dimly lit and quiet, possibly outside. 

Bottom line is, overthinking and relapsing because you realize that you're already so far into the night are things that CAN be prevented IF you follow what's said here. Of course, though, this won't work for everyone, everytime. But I can assure you that it has greatly helped me in the past with times of hard nights.

Good luck out there, hopefully I didn't already say everything you already knew. If I remember anything else, I'll add it here.

**EDIT**: One big thing that I just remembered is, YOUR DIET. If you have a horrible diet (IE: eating junk foods like fast food all the time and/or smoking/drinking alcohol) you need to gradually change that into something better. Go to the store and buy a juicer, and juice carrots, apples, spinach, and kale, at least 4 days a week. Never drink caffeinated drinks like soda or coffee. Cut back on all things sweet (sugar has been linked to cancer alone, among other things, included insomnia). Your poor diet could be the very reason you cannot sleep at night, and possibly why you have anxiety. **ALSO**.

DAE ever feel this way? "
4610,"Emotional freedom, this is the cure. Listen people, I have noticed one thing. Most of us here have some subconscious reason which keeps us up at night. Insomnia happens to almost everybody, but our "" fault "" is that we got caught up with our anxiety and complaints about life. I understood that if you get your shit together in life and have strong psychological set-up, sleep will not interrupt you that much as it does now. It just takes some willpower to let everything go, you are afraid of losing something, you are afraid that you will lose your job or will not get enough sleep as we need to function. It is all natural and for a reason, but we need to change our thinking perspective, we need to fucking let go all of the worries about sleep. Our mistake is that we just strive for sleep, take medicines and drink herbal teas, use some light therapy or put some white-noise stuff in order to sleep. That is the fucking mistake, we WANT to sleep. I don't know how exactly to explain this, but I see many people complaining and hating their lives because of the lack of sleep, and posting stuff like how they lost their jobs or failed exams due to insomnia. Listen, for example you have a pretty good , high wage job and your productiveness declines because of the lack of sleep. At this point, your subconsciousness plays a game with you, it wants you to get fired and live easily, not be involved with your shitty boss or perform heavy daily tasks with great effort. Your subconsciousness wants you to be miserable and just sit at home, watching a football game. The other side of you , it goes against it, it wants to work and make enough money in order to survive. So you get caught up between those two and fucking insomnia kicks in. There is a reason why you stay up all night, and you know that it does not happen suddenly, after you sleep poorly one night, you get less and less sleep for months, and your anxiety increases rapidly. Brain enters the state where it is alert all the time and it prevents you from sleeping. If you are a chronic insomniac, like if you can not sleep since your childhood , you probably do not give much shit at this point , however , I do not think this is the case about most of you. You can reach that mental state where you do not care, where you accept your suffering and exhaustion as normal, do not get stressed or depressed about your lack of sleep. I know how inconvenient it is, I have experienced it for a while and only know I am experiencing improvement in my sleep patterns. Fuck sleep and fuck whatever it causes to your body, mentally and physically. You can also laugh at it and make jokes with your friends about how high you get during the day when you did not sleep the night before. Fuck those news which informs people about "" dangerous consequences "" of insomnia and shit. You do not want to be a whiny bitch, do you? How do you think your problem will be solved with meds? How it is logically possible to enter chemicals in your body in order to satisfy the natural need? Even if you take meds, what are you gonna do without medication? Doesn't your insomnia tend to come back after you give up your medication, as you create not only physical, but psychological bonds with your tradazone for instance? There is no rational danger, you can do your best by not giving a shit no matter how much sleep you get. This is the hardest thing to do, but it is possible and I am living a proof. Just do not let insomnia to destroy your personality. Your  anxiety will not change anything, and you really have a lot of power in order to rule your thoughts.one day I told myself that even sleep deprivation kills me, I will never bitch about it or surf on the internet and "" get help"" . Help is you, as much as you give everything in order to sleep well, you are prone to lose the battle. You will not like my post if you are making an appointment with your doctor about increasing the dosage of your ambien, but still, downvote this post and give a shot to think about what I am saying. Make your sleep issues a slave of yourself, not vice verse.

For the past three weeks I had fallen ill with something undiagnosed, went to the ER, bloodwork came back perfectly fine, still felt crappy, (the ""illness"" has kind of vanished after the insomnia started??) I don't feel like ranting about it right now because I'm over that part. 

&#x200B;

BUT

Fast forward, and dealing with how sick I felt digged me deep into a hole of anxiety and despair. With that came: No good sleep. Anxiety took over my rest and this isn't a normal thing for me but it was pretty tame at first. It's fine, I shrugged it off. One day isn't much for me. I go on hypomanic episodes all the time and I willingly stay up a night to work on my projects. It wasn't too bad.

&#x200B;

Second night.. I felt more anxious. I had been anticipating that night for sleep because I felt like complete ass all day long. But racing thoughts were flooding my head and I struggled around, tossing and turning, reaching points where I was almost asleep but waking back up with jolts of panic, gasping. I would get hungry constantly, eat meals, drink teas. Over the course of the night I got so desperate that I tried FOUR different sleeping meds over the course of several hours. I started with NyQuil, then relaxium sleep (natural sleeping pills that worked fine just nights before), benadryl, and finally I got desperate and pulled out the big guns with seroquel, which I don't take regularly because I usually sleep just fine, I had it prescribed to reschedule my sleep. That night would mark my third day with no sleep. 

&#x200B;

Later that day I decided I'd try to go out on a walk, get some sunshine and tire myself out. I had been laying in bed for over a week prior from feeling crappy. Let me just say that it was a terrible idea. My body was just not in shape. I went outside, I felt like I was walking on air. Pulse racing, felt like I wasn't real. My vision was going white. 

I head back home from the walk feeling like ass, panicking. I called my clinic, asked them what they should do, and they told me that if it got too bad, head to the ER. I tried to give the night a shot to see if I got better, and I just kept getting worse. I head off to the ER in a desperate fit for sleep.

&#x200B;

At the ER, I was basically shoved into a small room with a bunch of loud noises and constant activity. Crying babies, doors slamming, vacuum cleaners, etc. I sat in here from around 9 PM to fucking 1 PM of TODAY agonizing. I was going crazy, hallucinating. Seeing streaks, weird ribbons at the corner of my eyes. My eyes were darting around. They refused to let me go because they believed I had gotten to a dangerous state, and they called a crisis group on me to come evaluate me and see if I had to be sent to a psychiatric hospital for all of this. 

They said that because of this, they couldn't induce sleep because I had to be awake for questions... And oh fucking boy was I enjoying the anxiety of being sent to a fucking asylum because I can't SLEEP and I feel like I'm fucking dying, I was experiencing the worst panic I've had in years. It was unreal. The hallucinations, everything. The crisis people took hours to get there.

&#x200B;

And just an hour before they got there....... I crashed. I suddenly felt woozy and I was actually able to snooze peacefully for 40 minutes until they came and woke me up for the questions. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward, because I slept those 30 minutes, I felt temporarily refreshed, so I wasn't freaking out anymore. They basically just said: you're gonna have to wait until tomorrow so we can contact your mental health clinic to schedule an emergency appointment since it's the weekend for your medication. We can't prescribe anything today.

This marks my fourth day with no sleep. I have this funny feeling in my throat and chest that's making me panic, all too familiar. I can't fucking rest. Tomorrow will be my fifth and I'm going fucking crazy at the thought that the meds won't get me to sleep or calm down and I'll reach delirium and be unable to communicate properly anymore. I'm here just feeling super anxious, trying my best to wind down, when I finally feel calm enough to maybe try and rest my eyes I can still feel my heart pounding, choking me, keeping me awake. 

&#x200B;

These four days have been the worst fucking days on my entire life. I feel trapped, scared of what's to come next. And that in itself fuels the cycle. The fear won't let me sleep and sleep is what fixes the fear. 
I'm home now, dreading tomorrow. My fifth day.

4641,"I get tired at night, start to fall asleep and then I'll suddenly get a jolt of energy and have to sit up. I'll be up until 6 AM after that, wide awake, with restless arms and legs. It's miserable. I'm thinking this issue might be caused by a hormonal imbalance or something neurological. I'm getting ready to start anew job and I'm so worried this will affect my performance."

4644,"Fuck everything. I can't fucking sleep. There's something wrong with whatever piece of fucking worthless meat inside me that makes the hormones/chemicals necessary for sleep. I either stay up for days, exhausted and dead, or clock out in the middle of something important, like... oh, I dunno... driving? Making food with sharp implements? Sitting in class? Making food with heated implements? Drinking? Eating?

I'm so close to just walking into a hospital and screaming my head off until they sedate me. I know that's a dick thing to do to the staff and the people there, but I'm on night number three for the twentieth goddamn time this year and the millionth goddamn time in the last three years and I'm about three seconds away from popping a blood vessel. I have no meds at home besides some bullshit ""natural herbs"" that some asshole gave me that never did anything, and the next doctor's visit is two and a half weeks away. I have work in six hours and school in sixteen hours and I know I'm not going to sleep at any point before those things.

It is taking every fiber of my being not to feed someone their teeth. I hate that this is happening, I hate that not a single fucking doctor - who, y'know, get medical degrees and slog through school for god knows how long for this kind of shit - has managed to proscribe anything that works longer than a week. I hate that the only two things that knock me out reliably are weed and anesthetic - one's expensive and illegal where I live, and the other is fucking never proscribed - and I hate that both of those are so fucking difficult to get my hands on.

I hate that everybody thinks they're a fucking comedic or medical genius when they tell me, ""Just go to sleep."" I hate that my boss thinks I'm a fucking weakling for being unable to wash his shitty dishes for him at his fucking awful restaurant because I haven't gone the fuck to bed in two or three or four or five days. I hate that I can't trust myself to fucking drive because I could clock out and kill somebody. I hate that I'm failing out of school because I can't pull my shit together enough to have enough energy to even make it to class. I hate that I'm a clumsy fucking moron all the time even though I'm about to graduate with a full scholarship to a college I picked out. I hate that I don't have the energy to be around friends, and I hate that I can't fucking control anything about myself past day three. Gotta piss? Better fucking run, because you can't hold it. Gotta shit? Better fucking go, bitch. Someone pissed you off? Better think of something quick, because what little self-control you had left just chucked itself out the window and you're about to tear their fucking balls out through their nose.

Give me something to do. Something I can do besides beating my head against the wall. Literally anything. Any kind of in-browser game, any fucking thing you can think of. I'm about to lose my fucking mind over this mind-bendingly, gut-wrenchingly infuriating bullshit."
4645,"Insomnia emergency. 2 hours sleep in 3 days and a half. Am I going to die? My insomnia has gotten so bad that I can't even get up anymore. I've lost the will to do anything about it. 

The only way I can sleep is if I stay up and pass out in the morning (8 a.m or so). I've been trying for THREE months to sleep early and wake up normally and it hasn't worked ONCE.

Let me start by saying that the people who live above me are absolute animals. They stay up all night and make a lot of noise, so that's ONE fact.

But even on nights when they are not actively making noise (probably because they passed out drunk), I still cannot sleep.

I get into bed, and I follow all sleep hygiene rules on this planet, and I do meditation for HOURS on end, and I breathe like a monk, and I still cannot sleep.

Sometimes it's the thoughts in my head. Sometimes it's a song that won't go away. I cannot get rid of these thoughts/songs no matter how hard I meditate or breathe. It's impossible.

But even when my mind is blank, and my neighbors aren't making me so mad that i'm smashing my fist through my own wall, I still cannot sleep.

I get into bed, and I IMMEDIATELY begin to have hot flashes. This goes on the entire night. I put the blanket on, I begin to sweat and overheat. I take it off, and i'm shivering. 

I don't know what to do anymore. 

I thought I would post this here and see if anyone can share anything interesting. I'm so fatigued  I can barely stand upright anymore."
4646,"Switching to a Gameboy and Kindle has really helped my insomnia If I lay in bed with the lights off then my own thoughts will keep me up for hours. To quiet my mind I catch up on some reading on a tablet or play some games on my PS Vita while laying in bed. Of course I've read many articles on insomnia saying that staring at backlit screens before bed contributes to the problem. Of course I could just buy paperbacks but ebooks are way more convenient and better for the environment. 

I dug up my original Kindle and immediately found myself nodding off while reading. It seems the lack of backlight makes a huge difference for me. I went ahead and ordered a Gameboy Advance and a handful of games from eBay for $25.  The Advance is last model without a backlight. Now the same thing is happening when I play it. I'm falling asleep mid game. As a bonus, the old Zelda and Mario games are fantastic. 

Just wanted to throw it out there for anyone else that likes to read or game before bed. Turns out staring at hundreds of tiny lights can make it harder to fall asleep at night. "
4647,"A trick for brain chatter at night Thought I'd share something that I found a couple months ago works most nights when I get what I call ""radio brain"" where it's like there's a radio tuned into multiple frequencies in my mind, of chatter and music (does anyone get that where you keep hearing a couple lines from a TV show or movie in your head??), and it's just on repeat, around and around and around when I get to bed. I started pretending it was a tape loop I could slow down, so I'm able to listen to it at a slow speed and get some control over it. It's like it helps to slow my entire brain down and I usually start dropping into sleep once I add some deep breathing."
4648,"E.M Cioran, philosopher and author, suffered from severe insomnia all his life. Here are a couple of quotes from him. Cioran is probably too dark for most people's taste. His insomnia was extremely severe, and some claim that he didn't sleep at all for half a century. He used to walk the streets of Paris every night, wearing a black coat and a serious expression. He had a love/hate relationship with his insomnia, thinking it both a curse and a blessing - he believed it had granted him lots of insight, but also alienated him from life.

Here are a couple of quotes he made about insomnia for those interested:

 - What is that one crucifixion compared to the daily kind any insomniac endures?

 - In the hours without sleep, each moment is so full and so vacant that it suggests itself as a rival of Time.

 - Impossible to spend sleepless nights and accomplish anything: if, in my youth, my parents had not financed my insomnias, I should surely have killed myself.

 - Just as ecstasy purifies you of the particular and the contingent, leaving nothing except light and darkness, so insomnia kills off the multiplicity and diversity of the world, leaving you prey to your private obsessions.

 - What strangely enchanted tunes gush forth during those sleepless nights!

 - The importance of insomnia is so colossal that I am tempted to define man as the animal who cannot sleep. Why call him a rational animal when other animals are equally reasonable? But there is not another animal in the entire creation that wants to sleep yet cannot.

And this is what he looked like:

4649,"I can't switch my brain off! Hey all, I have been struggling really badly with my insomnia lately. My primary problem is that I can't shut down and go to sleep. I can and do feel tired, but I often just lay in bed thinking and having my mind go everywhere but sleep for a long time.

I've tried OTC sleep aids, but now I just power through them. The messed up part is that in my waking hours, if/when I meditate, I can easily turn my brain off and think of nothing or blank out. For some reason, I am totally incapable of doing this when I am trying to go to sleep. Once I do sleep, I sleep fine and don't wake up, but this is driving me nuts.

I've always had insomnia problems, even as a little kid, but some times are better than others. Recently I have been through some hard times, got broken up with, moved, changed the hours I keep, my sleeping position/situation, etc. Previously when I was with my ex, we slept together and I could sleep perfectly well. I expect part of this is just familiarity, and situation changes. In that situation we typically went to bed at roughly the same time and in the same manner, which probably helped.

Even apart from her though, I've had better times. Last summer I was sleeping fine on my own, keeping late hours but typically waking at appropriate times and I don't recall having problems. Oddly, I can keep any hours and still wake up fine if I have something important to do, and I don't know why. Right now I have no firm things to do, and end up sleeping way too long. I am currently trying to move my alarms across the room to aid in wake up, but so far haven't slept to test it. I am also going to try to tire myself out more, which was something I felt helped in previous times when I slept better. 

The only other thing I can think of is that I changed my typical sleep position, for an unrelated reason. I don't think this is an issue though, because I've changed my sleep position multiple times over my life. 

So any thoughts or advice? Sorry that was so long, but thanks in advance for listening at least!"

4661,"what if taking your work space out of your bedroom is not an option? I'm sure loads of people deal with this. I have a roommate and I am a music producer so I can't just plop my desk and all my gear into the living room. LOL its kind of a luxury to say ""Have a room for your bed and a room for your work space"""
4662,"Does anyone else have random nights where they sleep quickly and easily, even during the (otherwise) worst periods of insomnia? I notice that my insomnia tends to be cyclical, which, during the worst periods, tends to involve countless nights of a period of light half-sleep at best. This could last for several days, leaving me exhausted and barely adequately functional. I would describe my sleep hygiene as being average, as I do my best to avoid caffeine later in the day and try to minimize my screen time. Even during my best efforts to improve my sleep hygiene, I notice that my poor sleep is relatively unaffected either way. Sometimes, however, oddly enough - I periodically have nights where I do absolutely nothing out of the ordinary, and yet I fall deeply asleep within 15-20 minutes of hitting the pillow for a good 5-7 hours. 

This perplexes me. My theory is that my mind and body are so desperately in need of sleep that the biological need outweighs whatever underlying factor may be preventing me from falling asleep. This lasts for a night or two, and then the deadly cycle repeats itself. Does this happen to anyone else?"
4663,"Self-administered CBT-I with (almost) immediate success Warning: long post

I don’t have any problem staying asleep, I have a massive, sanity-threatening problem falling asleep at a “reasonable” time. So bad I have, at times, broken up my sleep into a few hours at night and a few hours daytime “nap.” I can no longer nap or sleep in and got desperate for a solution. Even considered meds, but I reeeeally don’t want to go down that road. I know all about sleep hygiene, blue light, read several melatonin studies etc. I always resisted the formulation that my problem is discipline-mediated, but I am rethinking my thinking on my sleep. 

I learned about CBT-I and sleep restriction a few days ago and committed to giving it a try. Downloaded the free CBT-i Coach app, developed by Stanford Medicine for the VA (fucking in love with it). For a couple months before this, I’d been consistently advancing my wake time, not sleeping in on weekends. I use Alarmy now so I don’t hit snooze for 2 hours like I used to. But my sleep efficiency (time in bed vs time actually sleeping) has been completely fucked. In my struggles, I developed a Pavlovian association between my bed and misery. CBT-I is helping me break this. 

My average sleep time is creeping up toward 6 hours, which I am thrilled about. My goal is 7, but all things in their time. It’s only been a few days, so I’m fully expecting to have some bad nights and set-backs. However, just knowing from experience now that I am capable of falling asleep within minutes of getting in bed has been a game changer. It feels weird to force myself to stay up when I am sleepy, but I am learning what truly sleepy feels like!

Self-talk has been instrumental too. Rather than dread the next sleep-deprived day, I tell myself I have functioned on zero sleep (true) so a few hours deprivation is nothing! I know the more sleep deprived I am, the better my chance of sleeping well, and it’s all part of the process. 

I am taking ~1mg melatonin 2h before sleep. I don’t think it’s particularly effective, or hasn’t been in the past, but I am doing it to strengthen the Pavlovian conditioning for sleepiness in my nighttime routine. No night eating, no screens within 2h of bed, reading in dim light to wind down (not in my bed!) plus the usual sleep hygiene stuff. 

Just wanted to share my early success. If you all have experience or tips for the CBT-I method, I’d love to hear it (support and encouragement only please). 

**Edit**: It is recommended that a CBT-I program be monitored by a qualified professional who can tailor it to your individual needs and be sure you are doing this safely.

4669,"Insomnia is like a Chinese Finger Trap Insomnia seems to be much like the classic novelty gag, the Chinese Finger Trap.  The more your struggle, the harder you pull your fingers away, the tighter and more trapped you are.  I think insomnia should be dealt with much in the same way as dealing with the Chinese finger trap: by pushing towards it, and leaning into it gently, yet hardly moving....but instinctively we want to freak out, panic and pull away violently.   It's this mindset, ironically, that can keep you trapped.  Read this for an interesting philosophical insight of this novelty item... http://portlandpsychotherapyclinic.com/2013/03/chinese-finger-traps-what-novelty-item-can-teach-us-about-acceptance/

Do you really want to get better and be your old self?   Thinking about how to get better -- how to get out of this -- is not going to help you sleep.  Over-analyzing sleep is not good.  Nor is doing back flips and changing the essence of who you are to appease your fears.  The answer to getting better is to be yourself -- stop pulling so hard.  Stop trying so hard.  There is no need to try to figure anything out, or really ""do"" anything -- virtually all of it is counterproductive...at least it was for me... I had the most insane insomnia ever but I've slept well for many years now.  Yet I still think about insomnia every day...and make no mistake, I'M STILL IN THE TRAP! as we all are -- but I've got wiggle room now...I can breathe...I don't freak out anymore...and I'm sleeping.....  The answer is in the mindset of the Chinese finger trap.  Don't avoid insomnia...don't try to escape it... Move towards it. Make room. Face your fears head on -- make friends with them...be one with them -- go to sleep with them.  One day you'll wake up in the future and notice that they seemed to have fizzled away without you even noticing.

I realize a lot of people here will not like this idea....it's too easy.  it's not sexy.  It's not intellectual.  It's not scientific. Many won't believe it... But it works because it loosens the grip and ends the war.   If any of the quack answers from the world's sleep experts worked then everyone would be cured by now.

It's futile to fight against insomnia.  Digging for answers is a fools game because the answers don't exist.....at least not in my experience.  This is a tough pill to swallow, I admit........But that doesn't mean you can't sleep. I promise you that you can. If I can sleep, anyone can...... Again, stop the war -- be nice to yourself and lean into your insomnia emotionally...become friends with it -- don't run away from it.  It's an unbelievable paradox that goes against all your instincts, yet probably makes perfect sense at the same time. You might be surprised at how being warm, thoughtful, patient and nice to your insomnia problem might help you to remember how to sleep again.   I'm not even kidding.  There's something to it.

  I live this life every day.  I sleep every night.  And if my mind tries to ""pull,"" I have learned to push back in mentally. I don't fight myself intellectually anymore or try to figure things out....This mindset is instinctive to me now...and the thing is, once you become one with your problem and you start sleeping, then you cease to have a problem anymore because you will have learned that there is nothing to be afraid of; insomnia is not something to attack or run away from emotionally...but in fact, it's something to lean in to and be nice to.

4674,"Sleeping soundly for almost 2 months. I was diagnosed with Chronic Insomnia a little under 3 years ago. I've always been a bad / restless sleeper (nightmares, sleepwalking, etc), but I've always managed my ""standard 5 hours"" of sleep. Then a few years ago things took a turn for the worse.

I was regularly going days with zero sleep. Sleep Deprivation Reset Therapy helped when it got bad, but that in itself is its own form of torture and I hated doing it.

I've taken max dosage of every drug available, tried every sleep therapy there is and tried all the ""holistic"" natural shit that you can imagine. Nothing worked well, long, or consistently, leaving me frustrated and at the end of my rope.

Then a buddy of mine with a restless, autistic child recommended a ""weighted blanket"". They're expensive as shit, but at that point I had spent way too much trying to sleep and bit the bullet.

I have not regretted it since. Two months since my initial post on it and here's my follow up.

I'm sleeping soundly EVERY night. I'm averaging 6 to 7 hours, which is ungodly for me, and I rarely ever get up to pee anymore. (No, I'm not wetting the bed. Really.)

I've got a 25 pounder (I really like the heavy, heavy weights), of one of the mid-priced ones (I won't list brand, as I'm sure they're all pretty similar) and it is literally the best thing I have every purchased.

So that's my update. For me, weighted blankets beat out pills, meditation, therapy, and every remedy out there. If you're at the end of YOUR rope, I highly recommend it.

Because I've never slept better.

4679,"Do you ever get so sleep deprived you feel like you're losing your mind? Admittedly, I have a lot more going on that just insomnia but normally I can function decently.

The past 3 weeks or so, I've had insane insomnia. I cannot fall asleep until 5 or sometimes even 7 in the morning and then I wake up around 8 or 9 am.

My brain just feels like it isn't working right. I know it literally isn't because of sleep deprivation but sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind.

I can't think. I get easily confused and I can't remember things.

I know I should probably talk to my doctor about this (I have a non-related appt. in August) but I really don't want her to try to give me a prescription for something like Ambien."
4680,"Anyone else find it difficult to go to sleep before you're so sleepy you can't think? Been having this issue for years and years now. I planned around it in college because I was able to schedule my classes for the afternoon, but now that I'm getting ready to work actual jobs, I feel like it's going to be a huge problem.

Going to bed before I'm 100% can't-keep-my-eyes-open-sleepy is really unpleasant for me. My anxiety increases dramatically. My thoughts race, my heart races, I sit in the dark staring at nothing and thinking about all the things I'm scared of and all the things I'm worried about. I think a lot about death and mortality. I get hot and uncomfortable. It feels like being in a coffin. I don't know why, on paper it sounds like the silliest thing in the world. 

So instead of doing that, I just stay up until I'm incredibly sleepy, so that when I do get in bed I can barely think about anything. In fact, when I'm that sleepy I tend to just think about things that aren't scary - like my favorite movies and video games, girls, traveling the world. Now that I think about it, it almost seems like when I get really sleepy I'm less able to be anxious and I just fall asleep thinking about cool stuff, the way I did back when I was a kid/teen.

Even then, I always keep my phone with me so I can listen to podcasts and/or relaxing music (jazz/instrumental/ambient stuff) in case it takes me a while to fall asleep. When I feel like I'm getting REALLY damn sleepy and can't process what I'm hearing, I pull my earbuds out and fall asleep.

Unfortunately, while this 'works' and I get 8 hours of sleep, my sleep time ends up running from 6 AM to 2 PM. This is not optimal. Even without considering the problems I'd run into with a normal 9 to 5 job, it's still starting to bother me. During my waking hours, the sun is up for 4 hours and I spend the other 12 in the darkness of night. I'm positive this is affecting and compounding my anxiety and depression. I spend a lot of time alone with no one to talk to because everyone else is asleep.

I've tried to 'reset' this sleep schedule quite a few times now. I've woken up at 7 AM after only 2 hours of sleep, hoping that I could be tired enough to sleep by midnight or 2AM at the latest.

But I cannot describe the feelings of dread I get when I get into bed at midnight. It feels like I'm laying down to die. I have no clue why. Even knowing that if I can successfully start falling asleep at midnight, I can start getting up in the morning with the rest of the world and I'd have more time in which to talk to my friends and see the world in daylight and hear birdsong, I still feel incredibly anxious getting in bed that early.

Maybe I'm scared of the night, in a way. Not the dark - I love eating popcorn and reading creepy stories on Reddit in the 4AM gloom. But a small part of me feels like I need to be awake all night. I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so maybe in a way I'm trying to wait until the rest of the world 'has my back' before I go to sleep, in case something happens. Which is silly since there are plenty of emergency service people working at 3 in the morning. But who knows. I don't know how my brain works.

I'm going to try yet again to fix my sleep schedule by waking up at 7 and going to bed an hour or two earlier than I do now - which would have me in bed around 4AM. Small steps. It's just so hard to wake up early and so easy to just stay up all night, even if I'm super tired from forcing myself to wake up shortly after sunrise.

Thanks for reading. Advice, anecdotes, shoulder pats appreciated. "
4681,"Success story... Just wanted to let some people out there know that there really is hope. 

My insomnia started early 2016 and I've only finally managed to cure it 2 months ago. During that years time it progressed from having mild trouble falling asleep some days to staying up until 4am the majority of the week. I tried melatonin, sleep restriction, blue light restriction, all kinds of sleep hygiene, etc. but nothing worked. I pretty much thought that I'd have to deal with it for the rest of my life for a long while until I realized there was a difference between the days that I'd get sleep and the days I wouldn't.

I realized a short while ago that every time I'd drink coffee (no matter the time of day) I'd have a lot of trouble sleeping. It was tough actually diagnosing this since every source I looked at told me that it's really only important to not drink coffee past 5PM or some bullshit. Coincidentally my coffee addiction started early 2016 as well. This coupled with the fact that I already had anxiety when trying to sleep made diagnosing and treating it difficult. Eventually though after I stopped all coffee and soda my caffeine tolerance disappeared and my sleep schedule started to get more regular, although extremely slowly since the anxiety and habit took a while to get rid of.

I still have bad days every now and then if I don't follow a normal sleep schedule (staying up late, sleeping in), but I haven't had real trouble falling asleep for a good two months. My school attendance has gone back to the usual, my headaches are gone, my stomach problems are gone, and I just feel like I'm alive again.

I used to come to this subreddit whenever I couldn't fall asleep and I noticed a lack of success stories, just hoping I can give someone hope out there. Your root cause is probably not as simple as mine but it is definitely worth at least attempting to fix it. Thanks for reading hope this helps"
4682,"I seem to have gotten over my insomnia. Here is my story. About a year and a half ago, in the middle of yet another sleepless night, I made a throwaway account and posted this rant:  https://redd.it/3wx0vf  I had gotten fired a couple months prior and was just starting a new job.

The job I got fired from started out bad and got worse.  It was a manic place, a so-called ""unicorn"" startup.  I found myself having trouble sleeping.  It was a self-reinforcing cycle:  I couldn't sleep so I couldn't think clearly; I couldn't think clearly so I didn't perform well; I didn't perform well so my boss got upset; my boss was upset so I got stressed out; as my stress increased I had an even harder time sleeping -- on and on.  By the end of it I was getting somewhere between zero and three hours of sleep a night and felt like total shit all the time.  It was bad.

After I got fired I knew I had a problem to solve.  I did of bunch of research on insomnia.  There is a lot advice out there, the vast majority of which didn't help at all.  I talked to my doctor about it.  She didn't really have any useful suggestions.  I tried over-the-counter sleeping pills.  They didn't help.  I tried a lot of things.  Sometimes I would get a little better, sometimes I would get a little worse.  It was hard to tell which adjustments were having what effect.  Do I need to turn off all the lights in my apartment after sunset?  Is aerobic exercise the key?  Or does it just depend on whether I will face a stressful situation the next day?

If you go to a therapist for insomnia, one of the first things they will do is give you a form that looks something like this:  https://sleepfoundation.org/sites/default/files/SleepDiaryv6.pdf  You're supposed to fill it out with a bunch of info every morning:  ""What time did you go to bed?"",  ""What time did you wake up?"", ""How well did you sleep?"", and so on.  These questions help determine what kind of insomnia you have, which will determine how it should be treated.  The sleep diary also helps verify that your treatment is working -- your numbers should be getting better over time.

I decided I could save myself a lot of time by skipping the therapist and just filling out the form on my own.  I figured this data, when combined with the research I was doing on insomnia, would basically amount to the same result as a bunch of therapy sessions.

One problem I ran into was just not getting around to filling out the form.  I would forget, or just not have time, or both.  And paper forms are just so archaic in this modern age.  Eventually I ran across zapier.com.  I setup a ""zap"" which would send me a daily email asking how many hours of sleep I had gotten the previous night.  Another zap would pull my reply into a Google spreadsheet.  This system worked much better than the form because 1) I got a reminder to provide the info every time I checked my inbox and 2) I could reply to the email anytime, anywhere; on my laptop or on my phone.

By the time I implemented this system I had already mostly recovered.  I had learned that one of the most important factors for me is getting 30 minutes of sunlight a day (and I need to remove my glasses when I do it because they filter out UV rays).  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy also helped me get over the performance anxiety that would stress me out so badly.  Both of these techniques came from a book called ""[Say Good Night to Insomnia](https://www.amazon.com/Say-Good-Night-Insomnia-Drug-Free-ebook/dp/B005CW6T8S)"", which I found to be quite helpful.

It's now been about two months since I had a bad night, and I feel like it's safe to say I'm mostly over my sleep problems.  A year and a half after my late night rant, I'm about to start a new job at another unicorn startup.  I expect it to be just as demanding as the earlier one, but this time around I feel much better equipped to deal with the challenge.  I now feel eager to succeed rather than afraid of failure.

Having successfully recovered puts me in a position to help other people do the same.  I spent the last couple of weeks building LogSleep.com.  It makes the data collection and analysis aspect of insomnia treatment easier and more convenient.  Check it out if you're struggling and aren't sure what to do.  It's free.  If it worked for me, maybe it will work for other people too.

As a bonus, here is an annotated graph of my sleep records over the last three months:  http://imgur.com/a/vePGk  (Note that I didn't start recording the data until after I had mostly recovered.)

RESULTS
night 1 - I tried going to bed around midnight. I was awake listening to a audiobook for a hour or two. was able to drop off to sleep around 1:30am. It is now 1:15pm and i got almost 12 HOURS OF UNINTERRUPTED SLEEP! if you see my other posts here this is almost unheard of guys. How i feel after i woke up. Lower back is  a tad bit sore as if it had been stretched since i was in a curving position but overall i feel good.when i got out it was like i had a bit of sea legs and was dizzy for a moment but passed quickly.

Night 2: I wasn't able to fall asleep till about 3am last night but didn't wake up will 11am. So i was still able to get 8 hours of sleep it just seems like my circadian rhythm is off. still had a form of sea legs this morning but overall seems to be okay. My back didn't hurt at all either.

Night 3: similar to last night but woke up at 10am

Night 4: Odd sense of not sleeping but knowing that i am/was sleeping. Dreams seem to be very realistic to the point where i can't tell if I was actually sleeping but I am rested the day after. No back pain since day 1. Consistently sleeping but having extreme difficulty getting up in the morning on time. Possibly because it it much more of an effort to get untangled from the hammock thus I just keep hitting snooze. However it has seemed to fix my insomnia for now. I will see how it holds up against periods of extreme stress.

I am not going to fully attribute this glorious night of sleep to the hammock after only one night so ill continue logging my results. But I will say i am very optimistic about this."

I’ll start by saying that compared to serious insomnia, my sleep really isn’t that bad. But I would really like to be able to consistently wake up earlier, and go to bed earlier, so I can get more done and be more productive.

I’m going To bed between 11 and 1230 usually, but sometimes I toss and turn all night and end up sleeping on the couch. There have been a couple of days where I’ve slept on the ground. Sometimes I can’t fall sleep until the sun is coming up. It’s usually anxiety related, and I do take Lexapro and I also take L theanine. I’ve also taken a ashwanda, I’ve tried a Sleepytime tea, I have CBD oil.

I don’t wake up at the same time every day. I definitely over caffeinated, and sometimes drink coffee too late in the day. I have a hard time falling asleep, sometimes melatonin works and sometimes it doesn’t. I don’t want to feel groggy all day.

I don’t have the best sleep hygiene, or use my phone in my bed. I will often take a bath with magnesium salts before bed. Sometimes I take a magnesium supplement.  I sometimes nap. think ideally I would like to go to sleep around 1030 and wake up around six.

Not in frequently I have to pull over in my car and take a nap in it because I’m so tired I can’t function. I did take Adderall for probably about a year off and on, and more recently stopped taking it so that could have something to do with it.  But it was so inconsistent and such a low dose I can’t imagine it being a crazy impact.

I missed a 9am meeting today because I only slept 1 hour, didn't feel well and thought in the moment that getting another hour of sleep was more important.

I had my performance review later today and my boss was obviously frustrated and expressed that my sporadic working hours have been a source of frustration. I burst into tears because it frustrates me too, but I also feel like I work very hard regardless, meet deadlines, and produce high quality work, and it was upsetting that this became the focus of my review, and that this was the first time I was hearing this.

I hadn't been to one of my morning classes in months, and while it is my fault for not just pushing through and going, it's really hard to get out of bed after three hours of sleep. When I would get up and go, I would be so exhausted I wouldn't retain any information and feel horrible for the rest of the day. It's not an excuse (well, I guess by definition it is), but I was always getting to bed by 11-12 depending on when my class was the next day, but I just couldn't fall asleep for hours! It's not like I was intentionally staying up all hours of the night and then complaining about it.

People said I just needed to adjust when I'm going to sleep and fix my sleep clock. Lol. It was never about getting into bed, that was never the problem. The problem was falling asleep.

The key is NOT trying to fall asleep earlier, it's always getting up at the same time! My sleep therapist suggested this to me, but I still just did not have the willpower to get out of bed after barely sleeping. It sounds easy conceptually, but it's much harder in practice. One night I was having trouble sleeping. I tried the 'get up for 15-30 minutes and getting back into bed'. I ate an apple. I drank some milk. Nothing seemed to be working. At some point, I said ""fuck it"" and just decided to stay up the whole night. 

The next day was hell. I felt like I was physically ill. I was so tired I was sick to my stomach. That was the reality of it, though.

The only thing that kept me going was the idea of my head hitting that pillow.

As everyone in this sub knows, it's impossible to describe insomnia to people who don't suffer from it. How can you be exhausted and not sleep? I ended up quitting my job that I worked so hard to get and spent so many years in school for. I went to my doctor for sleeping medication and anti depressants to put me out until I felt I had more energy to focus on getting out of the slump.

Fast forward 6 months. I'd been taking Ambien and Zoloft consistently with decent results. If I took Ambien on an empty stomach it would put me to sleep. Zoloft seemed to help some some negative thoughts in my head. Maybe this was a placebo but I honestly didn't care. At this point  I decided that I was ready to come off the anti depressants. I kept the Ambien prescription just in case. As time went by I started taking less and less. I wish I could say this is where things got better. I wish that after so much time had passed I could say I recovered. I can't. However, this post does have some good to come from what I've learned. 

Present day, I am not taking any medication. I feel like it is just a bandaid to the problem. I decided I wanted to confront the problem head on. I wanted to dissect it and study it. I wanted to see what made it tick and why if fucked me with so much. Some nights I would have given anything for an Ambien. But I didn't. I downloaded a sleep app so I could track when I went to bed and when I woke up. It also tracked how well you slept although I don't know how accurate it is. I felt like I was getting somewhere though. I noticed exercising helped. I noticed drinking alcohol did not. I noticed smoking weed helped. I noticed reading helped. I noticed that going to bed earlier and waking up earlier helped. In the end I noticed some things I could cut out of my life in order to help.

The last thing I want to write about in this post is the coup de grace. The thing that I feel helped the most. It's talked about a lot in this sub but not in the way that it helped me. I practiced mindfulness and meditation for years. I read several books about these things trying to find salvation, anything to help me sleep. I could do these practices during the day but obviously taking day naps does terrible things for your sleep schedule. Nothing worked until I did it my own way. 

The sad thing about this disease is that no one really understands it unless they have been through it. Pills can knock you out, drugs can take you out of reality. But nothing can cure this besides yourself. When you are laying in bed at night you have to be there for yourself. Your spouse laying next to you is not always going to be supportive. Your friends and family are not always going to be supportive. What's helped me the most in the end has been observing my insomnia as a third party. As I lay I bed unable to drift to sleep I observe. I look at my anxiety, my stress and stare at it. I watch it and follow it as it passes by. It always loops back around though to catch you off guard. It puts the pit back in your chest or stomach just to fuck with you. It doesn't want you to sleep. The truth is that it hates being watched. It hates being looked at and recognized. It's hates when you have support. I don't repeat a mantra, I don't try to keep focused on anything in particular, I'm just observing. When you observe you distance yourself from the stress and anxiety. They are not part of you. 

As I have observed my insomnia I've found that there is another side of my mind beyond stress and anxiety.  That side is support. It's weak and its shy but it's there. This is the part of your mind that will always be there for you. It will always support you. It is there to observe your insomnia. It's there to teach that if you approach insomnia without feelings of anger, discouragement, apathy, and hopelessness that you can overcome it. 

This doesn't always work for me. There are nights where I stare out the window down my street and think how nice it would be to load my shotgun and swallow a buck shot. But I don't. I get a glass of water take a drink and approach my bed once again with the notion that I will do nothing more than observe my insomnia and while observing get a glimpse of that supportive part of my mind. Then I'll find myself drifting off to sleep and sometimes that pit won't form in my stomach.

4723,"A surprising remedy I read a few weeks ago a (scientific) magazine article about gut flora/intestine bacteria. It described how bacterial balance affects the whole body through hormone production in the brain. Especially stress hormone management can be damaged by a bad gut flora ([a similar article](http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/333870/description/Belly_bacteria_boss_the_brain)). The article made a hypothesis that insomnia could be caused by a bacterial balance disruption.


Since I've tried every possible remedy during the past decade for my insomnia from drugs to Yoga, NLP and other natural aids, I thought what the heck, I'd better try out this one too.


So after two weeks of using lactacid supplement, I'm starting to see a positive effect. Instead of feeling tense, not sleepy at all like usually when going to bed, I'm feeling drowsy and sleepy. And falling to sleep is much easier than before.


I can't say for certain whether the lactacid supplement actually works but the results are promising. I sincerely recommend trying."
4724,"Recently developed insomnia. Struggling with keeping time, and Fight Club was surprisingly correct about how it feels. For about a month I've been sleeping less and less. I'm not sure why, but I just can't seem to sleep. It's gotten to where I'll get three hours (in the afternoon) if I'm lucky. My nights are filled with Reddit and Facebook. I have too much time to click around, and I feel like I've run out of internet to explore. The biggest thing I've had to cope with is time loosing all meaning to me. I know how it feels for time to pass, but it's getting difficult to tell exactly how much that is. Concepts like ""today"" and ""tomorrow"" have become nothing but words. Arbitrary names given to seconds before and after midnight. Just numbers on a clock, it's all the same to me at this point. I can remember events, but I couldn't tell you if they were today or yesterday. Time has slow down and sped up at the same time. I can only assume some of you know what I mean by that. 

I watched Fight Club the other night, and the narrator talked about insomnia. The following is no big spoiler, just an aside about insomnia at the beginning of the movie.

""With insomnia, nothing's real. Everything's far away. Everything's a copy of a copy of a copy.""

That's exactly how I feel."

4738,Who else has this pattern? You sleep fine for a night but then proceed to stay up all night the next night or only get 1-2 hours of sleep because of anxiety or whatever and then feel like crap all day and then get maybe 6 hours the next night. I hate this insomnia shit man.

I'd rather have insomnia then have problems standing up & my legs going out on me. And no it's not soda because I mostly drink water.but I'm bi polar, have pain issues & have epilepsy.so all 3 dr's says contribute to my insomnia.but I think the depression part is the main issue.

I am working on that, but something has started to happen and it is that when I finally fall asleep, it is like a part of me is sleeping but another part not. I dream a lot, but the part that says I am not sleep tells me all the time that is a dream and make me fell aware about what is going on around me in the “awake life” if this make sense. The point is that I do not rest at all! And I would think the next day I will feel tired, which I feel, and fall sleep easier, but nooooo! It is the same! Has some one has experienced this?

4743,"No motivation to leave my bed in the morning Hi. So, i do have trouble with insomnias, but that's not what's been on my mind lately. What is on my mind is the fact that when i wake up, i just can't leave my bed and go to classes, like i should do. Instead i just stay in my bed for hours after i wake up, not sleeping or doing anything at all, just laying in my bed with my eyes opened. I think that the main reasons for that to happen are two: the first one is that i've been depresses for quite some time, so it's hard for me to find motivation to do even the simple things, like cooking, leaving my house, and i even find it difficult to just wake the f*** up and go to college it seems. The other reason is because i'm straight up lazy. Nothing more, nothing less, just lazyness. So that's why i'm here in this sub. I know that this is really dumb and that is not directly about insomnia, but for the lack of a better subreddit for this subject i'm making a post it here. And maybe there is/was someone in the same situation than me. If that's the case, could you give some advice?"
4744,"2am vs 6am So just about every night this week I have woken up between 1-3, wide awake. I've attempted to fall back asleep each time to no avail. I usually toss and turn for 1.5-2 hours and then give up. It is almost an indescribable feeling. I feel so mentally alert and my mind is so active. I want to know why. Because, I generally fall back asleep around 5am - 1 hour before I have to get up. At 6am, when I have to get up I am so exhausted all I want to do is lay in bed, I struggle to get up. That is the infuriating part. It is 3:53 as I write this, I have been up since 2, and feel like I could run a marathon.

Does anyone share this problem?

Note: I fell asleep tonight around 10pm, so I slept for almost 4 solid hours. Could this potentially be why I am not exhausted? I've read that 4 hour cycles are the most efficient ways of sleeping."

4751,"Sleep Diary #3: My family thinks I’m crazy for the lengths I go to fix my sleep. Undiagnosed delayed sleep wake phase disorder, but seeing as it gets diagnosed by self report, it’s definitely what I have. When I have to keep a morning schedule, it’s indistinguishable from sleep onset insomnia. Been dealing with this for 15 years. I recently got a day job that starts soon so I embarked on an intense mission to fix it. 

Here’s what I’ve been doing for the last ~~9~~ **10** days:
- Get up at 6am without exception. I use Alarmy app and now I do not hit snooze. Ever. 
- Expose myself to at least 30 mins of bright light within an hour of waking. Local weather does not often cooperate so I got a phototherapy lamp I just started using. 
- After ~5 pm I switch to dim light mode. This means closing shades and wearing a pair of blue spectrum blocking safety glasses over sunglasses. When the sun goes down I can ditch the sunglasses and just wear the blue blockers, keeping indoor lights dim as possible. 
- about 2h before desired bedtime, I take ~0.3-0.5mg melatonin (instant release). I was taking over 1mg but it caused early waking. I can’t find less than 3mg in store so I’m cutting the tablets into eighths, hence the range of dose estimated. 
- Screens go off not long after I take the melatonin. I read a book to wind down. 
- No eating after about 8 pm. 
- I’ve been delaying bed time until I am very sleepy, which has been happening earlier each night just about. I’m now at a 10:30pm get in bed time for the last 3 days. 
- sleep hygiene - dark room as cool as I can get it. I sleep with a fan blowing on me, good for cooling and white noise. I don’t even spend time in the room, let alone the bed, until I’m going to sleep. 
- No caffeine after 12pm, but I usually have my last cup around 10am at the latest. 
- Tracking sleep with a diary using the free CBT-I Coach app. Also gives tips to deal with anxiety and structure my routine. 

I think that about covers it. So now for the results:

My **past week*** average time in bed has been 7.2 hours, sleeping 6.6h, sleep efficiency over 90%. I have woken at least once on 5 nights, but I’ve been able to fall back asleep within a few minutes most of those nights. Twice recently I slept over 7 hours and felt great. My charts show a definite progressive increase in sleep time, with some hiccups. Maybe this doesn’t sound great to you guys, but I was coming from a 2-3am (or later!) bedtime 95% of the last decade and a half. I’ve felt tired most of this past couple weeks, but I’m really happy with my progress and I no longer seriously fear I will lose my sanity at my new job. Posting here has helped me keep up hope, so thank you all for bearing with me. 

***Edit**: my sleep log app was giving averages for the past 7 days only. I mistakenly thought it was a running average. For the entire 10 day period, my averages are: time in bed 7.05h, time asleep 6.35h, sleep efficiency 90.1%"

4753,"How I cured my own middle insomnia (take 2) *(Disclosure. I am not a doctor. This is how I found a way to cure my illness. I hope there is something useful in it for you but none of this should be taken as medical advice.)*

In between caring for a sleepless toddler, a stressful job and a mutating side project, something broke. Don’t get me wrong things were braking along the way. I put on 20kgs, I had severe reflux and suffered chronically low mood. But when things improved on the home-front and the reciprocal improvement on the health front did not present I knew something wasn’t right.

Most marked of the continued ailments was an in-ability to sleep for more than 4 hours and, more often, no more than 3. I would not wake up in a panic, stressed about the days events, I didn’t wake up short of breath. I would just gently rouse from sleep and seemed to lack the ability to un-rouse from waking.

Gradually though, over the course of 3 years I would grow to understand the code that would unlock the curse of this midnight albatross. It wasn’t a conventional cure. Exercise, for example, which I anticipated as the obvious remedy was like poison for my sleep. The harder I trained the worse I slept. So I was left to put out a fire without water and no concept of fire extinguishers. This is how I did it.

## A failure of “obvious” remedies: Initial miss-steps

## Exercise Elixir or Poison?

The most crushing blow to solving my sleep was the realisation that exercise, which I assumed as the most obvious elixir was actually a type of poison. Running, swimming, interval training, BJJ, bike riding all seemed to make sleep worse. The more intense the exercise the shorter my sleep duration and the more assertive my wakefulness and sustained inability to get back to sleep. This sucked. I love to exercise.

## Magnesium and Natural “sleep aids”

Magnesium is often touted as a sleep aid so I tried it with a variety of chelates. None seemed to increase the length of my initial sleep. They allowed me to doze after initial waking but I would have a headache and fuzzy thinking by the time it came to wake up.

The same result seemed to derive from natural sleep aids. Valerian, Passion flower, bachs remedy, tart cherry, ashwaghanda K-66, hops all would help me doze after waking but I would have the same lethargy/headache and fuzzy thinking by the time I came to rise. I was getting sleep purely for the sake of getting sleep. Refreshment for the next waking period did not seem to be included.

## Heat

At some point I heard Rhonda Patricks podcast on Sauna and heat exposure. I would subsequently try this with increasing sleep length in mind. Perhaps unsurprisingly this had the same effect as exercise with similar pronounced wakening and reduced ability to get back to sleep.

## Fiber

It took me A LONG time to really connect the dots between fiber intake and reflux. Reflux was an accompanying sympom of my sleeplessness. It’s hard to say how related the reflux was to my midnight waking, but it definetly contributed to occaisions where I couldn’t fall asleep and was a condition that made life significantly more miserable.

I knew about FODMAPS and the elimination diet and yes I should have had a more earnest attempt at these diets eariler. It took my until I came across the book by Norm Robillard the Fast Tract Diet for my awareness of the fiber to really hit home. If you’re suffering indegestion or reflux I can’t recommend Dr Robilliard’s book highly enough, it’s supported by research and Robilliard is coming from the position of someone who suffered from and alleviated himself of the condition. When I read it I significantly reduced my fiber intake and the resultant improvement in my reflux were immediate.

## So what made the difference?

My resolution of sleep was solved in what turned out to be a series of 5 steps outlined in chronological order below.

1. 23&me Nutrahacker recommendations NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract, Creatine
2. Alpha Lipoic Acid
3. Quercetin, Green Tea Extract & Aspirin & natural sleep remedies (Valarian ect)
4. Lifestyle interventions
5. Strategic exercise: Mitochondrial Density Training

If I were to apply what you could call Shylocks Razor to the problem, where, the cheapest and most efficient steps should be taken first it would probably look more like the steps below.

1. Alpha Lipoic Acid
2. Lifestyle interventions
3. Quercetin, Green Tea Extract & Aspirin, natural sleep remedies (Valarian ect)
4. 23&Me Nutrahacker recommendations NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract, Creatine
5. Strategic exercise: Mitochondrial Density Training

Note that it is likely that these supplements have a synergistic effect meaning they work much more effectively as a group than as independent supplements. This is likely due to the fact that insomnia is an illness of multiple failre points which need to be remedied independently. It may thus be important to take the supplements as a group of supplements rather than on their own.

It’s important to reiterate that this is only what has worked for me. I think if you follow a similar methodology to me you will also find a solution but the actual supplements you end up taking are likely to be different, particulary those recommended by 23&Me, to what I have taken. This will be due to differences in biology form person to person.

## 1. 23&me Nutrahacker recommendations NAC, Zinc, Broccoli Seed Extract, Creatine

Somewhere in mid 2016 I discovered[ Nutrahacker.com](http://nutrahacker.com/). This site is one of several “recommendation engines” that makes nutritional supplement recommendations based on your 23&Me chromosome data. These recommendation engines are quite nacent and as a result they’re considered pseudo scientific. Regardless of this, for me Nutrahacker was a candle in the darkness.

The key benefit that Nutrahacker provided was clarity on what I needed to avoid. Specifically B6 and Magnesium. These supplements are consistently recommended as beneficial to sleep yet for me when I’ve taken them in supplement form, my reaction has always been adverse from hypervigilance and aggressiveness (B6) and anxiety and sub-par digestive outcomes (magnesium). The fact that Nutrahacker supported my previously held assumptions did give me greater faith in the recommendations.

They also provided recommendation I what I should take which I’ve discussed below.

## Recommendations that I took up

## Broccoli Seed Extract.

Broccoli sprout extract made all things digestion better from reflux to expulsion. Taking Broccoli on it’s own didn’t seem to have a massive impact on sleep but because my digestion seemed to work much better I persisted with it.

## Creatine

Creatine was a sneaky one. Why would I need a bodybuilding supplement? Sometimes you’ve got to have faith. After taking creatine my low mood improved substantially. As far as helping with sleep, it seemed to make a big difference when I took it with zinc. Why? Who knows but it worked.

## Zinc

I’d taken zinc in the past and not noticed any improvement in sleep. I didn’t really notice an improvement in much actually so stopped taking it. Then randomly on the same night I took Creatine boom a great nights sleep. The effect has been repeated for several months now as of the time of writing this.

## NAC

For me, NAC is a wonderful supplement. It helped tremendously with my reflux and it just seems to make everything a little smoother.

## B Vitamins

I take B Vitamins in the form of vegemite which is an Australian yeast spread every morning. It has a savoury taste and for those uninitiated is pretty disgusting. I don’t know if the B Vitamins make a huge difference but I like Vegemite so B Vitamin intake is easy.

## 2. ALA (Alpha Lipoic Acid)

The Nutrahacker recommendations made me realise that my liver was likely a key player in my inability to sleep. This was supported by a blood test that showed elevated liver enzymes. There is also a consistent theme in Chinese medicine that waking up in the middle of the night is caused by liver dysfunction.

My solution for this? Look at what supplements are good for the liver. Alpha Lipoic Acid was cheap and well researched so I tried it. The results were immediate. I felt better upon waking after taking this supplement like I had a deeper sleep. My appetite also seemed to work on a much more even keel after taking supplement. This added benefit was a pleasant surprise.

There are other supplements with evidence suggesting benefit to the liver. Under a dr’s supervision I would assume that these would be worth trialing. Note that at this stage I have not trialed any of the below.

St Mary’s Thistle

TUDCA

I now take ALA around 20 minutes before every meal. Most suggest it is best taken on an empty stomach.

## 3. Quercetin & Green Tea Extract & Aspirin

One of the most noticeable symptoms of my lack of sleep was that my feet became hot at night. In fact my whole body temperature seemed elevated. I know that the deeper someones sleep the cooler their body temperature. Perhaps if I could lower my body temperature I could entice myself back to sleep.

I tried a cold water bottle on my feet. I tried a cold cloth on the back of my neck to know effect. A cursive google search also did not seem to reveal a great deal about supplements to lower body heat.

I did however find that Quercetin was considered a natural antihistamine. Histamine is produced as part of an inflammatory response which can bring along with it a general rise in body temperature. Perhaps an anti-histamine supplement would help?

I tried Quercetin with a natural sleep aid that contained valerian and hops. In the past, as mentioned above, the natural sleep aid didn’t seem to allow me to get any depth of sleep. With the quercetin though I seemed to sleep a little deeper.

Based on advice from the Examine.com I was informed the Green Tea Catechins would be synergistic with Querectin which I thought would be worth trying. This also seemed to work well. Finally I added 100mg of aspirin to the mix as an anti-inflammatory. When I took the 4 supplements together (including the sleep aid) it has generally been a knockout, although for reasons which I suspect to be due to having a later dinner or a stressful day at work their intake is not always a magic bullet.

A note of Caution. **Do not exceed the recommended daily dose for green tea extract.** There are, on record, several examples of liver problems that have been known to occur from overzealous green tea extract supplementation. Stick with the instructions on the pack.

## 4. Exercise: Mitochondrial Density Training

As described above, exercise, made my insomnia significantly worse. This pattern continued even with lifestyle and supplement interventions. There was however one exercise pattern that seemed to circumvent the midnight waking phenomenon. Podcaster Ben Greenfield calls it Mitochondrial Density Training and uses the work of Richards lab as evidence [https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.196303](https://physoc.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.196303)

The idea is that it boost mitochondrial density in your muscles. To achieve this you need short sharp high intensity efforts followed by long (up to 4 minute) rest periods in between. This method seems to provide a form of cellular fatigue without compromising sleep.

If I took a guess at why it doesn’t compromise sleep I would suggest that it has something to do with the lack of heat generated. Both Sauna and intense exercise were detrimental to my sleep which suggest that heat regulation may play a role in my insomnia. Mitochondrial Density Training allows you to get a workout without overheating

## 5. Lifestyle

My experience with lifestyle modification is that you need immediate feedback. Without the feedback, will power becomes compromised and your best intentions cave. Although some lifestyle modification won’t immediately mean you sleep longer there may be other variables where you can judge of their effectiveness. Mood, energy, alertness, digestion are good areas to keep an eye open for.

Keep note by the day of any improvement. My rule of thumb is that if I didn’t notice any improvement within 3 days it was likely to be a waste of my time.

## Dinner time

An early dinner time had an immediate impact on my sleep quality. I noticed that after an early dinner, when I woke during the middle of the night I would fall asleep much more easily.

## Desert

In addition to an early dinner time, I also found cutting out any form of desert helpful. I found cutting out chocolate in particular meant a better nights sleep. Although I’m a huge fan of chocolate I must admit that I don’t miss it after sharply reducing it. If you live for chocolate though, perhaps after abstaining for a little while and making improvements in your sleep, you may be able to bring back deserts and a richer dinner before bed.

## Alcohol

During this time, mainly due to my social situation, rather than any form of will-power I benefited from low alcohol intake. I’m acutely aware that it is very difficult for young people in the modern world to pry their lives from alcohol. The reality is that I think trying to solve insomnia without reducing alcohol would be extremely difficult. Even after 3 years of low alcohol intake I still couldn’t break the insomnia curse.

This may leave you with a conundrum. How to reduce alcohol and maintain a healthy social life.

Here is one suggestion. Test how refreshed you feel after a night of 1–2 drinks compared to a night of zero drinks. I think you will appreciate a difference. This at least verifies that alcohol is not good for your sleep. Not even a small amount. Just like desert perhaps you need to give it up entirely for a month or so. Once your sleep integrity is back, perhaps you can look at reintroducing it back to your life.

## Coffee

It seems the case that some people function really well on coffee, I though, am not one of them. When I reduced eliminated coffee I noticed a slight improvement in sleep. I would advise downgrading to dark or green tea. When I did this I found that my reflux symptoms seemed to improve a little. My sleep also improved a little also.

## Stress & Play

Stress for a long time actually really helped me. My stress allowed me not to sleep. It let me get a lot of work done. It justified me being an arsehole. But once I realised that I the amount that I had in my life wasn’t helping it wasn’t as simple as just doing a meditation session to turn the stress off. I had an actual addiction to stress. I logically understood that it wasn’t helping but I couldn’t just turn away just from being mindful.

Easily the biggest thing that helped me turn away from stress was realising the importance of play. I re-discovered the importance of play whilst listening to an Austin based author called Charlie Hoehn talk about his battles with the black dog and how play helped rescue him from it. He has a book that I can totally recommend called Play it Away. If you’re a little younger than me perhaps just employing play as a strategy may be enough to remedy your situation. It did for Charlie

## Other resources

Late in my solving of this problem I came across the self hacked website. It made me appreciate how important inflammation is in the clusterfuck that is insomnia. I have not purchased any of their plans and still it has been a great resource for me. If you’re stuck, at $69.00 USD I think Self Hacked is a reasonable price. Keep in mind you do need 23&Me data.

A slightly more well organised site that most readers will know is Examined.com This is another truly wonderful resource that allows you to verify the claims of many of the supplements you’re looking to try out. It’s not quite as pathology focused as self hacked and may come across as overly clinical, which isn’t always a bad thing. Even better the majority of the content on the site is free.

Last of all I need to also thank Rhonda Patrick, Chris Kresser, Mark Sisson and Ben Greenfield for holding a torch in the initial stages of my health Journey. They have not intentionally helped me but I have mined their sites (and listened to their pod casts) for information on the most obscure of ailments and they have been very helpful. They all operate with great integrity and are slowly making the world a healthier place.

## Conclusion

For me, there was no silver bullet to improving my sleep. There were however lots of small tokens that continually thrust me in the right direction. I hope this post will be one of those tokens for you in helping solve your sleep problems.

4754,"Discussing your insomnia My insomnia came up in a casual conversation with relatives and when asked how I was dealing with it, I admitted that it’s worsened. In return, I got various tips on how to deal with it (chamomile tea, lavender, meditation, the works - all of which I try now and again with varying results depending on the day), which I expected, but also comments on how I need to “turn my thoughts off” or “physically and mentally exhaust myself”. I didn’t want to argue because I figured they can’t relate to insomnia. However, I came away from the conversation feeling as though my insomnia was just dismissed.

4759,"Really concerned: 20+ years on nightly ambien and I'm supposed to stop? Anyone else done this before? Hello,

I have severe sleep onset insomnia for over 20 years. When it first started, I consulted a sleep disorder clinic and was diagnosed with something physiological causing it. I don't want to be tedious about the details.

The dosage of ambien I began at in the 90's was 40 mg a night with the option to take a 2nd 40 mg, a whole lot higher than now. I dropped to 30 mg. sometime in the 00's and 20-25 mg. when the FDA recommendation changed.

Since then, my doctors have been fine about my continuing for the most part, since I had a real battery of tests showing the degree of my problem, but the pharmacies in my area have refused to fill my prescription, and now my doctor of 15 years is retiring. I highly doubt a new doctor will be willing to prescribe this dose, even though I have zero side effects on it and it still works okay. My doctor has told me this outright. 

Without ambien, I just don't sleep. I don't notice any withdrawal from it. 

I've also come to the conclusion that I may not really be an insomniac so much as someone who gets very physically and mentally ill from a lack of sleep, if that makes any sense. Because it's sleep onset insomnia from a specific medical issue, I don't find any other medication to have worked, and I have literally tried everything on the market.

I'm getting desperate and thinking about just stopping before I am forced to stop (which would prompt so much stress for me), but then I'm afraid I will lose my mind. Literally.

Sometimes I can manage on 15 mg. but only if I stay up all night first.

What I find online is few stories of people coming off of long-term and higher-dose ambien, although I know there must be others. And I also find few stories of how sick people get from not sleeping: I wind up with severe vomiting, an arrhythmia, and my blood sugar all over the place and have had to be hospitalized once from this, and yet I still can't fall asleep because the medical issue awakens me the moment I start to drop off.

I am terrified."

I get trrrible panic attacks when I don’t sleep which keeps me up even longer. Usually I am able to calm down and fall asleep after 2-4 hours with the help of NyQuil. Yesterday I was only able to fall asleep for 2 hours. Last night, I still could not sleep. I laid down at 4am and slept maybe 15 mins. I just kept laying there until almost 8am. I’m scared because this time I literally could not fall asleep. My brain would not shut off. I was not having a panic attack or thinking anxious thoughts. I just could not fall asleep. Now, the very top of my head hurts extremely bad like someone hit me over the head. It’s sore and it could be a brain tumor or something neurological.

TLDR:  Found out I have sleep apnea, waiting to hear from Dr on what to do next.

I went to my sleep test on Thursday night.  Had reserved parking, checked into the clinic on the 5th floor.  Passed a lot of pissed off people in the lobby who were in town to see Bruce Springsteen, thought they had reserved rooms, but they didn't.  Oops.  The clinic was in a sectioned off part of the 5th floor, and I had to be buzzed in.  Once in, I signed a bunch of forms, and they took me to my room.  I was in my room by 7.30pm.  As soon as I was in, my nurse came in, and told me my Dr had ordered a ""double test"" or something like that.  I had no idea what she was talking about, she said that my Dr told them that if I had signs of apnea within the first 2 hours, they had to hook me up to a cpap for the rest of the night and record my results of that, too.  So before lights out, she brought in the nasal mask and hooked it up to the cpap that was next to the bed.  She had me wear it to get used to it just in case she needed to put it on me later on in the night.

The nasal mask was actually wonderful.  It very soft, and as soon as I put it on my ears popped and I could hear.  And If I opened my mouth just right, I could sound like Darth Vader:)  

A little later, she came back in with a crap ton of wires and boxes and stuff.  I had to put wires down my pant legs, down my shirt, she put wires on my head and face and legs, connectors to all of that and on my back and boobs.  And to top it off, she taped stuff to my finger, and some plastic thing that stuck out of my nose.  I have pictures, but it has me in it and well, I'm not confident enough to be made fun of on Reddit.

She told me that if I had to use the bathroom later on she would come in, unhook me, let me pee, and hook me back up in bed.  The poor lady didn't know she would do that twice that night:(

Anyway, I took 2 Ambien and that's all I remember.

When I woke up the next morning, she said that I stopped breathing within the first 2 minutes of falling asleep, I had dreams, and I got up twice to use the bathroom.  They did put the cpap on me, and I had no problems for the rest of the night.  That was all she could tell me, so now I have to wait to hear from my sleep dr about what to do next.

Just a side note, there were 10 patients from all over the southeast that night.  1 nurse is assigned for 2 patients.

**********************************



TLDR:  I've had various degrees of insomnia for 40 years, and I am going to an overnight  sleep study (where they hook me up to stuff)  on the 17 to find out why.



I've had various degrees of insomnia since I was about 7 years old.  (I'm 47 now).  I believe it started because of the abusive house I was living in, mother was a raging alcoholic and would like to beat on us kids in the middle of the night.  All 3 of us would huddle in bed and the second we heard her rants turn to us, we knew she would stumble up the stairs and start on us, so we would hide. We would go out a window to the roof or under a bed or in a closet.  This went on for 5 years, until I was taken away by the state and sent to live with my father (who I didn't know) in a different state. 

I remember in those years that I had to move my legs at night to get to sleep.  I don't know if it was a comfort measure or RLS.

Once in the new state, I started sleep walking.  My father tells me stories of how I would get on the dresser and say that I was going to fly away.  I don't really remember having sleep problems during my teenage years, but when I reached my 20s and started working, I found that I could not fall asleep at night.  Back in those days (late 80s), not much was available for sleep and I didn't have insurance anyway, so I just worked 3rd shift on all of my jobs.  I was still moving my legs to sleep at night, which was brought to my attention by various boyfriends over the years.

Once married ( in 1999) got pregnant and that is when my legs really took off.  It was really fucking unbearable.  I would beat on my legs in an effort to get them to stop making me feel like they had to run.  Plus I gained a ton of weight, which started me snoring, and I still had a difficult time falling asleep at night.  

Currently, I find it impossible to fall sleep without Ambien.  I've been on 20mg's for 10 years, and it works.  It hasn't stopped my legs from feeling weird, but I can lead a perfectly normal life, take Ambien, go to sleep, and do things that normal people do without feeling tired.  But since I never lost the weight I gained, my husband says I wake up constantly throughout the night.  (I don't remember because Ambien).

I'm at the point where I want to get fixed, and since I have insurance, I might as well use it because this shits expensive.  Last week, I went to Vanderbilt Sleep Center and met with a young doctor who is board certified in Behavioral Sleep Medicine and Neurology.  She rocks.  This entire place rocks, this entire place is all about sleep.  I'm hopeful they will find out what is wrong with me.

She told me that the dose of Ambien I am on is not good, and the latest recommendation for women is at the most 10 mg.  And that there are no long term studies on Ambien and women.  So she told me to reduce my dose to 10mg a night.  (which I haven't done, my bad).  She also put me on a low dose of  gabapentin 100 mg, which I can take up to 3 if needed, for my legs.  And she also insisted that I buy a copy of ""Say Good Night To Insomnia"" by Gregg Jacobs.  She said this book is the best book on sleep.  I'm skeptical because I have read so much on insomnia, it all sounds the same to me.  But I'll read it and give it a try.

So my instructions for now are to lose weight, take gabapentin an hour before bed, read ""Say Good Night to Insomia"", and reduce the Ambien to 10 mg.

Next week on the 17th, I get to go to a swanky hotel and get hooked up to a trillion machines for an overnight sleep study. After insurance, this whole thing is going to cost about $1700.  And that's not including a cpap machine if I need it.  

If you managed to make it to the end, thanks for reading this far.  I hope my experience will help someone else, because chronic insomnia can make life suck, and we only get one short time here, and we should be able to enjoy it.

4791,"Complaining about your insomnia isn't fixing anything! I wanted to preface this post by saying that I'm not trying to offend anybody, but I am sharing what I would consider a 'challenging' truth about insomnia recovery that would've saved me a lot of pain throughout my insomnia, and had helped me in my recovery. This may not apply to everybody, but I'm hoping that it's helpful for the people that it resonates with.

When I browse r/insomnia, I notice that there's quite a few posts that are just complaints, things like - sarcastic posts about how great insomnia is, letting people know that it's 3am and you're still awake.

This sort of complaining isn't conducive to recovery, and from experience, there's little to no value in venting like this. Sure, you can argue that it's helping you feel supported or airing out some frustrations, but it quickly spirals, becoming unproductive and negatively impacting your recovery.

From experience, I've noticed that this sort of complaining is detrimental to recovery in a similar way that reassurance seeking for OCD sufferers is, and subs like r/ocd and r/rocd actually have rules against reassurance seeking, because they've realised how unproductive it is.

**Okay, so why is it so bad?**

I could write about this forever, but I'll highlight the key issues that I've noticed in my own life:

* **You achieve nothing through complaining -** seriously, ask yourself, what do you get from complaining that's conducive to your recovery.  Sure, you may get a little bit of relief, but it's temporary, and in the long run, it's just going to cause more hurt. It's an ineffective way of working with the frustrating and challenging emotions of insomnia.

* **You're fighting against something that you can't escape from -** if you're struggling with insomnia, you probably won't sleep tonight and don't have the choice to just sleep, so why fight the inevitable? I'm 100% sure that a huge component in why I developed such challenging insomnia was that I had spent so many sleepless nights spiralling into pits of frustration, getting angrier and angrier at my situation. I've found that the more you rattle against your cage of insomnia, the more you're training your nervous system to link anything sleep related to the feelings of helplessness, frustration, anxiety and anger, further tightening the grip of insomnia.

* **You're becoming self-centered, selfish and obsessive -** the more you entertain this woe-is-me mentality, the more you lose your perspective and find it easier to become consumed by your problems. When I speak to people who have suffered from insomnia for years, I've noticed a trend in some (but obviously not all) where their problems are all that matter, all of their decisions are based around this and they have no capacity to consider other people.

**Don't worry though, there is an alternative!**

Actually, there's a few alternatives, but at the root of each, it's about growing up and learning how to maturely and skillfully work with your frustrations. I have found that learning how to skillfully handle these frustrations and the general terror of insomnia, without complaining or ruminating, was super helpful in my recovery. I'll mention a few:

* **Acceptance -** rather than acting out your frustrations and complaining, it is possible to practice acceptance of your situation instead. When I realised I could do this, it radically changed my life (and not just my sleep), because it provided an entirely new way of relating to challenges and life in general. For me, the first step was learning how to experience the direct, raw sensory data of my feeling body, on a level below thinking - so you're feeling what you're feeling, without interpreting it. If you'd like more resources on this, just let me know in a comment.

* **Widening your perspective and thinking about others -** thinking about, and practising compassion for others, has helped me widen my perspective and proved to be a great antidote to the self-centered, neurotic and sometimes toxic cycle of obsessing about my own problems. When you consider others and how they are struggling, it provides you with a break in your self-obsessed rumination. [Here's](https://ggia.berkeley.edu/) a load of great exercises to help with this.

* **Dropping the complaint as it arises -** this is really tricky, but it's a worthwhile practice. Every compulsion to complain will first arise as a thought, like a 'damn, this sucks'. When you notice these, you can drop them as they arise, just letting it go. I do this by shifting my focus to the direct experience of my body if I start to ruminate, and I may have to repeat the exercise 10 - 15 times in a short period of time before I've fully dropped a particular thought, because I keep getting pulled back into the drama of it. The more you do it, the better you get at dropping this type of thinking.

I can't stress how important this is, and how detrimental complaining can be to your recovery. Everything that I have shared takes practice, and it's something that I'll personally be working on for my entire life.

I'm not saying that this will fix your insomnia overnight, and right now, you probably don't have a choice in being able to sleep, but you will always have the choice to skillfully relate to your circumstances, rather than fighting against them and making it worse for yourself.

I hope you've found this useful, and if you have any comments, questions or criticism, please let me know!

4794,"Don't believe everything you think! After many years of on-and-off insomnia, I learned something quite shocking about my insomnia today.

I just got back from a follow up appointment after a sleep study I did about a month ago. I was hooked up to sensors all over my face and head and my arms and legs and was studied for 7.5 hrs. Now, I have absolutely no awareness of having slept that night. It was long and uncomfortable. I know that insomniacs typically nod off and have light intermittent sleep more than they realize, so when they asked me, I guessed I maybe slept 1-2 hrs. It turns out I slept 6.5 hours and was only awake in the middle of the night for about an hour. (this is the time I remember most vividly as being frustrated and tossing and turning). The rest of the night, I believed I was just laying there awake trying to stay calm and relaxed. I asked the doctor if my sleep was light or intermittent and he said that it was perfectly normal and cycled through the different stages of sleep.

To me this is a huge revelation... A week or two ago, I decided that I had had enough with trying different techniques to sleep and writing in my sleep diary and all of that. I just decided to focus on having a good day and do my best and to just try to relax when I can't sleep.... and the amount of sleep that I have been getting (or believe to be getting) hasn't changed, but I do feel better. I'm doing better at work and able to get in a few workouts a week and socialize... I'm a bit sleepy but I'm ok. I think sometimes our anxiety/depression about sleep impacts us at least as much as the actual loss of sleep. 

I know it seems impossible. It seems like how little sleep you're getting is killing you, or that there's no way you'll be able to make it through your workday or whatever trials await you in the morning. But it is possible that you are ok, and just need to work on learning to let go of negative sleep thoughts and anxiety."

It sounds stupid but I can't begin to explain how real it felt. I was literally in the first person, turning lights on and off, could feel temperatures, could see shadow figures...

The feeling of dread I get when I know I MUST sleep in the next day or two is sickening. It's a lot of factors, but the mere concept of dreams and sleep paralysis scare the living shit out of me, especially considering I've never had it before, I almost feel like I'm just waiting for it to happen. 

I am also scared of the kind of surreal dreams I can have, I DON'T want to dream, I don't want to see what horrific visions my brain can conjure up, its a horrible feeling, even if I do ""forget"" it the next day, knowing that I will experience it is scary. And all this isn't that I'm stressed out in my life, its literally just sleep that scares me and causes me to panic. Lying there, you are completely vulnerable and unaware of the outside world and whoever maybe there...

Does anyone else have this level of anxiety of sleep? Do you think there is anyway I can get over it?"
4799,"What happened to me? Who are they? Can anyone help me? can anyone relate? It was probably about 11 in a hotel room near Canon City Colorado when i decided I'd take my Ambien and head to bed as my head hit the pillow I felt this odd feeling that I can only explain as a sinking feeling... The room began to turn pitch black and I decided to ""let go"" expecting to fall asleep soundly for once.. suddenly I find my self falling through the bed down a dark pit, I could feel the loss of breath as if I had just been on a roller coaster that was taking a dive by the time I could gasp for air I was in this hellish firey brimstone cave like environment, then these creatures began tearing me apart and burning my flesh, the pain was all to real..I forced my self to wake up and by the grace of God I was able, but as I screamed and shook to consciousness I found myself surrounded by these dark shadowy figures (writing about this now is giving me then chills) I was petrified past the group of shadow people surrounding my bed was a tall dark hooded figure looking at me with no face just blackness when my mother awoke near me to my cries they all left just like that.. please can anyone relate to this or do I have some demonic attachment I'm scared to sleep tonight at fear they will take me. I know this wasn't sleep paralysis because I had motor control."

4801,"How I beat insomnia Even though my insomnia might not have been as severe as some people in this thread, I would like to tell you guys how it stopped.

For me, it began in grade 9, the beginning of high school (about 6 years ago) . It was the last night of winter break, the next day school was starting again. Even though I had stayed up late during the holidays (probably going to bed at 12 or 1) even when that time came along, I still couldn’t sleep. I can’t quite remember that night but at some point as time went on I just thought “there’s something wrong with me, I just can’t sleep!” 

So why? Why couldn’t I sleep? It was because I didn’t want to go back to school. High school was not the best experience for me personally.

I eventually fell asleep around 4 or 5 am, getting maybe 2 hours of restless sleep at most. I told my mom in the morning I wasn’t feeling well, my parents and I had an argument and eventually they gave up and I stayed home, trying to get some sleep but strangely it didn’t happen. I had never gotten so little sleep before, so I wasn’t used to how much your head hurts and limbs hurt. 

Anyways I don’t quite remember the following night, but I think I had a hard time going to sleep too, but definitely got much more sleep than the night before. 

A few days later my family and I went on vacation (I know a weird time to go) and I had no trouble at all sleeping (probably because I didn’t have school). And when we got back, the not sleeping came up again. 

I eventually got into a pattern where almost every Sunday I wouldn’t sleep until 4 or 5 (maybe not at all) and the day after that I would sleep okay and then I would barely sleep. That would be the cycle on the weekdays and on the weekend I’d sleep like a baby. 

This continued for me in grade 10 (after having a summer with barely any insomnia at all) and I was doing sports, and all I could think about is if I don’t get “7-8 hours of sleep I will not be able to practice tomorrow” and so it was a self fulfilling prophecy.

It got to a point very quickly where sleep was all I could think about. I would spend hours before bed reading in the living room with the lights slightly dimmed in hopes it would make me drowsy. If that didn’t work, i would do yoga for an hour or two or meditation. I followed all the sleep hygiene. I read a book about it that stated many rules, you guys probably know them all such as only use bed for sleep, turn off electronics a hour before bed, don’t stay in bed if you don’t fall asleep after 20 minutes, etc. none of these tips seem to work because the minute I got into bed despite how tired I could be, my heart would never stop racing and the only thing I could think about was what If i can’t sleep? And how terrible I would feel the next day if I didn’t sleep. I would cry so much at night because of how frustrated I was. Whenever I got a good sleep I would wake up in the morning, be happy for a few hours then start worrying if I would sleep again.

Eventually, my mom took me to a doctor and I got zoplicone (something like that?) I think it might have been a placebo effect because when I got the prescription filled I felt so relieved like a big weight was lifted off my shoulders . The first night I took it was crazy (in a good way). within 20 minutes I could feel the effects. I could barely walk in a straight line I was so drowsy. It was great.

Okay, no, my insomnia was not solved with a sleeping pill. With it I would sleep maybe 9/10 nights instead of 4/10 nights. There were a couple of nights I distinctly remember where I took the pill yet didn’t sleep at all.

As time went on I knew very well it was the fact that I was obsessing over sleep so much that was driving the insomnia. It was also the stress of school and sports and the fact that If i didn’t sleep, I wouldn’t be able to function. It was always that fear. 

In my final year of high school, I dialed down my stress, quit sports and took the minimum amount of classes I needed to graduate so I’d spend less time at school. (It was mostly the social aspect that stressed me out but that’s a story for another time) during this year, I stopped taking my sleeping pills, and I slept fine, 9/10. I think this is because I stopped worrying and focusing my entire life around it.

Unfortunately, insomnia flared up again for me during the time I was about to start my second job. I could barely sleep, and the worry that I wouldn’t be able to sleep and not function the next day started to creep up on me again.

Fortunately, this time around I found a book that was far more helpful than the one I had read before. The one I read before suggested so many tips about promoting sleep that it made my anxiety worse. It made me obsess over sleep more, and worry more.  I’m sorry to say I don’t remember the title or author of this book (but I’ll look around for it and post it here if I find it!) but the book was talking about letting your fear of not sleeping go away. It was kind of like CBT I think. Instead of thinking about how terrible you are at getting to sleep, get out a piece of paper and write “IM AN AMAZING SLEEPER” as many times as you feel necessary to do so.

The book talked about how sleep is natural, our bodies know how to sleep and we should trust them to do their job. 

Basically this book really I think was the thing that stopped my insomnia . Of course I’ll maybe have a night of very little sleep maybe once a month or once every few months but I think that’s pretty normal. I don’t follow any sleep hygiene at all now. I’ll sit in my bed whenever I like, I’ll watch tv in my bed, do homework in my bed. I’ll still be able to fall asleep pretty good. I think not following sleep hygiene helps me because I no longer associate my bed with anxiety anymore. Sleep hygiene made me obsess over the problem more.

I guess I’ll stop there. Long story short, I was able to stop insomnia by not obsessing over it, getting rid of my stressors, and changing my mindset. 

I’m sorry if this seems to simple or obvious or doesn’t help anyone. I just had an urge to share."
4802,"Anyone else feel like sleep is a battlefield? I could be perfectly fine during the day but the moment that clock strikes 7pm and the sun starts to set and my f.lux & blue light filters start to active I instantly start dreading the hours as they tick by until I'm in bed and forced to just lay there and contemplate how long it will take me to fall asleep this time and how many hours I'll get tonight. 

It's mentally exhausting having this mindset night after night after night. "
4803,"I think I found the cause of my insomnia Food. If I eat after 7pm, when I lay down to sleep I have racing thoughts and keep waking up but if I don’t eat after 7pm, then I can actually fall asleep faster and stay asleep. I had a hunch this was the problem but continues to eat around 8pm or so, until last night when I didn’t and slept like a baby. "
4804,"Second night of no sleep, omw to work So, haven't slept in 54 hours, called in sick yesterday to get some sleep but it didn't work. Already missed too much in a short period of time so I have no choice but to go. It's not really safe but w/e.

Hopefully they see that I look like a mess and send me home."
4805,"What is troubling you? Very often insomnia is caused by stress or anxiety over something. Resolving it the most sure way to cure insomnia.

I improved my sleep a lot by learning a simple technique: when i feel something is troubling me (my mood is not positive) - i try to find what it is and resolve it as much as possible. If resolution is not possible - i change my attitude towards the situation,  looking at the positive sides of it.

Sometimes anxiety is hidden: i wont feel relaxed and sleep wont come at all, while i cannot think of anything causing it. Example from my life: i have a little kitten, if it is in my room - i wont feel sleepy because for some reason it is unconsciously worrying me. Bedroom and pre-bed time should be free of things and situations that cause stress or anxiety.

Talk to people who have same problems as you. Feeling that you are not alone will help, while together it is easier to find a solution. Do not talk to people who dont share your problems - they will not understand you and can say something arrogant that will anger you."
4806,"Mental Insomnia Treamnent Guide If you have issues like sleep apnea, paralysis or other physical issues - this guide wont help. Otherwise consider using it.

Insomnia is usually being onset by stress, anxiety or depression. If not treated quickly - it becomes chronical, which means that sleep gets worse and medications become less effective. If treated properly - it will pass within a month or two, but proper treatment happens rarely.

**Sleep Hygiene.**

1. Avoid stress at any cost. Nothing is worse to sleep than stress. If stress happened but passed - sleep will become worse for some time, but then will return.
2. Wake up at 5-6 AM and dont let yourself to sleep more, even if you didnt get full 8 hours. If you have delayed sleep phase disorder - this is the most important step of fixing it. Set alarm to 5-6 AM and make it very loud, and put phone far away so you cant reach it with your hand. Waking early is important to make you feel sleepy in the evening - it makes the circadian rhythm work, which otherwise is messed up.
3. 2 hours before sleep stop doing any work or tasks - no internet, no calls/chat, no discussions. Start watching a movie or anime and you will feel relaxed and sleepy.
4. F.LUX - it adjusts screen brightness to the time of day, i cant imagine my life without it. Set wake up time to 5-6 AM, so it will dim the screen past 8 PM and you will feel sleepy.
5. Dont go to bed until you feel tired. If you go to bed while not tired - you wont fall to sleep and make it worse. Its better to sleep for 5-6 hours only than to spend 8 hours lying in bed awake. People can function on 6 hours of sleep fine for several days.
6. When in bed dont think about anything troubling, especially about sleep.
7. If you cant help but keep thinking about something troubling - start listening audio books, i listened several wonderful books this way and they helped me to sleep. If you dont like books - listening mantra helped me too (its a singing that you cant understand, but somehow it calms).
8. If you cant fall asleep within 30 minutes - get out of bed and continue watching movie until you feel tired.

**General Health.**

1. Walk outside daily, better on sunrise (6 am) and sunset (6-8 PM). It calms tremendously and provides vitamin D. 30 minutes of walk is enough.
2. Vitamins from food: ocean salmon meat, salmon eggs, buckwheat, millet, cabbage (broccoli), carrot, onion, garlic, tomato, linen oil, beetroot, bell pepper, dill - they contain a lot of essential aminoacids. They can taste very well if cooked properly. Eating only potatoes, bread, chicken and cow makes your body starved on nutrients.

**Self Psychotherapy.**

1. When something is troubling you - try to analyze what it is (find the source), then find a solution and solve it immediately or as soon as you can. It can reverse your depression and bring joy of life back. It can sway your mood back to positive thinking.
2. Take time to appreciate every good thing that happened (or not happened) to you that could have otherwise been worse. It will sway your mood back to positive thinking. In other words look at the good side of any situation.
3. Creation. Looking at things as they improve changes mood to positive thinking. I grow flowers as my way of creation and looking at them calms mind.

**If you want to cure insomnia (start sleeping without drugs) - measures above are a mandatory.**

**Medications.**

1. Alcohol - it is a brain hormone, which is created when we eat (in our intestines by bacteries that live there). It calms, relieves anxiety and improves mood a lot. Alcohol was a tide-changing factor when i was discontinuing one of my medications. Optimal doze per day is about 600-800 ml of 4-5&#37; beer. Lesser doze will have no effect, higher doze will not add anything while building tolerance. Alcohol builds tolerance and addiction fast. As initial treatment you can drink this much daily for 1-2 weeks, but otherwise dont take it more often than 1 time per 2 weeks.
2. Phenibut - potent anti-anxiety medication, but builds tolerance fast and addiction moderately. If you want it to have effect - dont take it more often than several times per week. As a course you can take it for 1-2 months, but not longer - it will loose effect after a week anyway.
3. NyQuil - potent at relieving anxiety and sedating. Builds tolerance moderately, can loose effect after several weeks.
4. Melatonin - hormone that tells your body to sleep. Can be taken before sleep as a supplement. Builds tolerance moderately, can last for several months.
5. Atarax - similar to nyquil, but requires prescription.
6. Cannabidiol - is forbidden in many places, but where it is allowed - it helped many people. I cannot tell more about it because it is forbidden here and i never tried it.
7. Benzodiazepines - they are the most potent anxiety relieving medications, but also known to form a life-threatening dependency if addiction was developed. Generally it is safe to take them every day for 2 weeks, but some of them can be taken for a longer time. If you take them only 1-2 times a week - they can be taken for a longer time.
8. Pregabalin - similar to benzodiazepines, is one of the most potent anti-anxiety medications, also forms a strong addiction if taken longer than 2 weeks. Gabapentin - less effective and less addictive version of it.
9. Lunesta and Ambien - short acting (about 4 hours) sleep inducing drugs. Lunesta builds tolerance fast (a month or two at best). Ambien builds tolerance much slowed (some people take it for years), but many people hallucinate and sleep walk with it.
10. Trazodone - antidepressant that improves mood, but also has a potent sedating effect.
11. Mirtazapine - antidepressant and one of the most potent sleep medications, builds tolerance slowly, but causes massive weight gain. Weight gain can be negated or reversed with metformin (reduces blood sugar) and exercises.
12. Agomelatin - antidepressant that induces melatonin secretion. It is mostly used for treatment of delayed sleep phase disorder and people with insomnia naturally develop it with time.
13. SSRI antidepressants are the tide-turning factor in treating insomnia. Serotonin is the hormone of good-feeling and calmness, in the evening it is being transformed into melatonin (hormone of sleep). Lack of serotonin causes anxiety, feeling bad (depression), difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early waking up. Any treatment of chronical insomnia should be started with SSRI antidepressant to check if sleep will improve over several weeks. Escitalopram is considered the most suitable for insomnia, while paroxetine is the most potent one and is used for depression. It reduces libido for males (it takes longer to reach orgasm), but not much and some married people consider it as an improvement.
14. Quetiapine - its main action is reducing dopamine, and thus it can cause akathisia and dry mouse (passes over few weeks) and dyskinesia (it means that dopamine level is too low and quetiapine doze must be reduced). Side actions are antidepressive (it is quite potent at it) and sedating (again very potent). It builds tolerance very slowly, people (including me) take it for many years without loosing effect. While sedating and antidepressive effects are useful for insomnia treatment, reducing dopamine is not. Dopamine is the hormone of motivation, sexual drive and muscle tonus. Thus reducing dopamine will mean lack of motivation, reduced libido and can cause shaking hands. To avoid this you should start with 1/2 or 1/4 of 25 mg pill and increase until you reach required effect. Maximum doze should not go over 150 mg, but usually 50-75 mg is enough. Regular antidepressive doze is 300 mg, while antipsychotive doze is 600-1200 mg.
15. Chlorprothixene - another antipsychotic (dopamine reducer), has even stronger sedative effect than quetiapine. Does not have antidepressive effect, but has depressive effect instead and thus will worsen depression. Causes dependency and is very difficult to discontinuate. It is the last resort for people who cannot sleep at all and tried all other drugs.

**Drugs can be combined as long as they belong to different classes.** Ultimately you can take 1 drug of every class, this is how i cured my very severe insomnia. Antipsychotics can be combined, but it increases risk of various side effects, including dangerous ones.

Curing chronical insomnia takes years. Be patient, you can discontinue every drug no matter how long you were taking them. But discontinuing prematurely will result in a relapse of symptoms

If you want to discontinue something - cut the usual doze into 2 parts of 2/3 and 1/3. Take 2/3 part 2 hours before sleep time (for drugs except ambien/lunesta onset of action is 2 hours), if within 1.5-2 hours you dont feel sleepy - take the other 1/3 part. If 2/3 doze worked - keep this doze for 3-4 months before next attempt to reduce doze.

**Insomnia can be cured once you find the correct combination of measures. Experiment to improve your life!**"
4807,"Does anyone else seem to have a ""cycle?"" Been this way as long as I can remember, but anywhere between every 1 - 3 months my symptoms get much stronger for a week or two, then go back to 'normal' levels"
4808,"I can't stay asleep for longer than 60-90 minutes at a time. For my entire life I would wake up every 3 hours or so. Which wasn't that big a deal. I would always fall back asleep fast and only wake up 3 times a night. I'd sleep three hours, wake, three hours, wake, 1 hour wake, then either get up or sleep till my alarm woke me up.

Recently things have gotten worse (I am only 28). Now I cannot stay asleep for longer then 90 minutes. Usually I sleep for about 50 minutes at a time. I am waking up 8+ times every night. I sleep for so little at a time I only know I was asleep because I remember my dreams vividly. 

Has anyone else experienced a problem like this and found a solution for it?

Some other background info: I have always had trouble falling asleep but now I use meditation and breathing exercises to fall asleep. I take ambien maybe twice a week and that will actually provide a 3 hour sleep stretch when I do. "

Sleep talk downs btw any good ones bc to me they are all more annoying or total BS than helpful.

4811,"Anyone else's eyes feel super dry after nights of no sleep? On nights of either restless sleep (waking up every 15 or 30 min) or just no sleep at all, it feels like my eyes are slowly becoming drier and drier and by morning when it's time to get to school and through the day, I'm sort of squinting to make them feel less irritated.

issues that are new to me however is my quality of sleep feels awful if it’s less than 8 hours, but the catch is i literally cannot go to sleep before 4 am (that’s always been a thing for me, but i used to be able to function on 4 hours sleep and now i can’t)"

Out in 30 mins....great dreams, and wake refreshed So here in San Francisco, they sell it at the marijuana dispensaries.  CBD removes the part that gets you stoned, but keeps the relaxing part.  Put two drops under your tongue and it's definitely bedtime.  It's about $50 for a bottle of it.  Should last a few months."
4816,"Get your insomnia figured out as fast as you can. Not trying to freak you out. I wish someone gave me this advice earlier than having to learn it the hard way personally. Years of chronic insomnia or even insomnia in general will, in fact, cause major health issues (mostly mental illnesses) if gone uncontrolled. I was a really healthy kid and my determination throughout the years couldn't fight insomnia on the physical level. Lack of restorative sleep for many many days throughout several years has made my health plummet. If you lay in bed for hours on end or go without sleep for several days consistently... there is a problem that needs to be fixed and nervous system suppression is only a short term solution. The cause may actually be very difficult to pinpoint but the earlier you try the more likely it is you can find the answer. Don't push the issue aside like I did because once you start to plummet from a health standpoint, you practically become a living time bomb. Value your lives and the benefits of getting sleep.

Just thought I'd throw my perspective out there for reflections. Insomnia ruins dreams both on a technical and personal level. A lot of users here are probably pissed asking how to fix the issue, see doctors and you most likely will have to see many through trial and error."
4817,"Ever feel guilty for not sleeping? Been battling with insomnia for several years now. And some nights such as tonight, it was 5 straight hours of trying to sleep until I said fuck it and got up. It's almost 5am now and I'm just playing some xbox and listening to music.

4819,"Just happy to have had a decent night. Last night, I had a couple glasses of wine and fell sleep a little before ten. I woke up at 12:15 to pee. That's usually the start of 1.5-2 hours wake but I was back to sleep within a couple minutes. Then I slept straight to 15 minutes before my alarm (I never look at the clock overnight but could hear the coffee maker start). Usually, that would be the death knell for sleep but I still dozed back off until my alarm.

Usually accompanied by a buzzing ache in my head and hot flushes for the remainder of the night/day that follows. Sometimes I can get back to sleep, but it feels like it's pretty rare.

My insomnia is mainly caused by sleep anxiety. If I've been in bed for 2 hours and realise I've got work in 5 hours I'll freak out and get a sudden rush of adrenalin and it's all over from there on.

When you have one of those nights, try to relax and assess yourself during the following day at work/school. Sure, you'll be more anxious than usual, and you'll feel pretty shit, but you can fucking do it, you've done it many times before.

Keep rationalising these thoughts about how lack of sleep affects you. It's not the end of the world and everyone feels that way sometimes.

I believe consciously challenging your anxious thought processes related to getting enough sleep can really help. Exercise and do all the right things, and when you do go to bed early and tired, truly do not give a shit if you don't sleep at all that night because you were fine the day before."

Like we haven't thought of that? Oh shit, it literally NEVER occurred to me that I should just fall asleep. I must have been doing it wrong my whole life!

Just go to sleep. I have to be up in 4 hours for work. I have to work a 14 hour day. Sure, I sacrificed three hours of sleep because YOU made me go to this stupid dinner party (ok, I'll step back from that one because I had a decent time until you started talking about really inappropriate things like how all your children weigh too much and how it pisses you off that Mom spends so much time doing something she loves). Just go to sleep. I've been working 12+ hour days for a week now. I'm exhausted. Did I mention that I have to wake up in 4 hours? **For arguably the most important day of my career thus far, possibly ever?** Just go to sleep. And don't take pills to do it, you said. I guess I don't *need* to take medicine to sleep for the night. Even though I'm nervous as hell and having excitement/anxiety about tomorrow and you and I both know there's no possible way I'd get to bed any time soon. But you're right. I guess I don't need drugs. I can just go the fuck to sleep. Just like you! Oh wait, you suffer from the same anxiety disorder? It keeps you up at night stressing about things? Oh may Lanta, that's so WEIRD. It's like I inherited it from you, or something. Really your understanding is flattering. 

Just go to sleep, he told me. Thanks, Dad. Always a pleasure. 

So thanks for genetically screwing me into insomnia as a result of anxiety. And depression. I'm a walking, talking, female carbon copy of you and you tell me to just go to sleep. 

Just go fuck yourself. 

**tl;dr**: I only had time enough for a few hours of sleep before a huge day at work, and thanks to years of insomnia I knew I wasn't going to sleep well before it. So I told my dad I was taking a sleeping pill and he, who also has insomnia, tells me to just go to sleep. And I lost it. 

I just needed to get that off my chest. I haven't been this mad in a long time. Hopefully, my deep sarcasm coms across in text. If not, I don't even give a shit. Thanks for reading, Reddit. :) "
4825,"Does anyone else... Alright, does anyone else have a love hate relationship with their insomnia?

4826,"Why is it so much easier to sleep in the day? I've struggled with insomnia a lot in the past. The biggest problem I've had recently is that I can't really sleep *at night*, but as soon as the sun starts coming up it suddenly becomes much easier and I sleep from 7 AM to around 3 PM.

Recently I've been trying to force a new sleep schedule, and it seemed to work for about a day until I fell asleep yesterday at 10 AM for about five hours. I might sleep at night, but only for a few hours. Then the sunlight somehow makes me sleepy and I pass out.

This is like the opposite of what's supposed to happen. The dark is supposed to make you tired, right? So why does the sunlight make me want to sleep?

What's worse is after sleeping in the day I couldn't possibly feel better. I feel really refreshed.

It’s a free podcast called “sleep with me.” It’s definitely not for everyone but I found that listening to it helped distract my mind enough to dose off, and when I do listen to it I leave it on all night and each time I wake up (which is usually very frequently) I find that it helps me get back to sleep pretty quickly. Doesn’t always work, but it certainly does help to quiet the mind.

But the worst part or the day is around 5am when the pain settles in. When I run out of things to distract myself with and I wrestle with my agony before finally passing out at 7. Work at 9, wake up at 8:50, rush to work pissy and exhausted. Just have a vague idea on the what the fuck is going on but roll with it, usually goes fine somehow as far as I know at least.

(First time reddit poster btw, hence the slightly awkward tone of the post)"
4835,"Anxiety about not sleeping causing insomnia ( This is my first post on reddit and funny enough, the reason I made a reddit account was to have something passing the time while I lay awake at night not sleeping. )

For the past month, I started to have trouble sleeping at night. At first it was something really small - first night I was drunk and emotional and couldn't fall asleep, second night there was a mosquito in my room - and just led to a few nights of lying in bed, tossing and turning, not sleeping until the sunrise. At first it was a mild 'i can't sleep but this is probably just a phase' anxiety, but since then has grown into a fully fledged insomnia. On my worst nights I would get in bed at 4pm trying to sleep, and not sleep for two whole nights. Whenever I hit the bed my anxiety about spending a whole night trying to sleep, not sleeping, and feeling horrible in the morning would just surface and I'd just lie there awake with heart pounding. 

Recently I decided to try sleep restriction therapy on myself but haven't been very strict about it. The reason for that is because I know my insomnia is strictly a mental thing - no matter how tired my body is, my mind just has a way of overcoming all of that and making me anxious. So I feel like even if I established a 'strict' sleeping schedule and my body felt tired at the same time each day, that still wouldn't guarantee anything because my mind just keeps dwelling on the issue. Specifically, this anxiety is about not sleeping, which is ironic because of course worrying about this would just make it worse. Have any of you experienced this before, and what were some things you told yourself / techniques you used /methods that helped you overcome this anxiety?

I stay in that state of being half asleep and I cannot for the love of god actually fall into a state of sleep. I'm having no concious thoughts in this state, nothing. I just don't fall asleep. 

Time seems to pass a lot slower when I'm in that state. It feels like an hour, I open my eyes, (which keep getting crossed when I open them?? Idk) look at my clock, and it's only been 10 - 15 minutes. What the hell is going on?

I thought for sure that I had ruined any chance of getting rest that night since people usually tell you to stay awake during the daytime or you'll ruin your sleep. That ended up not being the case though. The nap helped me not to feel as anxious and overtired. I was able to lay down at 2am and only woke up at 6:30am when the alarm went off. 

I think being overtired can make it harder to fall asleep even though that might not make sense. For the first time in days I actually feel fairly normal. If anything, I feel like I could go back to sleep right now if I had the opportunity. From now on if I can take a nap during the daytime, I'm going to.

After years of life-crippling insomnia (literally thinking I was causing myself brain damage and that there was no hope for me ever), I have finally been sleeping ok. It started during my long summer vacation during which I was in the countryside, and now I have been able to keep it up even as my stressful job started again. A key piece was being able to move out of my doghouse of an apartment into a nice two-room place. When I go to my bedroom, I feel relaxed AS FUCK even after a stressful day. I FINALLY have a designated beautiful little room to sleep in. And it seems to do the trick, combined with a very low dose mirtazapine medication. Can't seem to be able to quit that, but I don't mind, at least this one you can use for life.

I think about suicide nearly every day and I'm fucking terrified. In some ways, I wish my boyfriend would just dump me so I can end my life. Insomnia has caused me to lose my job, my friends, and my spirit. After losing my job, I became broke and lost my insurance. My boyfriend doesn't make enough to support both of us, and I can't bring myself to keep a job. I had an interview a few days ago that I had to cancel due to not sleeping. What is this? What is this life? How can we enjoy life when we are so fucking exhausted and tired all the time? I would rather have any other problem but this one. Even on the days I do get my sleep, all I do is worry about if I'll sleep the next night. All I fucking think about is sleep. Insomnia has taken everything from me. It's defeated me. I'm just done. It's turned me into an asshole. It's made a mockery out of me. It's taunted me. It's taken my life away. It's taken my past, my present, and my future. I took the first 21 years of my life for granted. The first 21 years when I was able to sleep for 8+ hours with no problems. I never even thought twice about sleep back in those days.

4864,"4 uncommon tips As a normal sleeper again, I have returned from the pits of hell to live again...here are a few tips I wish I had known going into my insomnia ordeal:

1. Be careful what you read.  Interesting and informative as this place is, it's easy to come away more frightened than ever...it's easy to assume someone else's horrific experience will be yours too.  My descent into the insomnia-pit was springboard by spending my days reading about others' sleep issues.  Be very careful.

2. Also be careful about allowing yourself to be ""diagnosed.""  Once you are diagnosed by a person wearing a white coat (or even by yourself), then that diagnosis/classification/label will stick with you, possibly forever. You may never be able to mentally escape it..and you will always be a victim.  The victim mentality must be vanquished.  It's for this reason I always hated thinking of myself as an ""insomniac.""  The label alone is damaging if you allow it to define you. 

3. The cause of insomnia is connected to the mind.  Why am I sick?  Because I think I'm sick.  And because my doctor says I'm sick.  If he/she says I'm sick, and diagnoses me, and pins a label on me, and gives me a prescription then I must be sick. Maybe I'm not really sick, but my mind says that I am.  So I am.  See how it works?  And this allows fear to take over, because after all, we're sick.   I'm the same person now as when I wasn't sleeping.  At the time I had gone to the doctor and she was convinced that I had an anxiety disorder and wanted to put me on an SSRI.  I said no...she also wanted me to try a low dose of a depression drug....I took her up on that, only to promptly go sleepless for the next 5 nights in a row.  So I learned two lessons there: don't take drugs and don't mindlessly accept a diagnosis; they can both make things worse.

4.  Learn the art of conquering.  Learn to get the upper hand mentally again.  When I go to sleep I think of things that make me mentally and emotionally stimulated.  I love to think of me trying to survive a cold night out in the woods in a tent...or hanging off the side of a mountain in a tent....or being on the ocean in a raft, riding the stormy, windy seas.   So what would float your boat emotionally?  Telling your boss off?  Imagine the feeling if you could just tell him to get lost and walk off your job and be free from all the crap.......not that you would actually do it, but sometimes it feels nice to fantasize about those kinds of things.  Or what if you ran away...What would you do if you could start over?   Or what if you got that girl...or that guy....See what I mean?  It's good to dream and fantasize and get the upper hand emotionally again.  I like to imagine that I'm a fugitive from the law and that I'm trying avoid being captured....it's this sensation of conquering something or overcoming something that puts me at ease so I can go to sleep.

Good luck everyone....hope you sleep well.  Be good to yourself and remember, getting over insomnia has not so much to do with fixing something that's wrong, but rather empowering yourself and feeling better.  Tell someone you love them...it will help you sleep better.

This is a short description of how I cured my so called 'insomnia'. This does not apply if you have medical conditions such as apnea, but if you are having trouble sleeping and you have no idea why, this will help.
I started having problems going to sleep, often before going on a long journey the following day. This then started happening on a Sunday night when having to go to work on the Monday, often even when I was completely exhausted after a tiring or heavy weekend. I had no idea what was going on, but eventually found a book - The Effortless Sleep Method - which made me realise the most important thing - that not sleeping is not caused by any external factors at all. It is all in your head. Rather, it is caused by negative thoughts in your brain. That is why it is so incredibly powerful, and can stop you sleeping even when you have had 2 or 3 nights with very little sleep and are physically totally exhausted. There is a lot of stuff in this book that is good, but a lot I found not entirely necessary. So I am distilling everything that I discovered and realised into a few paragraphs, in the hope that it will help someone else. What set me on the road to recovery basically boils down to a single realisation:

Fact: - If you are having trouble sleeping, it is entirely caused by worrying about not sleeping.

It is very important that you understand and accept this fact. It applies equally to either going to sleep, or waking up and not being able to go back to sleep. Remember when you were a kid, you never gave it a second thought - you would just go to bed and go right to sleep. That is what you need to get back to, and it is possible but will take some time. As an adult, pressures of work and life generally add to stress levels, and after one or two bad nights you start thinking 'I really need a good night's 's sleep'. You start thinking that you can't cope without a good night's sleep. This adds to the pressure of wanting to get a good night's sleep, and so before you know it you are worrying about not sleeping, which in fact is what is making you not sleep. It becomes a vicious cycle. Really The solution therefore is very simple: stop worrying about not sleeping. Oh that’s easy for you to say I hear! I'll come on to how you can do it shortly.

Some people get into an awful mess, try all sorts of remedies, pills, old wives tales (milk before bed?), binaural beats nonsense and for some reason nothing works. That is because nothing like that will ever work - what you need to change is in your head, not some bad habit (unless you are drinking coffee just before bed or something really stupid). It is very natural to start attributing your sleep issues to all sorts of other factors; am I drinking too much coffee, did I lie in too long at the weekend, did I drink too much alcohol the other night, should I not watch TV before bed etc. etc. It is NONE of these things, or anything else other than the fact that you are thinking and worrying about sleep.

Now of course, not worrying about sleeping is easier said than done. Frankly it is pretty much impossible in the short term, but that is what you need to work towards. This is not a short term fix, but it is in fact the only fix. It might take a few months or a year or two to get completely better, but you will. Do not take sleeping pills of any sort, don't drink alcohol to sleep, don't do anything to make you sleep because this cannot work, since it is all in your head. In fact taking anything to help you sleep is a very bad idea because then it becomes a psychological crutch - if you don't have whatever it is, you will worry about sleeping and then have no hope of sleeping. Everything you need to sleep well is already inside you, just like when you were a kid. Also who wants to become and alcoholic, or sleeping pill addict? For this reason avoid going to see your doctor, unless you think you have a medical issue other than not being able to sleep, but otherwise they can do nothing apart from give you sleeping pills which is the absolute worst thing you can do.

So I am going to offer some brief practical advice on how to sleep well. This is all based on understanding and believing the fact above. Re read that a few times and accept it. Then you just need to do 2 things:

1. In the evening, or during the day whenever you like, say out loud: I don’t care how much I sleep.
Repeat this a few times (5 to 10 is fine) before bed, try to relax as you say it and actually feel what you are saying and believe it. What this does is actually tricks your subconscious brain into believing what you are saying, even if you are not quite convinced yet it doesn’t matter. If you can't say it out loud, you can say this in your head, but out loud is better. Try and mean it, say it a few different ways if you like. Or change the words, it doesn’t matter as long as the meaning is the same.

2. Don't think about sleep. Yes this is the hard part. Your lack of sleep is causing by anxiety and worrying about sleep, so you need to stop doing it. That is what perfect sleepers do, right? They never even think about sleep. That is what you want to attain. Of course it is easier said than done, but combined with the first point, you can put a kind of censor on your brain and catch yourself before a negative thought surfaces. So use point 1 to help with this - as soon as you start to even think about thinking about sleep, just say to yourself: I don’t care how much sleep I get, and start thinking about something else. Often if you just say the I don’t care mantra a couple of times you find your mind gets bored and starts thinking about something else anyway.

The object is to minimise any negative thoughts, and just have positive thoughts about sleeping. So you aren't worrying about sleeping any more, the only thoughts you have about sleeping are 'I don't care how much I sleep' over and over. The result is that your brain will calm down and you will actually stop caring about sleep. Even better, if you do have a bad night or two, it doesn’t matter as much because guess what; you don’t care how much sleep you get any more! So it helps you get through the day as well. If you have been suffering then you already know you can get through a day with very little sleep, so who cares? It may not be ideal but it is amazing how much you can get done in a day running on a few hours or less.

So that is it, accept the fact, and then repeat the mantra during the day as required in order to minimise worrying, and then again a few times before bed.

Note that none of this is new, refer to the book above, and other research e.g. google the 'guardian how to beat insomnia' article, but somehow it isn't widely known. Look in internet forums and they are full of people reporting varying levels of success with routines, audio books, drugs, etc. which all do nothing. By all means do further research, but it is crucial to understand that it is not caused by anything other than your own worries.

You work with a mental health counselor (psychotherapist or therapist) in a structured way, attending a limited number of sessions. CBT helps you become aware of inaccurate or negative thinking so you can view challenging situations more clearly and respond to them in a more effective way.

> “Cognitive therapy seeks to alter faulty beliefs and attitudes about sleep.[34] For example, insomniacs ""often display a great deal of apprehension about bedtime and performance anxiety in their attempt to control the process of sleep onset; some even entertain catastrophic thinking about the potential consequences of insomnia, all of which may heighten their affective response to poor sleep."" The objective of cognitive therapy is to cut short the vicious cycle of insomnia, emotional distress, dysfunctional cognitions, and further sleep disturbances. Examples of treatment targets for cognitive therapy include having unrealistic sleep expectations (e.g., ""I must get 8 hours of sleep every night""), misconceptions about the causes of insomnia (e.g., ""my insomnia is entirely due to chemical imbalances in my body""), amplifications of its consequences (e.g., ""I am going to fail after a poor night's sleep""), and performance anxiety resulting from excessive attempts at controlling the sleep process.[35]”

I find that taking 15 minutes to half an hour to talk myself about how I'm feeling and about any worries I have before bed works wonders for insomnia.

4880,Enjoying sleep deprivation I read somewhere as your day progresses your brain creates adenosine. When enough adenosine is all built up it turns into a neurological key that tells your brain to sleep. When you don't sleep your brain keep making adenosine and this overabundance has anti-depressant effects. I love not sleeping for a couple days because it makes me feel like a different person. It murders my anxiety because I'm too tired to over think things or worry. Am I the only that is like this or do I have sympathizers? 
4881,"I really hope this helps somebody. So I have experienced insomnia for a while now and made some investigation, I hope my advice will be helpful for some people. Before I start to share my methods I want to warn you that my advice does not refer for people who have had insomnia since their childhood or inherited their parents' inability to sleep, so it is genetic. In case, I believe only a small percentage of people on this sub belong to that category. However , even for them these tricks might work.

Insomnia is mostly stress and anxiety related, so most of the people all of a sudden sleep poorly at some random night and BAM! Here comes the cycle. You did not sleep well tonight so what about tomorrow? Will you be an insomniac for the rest of your life? What about if you do not sleep well and you will not be productive at work? Will you get fired eventually? How about those huge bags under your eyes? I bet most of the people think you are a stoner and look unattractive. How will you cope with that? Doesn't it make you feel uncomfortable? Oh, you are a student. Tell me more about how you are suffering with no sleep and still have to go to the lectures early in the morning. Probably even your student advisor does not give a fuck. How are you going to pass your finals when you are sleep deprived? And there a probably hundreds of insomnia-induced questions which you ask yourself every day. So here are my tricks for you to cope with this hell. There is no anymagical solution, but it is more about the psychological set-up.


1) Never ask that ""God, why me? "" question. I assume you probably wish you had more ""normal "" problems like studying for finals, getting your stuff done or finding a job. You probably watched the ""Fight Club"" where an insomniac goes to meetings for people who have cancer or other fatal diseases. Significant percentage of adult people experience insomnia at some point in their lives so you are just one drop in that ocean.

2) Do not talk/mention your insomnia to people unless they ask you about it. Neither do not get stuck on the internet for finding that ""100 % cure "". I believe by doing this, you concentrate on your problem too much and it makes it worse. You keep telling "" oh I have tried everything and nothing works "" over and over so your brain/body takes an alert mode before sleep, it recognizes sleep as a threat and therefore influences its quality.

3) LET GO! I know it sounds cliche and it was mentioned like 100 times in previous posts, but this is the most important aspect in your psychology. There is a quote saying "" The fear of danger is more dangerous than the danger itself "" ( might be a shitty translation, sorry) . How can you just let go when you suffer every day? Well, that's why I mentioned, this is the hardest part. There is a part of us which keeps telling "" ooh my life is ruined. I am suffering every day. I can't concentrate, my motor skills are deteriorating and I feel numb "". Well, fuck it. Accept all of the negativity, do not let your fear to take over. These thoughts are produced by your brain, and it tricks you. You are subconsciously prone to those news which say "" sleep deprivation causes this and this and this "" . Do you control your sleep? No. So can you change anything? No. It would even be better to read about people who get only a few hours of sleep and function normally.

4) Do not expect to be cured in a short-time period. When you try something new, like some herbal tea or over-counter pill, your brain also plays a game with you, as you take the supplement and lay there thinking "" ok so I should sleep now... '"" and as the time goes by , you get more anxious as you think even with the supplements you are unable to sleep! Trust me, it takes time. It takes a while for your brain to get tired enough/ be in that state where you are just knocked out without even thinking about your sleep. On the other hand, you can enjoy the relaxation effect of the supplements you take and just chill, laying in bed.

When I first went to my therapist and started to complain about my insomnia, he just did not pay any attention to my problem and started to ask questions, it was a psychoanalysis session. I was frustrated because I thought he would prescribe me some meds or suggest some routine, or herbal teas. My point is, insomnia has really deep psychological roots. I really wish you can reveal those roots for yourselves. In this post I did not offer any supplements or meds. I believe the psychological part is as important in this problem as physiological. 
Good luck to all of you and I hope you get better quality sleep soon!

P.S I believe some strict sleep restriction, and the right psychological set-up should be enough. Obviously, natural supplements or over-counter pills can only help.

4882,"Does anybody else feels that insomnia lowers their cognition? Ever since mine came, I haven't felt like myself at all. I used to be so focused and driven and generally all-round intelligent. But now I feel like I couldn't keep up anywhere near where I once was. It's starting to take a toll on my psyche. I'm worried that my depression will come back.

4883,"My battle with, and eventual victory over the monster that forced me to stay awake. Greetings to you all, /r/insomnia. 

I have been a clinical insomniac for over 12 years. No matter if you can't sleep for a night, or almost an entire week, I know how you feel, and I know it sucks. 

My first episode that landed me in the hospital was at the age of 13. I had slept only a handful of hours over the course of 6 days. When I say a handful; to be more direct, what I mean is 3. 3 hours of sleep, somewhere in those 144 hours. I didn't have a bad life, and I wasn't suffering from any trauma, I just didn't sleep, no matter how hard I did or didn't try. 

I started to get very sick. I was running a fever, I was hallucinating, and it wasn't until I told my mother that action was taken. She didn't know I wasn't sleeping, which, in hindsight, was likely a bad idea to withhold from her. I was diagnosed with acute insomnia, given a sedative, slept in the hospital bed, and given some pills (trazodone) to help me sleep. No harm done. 

As a 13 year old, it was quite a powerful drug. 25mg did the trick, and I slept great. 

For a week. 

It stopped working, and my dosage increased. First 50mg, then 100. It got to the point where the drug did nothing for me. I spent years just dealing without sleep, an average day for me lasting 24-36 hours, and then getting 2-4 hours of sleep in between bouts. I spent the entirety of my late teens feeling like a zombie. I was always exhausted, I had nearly no desire to do anything, and I was slowly going insane. 

At ages 17-19 I had very easy access to liquor. I drank myself to sleep on the really bad nights, and quickly became a young alcoholic. I met my now wife at that time (8th anniversary this October) who helped me kick the bottle and get some focus together. Magically, for a couple of years I slept semi-regularly. Never a full 7-8 hours, but 24 hour awake times were a thing of the past. I felt better than I had in years. 

This continued until about 22 and then my insomnia was more seasonal, if that is even a thing. During the spring and summer I rarely slept more than 2 hours a night, sometimes 4-6, and sometimes none. Then when fall and winter would appear, I would be more regular. I dealt with this until I was 25. This was last year.  

I started working (and still am) as an IT Engineer at a mental health care company where my insomnia was running rampant. I had terrible episodes, almost similar to schizophrenia. Auditory and visual hallucinations were regular. Sleep was certainly not happening, and I finally decided that after 5 days without rest, it was time to go back to the doctor. 

My doctor said it would take some serious prescription testing to figure out where I need to be. I have been on an insane amount of medications to try and solve this issue over the last year. Every benzodiazepine you can think of (most notably, Seroquel and Ativan), and all but one sedative (Ambien, Sonata, etc..)

Finally my Doctor threw in the towel. The medicines either stopped working, never worked to begin with, or worked TOO well and rendered me useless the next day. I missed a lot of work, but the Human Resources Department and my director were able to make an exception for me due to chronic insomnia and anxiety disorders being in line with the ADA (Americans with Disabilities Association) guidelines. My doctor signed off on the form and my job was safe. 

I was referred to go to a sleep study. This wonderful little place would put a hat on me with a bunch of wires connected and monitor my brain activity for 8 hours, two nights in a row. 

The catch was that even after insurance coverage I would be 2.4k out of pocket. I couldn't afford it. I felt defeated. 

Ultimately I went back to my usual patterns and nothing got better. I was about to give up and accept that this was going to be the rest of my life. But I found out something else about myself in the last 6 months. 

I am severely depressed. 

Once I realized one of the core issues, I was resistant. I felt that I was weak and no one could help me. I felt that I was a burden to the people around me. My wife, thankfully, and kind of forcefully convinced me to seek help. 

I changed doctors and he reviewed my history with my medication and found the winning combination. 

Zoloft and Lunesta. 

I have slept, for 7-8 hours, every night, peacefully for the past 21 days. I don't feel like I am going to panic when I think about things that bother me. I don't doze at my desk or nod off at the wheel. I am living again. 

My advice to all of you who cannot sleep, get help. It is not a minor condition, and it is no way to live. Somewhere there is the proper medicinal or behavioral treatment out there for you, and you will make it. 

Sorry if this sounded rant-y or preachy, but I really wanted to get this out there.

The only thing that happens when my eyes close is an existential mind fuck...just to open them again and realize it's two hours later and I still haven't slept. My mind races constantly.

Barely function, can't drive, stumble when walking, have trouble thinking. I honestly expected the mind would shut off at this point but it hasn't happened. Last night I drank a few beers and they barely helped

Doctor says whatever I'm trying is futile. Since few things work on me he gave me pregabalin, trazadone and agomelatine to see if anything sticks.

I know I can't go too long this way but I don't want to get trapped with pills again

4911,"Marijuana & Insomnia Not so many people really believe I suffer from insomnia, they just think it’s an excuse to smoke weed. I have been smoking since I was 14 (I know, very young). I’ve always had trouble trying sleep ever since I could remember. My friend and I had a sleep over and again, I couldn’t sleep. It was 4am and I still had energy for days so he (jokingly BTW) told me to try and smoke weed to have a good nights sleep. I did and ever since HAVE to smoke every night to sleep. I try to get my body physically and mentally tired but nothing ever works. Was wondering if there is anybody out there that suffers from the same thing? Or is it just me? "
4912,"If you haven't yet, try listening to some ASMR or white noise to force yourself to sleep. It's worth a shot. I get these bouts at night where I lie awake for hours, despite knowing that I need to sleep and being tired. The only thing I've found that works for me are droning, repetitive sounds. Check youtube out for some white noise videos. It might cure your issues.

4913,"My insomnia has been insane lately, to the point where I'm becoming suicidal I have been getting <4 hours per night and no sleep ~30% of the time. I've currently been up for 2 days. I have finals this week and next but I've just been skipping my classes because I don't even care anymore. Idek the last time I went.

What drugs help you deal with the discomfort of sleep deprivation during the day or to help you fall asleep? Trazadone and alcohol don't seem to be working very well and I'm willing to try anything at this point."
4914,"Screw this. I woke up for work yesterday, I was let off an hour early just so I could be well rested, it's 4:30 am, my next shift starts in 2 hours, and even though I laid in bed for 7 hours trying different things, it's just not happening. This happens every Saturday and I hate it.

It's not like I'll be able to just go to bed after my shifts over either, I've got final projects to do, so now I'm stuck just powering though this until at least 9pm. 


Rant aside, I could use some advice for staying functional until then."
4915,"Discussing insomnia with non-insomniacs is painful Why? Because they have no fucking idea.

""I haven't slept in 3 days""

""Oh? Just do x! X always helps *me* sleep.""

I hate that word, ""me"". Everybody thinks that the world revolves around them or that other humans experience struggles on the same level as they do, so they'll always downplay your sleep issue without ever understanding how serious it actually is.

Melatonin is often suggested to me, and it never worked. I'd hold 10 tabs under my tongue until they all melt, feel sleepy for about 30 minutes, then the effect wears off as if I hadn't taken anything. And yet people without insomnia still swear by it and cannot seem to understand that it does not work for some people at all. I basically started ignoring all recommendations from people without legit insomnia because it's clear to me that they have no problems sleeping and the placebo they get from their herbal supplements is all they need.

The stuff that actually does work- Cannabis, benzos & gabapentin are almost never suggested because people without insomnia tend to also be those annoying people who ""Don't do drugs"" yet still drink and take antidepressants or other meds their doctors are prescribing them. 

It also really bothers me that there's no known criteria for a person to be considered an insomniac, so people who take an hour to fall asleep can go around telling everyone ""YO, I'M SUCH AN INSOMNIAC"". Meanwhile I've been lying in bed wide awake for the last 4 hours on top of not having slept the night before and finally got fed up and started writing a rant on reddit. You are reading said rant right now.

Overall, the only way to talk to an insomniac about insomnia, or a person with any problem really when you yourself have no fucking clue is to listen and get an actual feel for our struggle before putting yourself on top of it.

I've been working shift work for about 9 years, and for the bulk of that time it was very haphazard and chaotic turnarounds. I currently have a schedule that means I have to work 2 weeks of day shifts followed by 2 weeks of night shifts which is slightly better. But the damage has been done.

I feel like I have no circadian rhythm left. I now often struggle with sleep anxiety and end up tossing and turning and fretting for hours on end. When I do finally fall asleep I can't /stay/ asleep, and often wake up feeling unrested and fatigued.

I tried Zopiclone a few years ago and it helped, but after a few months I stopped taking it and managed to go back to natural cyckes. However, this year I started taking it again and now I find myself dependent on it (7.5mg). To my utter horror even this is has lost its efficacy.

I remember being exposed to a pretty crappy school environment, bullying, being beaten up, being threatened and such. Which I think manifested in my anxiety. I’m pretty sure this is what caused my sleep issues in the first place I didn’t want to go to school so I would refuse and sleep all day, then would stay up all night unable to sleep. This got me referred to a child psychology unit in my borough, who decided the best thing to do was put me on melatonin and leave it at that. I was prescribed 9mg of melatonin which didn’t help on the slightest, I would be in a dark room for hours with nothing to do, this would lead to me thinking badly about myself and push me deeper into the self loathing hole, I was then put on citalopram, an antidepressant which made me more emotionally messed up, and my parents wouldn’t help by calling me useless or lazy or making fun of me for it. Ive been in the cycle of fixing my pattern for maybe 4 days if I’m lucky then going back to being awake for more than a day and feeling like trash. My sleep was quite sporadic, I would wake up a lot and when I get up I’m not in the best of moods and will often be late due to not waking up to an alarm.

My sleep issue now is not as bad as it once was (I say writing this post at 7am) I was once unable to sleep for days at a time unable to sleep comfortably to now rarely oversleeping and rarely going over 24 hours unless I plan on it for pattern fixing purposes. My biggest worry is starting university and not showing up because I’m asleep, my insomnia would ideally be cured by then with the new pattern but I highly doubt it as nothing has helped before. 

Has anyone had anything similar to me where their insomnia is linked to anxiety/depression, I feel like it’s pretty common and if you do what strategies to you use to help yourself sleep and keep a good sleeping pattern.

TLDR: 9 years still no fuckin’ sleep"
4920,"Tips that helped me fall asleep and break my insomnia Hello reddit! I've been suffering from anxiety induced insomnia for the past couple weeks, specifically sleep onset insomnia. Here are some tips that worked for me to finally be able to fall asleep. I'm sorry if they don't work for you :(  I put the highlighted tips in italics (for tldr's sake)

1. **Addressing the anxiety:** *I think the first and foremost thing was to address where my anxiety was coming from and having a resolution for it.* I have a huge test coming up in a couple days (one where my life kind of depends on) and I hadn't been doing well on the practice tests, so it was making me have full on panic attacks at night when I'm about to sleep. It really worsened my anxiety because I couldn't sleep due to stress, and I was tired all day from the stress and I couldn't study properly. I studied as hard as I could through the insomnia/tiredness. I feel a lot better about the test now and my mind is less crazy. *If you're actively working on something and you are giving it your best effort, it's okay not to worry. Everything will be okay!*
2. **Sleeping aids:** *I used half a tablet of Benadryl (12.5mg because 25 made me way too drowsy) on the days my anxiety was really bad*, and I didn't use it consecutively because I didn't want to become dependent to it. Usually the night when I take Benadryl, my sleep quality isn't that great so I end up being tired anyways throughout the day. Since I have an exam to study for, I couldn't use any drugs that would affect my memory (like weed, benzos, and whatnot), and Benadryl was pretty helpful for the sleep onset and I had some decent REM sleep. There is a little bit of grogginess when you wake up though. I tried melatonin 3mg (cut up into 4ths) but it wasn't helpful and it gave me heart palpitations so I gave up on that. I think it's very important that you don't get dependent on drugs unless on the days you ABSOLUTELY need it, because your body will stop trying to fall asleep unless there are drugs involved.
3. **Sleep hygiene:** Some helpful things that made me comfortable was *sleep with only my underwear, making sure I was at a comfortable temperature. I have a low pillow* (I tried a high pillow but that made my insomnia worse because I was uncomfortable). I use earplugs (but not inserted too deep because that gave me a headache).
4. **Trouble falling asleep:** I'm a REALLY light sleeper so when my family is walking around, closing doors, I end up waking up. It was hard, but I went to bed only when I knew it was going to be quiet for me to sleep because *I felt that the more times I kept waking up when I was falling asleep, the harder it became to actually fall asleep. Making sure you don't have any interruptions when you are trying to sleep is IMPORTANT.* When I had been in bed for more than 2 hours unable to sleep (because family being loud and whatnot), I got up and read my notes at a dim light until they went to bed, and until I became tired again.
5. **Sleeping ritual - this was the most helpful for me!!!:**  *I make sure to not drink any water about 1.5 hours before going to bed, and I turn off lights and read with a dim light for 2 hours before going to bed*. *I make sure I'm not hungry when I'm going to bed. I spent about 20 minutes listening to quiet music, thinking all of the thoughts I usually think before I go to bed, and making sure I have a resolution and a plan for my worries. When I go to sleep, I remind myself how comfortable this bed is, how good the temperature is, and* ***I relax all of my limbs and do not move or swallow any saliva (this is important because you WILL wake up if you move even a slight bit), and just focus on breathing in and out.*** *Especially focusing on just breathing helped me not think distracting thoughts and focus on being relaxed.*
6. **Activity:** I tried running for 30-40 minutes about 3-4 hours before going to bed or going on a walk for 30-40 minutes but I didn't find it helpful for falling asleep, but this may be different for everyone. Running actually just made me tired but I still had insomnia, so I gave up on this.

4922,Anyone else take Diphenhydramine every night? It's become something I take every night to fall asleep.  I usually take either 50 or 75 mg.  It's sold both as a sleep aid and as Benadryl antihistamine.  Been wondering lately about side effects.  I might be noticing that I feel really lathargic and generally shitty in the morning after taking it.  I know some people like to abuse this stuff by taking massive doses and that's definitely not what I'm talking about.  I'm talking about taking reasonable amounts for the pure purpose of falling asleep. Anyone else take this all the time to fall asleep? Anyone notice any negative side effects?

4924,"How to optimize sleep and fix insomnia Hello reddit. I have struggled with chronic insomnia for years and have learned a lot about optimizing sleep. I am doing much better these days based on these practices. I have compiled this list of tips/methods to optimize your sleep. With diligence, even the most stubborn insomnia may be able to be cured. Even if you aren't an insomniac, you can probably improve your sleep in some ways. Many of these methods are major lifestyle changes for some people. Dont make too many changes at once, otherwise you may burn yourself out and fall back to old habits. Slow and steady is the better bet.

A lot of this comes from the two books, ""Why We Sleep"" by Matthew Walker, and ""The Sleep Book"" by Guy Meadows. I highly recommend reading both even for the normal sleepers (especially the first).

**Schedule**

* Go to bed and wake up at the same times, every day.
* Melatonin can be used to give yourself an early melatonin spike if you have jet lag. It only works if you travel eastward, such that the sun is setting earlier than your biological clock thinks.
* Avoid sleeping in on weekends. It's better to get up at the same time so you dont screw up the next nights sleep by losing sleep drive.
* Try to align your sleep schedule with sunrise. For most people this will mean going to bed around 10pm.

**Sleep restriction therapy**

* Dont spend more time in bed than you need. Most people need 7 to 9 hours of sleep. Experiment with that range.
* Set how many hours you would like to sleep, and set sleep/wake times that comprises those hours. For example, say you want to wake up at sunrise, which is 6am, and you need 8 hrs. Count back 8 hrs to 10pm, and that is when you should get in bed, no sooner.
* There are more rigorous methods of sleep restriction therapy, but they are difficult and reserved for extreme cases. You can try going as low as 6 hrs per night but I wouldnt go below that without the supervision of a sleep doctor.
* Track your sleep efficiency (time asleep/time in bed) and you may increase time in bed if you are above 85-90% and feel you need more sleep.
* Dont spend more time than allotted in bed even if you are trying to ""catch up"" on sleep or sleep in. 

**Naps**

* If you are not getting optimal sleep, try to avoid naps because it might lower your sleep drive too much.
* Otherwise, a short, 20-30 min nap in the afternoon is ok. Humans naturally have a rise in sleep drive in the early afternoon, so there is speculation we took an afternoon nap before modern work culture.

**Environment**

* Spend some money on a good comfy mattress, pillow, and covers. Doesnt have to be expensive but you should go to a store and try various ones out.
* Cool the bedroom to 65 - 70 degrees F. The body needs to lower its core temperature to signal to the brain its time to sleep
* Make sure your bedroom is completely dark at night. Even a small amount of light can interrupt sleep. Sleep masks dont solve everything because there are light sensitive cells on your skin as well.
* Block out distracting sounds with a fan or white noise app.
* During winter you can try a humidifier if you frequently wake up with dry mouth/throat.

**Drugs**

* Avoid alcohol altogether. It suppresses sleep. If you must cave in, stick to no more than two drinks, no later than a few hours before bed.
* Avoid marijuana. It may help you fall asleep in the short term, but it suppresses REM sleep, so you will get better quality sleep without it.
* Avoid tobacco. Nicotine is a stimulant and will keep you up if you smoke at night.
* It goes without saying, most other drugs will interfere with sleep in some way. We all love to party but you've got to keep it infrequent for optimal sleep.

**Caffeine**

* Some people metabolize caffeine slowly, meaning it stays in your system for a long time. Try going without any coffee or caffeine.
* Ideally, you should have at least a few days a week in which you have NO caffeine.
* Definitely dont have any caffeine after lunch time.
* Chocolate has caffeine in it.
* If you have a high tolerance to caffeine, you should take two weeks off to reset tolerance so you wont need as much.

**Light therapy - controlling your circadian rhythm with more natural light exposure**

* Get at least 30 min of direct sunlight (outside, no sunglasses, even if it is cloudy) within the first hour of waking up.
* Wear blue-light blocking glasses after sunset, for at least the last hour before bed. I use the cheap Uvex Skyper glasses.
* Align your sleep schedule with the sun. Wake up around sunrise and go to sleep within a few hours of sunset. Typically this means going to bed no later than 10pm.
* To aid with getting light exposure in the morning, you can get ""Re-Timer"" glasses that have LED lights shining the optimal wakefulness-promoting colors.
* Get a small red-colored flashlight or nightlight to use if you get up at night, so you dont induce wakefulness with bright artificial light.
* Dim the lights in the hours before bed time. Try to avoid screen use in the last 30min - 1 hr before bed.

**Diet**

* Chronic poor sleep can make you insulin resistant. This means your body is less able to clear out blood sugar. If you eat a high-carb meal, it will lead to a spike in blood sugar, followed by a low. These wild swings in blood sugar can mess with cortisol. If your blood sugar is too low, the body will raise cortisol. If that happens at night, you will wake up.
* Shift your diet to a lower carb diet with low glycemic-index carbs like sweet potatoes, brown rice, beans, etc.
* Most people only need 50 to 150 grams of carbs per day, dont over do it.
* Avoid carbs for breakfast, and save most carbs for dinner. This will help your body maintain a natural cortisol timing because high blood sugar suppresses cortisol, but we should have a cortisol spike after waking up.
* Eat a good serving of veggies for natural fiber to help digestion.
* Dont eat too large of a dinner, otherwise you will raise your body temperature at night when it should be lowering to promote sleep
* Dont eat within 2-3 hours of bedtime.

**Exercise**

* Get at least 30 min of rigorous exercise per day, preferably in the morning or afternoon.
* A morning walk/run outside is a great habit as it kills two birds with one stone: daily exercise and morning sunlight exposure.
* Dont exercise within 3 hrs of bed time.

**Mental game**

* Some people psych themselves out at night, whether worrying too much about getting sleep, or spending too much effort on ensuring the perfect conditions. You need to learn to let go and let nature do its thing.
* Practice mindfulness meditation during the day. There are some good guides on the internet about this.
* When you lay down in bed, try welcoming the various types of thoughts that come. For example, say you start worrying about something at work, simply think: ""Welcome, work worries."" Treating these thought intrusions in a welcoming way is part of ""Acceptance therapy"" which helps to calm you down.
* Dont spend too much energy on getting the racing thoughts out of your head. If they come, simply observe and know they will go away eventually.
* Dont worry about having a bad night of sleep. Just accept it and know that good sleep will come in time.
* What should you do with yourself if you law awake for hours? Try to spend a little time on mindfulness meditation, focus on relaxing and conserving energy for the next day.
* Do something relaxing for the last 30 min - 1 hr before bed, like reading a book. Avoid excitement-inducing activities like video games or action movies.

**Getting out of bed**

* You may have a hard time getting out of bed at your alarm. It is crucial you dont spend excessive time in bed, otherwise your brain will fail to release enough sleep-promoting hormones. Here are some novel ideas if you are really struggling:
* Make it a habit to jump in the shower as soon as you get up. Once you've showered, you're unlikely to return to bed. Shower first with hot water then finish off with cold for a jolt of wakefulness.
* Keep a bottle of water, a high-protein snack, and a caffeine pill beside you. Consume all three as soon as you wake up. This should help jump start your energy enough to get out of bed and start your day.
* Use a portable electric heater on a timer. Have it turn on 30 min or so before your alarm, so you wake up warm. This will discourage you from staying in bed and sweating.
* Block internet on your phone so you dont lay in bed browsing. The app Freedom.to can do it but there is a small monthly fee. With Freedom you can set a schedule to block, such as 5am to 9am. If you need to unblock it, you can log in on your computer and remove the device from the block, but make sure you add it back in later.

**Sleep tracking**

* You should track your sleep in some way so you know what works and what doesnt.
* Manual method: keep a spreadsheet and fill it out every morning. Log the time you went to sleep, how long it took to fall asleep, when you woke up, when you got out of bed, how many awakenings did you have, how many hours did you sleep (estimate), and calculated sleep efficiency.
* Automatic methods: There are many sleep apps. I use an Apple Watch in combination with the Pillow app. Fitbit is also good. A phone by itself can only use the microphone to detect the sounds of you moving, which isnt that accurate, so wearables are better. Supposedly the ""Oura Ring"" is the newest most accurate sleep tracker.

**Sleep aids**

* In general, drugs are not effective long term at inducing restful sleep. They tend to knock you out without letting your brain do what it needs to do for actual recovery.
* If you are habitually using sleep aids, you need to taper off slowly, because they can cause rebound insomnia when you stop.
* Melatonin is not scientifically proven to help in most situations.
* In general there is no magic bullet, but the best sleep aid I've found for occasional use is called ""Doc Parsley's Sleep Remedy""
* Try to only use sleep aids in special situations, like for jet lag or emergencies. It is too easy to become dependent and they often result in less restful sleep.

**Sleep apnea**

* Go read about the symptoms of sleep apnea, and if any of it resonates with you, get a sleep study done to rule it out."
4925,"Can't ""get comfortable enough"" to sleep? I feel like my main problem is how uncomfortable I am lying in bed regardless of how tired I am. I hate my bed. I hate lying in my bed awake for any length of time now. My room is very small so it's hard to avoid sitting or lying on my bed during the day, but I try and I'm continually trying harder to reduce my time spent near it. I do have bad back problems, but alot of the time it isn't the pain that keeps me awake.I feel like my neck is so strained on my pillow and my pillow is lumpy, my bed is hard and needs to be replaced and offers no comfort either, my blanket is too light and doesn't give me the pressure and security a heavier one would. I can't afford to replace these things as I'm 17 and my family is broke. I also get this issue in my grannys house though, her pillows are a bit better but I still toss and turn and I'm up all night. I have to toss after 10 minutes or less or I'm uncomfortable or I'm in pain. I do baths, magnesium, 5-htp and valerian before bed, I wear wax ear plugs and try to keep the room dark and cool. I read, meditate, do yoga, listen to music or do something else of simular nature to wind down. It's so frustrating. I can't take it anymore, I'm too sleep deprived to do anything. It's interfering with all aspects of my life. I was already in a difficult place to begin with, eating disorder (anorexia + binge eating), anxiety/depression, new Aspergers and ADD diagnosis, loneliness, severe chronic back pain and a bad home life. I just need to get this under control, I really can't function well without my sleep. I don't know what to do anymore."
4926,"CBT Week 2 Update I'm back, and things are still going well. My sleep efficiency has still been going up, (time spent in bed vs time asleep), which is great. I had one relapse this weekend because I showered with a bright light on too close to bed. I thought I was sleepy, but turns out I wasn't. I think this coming week will be the most important for me because I'll be extending my time in bed to 6 hours. Before, it was only 5.5.

4933,"How to Approach Insomnia Mentally Recovered extreme insomniac here.....it can get better...but having the right mindset helps:

1) The more I try to control my anxiety the more I am controlled.  In order to reduce my stress and anxieties and fears, I have to make friends with them.  The war must be stopped.  Peace must come first, then sleep will follow, not the other way around.   The more I focus on my fears and try to control them the worse they get.

2) Insomnia is not a war.  It's not something to fight.  It's not something to out-think, out-smart, out-maneuver or trick.  I don't need to ""fight,"" ""battle"" or ""overcome"" anything...I refuse to be a willing participant in this non-existent ""war"" with myself...I am no longer a willing participant and I refuse to ask myself unanswerable questions.  Thus, i cannot lose or be beat mentally because I refuse to engage in a fight, whether it be a mental fight, an emotional fight, an intellectual fight or anything else.  Disengagement is the best and sure fire way to approach insomnia.

3) Insomnia does not deserve nor require attention.  Instead it deserves, requires distraction.  The best distractions are focusing on things you like or your accomplishments.  These accomplishments can be past accomplishments or even getting something done like housework or finishing a project.  The brain must re-learn how to engage with life and disengage from thinking about how to fix itself.  Insomnia is not the problem -- the problem is overreacting to it.  Sleeping well does not require any sort of engagement whatsoever -- it requires disengagement...it requires getting back to basics...getting back to you...getting back to the simple life and just being the old you, the best you -- not searching for a new you.

4) If you've always been a good sleeper yet you've had problems in the recent past and gotten on meds, your sleep will not return to normal unless and until you get off these meds.  Only when your brain is allowed to sleep normally, unaided will it be able to do so.  You will never develop trust in yourself, or your body again, if you never get off the meds and do it on your own.  you must confront your fears head on and beat them back with success.  This is true with all fears and phobias.  Confronting them gives  you power.  Don't bend over backwards for insomnia in order to soothe your fears -- it doesn't work. 

5) End the ""what-if"" questions.  Ignore them if they pop in your mind.  Don't address or answer them.  We ultimately don't trust ourselves to make the right choices anyway, so why engage?  Doing so will only lead to fear, indecision, regret, second-guessing, etc....Just make a decision to be yourself, act as you always act and never look back or question it....just go forward like the real you.  Soon, the real you will emerge again and you will look back and wonder why you ever allowed yourself to be manipulated and twisted into something that doesn't even resemble you.

6) Finally the answers are simple.  What you should do is instinctively obvious.  Don't look to someone else for advice on how to sleep.  They do not know how to make you sleep. Their opinions will only confuse you.   Only you know...the answers are not something that you should be searching for anyway -- there are no answers to be found....your internal wisdom and common sense are much more valuable than what someone says in a book or on the internet.  I sleep normally nowadays but I'm still clueless as to how to beat insomnia.  I never did figure that out.....but I sleep good.   Sleep is a mystery..but as soon as you can get back to being the victorious you again, the sooner sleep will return. My sleep issue, as it turns out, were not due to of a lack of valerian tea, lack of melatonin, or lack of a psychotherapist appointment, lack of Ambien, lack of reading, lack of knowledge...proven by the fact that I'm lacking all of these now, but sleep fine.

Good luck.  if anyone needs help or advice, don't hesitate...I'll be glad to try and help you.  Tom"

I had minor sleepwalking when I was previously prescribed ambien at 19yrs old so I stopped taking it. Despite the sleepwalking it was the best I’ve slept in years. My dr has given me 4 different anti-depressants, lunesta and recently trazadone. 

Trazadone caused me to hallucinate a terrifying amount and the antidepressants had their own issues.

4936,"I'm sleep deprived all the time and it's making everything awful. I feel emotionless. I'll go to bed at fucking 12 PM and lay in bed for just hours and hours, until it's 5:30AM and I'm still awake with an alarm set for 8:00 so I can get up for classes. Usually I get around 4 hours of sleep a night and even sometimes 2 and about once a week I get a good night sleep. Melatonin helps a little bit sometimes but I get awful dreams when I use it. Benadryl does jack shit and I feel hungover the next day when I take it. Marijuana makes me feel anxious as hell. The sleep deprivation makes me feel emotionless and I can't concentrate on anything at all. It fucks with my vision a lot too. I get a ton of visual snow when sleep deprived and I hallucinate badly when staring at things for a while (which happens a lot when sleep deprived). I want to see a doctor but I can't afford it myself and I don't want to ask my parents because they'll probably think I'm seeking drugs, also I don't want a physical dependency on benzos or z-drugs and I'm not touching anti-depressants.

4937,"I have eliminated coffee and since then, I have slept better than I ever had in years! The title says it all. I have suffered from insomnia for several years. I just hated the feeling of not getting enough rest, getting suboptimal rest, waking up in the middle of the night and not going to sleep, etc. A couple of weeks ago, I was talking to my roommate and he just told me to try eliminating coffee and caffeine off my diet. I didn't think it would affect me because I stop drinking caffeine at noon and I have been drinking coffee for a decade. Nevertheless, I gave it a try. For the first two days, I had major headaches and had to push through with Advil. But shortly afterward, I slept over 20 hours the next two nights. The last time I did that was over a decade ago.

I really hope this helps some people here. Please try taking caffeine off of your diet. I suppress my addiction to decaf coffee. My brain feels a lot sharper and I am a lot happier."

4943,"Pharmacology of Insomnia Hey everyone! 

Long time lurker here. Just today signed up to kind of give back to the community and be more involved.   In this post I want to share with you everything I've studied over the years to address all my mental issues haha including insomnia and anhedonia(depression?). Obviously in here, I'll be talking specifically about insomnia and the pharmacology behind it. I'll also be addressing different causes of insomnia and how certain people will have different symptoms and things that can help them.

Let's start off with it's causes

# Causes of Insomnia

## Underlying mental or physical conditions
Insomnia is almost never diagnosed by itself. It's usually a symptom of another condition. Nobody goes to a doctor and comes home with an Insomnia diagnosis. Your doctor will often ask you questions to determine the underlying cause. This condition could be a mental one such as depression or a more physical one such as hyperthyroidism. Therefor your treatment should focus on treating the underlying condition. Your doctor will prescribe you medication to treat your insomnia along side your underlying condition as well. Which is fine. No reason why you should keep suffering. In this post though, I'll only address the mental conditions and how they cause insomnia.

## Stress
Stress isn't necessarily a mental condition. However, it might lead to many mental conditions especially if it's prolonged and not addressed. I'll get into the pharmacology of this as well.

## Nutrient Deficiencies
A chronic deficiency in certain nutrients can cause insomnia. Just to name a few, magnesium, vitamin B(almost all of them) , vitamin D. Deficiencies in these will often cause a chain of imbalances in your neurotransmitters which will in return result in you not getting the sleep you need.

##  Chemical Induced 
Certain compounds you’re taking could be causing insomnia. Anti-depressants, diet pills, stimulants are the most common ones. Insomnia usually goes away after cessation of consumption.

## Circadian Rhythm Irregularities
If your circadian rhythm is off, you won’t be able to get the sleep you need. Your body won’t be ready to sleep when you want it to be. This might be caused by many things. Night shifts, no sun exposure, staying up late on a regular basis. 

# Potential Treatments

Now I’ll explain how these conditions result in insomnia and the pharmacology behind them.

## Mental issues

### Depression

Depression has many causes and results in many different neurotransmitters being out of whack. Let’s discuss which ones are actually responsible for insomnia.

Serotonin: Serotonin is the neurotransmitter that facilitates many things. Regulation of your sleep cycle is one of them. Your body produces the most serotonin upon waking and replaces it with melatonin as the sun sets. Yes your body/mind do react to sunset. 
	Depressed people often require more serotonin than people that aren’t depressed.

Glutamate: Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in our brains. Your body naturally elevates glutamate levels when faced with “stress”. The reason for this is that, glutamate is heavily involved with analytic thinking and learning. When you’re under stress , you need to be doing a lot of learning and thinking to either adapt to your current stressor or to eliminate it by resolving it. Therefor glutamate is released. However , people with depression often have issues that aren’t resolved or addressed, this results in glutamate constantly being elevated. This in return diminishes dopamine as glutamate and dopamine are negatively proportioned.

Adrenaline/Nor-adrenaline: As I mentioned above, people with depression are stuck in a stress/fight or flight state. Too much glutaminergic stimulation triggers ACTH release. This also results in their adrenal gland being over-worked. Researches show that , depressed patients often has bigger adrenal glands that those that aren’t. Having too much adrenaline and/or noradrenaline will be quite stimulating and can cause insomnia.


So how can this be fixed? Well it’s definitely not easy. But start somewhere! Address your depression. See your doctor. Usually the first line of treatment will be an SSRI. This has two benefits. You having increased your serotoninergic stimulation will in return decrease glutamate which in return reduce ACTH release and also directly inhibit noradrenaline release. However, SSRIs also increase ACTH directly by acting on serotonin receptors. What happens when you’re depressed is that, your body does produce more serotonin to cope with the “stressor” but it being constantly elevated often results in desensitization. This is why there are a few anti-depressants that are developed that remove Serotonin from synapses which in fact re-sensitize them to serotonin. Try these new anti-depressants. There is also a drug called Riluzole. Ask your doctor for a prescription for it. It works by reducing glutamate. So your serotonin pathway isn’t affected at all. If you’re being treated for depression and you’re still not sleeping well, try  a very low dose of melatonin. I often recommend 50mcgs. It’s a super low dose but trust me your body will react to it better. Your body is capable of turning melatonin to serotonin and vice versa. So if you take a higher dose, some will be converted to serotonin which will increase ACTH and cortisol and guess what? You won’t be able to sleep. You can find a ton of anecdotal evidence for this. Melatonin also decreases dopamine and this might result in things like restless legs and stimulation especially for people with ADHD(will get to it later).If you’re taking an SSRI and it has worked for you for a short time and stopped, try supplementing with 5-htp. SSRIs work by making your serotonin stay around you synapses longer which result in more serotoninergic stimulation of them. This however tricks your body into thinking it has too much of it, so your body stops producing serotonin. So after a while, you’re back to where you are in terms of serotoninergic stimulation. So fix this, you might consider taking 5-htp or a precursor such as L-tryptophan. 5-htp is basically serotonin. L-tryptophan is what your body uses to make 5htp.

### Bi-Polar

People who are bi-polar go through 2 phases of mental states. A high and a low. Both states can result in insomnia. However, obviously a when going through a high, you’re more likely to stay up and not sleep. What happens during this state is that you’re glutamate is low and your dopamine and noradrenaline are sky high(Mania). It’s often treated with drugs that stimulate NMDA and other glutamate receptors. You can try a gram of Sarcosine and a few grams of L-Glycine during this state.They work by decreasing glutamate re-uptake and directly binding to Glycine glutamate receptors . Stimulating glutamate receptors will normalize your dopamine levels. Melatonin could also work during this state as it will decrease dopamine as well. Also make sure you’re taking any mood stabilizer (Lithium etc.. ) your doctor gave you. If you’re going through a low, your mental state will be quite similar to those with depression. For this reason , all the advice given above will apply here too.

### ADHD

People with adhd have a hard time collecting their thoughts together and relaxing. It’s because their brains lack dopamine in parts that facilitate focus/attention. They often get distracted and only get intrigued by things that are “new” and stimulating. Otherwise they’ll suffer from racing thoughts and anxiety. Both of which can cause insomnia. To treat ADHD induced insomnia, you can try a low dose Ritalin. Not adderall because adderall also increases glutamate and serotonin. I also have ADHD and I had the best sleep of my life with 50mcgs of melatonin and 5mgs of ritalin taken together! Taking ritalin close to bed-time makes my racing thoughts go away and melatonin gets my body ready to sleep. It’s definitely worth trying. Melatonin does facilitate sleep through means other than reducing dopamine so don’t get confused here.




### Anxiety

Anxiety might be caused by a variety of mental conditions and the sense of anxiety often differ. People with ADHD can feel anxious in a different way than people with depression. The treatments would obviously differ. Addressing the root cause of anxiety would often help with the accompanying insomnia. People with ADHD obviously wouldn’t be treated with GABAergics. Doing so could potentially worsen their ADHD as gaba would inhibit their already low dopamine. That’s why some people feel stimulated by Xanax. Seriously this is a thing. There’s plenty of anecdotal evidence for this. If you have depression and feeling anxious , a gabaergic could help. You could try Gotu Kola or Valerian. They’re both work through increasing GABA and/or directly binding to GABA sites. Gotu Kola works by converting glutamate to gaba. Valerian binds to GABA receptors directly. If you have ADHD, stick to your medication and it should keep your anxiety in check.

## Stress

When you’re under stress, you have a lot more Glutamate , Adrenaline and Noradrenaline in your system. You’re basically more stimulated. This will cause insomnia. However the cure will depend on how long you’ve been under stress. If you’re worrying about a speech you need to give tomorrow morning and can’t sleep. I recommend a glass of wine. Alcohol(Ethanol) is a NMDA blocker, GABAergic and also blocks melatonin re-uptake. Now I don’t want you to think, I encourage drinking but for short term stress , alcohol is great. For long term, I would recommend adaptogens. Cordyceps Militaris is a great one. It works by binding to Adenosine receptors(opposite of what caffeine does). This in return reduces glutamate and acetylcholine release. Both of which are elevated during stressful times. Also an obvious treatment would be eliminating your stress factors.

## Nutrient Deficiencies

Deficiencies in certain nutrients that happen to have a direct impact on neurotransmission can and will cause insomnia. Magnesium for instance, it’s a NMDA blocker so a deficiency would result in an over activation of these receptors. Vitamin B6 facilitates conversion of Glutamate to GABA so a deficiency would result in again an over activity of glutamate and a lack of GABA. Vitamin D does have a direct impact on serotonin receptor sites so a lack of it can negatively impact serotonin. Obviously fixing the deficiencies would help you with your insomnia.

## Chemical Induced

If you’re on a medication or taking certain supplements, your insomnia might have been caused by them. If you’re drinking Coffee , stop. Caffeine has a long half life so it doesn’t just go away. Diet pills often has stimulants like Caffeine, Yohimbine etc… So if you’re taking them you’re going have to stop. Your anti-depressant might be causing insomnia as well. Like I mentioned above, try switching to another one. Don’t just switch to another SSRI if you’re already on one. Try switching to one of the ones I mentioned(Riluzole, Tianeptine). Common OTC sleep aids can cause insomnia too. Diphenhydramine(Benadry) is pretty common because it’s a cheap anti-histamine. What people don’t realize is that though, it’s also anti-cholinergic. So it blocks muscaranic Acetylcholine receptors. Blocking these sites will increase dopamine… so you’ll feel stimulated and not sleepy. People with depression often welcome this though since acetylcholine is increased in depressed people. Dextromethorphan is another drug that goes into sleep aids. It’s a NMDA blocker and it’s known to be an SSRI as well. So it might not be the best sleep aid as NMDA blockage can increase dopamine and SSR inhibition can increase ACTH and therefor stimulation.

## Circadian Rhythm Irregularities

With this, the first thing comes to mind is melatonin. If you work  a night shift. Try taking melatonin at the times you want to sleep so your body shifts your circadian rhythm. Also , you can try taking Mucuna Pruriens(contains L-Dopa) and 5-htp(Serotonin), when you first wake up. So you’re supporting your body’s own sleep cycle. Dopamine and Serotonin are the highest when you first wake up so it would be smart so support them both. Also consider taking Vitamin D with breakfast. Your body expects sun exposure upon waking ,so taking vitamin D could help mimic that. But having real sun exposure would obviously be the better choice here.


While I don’t have specific references for these, I don’t think I made any claims that are off the chart and most of my knowledge comes from reading studies and tests on NCBI anyway. Hope this helps someone that’s having a hard time sleeping! I'll be around to answer questions as much as I can! So ask away!

4953,"Insomnia drains me of all energy, motivation, and everything I need to succeed in life. On school nights - all but Friday and Saturday night, with rare exception - I suffer from maintenance insomnia, and often fail to fall asleep initially within 30 minutes. The result when I wake up is a lack of energy throughout the day, poor school performance, and not enough motivation to do much when I get home but movies, TV, Reddit, and sometimes reading. I just feel like I don't have the mental capacity to push myself to do homework, which does provide me with a great of anxiety, which fuels my insomnia. The positive feedback loop only makes my week worse and worse until I sleep well on Friday night, and Saturday night. Upon waking up on Saturday and Sunday I've found that I have a great deal of energy, unlike the week days, and so I want to use all this energy to have fun, since I never have any real fun during the week anyways. It's almost as if I only have 2 full days in a 7-day week, and I'm pretty horrible at time management as it is.

4954,"Serious question: can someone actually describe to me what it means to ""sleep""? I get a few hours of something in each night, but I don't think it's sleep.

I finally came to the conclusion that nothing is wrong with me this is just the way I am. I don't function on a normal 24 hour cycle. I took a couple weeks of work and ran an experiment on myself. I stayed up ignoring the time and only went to bed when I was sleepy. Turns out I'm on a bit closer to a 32 hour long cycle. I can stay awake for 22 hours, but then I need about 10 hours of sleep. I need 10 hours of sleep regardless of how much I stay awake and I need 22 hours of awake time regardless of how much sleep I get. I feel optimal at that point even though I'm not anywhere close to being on a normal schedule living like that.

I realized this might just be how I am after a conversation with my psychiatrist. I told him that I stopped trying to suppress my fidgeting and I feel much less anxious because of it and he said that sometimes you just need to realize how your brain is wired and work with it rather than against it. So I measured it, my circadian cycle is about 32 hours long. If I accept that and find a way to make it work in today's Society, then I'll be happy."

Unfortunately I had room mates who would work different shifts and come and go turning the lights on and off. The mask was originally just for the light, but I started to develop a Pavlov-like effect where just putting it on, my body and mind would start to prepare for sleep.

4962,"Over 100 hours without sleep, my thoughts and experiences First of all I don't know why I can't sleep, I go to bed but it just won't happen. I lay there for hours and eventually see the sun come up. I've tried 8 different sleeping pills and they all don't help. Some of these problems might not be from insomnia but I've only experienced them since I started having major troubles sleeping. At the moment if I had one sleepless night every 2 nights I would consider that good, I've had a lot of back to back sleepless nights lasting 2-3 days and if I do sleep it's only 4hrs max. 

I'm coming up on the fifth night without sleep so I thought I'd share how I'm feeling 

- my eyes are so dark that I can notice it in group photos. Up close it looks like I've been punched out and have black eyes 
- I'm having huge troubles conversing with people, I have to ask them to repeat what they're saying over and over because it just sounds like noises not even words. 
- I've started hallucinating pretty bad, if I'm laying down with my eyes closed I can't tell which way is up. 
- my body is constantly hurting, most of the time it's a muscular pain but a lot of the time it will also be a stabbing of aching pain that I can't explain why
- I'm always going through some kind of painful experience. Like if I'm swimming I'll chafe really badly or I'll just be walking down the street and my back feels like it's burning and it feels unbearable. I also have lots and lots of headaches. 
- my body and face especially has gone really really pale despite spending a lot of time in the sun. 
- can become extremely irritated at everything

Some of these things happen all of the time and some not so often

If I can't sleep soon I'll go see a doctor but it's difficult because I'm travelling a lot and not sure how easy it is to find an English speaking doctor "

4965,"Insomnia is slowly killing me! Right about now I would accept being sucker punched if I knew it would be hard enough to knock me out.   I realized last week I was hooked on Xanax, so down the toilet they went.    I have had maybe 14 hours of sleep since 2/25.  I broke down 3 hours ago and took a 10mg Ambien and here I am surfing Reddit.    I am in so much pain from lack of sleep.  This insomnia wrecks havoc on my fibro and rheumatoid arthritis.  I just want a good 8 hour siesta.

4967,"Hey Insomniacs! Lets try to help each other out, what has worked for you in the past? I'm having great deals of trouble with my sleeping patterns in general, and I need to fix this since I don't want it to affect my grades.

In the past I have noticed exercise can help, and I hear Melatonin can help us out."
4968,"Why I Enjoy Insomnia I'm currently self-employed as an artist/freelance-animator, which requires me to be constantly creative just to make money. I always find that after a night of little to no sleep, the coffee or energy drink the next morning supercharges my creativity, but my best ideas come sitting at my desk in the early morning, letting my brain freewheel in strange places. However, the downside is that my personality has changed, making me a little darker, which reflected in my art. Also, I occasionally lose control of my temper, and more often my humor goes nuts. Fortunately, artists are generally accepted as being crazy, so my friends cope with it. All in all, I'm enjoying sleeplessness, so yah."
4969,"Anyone else had insomnia for...well, ever? I've had terrible insomnia for as long as I could remember. 

There's a number of reasons - racing, neverending thoughts that start up when I lay down being the main problem.

Nothing has ever worked.

I'm at the end of my rope. It's getting worse lately. I'm about to ask my Doctor to prescribe something after years of me avoiding any medication...but I'm so tired of always being tired.

After sleeping 2 hours for the last 4 nights, using the counting breathing technique and taking 5 mg of melatonin each night, i decided to give werd a try.  Good God. That shit will knock you out cold. Even if you WANT to stay awake you cant. I slept for 12 hours last night and i still cant believe it. Just give the sticky icky a try guys you wont regret it. Preferably indica with 20% THC "
4979,"Seizures caused by lack of sleep? My boyfriend has been struggling with his sleep for a few months now, and takes melatonin almost every night. This past Thursday he hadn’t slept at all for two nights, and had a seizure which caused him to fall down a flight of stairs. He suffered a severe concussion and dislocated his shoulder, but the doctor said he should recover just fine. They did a CT in the emergency room and didn’t find anything abnormal, but he’s set to follow up with a neurologist in a few days. 

This is the second time that he’s had a seizure like this - the first one happened in January 2018 under similar circumstances (lack of sleep, extreme exhaustion). I’m curious if anyone else has ever experienced something like this. "
4980,"Sleeping every 2 days? I've dealt with insomnia all my life and I've had plenty of all nighters but lately I only feel the need to sleep every two days. I'm always awake for exactly 36  hours before I sleep in for 9-12 hours. I was prescribed Ambien and took it for a week straight, it didn't do a thing. Didn't even make me sleepy. I've also tried over the counter sleeping pills and NyQuil.   It happened gradually over time, the all nighters got closer together. I even stopped drinking caffeine for a week and it didn't make a difference. Has anyone else experienced this? It's been going for about a month like this now and the only thing I noticed is that my eyes are a little dryer than usual. 

EDIT: I should add that I have unusual sleep anyway. I think it's sleep paralysis because sometimes when I'm falling asleep or waking up, I'm aware but not awake and I can't respond. I've had few night terrors but never like anything I've heard of sleep paralysis. There are times I enter a dream the minute I close my eyes, or at least within 10 minutes or so. If I can't fall asleep after the first hour of laying down, I know I'm not going to sleep anytime soon. If I get lucky and I'm able to go to bed early, I'll wake up a few hours later feeling slow and groggy with a headache. My most active hours are between 3-6AM and 9-12PM. I can actually feel myself snapping from being tired enough to sleep to completely awake. It's like a cold wind hits my face.

4981,"I have two choices when I always wake up SUPER EARLY at 3am - can anyone relate? 1. Wake up, lay there in the darkness suffering: Racing mind, tense body, mildly anxious.. can't go back to sleep. To just LAY THERE .... for hours.  Until I wake up. \[8am.\] Suffering.  

2. Get up. Get on computer. Type things. (Like I am doing now.) ;P ..... But then the rest of my day goes I am easily stressed and exhausted.

4982,"Aromatherapy has done wonders for me. I’m serious, some might think this is bullshit but I literally have dreams daily now with 5-6 hours sleep which is perfect/sweet spot for me an I don’t feel groggy at all when I wake up. I got my diffuser from TJ Maxx an I got a essential oil box kit from Relax 6 at local vitamin shoppe really not expensive investment. 

I purposely have not used use it some days to see if it is just a placebo effect I had going on but not at all. Sometimes I remember my dreams when I wake up but for the most part I don’t remember them they don’t make any sense anyways just random whatever the brain wants to do but this has really helped my night time anxiety/overthinking for sure!

My insomnia had gotten to the worse point ever I made a post about how long have you stayed up straight before anyways after this episode I was like I have to try something new so I gave this a shot and I responded very well to it. Also I have been taking full spectrum CBD gel pill in the morning with first meal along with my multi vitamin maybe that built up in my system along with this? Anyways I sleep really good these days and I’m giving the credit to my aromatherapy."
4983,"Has anyone tried the Calm app? For those who aren’t familiar: There’s an app called Calm that’s supposed to help with relaxation, getting to sleep, and also meditating. They have “sleep stories” which have basically boring but chill short stories read by people with soothing voices. It’s also got the standard sounds you’d find on a sound machine (ocean, thunderstorm, rain, etc.) It has breathing exercises which seem nice to relax. And if you’re into meditating they’ve got a LOT of content on that.

I’m asking because the app costs 80 DOLLARS which is ridiculous!! I’m on the 7 day free trial, and I do have to say that when I was listening to the Bob Ross sleep story last night I knocked out pretty quickly, and their breathing thing is cool. The other stuff I don’t find useful, personally speaking. Any thoughts for those who have tried/use it? Is it worth that insane amount of money? Has it helped you with sleep at all?"
4984,"Trying CBD oil, hopefully it works Update: So, after I went to bed around 11, I pretty much slept for a few hours, then woke up around 2:30 or 3:00 in the morning, just kind of tossing and turning and occasionally falling into light sleep. It might not have worked for me as good because I only took half the amount of dosage, because I was already tired. That could be an explanation, so I will try full dosage this weekend when I don't have to wake up at a certain time. This week however, I will try half a dosage with melatonin about 15 minutes after taking the cbd oil. "

Anyway, I'm typing this at 2:00am, so please bare with me. 
Have a routine: I know this is easier said than done, as I usually try and fall asleep between 12-1 in the morning and wake up around 7-8. 
If you have anxiety or mind is on overclock 24/7 (Like mine) :

Write your feeling down on paper, this has helped me in the past a few times.  You can shred it or throw it out afterwards if you're not comfortable with having it around the house.  (it can be embarrassing) 

Watch your favourite youtuber through the night- this will help take your mind off things, mind numbing content is 100 times better than  overthinking things that has happened through the day. ( I know that is rich coming from me) 

You'd be suprised how good reading is through the day, however resist the urge to nap, sometimes in the past this has stuffed my sleeping pattern up. 

I have a strong issue with not taking my own advice, so as mentioned above take this with a grain of salt. I hope this will help you in the future.  I do apologise if all has been said in previous post in the past. Sigh, I have a feeling  won't be sleeping to great tonight. Best of luck Reddit!

4993,"Insomnia coupled with manic state and other complications Hello I’ve been wanting to post this for some time now. Just to see who can relate to a very specific form of insomnia that seems worse than the ‘textbook’ case, and maybe some empathy about the situation. 

When insomnia hits me, twice in my life, it hits extremely hard. Like four to six nights with only about 2 hours of sleep. Both times it was during college and grad school respectively. I’ve had to leave everything behind and head home to recuperate. Because after a few days without sleep, my brain becomes near manic, panicking constantly, and nothing can bring it calm. Every night I lay there and cannot sleep, in the daytime I can barely function as I just lay there thinking what the hell is wrong with me.

During these two periods, always lasting 2-3 months, life is almost impossible. I had to rely on my parents heavily to get anything done. The usual sleep medications and supplements don’t do a single thing. They actually make me wake up with a jolt and make me very agitated. So life is a continual hell. Can’t watch TV, read a book, do normal things because my mind is on another planet freaking out. Some doctors call it mania others anxiety. I call it mindless despair.

Just asking my fellow insomniacs if they’ve experienced similar intense episodes, where they had to pause their life. After months of a cocktail of medications, and somehow letting go of the stress, and having my parents help me, sleep slowly came back.  Very slowly, and I can never sleep as well as before these episodes. I always awake with a jolt.

Besides the mental issues, some other things I noticed were a decrease in intelligence and creativity still lingering today, a dismal sense of helplessness, flat emotions, and unresponsive organs (namely my GI tract and other things were extremely slow. I thought that lack of sleep was slowly killing my organs functions).  Is there anything I can do to prevent this sort of thing from happening again. I don’t think I can survive a third ordeal.  Thank you my fellow insomniacs. May we somehow persevere."

These chems are addictive and you will build a tolerance to them with repeated usage yet for the occasional night when you really need to get some sleep they work like a charm. Etizolam has a short half life and won't give you a morning hangover but may not give you a full nights sleep either. Flualprazolam is much longer acting and can provide a full nights sleep but does cause morning drowsiness. Neither of these chems is scheduled nationwide yet. Google them for more info.

5020,"Going into my third night of sleeplessness, feeling very lonely and afraid. Genuinely scared, I'm actually shaking slightly, this is becoming like my own personal torture and I don't know what I should do.

It's easier for me to come online and rant than lay my head down and confront the flooding of anxiety I seem to be met with trying to sleep, it's somewhat overwhelming me.

I feel like I'm slowly going insane with this and that it's impossible for me to make sense of this right now....

5021,"Insomnia Causing Frustration Causing Insomnia What do you advise for not being able to sleep and getting frustrated with it, and then having that frustration mount up an up so that you definitely can't sleep. I do all the things suggested like reading a book or doing something else when I can't fall asleep but while I'm doing that, my frustrated goes higher and higher until I get a nervous breakdown. What can I do to stop this?"
5022,"Slept like a fucking rock! (had to work myself to near exhaustion though) For the first time in maybe this entire year. I slept like an absolute rock last night! from 10p.m to 8a.m almost without interruption.  


I think it’s because i did a double shift yesterday at my job and worked from 10a.m-8p.m, so almost as soon as i got home i crashed. 

I hate that i have to almost over extend my body just to get a good nights rest but hey, that sleep was nice. 

But it’s also depressing because usually i get 2-4 hours of sleep and i wake up irritated, groggy etc..., *THIS MORNING* though i jumped right out of bed , felt rested and felt great. It’s depressing because i know i’ll probably not feel this great after a sleep for a long time but man it was worth it.

5023,"Banana tea for sleep. For the past few weeks I've been getting very little sleep. I'm on medication that supposed to help you sleep but it doesn't help much. I mentioned to a co-worker that I've tried a lot of things and nothing has really worked. He told me I should try boiling a unpeeled banana and drink the water and try to eat the banana. I didn't believe him till I searched it and watched a couple YouTube videos, it actually is real.

I use a snore app to kind of monitor my sleep and the results usually are depressing with little sleep. After trying banana tea my sleep results were a lot better.

I cut the ends off and cut it in half because the pot was small. I used around two cups of water and waited for it to boil, then set the timer for ten minutes and put the banana in the pot.

They say to eat the banana as well as drinking the tea, but I couldn't eat the banana, it had a weird mushy asparagus taste and cinnamon didn't help. The tea however was easy to drink once it cooled down, I did use a little cinnamon and honey to make it have some taste.

You should really try it if you have a banana and are having a tough time finding something to put you out."
5024,"after 11 years of insomnia, i cant take much more I'm a 34 year old Irishman who has suffered with insomnia for 11 years. It started suddenly - 11 years ago I just stop sleeping properly. There was no event that triggered it - I had a summer job as a house painter and suddenly went 2 nights with no sleep. Since those 2 nights, I've only had a week here and a week there where I've slept well. The vast majority of the time, I struggle. 

I tried sleeping pills years ago and these worked, but I got hopelessly addicted for 3 and a half years (even faking prescriptions) and ended up in rehab for 28 days. I haven't taken a sleeping pill for 7 years now. 

I've worked as a software engineer for most of this time. It's been a real struggle to work while sleeping so little, but I normally manage. About 12 months ago I started to wear blue-light blocking glasses in the evening. These had an extraordinary effect - I suddenly went from 4 hours restless sleep to 6 hours deep sleep. It was beautiful and I thought I'd finally cracked it. However, this only lasted about 3 months and slowly but surely I started to have problems again. By the way, I usually have no problems getting to sleep - I pass out within 10 minutes most nights. However I get a very shallow restless sleep, and wake up every 90 minutes. It can take anything from 5 minutes to 3 hours to get back to sleep. After nights like this, the next day I have headaches, concentration issues and deep depression. Over the last 7 months, things have gotten worse. I had to quit my job and, as a result of my bad mood, irritability and deep depression brought on by night after night of broken sleep, my long term girlfriend broke up with me. As we shared an apartment, I had to move out and move 2 hours away back into my parents house. I was angry but I realise she had to move on with her life and I was holding her back. She showed incredible pateince with me for 4 years but my situation eventually broke her. 

Currently I'm living at home with my parents in an isolated area. I have no friends around here. I have good friends back in the city and we meet occassionally but their patience is wearing thin too - I'm constatly cancelling plans to visit due to another poor night's sleep and the subsequent headaches and depression that ensues. 

I have tried an awful lot of things and I live quite a strict healthy lifestyle: I eat very well (unprocessed foods only), I force myself to run every 2 or 3 days (I even regularly win 5km and 10km races), I have a low heart rate, low blood pressure, low cholesterol. Basically, I've never been fitter and when I go to the doctor, I pass all tests with flying colours. I practice CBT and also sleep restriction therapy where I only stay in bed for 6 hours each night. I also have practiced vipassanna mediatation on and off for years. I'm currently doing it fo 2 hours per day and this is a help - I sometimes feel moments of bliss brought on by deep concentration I have achieved. But still, I cannot stay asleep, or get into a deep sleep (I've tried all OTC pills - melatonin etc and have found them to be no help). 

A few years ago I did a sleep test - it showed I hd 88 'mini arousals' during the night (I only slept for 3 hours so that's 88 in 3 hours). They ruled out sleep apnea and didn't know why I was waking up so much.

One other thing worth mentioning is that 4 months ago I got teeth braces, top and bottom. This actually exacerbated my problem. I spoke to the dentist and he said in the thousands of patients he has treated, none have reported chronic insomnia as a consequence of braces. I'm not 100% if this has anything to do with my sleep issues since I had started to get worse 2/3 months before the braces. 

I've now reached the stage where I am contemplating suicide. I feel a complete burden on people - I was on my ex, and now I am on my elderly parents. I feel no sense of self-worth and have enormous envy for other people my age that can work, drink, have relationships, sleep well and be happy. Such simple things are now out of reach for me. I've had suicidal thoughts for years but I never seriously considered it until recently. Now I find myself planning exactly how I'll do it (I have access to a gun) and where (far from my home so my parents aren't the ones to find me). 

To be clear, I'm absolutely convinced I've arrived here because of chronic insomnia, not depression. The insomnia as brought on the deep depression and despair, not the other way around (I have tried various amti-depressents but none have helped me sleep and therefore the depression has remained).

I'm writing this post out of desperation and the hope that someone can suggest one more thing I can try just so I can get a regular nights sleep. I now truly feel like my options are fully exhausted, apart from one.



EDIT

Thank you everyone for such kind replies and suggestions. My plan is to commit fully to Sleep Restriction Therapy, starting with a 6 hour time-in-bed window. This is something I had moderate success with before, but I never committed to it for more than 10 days or so. I started it 2 nights ago and plan to see this through. I found an app called CBT-I Coach which is dedicated to SRT so I'm tracking everything with this. I'll post weekly updates here. Thanks everyone.



EDIT

Just to update people, I've have done 11 nights of SRT. I started out giving myself a 6 hours of time in bed - 11.15pm to 5.15 am. As my sleep efficiency was below 80% (i.e. I was awake at least 20% of the 6 hours in bed) I reduced to a 5 and a half hours of time in bed for the last 3 nights. My sleep efficiency is still below 80% so now I'm reducing to 5 hours time in bed - 11.30pm to 4.30am. I'm a very extreme case but shouldn't I have seen some progress after 11 nights?"

5027,"insomnia and anxiety, any tips would be appreciated   I suffer from anxiety and a dissociate anxiety disorder. About five years ago I started work at a place that required me to wake up at 4am. I found myself unable to do fall asleep and spent the night tossing and turning trying to sleep for the first time in my life. After that I started to notice the fear of not sleeping creeping into every part of my life even when there was nothing to do the next day. 
 
  I left the job to study at a university but had to leave after two years due to my anxiety and insomnia reducing my ability to perform. 
 
  Now I have an obsessive loop of a self-fulfilling prophecy that constantly cycles because I fear not sleeping which makes my anxious mind that likes to grab hold of obsessive thoughts very tense and thus not able to turn off.
  
  I practice meditation, mindfulness and have completed courses in cognitive behavior therapy with therapists. I also take anxiety medications that help with my overall symptoms but still find my insomnia and the fear of no sleep to be the greatest challenge rivaled only by my dissociation.

  Any tips and help would be greatly appreciated. I know there must be a way to correct this thought pattern as I know I can sleep fine if it were not for the anxiety surrounding the act of sleep itself. It's a thought pattern I've thought myself into, so any help on helping my brain see it as simply that and not a legitimate threat would be nice, any repeated phrases or anything?

5029,"Anyone have experience with extreme insomnia ''attacks''? So, I will make this as short as possible. For about 3-4 years now I have had standard not-too-bad insomnia, which I can usually keep away by taking 15-22.5mg of zopiclone. But once every 1-2 months I get these extreme episodes where my brain kinda explodes with thoughts, and I just can't sleep at all. Pills won't work. Tried taking 70+mg of both zolpidem and zopiclone over the course of a night without effect, and have tried a buttload of different benzos as well. Once I reach 72+ hours without sleep, I drink till I pass out, and this usually ends the ''attack''. But it's not really a great way to deal with it. I was once set on riding one out without drinking, but after 120 or something hours without sleep I was checked into a psychiatric ward, because I was so delirious from fatique. Here are the things I have tried:

- Gym, Tea, Walking, Running, Reading(Not in bed), Sleep schedules, 30 minutes in bed and 30 out of bed, No bright light 1 hour before bedtime, other stuff.

- Numerous sleep ''specialists''

Honestly the mix of my completely awful sleep problems, and the fact that I feel like sleeping is a huge waste of time and not always enjoyable, I generallt hate sleeping. Sometimes I even dread sleeping when I do get tired, I just hate it. I wish I either didn't ever *need* sleep, or that I could sleep for unlimited amount of times (a year, a week, forever).

5031,"Can't sleep due to fear of organs moving / I feel the need to restrict my abdomen to sleep Hey guys I'm a 17 year old girl and since I was about 13 I've had this weird fear of my organs shifting around while i lay on my side. I feel as if laying on my side makes them ""flop over"" and all of my abdominal organs fall on top of each other. So i always sleep laying on my back usually with my arms crossed over my chest. I feel like laying flat on my back keeps everything in my body the way it should be. Also to sleep i have to wear underwear with a thick waistband and a pair of spandex shorts. That makes  me feel like everything in my belly is secure and strapped in. If i don't t have the correct underwear and shorts on or if i have to be on my side i start to panic and i feel like i cant breathe and my abdomen aches for restriction. lately it's gotten worse and worse and to the point where I'm up all night and resorting to sleeping sitting up. The past week I've tried out melatonin an hour before i fall asleep so that knocks me out a little earlier. But i don't want to always rely on that. This has been going on so long and I want to solve this problem. Even knowing that organs can't move in the way im imagining it doesn't help I still feel as though they are. Keep in mind that i am not overweight, I weigh 115lbs and i don't have any confidence issues or body image issues. I graduated high school last year and it's become worse and worse of a problem this past year. I still live with my parents and I've addressed it to my mom and she's the one who suggested melatonin but I really want to know if there is anyone else out there who struggles with this and if there is anyone who knows what could be wrong with me or give me advice. Thanks. "
5032,"I can get sleepy reading a book, but then wide awake when I out it down to fall asleep It's infuriating, as soon as I put it down it's like my brain is now free to worry about going to sleep which causes anxiety and therefore wakes itself up, yet I can't stop it."
5033,"It seems like people accept that blue light affects sleep but there may be more to it Recently I saw some stories published in various places about a study that suggested that camping could result in you falling asleep earlier and waking earlier, roughly in line with the sun. The participants didn't have any screens or even torches. It seemed like it was another study suggesting that blue-light was causing sleep problems.

As it happened I remembered that a similar study had been in the news before. Turns out the same people did both studies and there wasn't much new this time other than they did two tests, one in the summer and one in the winter.

Unlike the news stories, the study suggested that there might be other factors here. It wasn't just that the campers didn't have electric light at night but they also had high levels of day-light during the day.

The authors say that a lot of people don't get exposed to natural light during the day, working in windowless offices and going home to electric light. In this study the campers were outside most of the day and were more active as well. As a result they got not only natural light but a more intense light too. So, perhaps a lack of light is large factor in sleeplessness.

If the findings are correct, it raises other questions. How much light do we need during the day? How strong and for how long? Does colour temperature matter that much and if so could this be cured by enough of the right coloured bulbs during the day? If someone had enough light during the day, how much artificial light would be required to disrupt sleep.

Looking at my own history, it would certainly make sense. I grew up being a total early bird, I'd get up full of energy at 6:30 or 7. I spent most of my day outside or in a classroom not too far from a window. I'd watch TV late at night but it didn't seem to affect me, maybe because I'd go to bed and listen to the radio with the lights out or read a book. The opposite has been true since I started having sleep issues.

Recently I've been making some progress. I'm waking up at 9, more like 10, rather than 1 or 2pm, but it's not enough. For the last two days I've made sure that I get more light during the day. When I wake up I turn the bedroom lights on and I've made sure I've gone for walks during the day. On Saturday I woke up fairly easily, just before my 9am alarm, that I usually hit snooze on and go back to bed. On Sunday I woke up just after 8am and although I didn't get up for almost an hour it's a big improvement for me.

It's too early to know if there's any real change or if this is just a bit of luck but I thought I'd post this in case it helps someone else.

Edit: 
I've done a sleep diary for the days after I initially posted. Mainly for my own benefit but hopefully someone finds it interesting.

Day 3 - Last night I didn't get to sleep that early, might have been after midnight which I was disappointed about. Woke up this morning at 6:30! It was actually too early, usually if I wake up before I expect I try to go back to sleep and that's what I tried to do. I think I managed it but I woke up again, maybe 7:30 and finally got up at 8:00

Day 4 - Woke up at 7:30 and got straight up! A little groggy but not MUST-SLEEP groggy. It was 12/12:30 when I went to sleep. I'm also sleeping less too, so maybe my sleep is better?

Day 5- Same as yesterday. I'm worried that I'm not sleeping enough now. First woke up at 6:30. What's amazing is that last week I was concerned that while I was getting up at a semi-reasonable time it was 9/10 hrs after I went to sleep and I was still feeling sleepy.

Day 6- Decided to try to go to sleep an hour or so early. I think it worked except I woke up needing a pee! Fell asleep fairly quickly again. Woke up at 6:30 again and tried to get back to sleep, was only partially successful.

Day 8- Day 7 was much the same despite staying up late to watch TV with a cup of tea. Woke up at 5:15 on day 8 to notice my Hue light had come on then seemingly couldn't get back to sleep. Except the next time I looked at the clock it was 8:00. Think I was probably awake for an hour which might be why I woke up later.

Day 17 - Things continued well for a few days after this but unfortunately things have gone back to normal now. One reason might be that I got a bit complacent and one night I ate late and was on the computer later than I should have, might have had the lights on too. I believe the biggest difference was going back to work on Day 11. I work in the evening and I knew that I wouldn't be getting any early nights, in fact since Day 1 I've deliberately gone to bed at my usual time. However I work in quite a brightly lit environment and while I get about 2hrs of near darkness before bed it's probably enough to disrupt my sleep. 

This morning I woke up at 6-ish although it's hard to say how long I was awake for I definitely. fell asleep once. I wish there was some device that could tell when you were awake or not, I've got a fitbit but even if I shake my wrist or move it around, it might register as ""restless"" if I'm lucky. Short of electrodes I can't think of how you could register sleep vs eyes closed, perhaps some sort of phone app with a dead mans switch might work?"

5035,"A meditation technique which worked for me In my teen years I had moderate insomnia on a regular basis. This is a technique I invented which worked well for me. It's extremely difficult to describe but I will try my best, if it helps even one person it'll have been worth trying. 

In my head, I have two different ""voices"".

 My own voice which I am in total control of, the voice which is reading this out to you in your head. The voice you use when you try to talk yourself out of something, you know?

The second is what I can only describe as my ""stream of consciousness"". You know how when you begin to fall asleep, and you're in that in-between period where you're kinda dreaming but not totally unconscious? The second ""voice"" is basically that. Words, images, ideas which you are not making an effort to form, but which exist in your mind regardless. I learned how to tap into that voice while still fully awake. 

Here's how: I try my best to silence the first voice. Then I focus on the thoughts which remain. At the moment, I have a song stuck in my head so that's what remains. (note: this technique is much harder when your have an ""earworm"" like that) I silence that as well. Now all that is left is this kind of stream-of-consciousness which is very hard to describe. In my head, I ""hear"" a quiet voice speaking nonsense. Maybe it's just bits of conversations I had today, or voices from a show that I'm watching. But it's not anything coherent like the song stuck in my head. 

I do my best to focus on this voice. I listen to each word. If done correctly, it will feel like these words are flowing to you, they are not consciously being formed. Stay focused on these words. The words begin to form a kind of dreamscape, I begin to imagine strange visuals based on these words. I think this is how dreams begin. If I can stay focused, I will be hypnotized by this and begin dreaming. Sleep, hopefully, follows. 

I realize this will make no sense to 99.9% of people. I'm trying to describe the inner workings of my subconscious mind. I've never heard of this technique being used by anyone else, however I imagine that it is basically just a variation on a kind of meditation."
5036,"Missing classes due to insomnia - anyone else had this problem? Recently I've been struggling so badly.  I am an MSc student and it's got to the point where I have been up all night and eventually passed out about 6 or 7am which, if I am to be in class for 9am, is clearly no good.  I've missed two classes this way in the past week - I am at my wits end.  Apart from forcing myself to stay up all night, I honestly don't know what to do.  I also don't know whether to say something to my teachers.  It seems awful rude to just not show up, but saying 'Sorry I missed your class, I was asleep' sounds so shitty an excuse.  I feel so miserable, missing class, I can barely study because I am so exhausted.  Feel like I'm going crazy.

I can never get comfortable and going to bed had just become dreadful. The bed I used to love and struggled to leave has become uncomfortable and kinda depressing. And I can't even use sleep as an escape or a way to skip time anymore, and I god do I need that. Sometimes I honestly feel like I'd rather just die instead of trying to sleep again.

He started being a jerk (not like him at all) the day before he had to go back to work and that combined with little- crap sleep has triggered a huge depressive episode. I can't stop crying or thinking about wanting to kill myself and all the ways I could (I won't do it I know for a fact, if I thought I would I have the resources to be put on a psych evaluation). My husband understands mostly but I don't think he understands fully or to the extent on how bad it is.

I want to tell someone about it in detail but anytime I try they freak out thinking I really want to kill myself or just look at me like I am crazy and I don't want to scare anyone away. I want to talk to my dad or my friend but I don't want them to worry. 

Insomnia is more then just sleep related, it makes mental issues so much more worse then you would think. I am medicated but even still this can happen and it does.

I am fine, I just really wish people could understand depression and insomnia better, trying to explain it without people freaking out can be a pain. It can be like a little voice in the back of your head saying all these things you know aren't true but the devastation you feel make it all feel real and true.

But when 5 AM to 6 o'clock rolls around I hear the birds and pass out like a rock for a good 4 hours.  Dreams and all.  On the weekends I can get almost 6 hours.

I tried to mitigate an uncomfortable night (very hot, kind of weirdly restless) by going to bed when I felt tired instead of earlier, so that I wasn't gonna condemn myself to a night of tossing and turning. I also opted not to take a sleeping pill, because I've been going through a LOT of those, and I'm worried about the potential health impacts.

Guys, I don't know what to do at this point. The only thing in my life that has ever helped is me smoking weed back in America (I'm currently in a country where that's not feasible.)

I'm in my bed no later than 9:00 each night, and I spend hours just laying there, doing absolutely nothing until about 3-4 in the morning. 

Last year, I finally decided to try to fix it. I started following a very strict sleep schedule, slept in close to complete darkness, and avoided caffeine and alcohol.

So 3 weeks ago, I finally gave in and bought a 200ml bottle of melatonin. I took 20ml, and wait to see what happens. It made me unbelievably tired at first, and I think to myself, ""great, this works!"". How wrong I was. I was just stuck at that point of barely awake but not asleep for hours. But for whatever reason, I kept taking it, and I'm worried that I won't be able to sleep without it.

5045,"I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy... I've gotten to the point where I absolutely dread nighttime. Nighttime means sleep—and, for I'm sure many of us here, trying to sleep is nothing short of agony.

I can't remember the last time I had a restful night's sleep. It's not that I toss and turn, it's not that I continue waking up, it's that I often can't even get to that point—I can't fall asleep. My mind is tired, my body is tired, my sheets are clean and warm, but its never quite enough for me to drift into sweet rest.

I usually spend about three hours (some nights more, some nights less) laying in my bed trying to sleep. I become incredibly tired, but it never matters. At about hour three, I tend to get frustrated—which, of course, only makes matters worse. I rummage through the Internet for any tips/tricks/advice I can find; and then, upon several unsuccessful employments of various ""don't be so anxious"" clichés, I often resort to a strong dosage of Zzzquil to get the job done. It's a cycle I wouldn't wish on anyone.

My schedule is consistent, I do not take naps throughout the day, and I do not drink caffeine after 4:00pm. I'd like to think I have a positive outlook on life, and I wouldn't say I'm any more stressed than a typical person my age (24). I've tried many OTC medications and have exhausted a majority of the techniques that can be accessed online. For the rare nights that I do end up getting over four hours of sleep, they are often not restful. So here I am at almost 6am (CST) just as awake as I was at noon. 

In all honesty, I find it embarrassing and pathetic for me to be this powerless in submitting my body to perform an operation that should be so natural. I just want to sleep."
5046,"The best advice for insomnia I can give. I have been plagued with insomnia for the past year or so, and within the past few months I have been doing some experiments to figure out what works best for me. I have tried almost all suggestions that people give online, and nothing has worked, at all! Until I stumbled across an article (I can't remember where I found it-I'm trying to find it now) that gave me the absolute best advice. 

*A little backstory:*  My insomnia began when I started working 6am to 2pm shifts instead of my usual 1pm to 9pm shifts. How was I expected to be fully rested and be at work by 6AM?!?!? I started to worry about not getting my full eight hours of sleep, and not having the energy I needed to get through work the next day. This was the start of my insomnia.


Here is all of the things I tried that didn't work

- Valerian Root (tea and pill)

- Melatonin (10mg and 3mg - teas and pills)

- Doxylamine Succinate

- Benadril

- Magnesium Citrate

- Moving my electronics out of the room

- Not using electronics a few hours before bed

- Waking up at the same time everyday

- Exercise ( I ran/jogged 2.6 miles every morning - didn't help)

- Reading under a dim light

**Doing these things actually made it harder for me to fall asleep, because I did them with the anticipation that it would make me fall asleep easier! Which made it worse!**


I took a vacation week when Dark Souls III came out for PC (I had a vacation and needed to use it-I'm about to move and be with another company), and I had no problems sleeping whatsoever! I would go to bed at midnight and wake up around 7am and go for a run. It took me less than 15 minutes to fall asleep and I always felt fully rested the next day (unless I drank that afternoon). 

I came to the conclusion, that **it was my worry about the next day that caused me to stay awake.** 

- I worried about my performance.

- I worried about what time I'd fall alseep.

- I worried about waking up in the middle of the night and not being able to fall back asleep.

- I worried about having such a crazy workday ahead of me that I wouldn't just be able to make it through.


I had to be up at 5am today to be ready for work. And do you know what I did before I went to bed last night? Played Dark Souls, talked to my friends over Skype, and drank grape soda. I didn't give a darn about being tired today, and in turn I fell asleep fast and felt well rested and ready for my workday.

So here is something to try: Have fun with your night regardless of what is going to happen, and **don't try to fall asleep.** Do what you would normally do until you feel that you need to sleep and then continue to lay in bed, but don't try to sleep! JUST RELAX AND HAVE FUN.

TL;DR - Thinking about insomnia (and the things to counteract it) actually makes insomnia worse- and you just need to relax and have fun!

My boyfriend can literally lay down and be asleep within seconds, without fail. As such, he doesn't ""get"" insomnia. He gets angry with me because I don't ""try"" to sleep, and I've tried to explain to him that my body and my mind just don't work that way, but it never gets through to him.

He gets angry and frustrated, I get angry and frustrated, and that's one more way insomnia fucks up my life.

5050,"Finally completely free of sleeping meds and sleeping better than I ever did on them I'm not saying I never needed to go on meds in the first place, because I definitely did.  Last summer I was in a terrible place, and sleeping meds gave me a shot at actually getting a few hours of sleep as opposed to going days without a wink of sleep.  I'm just saying there is light at the end of the tunnel for everyone with insomnia on meds and when you feel stable and ready to tough out the taper, you'll be able to go off them.  Don't rush going off the sleeping meds if you don't think you're ready, but if you feel 'stable' on sleeping meds, I'd gather the confidence and give tapering off a try.  Don't be surprised if it gets worse for a while, tough it out because it'll eventually get better again.  The first few times I tried quitting meds, I went back to not sleeping at all for days at a time and got scared that I was going back to where I was at before so immediately went back on them without giving it a decent shot, or sticking it out a while more.  This is because the first few times, I tried tapering off them when I wasn't 'stable' on them yet.  When you get to the point where you can consistently sleep with meds for a few months, only then should you consider tapering off.

I slept worse while tapering off them and for about a week after I had completely given up them, but after that harsh ""withdrawal"" phase (sweating, worse insomnia, etc), I feel like I'm for the most part better off now.

5054,"Choline cured my insomnia To make long story short, I've suffered from insomnia for 15 years although I wasn't a good sleeper even as a child. Every time I lie down, it feels like my brain is turned on -- stupid and irrelevant thoughts pop to my mind keeping me awake. 

For the first decade I tried every prescription drug available. The only one that didn't cause tiredness or other side effects was mirtazapine -- in extremely low dosages it just make you a bit more sleepy. Though even a bit too much causes awful tiredness during the next day. Of course in addition to drugs, I've tried every other remedy available but I don't think I need to tell you that.

In the past five years I started 'biohacking' my insomnia. My posting history gives an indication of what I've been doing. I've tried fish oil, lactobacillales, GABA, HTP5, taurine, creatine, etc. 

Nothing helped until I encountered PhosphatidylCholine. First I took whole pills (250mg) that caused tiredness, headache and other problems. But I noticed it had a strange effect on my brain activity. So I started to lower the dosage until I reached about 75mg every other day.

First of all the main effect was natural sleepiness. Now, instead of feeling anxious and tense every night, I feel simply tired and sleepy. Before it took me about two hours to fall asleep, now it takes less than ten minutes. It feels like choline silences the 'voices' in my head. My thought don't jump all around but stay focused. Even when I wake up at night my mind doesn't start racing.

It's been now two months since I started taking choline and its effect hasn't changed or lessened. It DOES have side effects that I would summarize as 'feeling different'. Some or good and some are bad but in the end, nothing beats not feeling tired all the time.

I hope this helps someone else.

Edit: since choline accumulates to your brain, it might take a week or so until you notice the effect."

5056,"PSA, this is a solvable problem TLDR: 
I was on here four months ago and read a PSA post from someone who had gotten better after suffering from chronic insomnia.  That post mentioned CBT for insomnia and it inspired me to give it a go. I'm happy to say IT WORKS.  I sleep soooo much better now than when I was on Ambien.  The biggest help is sleep restriction.  
/TLDR

It all started 2 years ago, when I was overwhelmed by trying to work 80 hours a week.  I was super stressed about getting everything done and when I couldn't fall asleep, I would lay there and try to force myself to sleep.

Rule #1) never try to force yourself to sleep.  It is a losing battle.

However, relaxation techniques can be helpful.  I recommend getting really good at one of them, and only using that one.  For me I will simply play a game with myself in which I count my breaths.  In is ""one"", out is ""two"", in is ""three"" etc.  With each outward breath, I will feel myself sinking into the bed and I will consciously relax any tension in my muscles.  The game is to see how high I can count before I lose track.  I usually don't get over 40.  I find that breathing a little faster than I normally do is helpful.  If you find that you have stopped counting, just start over.  If you find yourself stressing out about the game, then it's probably time to get out of bed and go read a book.  

The worst cycle to get caught in is to lay there stressing about not sleeping.  You will never fall asleep if you are stressed about sleeping, and trying harder to sleep won’t work.  If it did, you probably wouldn’t be here reading this, would you?  If you keep that cycle up, it will become normal for you to lay there stressing about sleep.  This is a condition known as Insomnia.

To break this cycle, never force yourself to sleep and only go to bed when you are sleepy. Get out of bed and go read something that is not stressful. The stress comes from the thoughts “I can’t sleep” or “I won’t be able to get everything done tomorrow”.  If you are reading a lovely short story about bob’s vacation in El Salvador, then those thoughts can’t happen.  You will relax and start to feel sleepy.  

Shutting up the thoughts is also the point of counting your breaths.  If you are counting “one, two, three, etc”, you can’t wonder if you are going to pass the test or have enough money to pay rent.

Another problem that I had is that I have a partner who needs about 20% more sleep than I do, and I had been trying to go to bed when she does.  If you are a poor sleeper with a partner who sleeps a lot and you try to go to bed when they do, you are 100% guaranteed to develop insomnia, which gets us to rule #2.

Rule #2) never, ever, ever be in bed if you aren't actually sleepy.

This rule is difficult.  After being on Ambien for a year, I started to need it every night just to fall asleep.  Not only that, but I was no longer sleeping through the night.  I am pretty confident that the Ambien was disrupting my body's normal sleep cycle and was actually causing my insomnia at that point (The stressful situations that had initiated the insomnia had passed).

The reason rule #2 is hard is because I had forgotten what feeling sleepy felt like. It’s not the same as being exhausted.  Sleepy is an active mechanism in your brain that kicks in when it is damned good and ready to.  There are things that you can do to encourage it, such as relaxing, avoiding evening caffeine, not exercising 2 hours before bed, getting up at the same time every day (yes, weekends too), but until than mechanism kicks in there is nothing for you to do but wait for it, and don’t do the waiting for it in bed.

I started to call the mechanism “Mr. Sleepy”. Sometimes Mr. sleepy wanted to visit, and sometimes he didn’t.   All you can do is wait for him to pay you a visit.  Trying to force him to visit scares him.

Rule #3) no drugs.

If you are dependent on any drug to fall asleep, that drug will eventually become less effective. Remember the first time you drank alcohol? Caffeine?  Even if you don't drink coffee every morning, ask your friend who does, eventually, it just loses its effectiveness.  Even the over the counter stuff.  It has been repeatedly shown that CBT for Insomnia is much better than drugs in the long run, and my personal experience backs that up.

Realization #1) There is a thing called core sleep.  Core sleep is about 5.5 hours a night, no matter how bad your insomnia gets, you will get at least this much sleep on average.  Of course you could go several days without sleep, but you will eventually get that 5.5 hours, no matter what.

So I was suffering from insomnia and developing a tolerance to Ambien, and the only solution was rules #1 and #2.  

The following 2 weeks were very difficult.  I found keeping a sleep log to be very good.  

Rule #4) keep a sleep log

Mine is here:  you should be able to download a copy and use mine
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16VuxmiANGcQLrMbT3ihan4DBIbvzy_F9A5u7jVuaZiQ/edit?usp=sharing

I kept track of the hours with decimal hours (10.25 is 10:15) The sleep score is the amount of time you are asleep divided by the total amount of time you spend in bed.  Your score should be above 80%

Looking at my sleep log should be instructive.  I took my last Ambien on 4/22  the following 2 weeks were pretty tough, but by 5/9, you can see that I was averaging 6 to 7 hours of sleep a night.  I stopped recording my feels at around that time because things started to level out.  Today, 4 months on, I am sleeping 7 hours a night and only having about 1 night a week that I only sleep 5 or 6.

That experience taught me Realization #2.

Realization #2) even if you are sleeping 5 hours a night on average, you will survive.  For the first 2 weeks, I only slept 5.5 hours a night on average, but I was still able to get up, go to work, and take care of my shit.  This realization is incredibly useful to me today, because now, when I can't fall asleep immediately, I know that I'll do fine the next day,  I might not feel amazing, but it won't impact my ability to get my work done.  This realization means less stress.  Less stress means more sleep.

So sleep restriction means you’re going to have a lot of reading time on your hands.  I recommend installing Flux, buying a 15 watt incandescent reading light, and some books:

TLDR2:
Rules #1 and #2 are the only real rules; the rest of this stuff is just here to help you with those two rules

I just have a feeling that it would make one feel better"
5064,"Some things that help 'cause I'm on my own. Hi, all! So.. a little background, i guess. I've had insomnia as long as I can remember. I remember staying up for 3 days when I was 8 just because I couldn't sleep. This happened multiple times. I'd go to bed early, but be up for hours and hours. And then I'd wake up after only 4 or 5 hours of sleep. When I was 9, I developed psychosis which has now gone into full blown schizophrenia.  The insomnia has exacerbated the issue, but I digress. I've tried all sorts of doses of melatonin and it worked for awhile. Even after 2 months now of not taking it, it still doesn't work. Trazodone was prescribed to me by my psychiatrist, but that has since stopped working as well. My antipsychotic has a side effect of drowsiness, which helped for awhile, but this has also worn off. I'm in between psychiatrists right now, so I'm on my own. My current psychiatrist wouldn't help me anyway.

After that long story, here are some tips from me to help get to sleep! 

1. Put the electronics away! - I know you're bored just laying there, but this might be part od the reason you're awake. I havent gone to sleep before midnight in years. I put the ipod away at 1015 now and I've been asleep before midnight every night.

2. Have a set time to go to bed - this has actually helped me. I take my medications (antipsychotic and multivitamin) between 9 and 930. Bedtime is usually around 10-1030. I'm a nursing student so my days start early. 

3. Get up early - this has helped me tremendously. I know you're tired.  But within a few days you'll be on a better schedule. I try to be up by 730 every day. No, it doesn't work all the time. I have a day every week where I just sleep as long as I want, but evem when I do that, I'm getting up earlier. And therefore getting to sleep earlier

4. Use your bed only for sleeping - I never thought this would work until I tried it. I lived in a 4 bedroom apartment with 7 people for 2 years. My bed was my sleeping area, my dining room, my desk, and my living room. I did everything on my bed. I've since moved amd now only use my bed for sleeping and I'm getting to sleep earlier because now my body knows bed=sleep

5. Reading - I read every night before bed with my fiance. It helps me to relax after a day of staring at computer screens and working on patients. I relax and so I get to sleep faster.  I only read for an hour, tops. Most of the time I fall asleep while reading. 

6. Chamomile tea - it works wonders on sleep amd anxiety (I als o have anxiety amd panic disorders. I'm a mess, haha!). I've found that amythi g warm in my stomach will help me sleep. The two biggest things I've found that helped were chamomile tea and oatmeal. It takes some trial and error on times. For me it works best if I drink the tea just before I'm ready to sleep.

7. Find a comfortable position amd stay there! - if I wiggle too mich it wakes me up. If I lay still, I'll fall asleep

8. Nature soundtrack - I've found that a distant thunderstorm soundtrack really helps me sleep. Mostly because it gives me somethi g to drown out. 

9. No Caffeine after 10am! - Yup! That's an early time, but it's necessary. No caffeine at all, if you can avoid it. But if you can't, none after 10am! It helps!

Insomnia sucks, I know. But there are things you can do to help yourself. This is a list of what I've found helps me. It doesn't take care of the problem by any means. I still have nights were nothing I do helps, but now I'm having better nights than before. 

If you've made it this far, tbank you for reading! Please try some of this! I want you all to have a great night's sleep!"
5065,this shit is tearing me apart. JUST LET ME SLEEP
5066,"Feel like my body is locked into a 28 hour day cycle If I manage to get a full 7 or 8 hours of sleep one night, the next night, I am never ever able to go to sleep any earlier than 4 hours later than I need to.  For the next day or two, I'll get 4 or 5 hours of sleep, until I'm finally exhausted enough to go to bed at a normal time.  Then, 8 hours of sleep, and the cycle repeats.  

I feel like I would be **golden** if our days were 28 hours long... But since that's not likely to happen, I'm at a loss.  Am I just doomed to repeat this horrible cycle for the rest of my life?  It's been this way for years and years.

EDIT: I have the answer.  I just have to travel 1 billion years into the future.  The Earths rotation is apparently slowing enough to cause the day to lengthen by 1 hour every 2,500,000 years.    ........  >.<"

Then i wake up tired and then i want to sleep all day but right when i get home to sleep I can never sleep. 

What can i do to fix this?"
5069,"Specific flavor of insomnia... I don't know how common it is but, I don't know if I can't sleep or if I just don't need as much sleep. There a nights when I'm just lying in bed awake with my thoughts, and other nights when I'm tossing and turning but never quite getting to sleep. I can stay up all night if I choose and have little to no ill effects during the day, but other days I'm absolutely wrecked from lack of sleep. Some nights I'll stay up 'till morning just reading a book or watching t.v, other nights I'll be frantically constructing a crazy cardboard sculpture like my life depends on it for no reason at all(I'm a visual artist so I'm not counting the times I stay up to finish within a deadline). I'm not jacked up on caffeine because I only have one cup in the morning with breakfast. Does anyone else experience these varied forms of insomnia?"
5070,"Fast for 16 hours to reset your circadian cycle. Hey guys.  I've been an insomniac my whole life.  I've generally been shitty at falling asleep, staying asleep, breathing while I sleep (apnea), but the main issue has come down to having a late/long circadian cycle.  It's extremely easy for me to stay up late, and extremely difficult for me to fall asleep early or get up early.  It's easy for me to have a regular sleep schedule, falling asleep at midnight or so, and then in one night destroy it by not being able to fall asleep until 4 or 6 AM, and then not be able to fall asleep until like 4 AM the next night.

I'm now 26, and a lifetime of insomnia (and reading things) has taught me a lot about sleeping better.  I used to fix my circadian problems by just staying up all night some time, but that was never a great solution.

My new method is to fast for 16 hours, and then eat breakfast at regular breakfast time.  So if I want to be getting up and eating at 9 AM, I would stop eating food at 5 PM the day before.  I usually manage to fall asleep at a somewhat reasonable hour just from being so hungry, but then it's the breakfast that really sets my schedule straight.

Scientists learned about this trick by studying bats.  The bats are normally nocturnal, but at the end of their season their predatory birds migrate south, and the insects they feed on only come out during the day, so the bats become diurnal.

5079,"Sick and tired of being sick and tired Hi all, I am somewhat new to this. I have periods where I can’t fall asleep sporadically (is not always a consistent thing). Thing is it sucks. Even when I do sleep I don’t sleep well, I haven’t in years. I have ADD (diagnosed and medicated) and am hypersensitive to pain, noise, and body positioning, which doesn’t help on top of that. My back is sore most mornings too for some reason, and it kills right now. Sigh. 

I definitely have an anxiety issue which I think is probably the culprit along with my ADD. 

I plan on going to the doctor asap and seeing what I can do. I know that antidepressants such as trazadone are commonly prescribed. Thing is, I don’t have depression. I have anxiety. I would rather not take an Antidepressant as a first line therapy. It would be nice to just have something that would calm me down or make me sleep.

5081,"Delayed Sleep Phase Syndrome I wondering if this is to blame, and not insomnia?
So, I never had problems sleeping until about 5 years ago. I was always a great sleeper as a kid, and even as an adolescent. When I was 22, I started at a job where my hours were 3 am to 12 pm, and I had a long drive to work, so I had to wake up at 1:45 am. I did this job for a little under 2 years before my body couldn't take it anymore. I've had a job with normal office hours (8 am to 5 pm) for just under 4 years now. Every now and then, I'll go through bouts of insomnia where I just cannot fall asleep until 2 or 3 in the morning. Even if I'm tired, I simply cannot fall asleep. It feels sometimes like my body cant sleep yet, even though I'm tired. Last night i slept from 2:30 to 7:30 am.

I've read online that normally, this syndrome is genetic. I'm wondering, can shift work cause this as well, and can it take years to fix? I usually never have completely sleepless nights (I've only had a few in my life) but I have nights where it will take me hours to finally go to sleep. "
5082,"Forgetfulness/Memory Loss I’m 25 yrs old, I take no meds, and am healthy aside from the insomnia. The thing is I’ve been forgetful for the last few months. I go on a walk with my dog everyday and have forgotten my way back, have forgotten my locker combo, forgetten names of people I always talk to, and forget what class I’m supposed to be in. All blood tests and physicals have been normal.

It started gradually over the last 5-6 months, and while it’s pretty intermittent, it has been increasing. Luckily, I always eventually remember but could this be from insomnia. I wake up tired, and feel like I haven’t slept in a day or two."
5083,"I really hate this horrible cycle Anxiety and insomnia. Anxiety causes lack of sleep, which causes additional anxiety, and the cycle goes on. I hate being trapped in it with no way to break out.  Any tips on how to break this cycle? I get caught in it at least every couple months."
5084,"3:00 am again, I keep telling myself it's not so bad, but it's probably worse than I would like to believe. Coming up on close to a month of averaging 3 hours of sleep a night. Good nights I'll get 4 to 5, bad ones maybe an hour and a half, seems to average about 3 hours a night every week. During the day I'm so scatter brained I can't focus on work or school ( coding fo work, physics for school). Both require me to be able to sit and think but on a good day I can devote an actual real serious hour to each before I feel like I need to ram my head into a wall, which iv actually  done to make me feel better. I'm not sure if it's anxiety or depression or stress or a combination of them, but every single night for the past month I feel like I am crazier and crazier at 3:00 am. Nothing really works, I exercise regularly, not like bullshit exercise but actual keep going until my body is hurting excersise. Still no help (I do feel most clearheaded after working out so its usually when I try to get stuff done). All over the counter pills do nothing, if anything they make my insomnia worse. Went through a phase with using ""legal"" benzos like etizolam and shit that ends with lam instead of pam, that didnt work due to past substance abuse issues, that road quickly turns into ""hey these help me sleep and help me feel less anxious during the day!"" With that train of thought you see as to why those became out of the question. Honestly soup and a few glasses of hot sake have been the best to me when I try and snag those few zzzzzs, but not good enough to even feel like I can live somewhat normally throughout th day. So now here I am, one month of 3 hour nights. Feel like I'm brain dead, worried I won't be able to function through school or work for even another week..... guess I'm rambling nothing better to do at this time. Sorry just needed to vent."
5085,"How did our bodies forget how to sleep??? I've sleep fine for nearly all my life, until Aug. What the hell happened?"
5086,"Another insomnia story I am coming up on one year since insomnia entered my life. I had never thought much about sleep before..pretty much slept when I wanted. I didn’t really understand what insomnia was,but now I do.

It came on suddenly and I couldn’t understand why I didn’t just sleep. After a week of what I thought was almost no sleep, I was sure I wouldn’t survive. I even went to the emergency room where they gave me Ambien and told me to go to my doctor.

So my doctor ran a few blood tests which were normal and gave me Restoril. No other real advice so I felt I was on my own and obsessively began reading everything I could find and learned sleep meds were far from ideal. 

My insomnia continued and I never got a restful night. It made me selfish in that everything was about me and sleep day and night. I went through the motions of living but did not feel alive. I really didn’t want to spend the rest of my life this way and could now even understand why suicide is an option for someone. 

I asked my doctor for Trazedone which I thought was the best drug option. It did help but not consistently well. I was thinking and researching sleep almost constantly.  Never a day without it at the front of my mind. 

A year later I am now sleeping a lot better and feel rested most days, enjoying life again. I am still on trazedone but have decreased the dosage and am hopeful to get off. The trazedone helped but I think other things were more key. The biggest frustration is not knowing what really helps or hurts. I incorporated CBT-I methods. No formal program just what I read. Tried to not overthink and go to bed knowing I am ok however I sleep. 

Anyway just wanted to share because at one point I thought it was hopeless. Maybe it is the natural progression that I can sleep normally again or maybe combination of Trazedone,meditation and other CBT-I methods. Also it takes time so don’t give up.

5122,"What's worked (and hasn't) for me. So a few weeks back I made a couple posts here when I was at probably the lowest point of the insomnia that I've been struggling with the past month.  I wouldn't say I'm completely better now, and I've had some ups and downs, but I believe that the rough times are behind me and there's only improving from here on out.  Thought I'd share what I think has worked for me in case others can benefit from it.

First, what I don't think really did anything for me: medicine.  I first tried taking Unisom with doxylamine succinate alongside melatonin, but not only has its effectiveness been questionable whenever I have taken it (it didn't really seem to help me get to sleep faster, or stay asleep longer) it leaves me feeling WORSE the next day than if I didn't take it and got the same little amount of sleep.  I then tried this combination sleep aid I bought on Amazon called [Luma](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Habit-Melatonin-Chamomile-Magnesium-Supplement/dp/B00JCO3ALG) that has various different supplements meant to help with sleep and reducing anxiety.  I'm not entirely certain it's helping either, I've had nights where I took it but still didn't sleep well, but it doesn't leave me hung over the next day so I've incorporated it into my nightly routine at least until I run out of it.  I've found that taking it about an hour before bed works best.

I also discovered the [Sleep With Me Podcast](http://www.sleepwithmepodcast.com/).  While skeptical of it at first, I've gotten into the habit of playing it whenever I've noticed I can't fall asleep for an extended length of time, roughly half an hour.  Like the drugs it hasn't always worked...  But, probably over 75% of the times I've had to play it I've ended up falling asleep during the podcast.  The times it hasn't worked has been when I was either listening to the podcast too much and got too involved in the story being told, or when I got too fussy about volume and stuff.  But otherwise, it's worked so well that despite probably going through over ten episodes by now I can maybe recall what only two or three of them are actually about.  Usually, I'll find myself zoning out and unable to really focus on listening to it which will lead to me falling asleep.  However, I haven't actually needed it the past few days due to probably the biggest, most significant change I've made that has helped.

I stopped looking at the time everytime I woke up.  Specifically, I turned my alarm clock away from my bed and the one time I did have to turn on the podcast I covered the top of my phone so I couldn't see the time on it while hitting the play button.  This has been, by far, the biggest improvement to my sleep yet.  Instead of nights being strings of me constantly waking up and trying to get back to sleep, nights have become...  Almost normal, even if I feel the next day like I briefly recall waking up a few times.  Why's that?  Because the mere act of looking at the time when I woke up only served to wake me up further.  I'd calculate how much sleep I got and dwell on how little I had slept, or how little time I had left before I would have to get up.  Yet by resisting this, and just staying in bed and keeping my eyes closed, it feels like I've been able to get back to sleep whenever I've waken up so quickly that I can't remember I was awake at all.

On top of that, I've begun settling into a routine.  Because of my work schedule I've always preferred going to bed around 4am and sleeping until 11 to noon.  So lately, once 3am hits I'll take two of the Luna pills and start to wind down whatever I'm doing on my computer (which has long had F.lux installed on it to help with the blue light issue).  At 3:30 I'll turn off my computer and the lights, go to the bathroom and if needed take some ibuprofen (I've been having frequent headaches due to lack of sleep) and/or ranitidine if my stomach acid issues are acting up (they can end up keeping me awake).  I'll then sit down in the living room (NOT in my bed) and play an episode of the Lore podcast.  Reading or something similarly relaxing and distracting would probably also work, but I want to make sure I'm avoiding looking at a backlit screen.  I like Lore for this because the episodes are short enough to fit in that half hour time frame, self-contained so it doesn't leave me wanting to hear more to see what happens, and despite the more macabre material the music and his voice just make it a very mellow podcast to chill out to.  This helps to calm my mind, helping it shut down before bed.  Once it's done it should be around 4am, so I'll go to the bathroom one more time to try and squeeze out anything left so I don't have to go during the night and then hop in bed making sure my alarm clock's turned away from me.  Before I know it I'm usually asleep.

In the end, like probably most spontaneous insomnia I figure this has all been caused by the anxiety of not sleeping.  It first came when I got sick at the beginning of January, and sickness tends to cause my sleep to get disturbed.  But I was so worried about it that very worry ended up making things much, much worse.  And every night when I woke up, looked at the time and saw how little sleep I was getting just kept the cycle going.  But I feel I've finally managed to break that cycle by ensuring that even if I do wake up there's nothing notable that can happen to kick my mind in gear.

So here's hoping this continues to work for me.  A month of insomnia has been the longest it's ever hit me, usually it just pops up for a week or two and only manifests as difficulty falling asleep, not the difficulty staying asleep that has also been a problem recently.  With any luck this will be the last post I feel like making on here."

5124,"Surprisingly huge drop in price for my medication Hello there. 

I've had insomnia since I was about 13. I'm in my 20s now and I only recently started trying to treat it with medication in 2015. I could never afford it though because the total would always come out to be almost $100 for 30 pills and that was for the generic form of ambien. I recently renewed my prescription and now it's become less than $20! This is great because now that it's so affordable I can use it to regulate my sleep schedule instead of sleeping every other month. "

5126,"Anyone else just braindead? Memory is completely shot, cognitive functions are abysmal, basic arithmetic seems 10x harder, shit even my spelling ability has diminished. 2 hours sleep last night and on average i sleep 4, its really starting to fry my brain. Anyone else deal with this? Has anyone improved cognition after getting consistent good sleep? "
5127,"Exhausted by day, alive at night Hi everyone

I am pretty sure there’s something wrong with my sleeping pattern.
Every day I feel extremely tired in the afternoon and usually it ends up in me taking a nap. On average I go to bed at 3 and wake up at 6. The rest of the “day” I feel exhausted but stay awake for dinner and seeing my family. At 10pm I go to bed. Suddenly I’m wide awake and can’t sleep. As if I just took multiple espresso shots. Around 4am I fall asleep and on weekdays I’ll wake up at 6, when I’m free it can go from 9-12. 

So I thought I just fucked up my sleeping pattern by taking naps causing me to need less sleep right?

I’ve been forcing myself to stay awake all day, no naps. It’s been weeks since I slept during the day. I’ll still feel exhausted for the entire afternoon. But as soon as everyone starts to go to bed I feel energized. I don’t drink any coffee or sugary drinks after 5pm and I try to stay away from my laptop, tv and put my iphone screen on nightmode low brightness. Still can’t fall asleep before 4am. 


Should I just nap to get some hours of extra sleep or will that make everything worse? Are there other people like me that seem to come alive at night? 

Ps: no jetlag, taking meds for iron and b12, also take medication for hypothyroidism"
5128,"Insomnia causing school absences - how do I talk to my profs? I'm a college student and I've been dealing with insomnia that appears/disappears over time. In high school, I was driven to school so I didn't really have a choice on whether or not I was going, but now I'll sleep through lectures because I'll get to a point where I can FINALLY sleep after so long, my body will just shut down, or I'm so delirious I know I won't learn anything. 

It's getting to the point where it's genuinely affecting my studies because of participation points, which is affecting my overall mental health and confidence as a student. I need to be able to explain to my professors that I'm not just missing classes because I'm fooling around, I just literally can't sleep and miss them. 

I'm not officially diagnosed but not being able to sleep is a pretty obvious symptom I fill lol. 

I was wondering how people dealt with telling their professors and if you were able to get excused absences / sympathy? I need to not fail. "

5132,"Have insomnia? don't panic...here's some advice So it's easy to hit the panic button when you stop sleeping.  And when I stopped sleeping I hit the panic button hard because I soon found myself going completely sleepless for multiple nights in a row.  This was truly incredible after being a professional sleeper my whole life. 

My wicked stint of insomnia lasted for over a year.  That was over 10 years ago and I sleep fine now.   The point is this: The first thing you need to know is that if you have been a good sleeper for all or most of your life, then your sleep will almost certainly turn around. Generally sleepers will be sleepers.  They may have ups and downs but eventually sleepers even out to be good sleepers again.  So take heart.   It's like baseball:  .300 hitters, they say, will be .300 hitters.  They may have a bad year here or there, but these types of hitters will eventually turn it around to become .300 hitters again.   You are no different in regards to sleep.  So before you panic and go off thinking the worst, remember this; your situation will most certainly turn around.  Just be easy on yourself in the meantime.

So keeping the aforementioned in mind, I want to tell you something about insomnia:  For me, a bad night's sleep would sometimes make it a bit more difficult to go to sleep the next night.    There was something about my brain that just didn't feel the same. Like it was tight, stressed (cortisol rush?), and even though I was exhausted, I tended to not get sleepy, at least not at the right times;  at night my sleepiness would be replaced with panic and I wouldn't sleep. 

On the contrary, if I slept good one night, the next night would often be good too.  After a while I started noticing the trend that sleeping well often springboarded more good sleep.  There is something about sleeping that relaxes your brain and allows you to sleep easier, almost effortlessly sometimes.   

Even nowadays I generally sleep really well -- for months at a time...but if I have a tough night, it often remains tough for a few nights in a row.   I don't say this to scare you but rather so you can know that this may be normal.  And as frightening as this idea may be, it actually comforts me knowing the truth about it and knowing that my sleep will eventually turn around if I don't freak out and think my life is over. 

Some of the things that help me get out of a bad sleep rut are: 

1. not staying in bed all day -- get upright (sitting or standing) as much as possible, even in the evening. at least periodically. 

2.  Learn the art of yawning.  Especially in the evening.  Yawning brings more oxygen to your brain and helps it relax.   Yawning often triggers lots of yawning, which triggers real sleepiness. 

3. learn the art of distraction. Distraction is about the only real fix for fear.  Keep your mind occupied reading or watching something on tv or something you like doing. btw...computer-watching at  night can be detrimental to getting sleepy! beware....be careful. 

4.  Go to bed at a reasonable time.  I like the 10:30 - 11:30 range. We have natural sleep rhythms and various chemicals that help us go to sleep at different times of the night. These chemical waves come and go.    If you choose to go to bed at 1 or 2 am, for example, you've chosen to skip one of those waves.  

5.  Don't ""try"" to go to sleep.  Instead, try to dream.  Try to get lost in your thoughts.  Distract yourself and enjoy yourself while in bed.  Being asleep is just another stage of being awake.  You are not knocked out or unconscious when you sleep; you are just as alive and conscious there as you are in the real world.  Just relax, be easy on yourself use your thoughts to put you in another place.   Good luck, Tom"
