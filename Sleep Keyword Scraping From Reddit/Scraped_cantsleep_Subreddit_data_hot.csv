Another one of those nights,Can't sleep
Anyone up?,Can’t sleep. Want to but can’t.
Anyone here?,"I mean, obviously ya’ll here. 

Anyone else not able to sleep right now? :( "
TFW your brain is full of noise keeping you awake,
Can’t sleep meme,[original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/memes/comments/b20pse/its_a_big_day_tomorrow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)
Fuck me man,Anyone still here?
My biggest regret,"First, some context.

So I broke up with my girl friend, of 6 months, two days ago. It was my first long term relationship, and I seriously considered marrying her in another 6 months (we’re both in the military; and in training). Long story short (kinda), I got some bad news about her, from an anonymous source, while I was apart from her for a month. I took it out of context and basically made the next month hell for her. She put up with me because she did feel like she made a mistake, and felt like she had make it up to me by listening to my bullshit. When I finally got done training she was cold to me, and it took a weekend of me being ignored to make us both realize that the relationship was over. 

Anyway this is a poem I wrote to help me deal with the heartache.



Jeni


Now that she’s gone I can do what I want
Now that sh’e gone I can screw who I want

Now that she’s not in my life I can do more
No More ball and chain to hold me down

Haven’t been this free in 6 months
Go around to any bar, and show up these chumps

Find a new girl to fill the hole
Find a new girl to complete my soul

They say to not give a fuck
But I guess it just not my luck

I gave all I had to that girl
I fear I have nothing to give to the next

A man of twenty and two years old
Has never felt anything as cold
As a women that was his
Be lost by his arrogance 

It’s crazy what I could have had 
If I had not acted like a chad

But now that she’s gone there is no holding back
I could go anywhere with just a rucksack 

But nothing will ever feel the same 
Because I know I am the one to blame



Thanks for reading."
To anxious to sleep,"I hate feeling like this, while I'm tired, my mind just won't stop racing. I'm so anxious right now that its uncomfortable. I just cant stop worrying about everything thing in my life. "
I feel like a failure,"I can't sleep I've been in bed since 11 p.m it's now 4:30 a.m , most of the time I just keep thinking that i'm a failure life gives me second chances all the time but I keep doing the same exact thing, mostly realated college stuff and my life style like I almost got kicked out from college last year because my grades were so bad that I kept begging the college faculty the entire summer break but I feel I let myself down again and my family and i really worried about my future and where I live college degree is EVERYTHING."
Can’t sleep,"Currently 3:30am. Been in bed since midnight and I can’t sleep, I woke up after an hour and a half and have been lay here since just switching positions. 

I hate this crap, it happens a few times a month and I don’t know why. Maybe it’s because I went extra hard at gym, maybe it’s because of the Pepsi before bed or some underlying problem who knows. 

I have work and need to be up at 6.30am. Fuck. 

I wish you all a lovely sleep <3. "
Sleep is hard,"I've lost that much sleep over the years and get on average 4-5 hours sleep a night for a physically labourious job. It's gotten to the point my body is so exhausted I can't stop shaking. 

Nothing helps me get to sleep either - the only time I manage to sleep more than 6 hours is when I'm too exhausted to stay awake."
"Cant sleep, obviously","I just got surgery and ive been okay with sleeping these past few nights but tonight i just cannot do it for some reason
Ive been trying and switching positions and adjusting the temperature and i just dont know what to do?? 
Ive been trying for the past 4 hours now and nothing works
This usually only happens when i have to be at school the next day but i dont have to be back for another three weeks?? 
Im just confused and dazed i guess i mean
I just wanna s n o o z e yknow but my body will not physically allow me to and it sucks "
Me: clicks my phone off and closes my eyes,"My brain: you have 8 things to google that I want the answers to right now. Maybe you should make a list of all the things you're supposed to do tomorrow. Did you set an alarm? Hurry I need answers STAT or your life will be in shambles. You didnt drink enough water today maybe you should get up and have a glass and then you'll have to pee in 30 minutes so might as well go on your phone. You cant remember an item on your grocery list? Told you you should've written it down. Hey hows that hobby you havent started going maybe now a good time to watch a how-to video on youtube. Speaking of youtube watch an ASMR video that'll calm you down. Then go ahead and click through 9 videos because you're never satisfied. This shirt is kind of uncomfortable fix it. Now take it off. Now I'm cold go get a different one. Here's another 3 questions only google can answer.

"8AM, still at it...","What do you guys think, should i just stay up until the evening or try to get some sleep troughout the day? That usually fucks the sleep cycle up.."

Really thought things were getting better but I’ve done a completely 360 and gone back to getting no sleep.
"
How I fall asleep,"I don’t use melatonin as it doesn’t work for me but I found a sleep aid at the health food store and it works so well. 
Here are some other helpful tools that helped me in the past that might help you:

- lavender bath before bed
- bedtime yoga on youtube
- sleep mediations on youtube 
- podcasts 
- Tara Brach mediations 
- exercising during the day not evening 
- turning down bedroom temperature
- writing in my gratitude journal 
- reading the bible or any other boring book I would never read 
- no tv 1/2hr before bed
- no devices 1/2hr before bed "
I get about 3hrs max these days,I don't smoke anymore. I don't drink anything with caffeine ever. No foreign psychoactive substances at all. I sleep in the dark and always use blue light filters after 9 or 10pm. And yet... No matter how tired I am... I can't sleep before 8am... and right now I just can't sleep at all.. whats happening.. 
I’ve been on this sub for a while and I finally found something that works for me,"My main reason for my sleep trouble comes from my medication, ADD, and the fact that I have to study late at night. I have been using benedryl for some sort of relief but it’s not too good, especially after using it for longer than a week. But I finally tried something that is always suggested here: melatonin !

For real! Melatonin works wonders! I wish I tried it sooner! I just got some 3mg of melatonin and take it half an hour before I want to sleep and it has been great! 

Just wanted to come back here and post this- if you have not at least tried it, please do! I never thought it would work so well. "
In need of assistance. Having nightmare,"So I started my sleep with my usual dream about this girl I like and how we were dating. Flash forward what felt like eternity in dream land and I’m at my cottage with a group of people and this girl is here (Audrey). Everyone leaves and then there’s this fucking wolf mom and fox mom trying to kill me for some fucking reason. 

Now I’m too scared to go to sleep but don’t have internet to watch Netflix "
An interesting title,"I got glasses just over a week ago with that blue light filter in them, and I’ve gone from sleeping 3-4 hours a night to sleeping through the whole night (and my alarm for work twice in 3 days). Some idiot forgot to put her glasses on before leaving the house, and it’s now 1:30am and I have to be up again at 4:30…I’m starting to think those glasses might actually work for me 🤔"
Failed 2 exams and a lab. I have no idea what I'm doing in uni and I'm in my 3rd year.,I guess it was always expected of me to have a degree. So I went into engineering. I'm still struggling and it is so painful. I honestly try but the marks I get reflect someone with no understanding of the course material vs someone who didn't solve some problems.
Struggling to sleep. Any ideas to help?,"I’ve been trying to be in be by 10-10:30 every night (college student), but I usually stay up way later, like tonight (3:30ish in the morning as I write this). 

I’m constantly thinking of things that stress me out, like trying to fin another job, paying my semester off to sign up for classes next semester, all that good stuff. 

I take my anxiety meds in the morning and when I can’t sleep I take melatonin to try to help. It gets me to the point my body is tired but my brain is like “naw fam, we staying up.” 

I stop drinking caffeine around 6pm so I can sleep, I don’t have bright lights in my room, I have quiet background noise, and all that. I literally do everything drs will recommend with sleeping issues. 

Does anyone have anything that could possibly help me? Thank you in advance! ❤️

Any ideas to help? "
Mental distractions to help you sleep for when you’re too anxious to read before bed?,"I’m usually too anxious to read before I sleep, so I have a hard time paying attention. Instead, I’ve been focusing on breathing while I try to think of a story in my head. It helps to divert from the anxiety and be sort of fun. Does anyone else do this?

I think of a character who isn’t based on a person. I think of what they look like and what their values are. Then I think of something they want or need. Then some sort of event or conflict... and I go on and on. You get it... it’s a story, but it’s being surprisingly effective in beating back the malaise that hits when you’re alone with your thoughts trying to fall asleep.

Does anyone else have a mental exercise like this? 

Good luck, everyone "
This channel on YouTube has some great White noise videos. This helps me sometimes.,
Bed takeover,One cat is at my feet and the other one keeps laying on the blanket so I can’t pull it around to cover my whole body. When I move them they go right back. Little torturers. And my son is here too kicking me. Why do kids have to dig their feet into you while they sleep?
How's everyone doing?,
Lots of good pointers in here. What works for you guys?,
Last night- every night,
Where is the body,
My fucking fan sucks,"My fan that I've had for about 2 years is starting to piss me off. If it's in the wrong position it makes it BRRRRBRRRRRRRR sound and I have to move it in a very specific way to get it to sound normal. I can't sleep without the fan on me, but more importantly, I can't sleep without the peaceful REGULAR noise it usually makes. I moved it today to get more fannage, and it made the noise.. Except this time when I tried to move it to the correct position it's making that loud noise but just a liiiittle quieter, but loud enough for me to notice and it's driving me crazy. It's time for a new fan but alas, I'm broke so I must suffer my sleepless nights for the foreseeable future. "
Ugh sleep,Ughh I need to sleeep
Anyone up and wanting to talk,It’s currently a quarter to midnight and I just don’t feel like sleeping and I like thinking a lot and I need a place to put my thoughts down and get feedback because I haven’t been able to drop it the past couple nights 
The reason I'm afraid,"Was gonna type something dynamic out but medications are taking me. I will die or be on the verge of death in this dream
I tried to fight it as long as I could. I wish I could take someone else into the realm with me.. I'm getting tired of fighting alone"
Fucking Hell,"Fucking hell I can't sleep, it's almost 4AM. No wonder I keep waking up at 1PM. If i slept at 5AM, 8 hours later would be 1PM. Been rolling in my bed for almost 3-4 hours, this is fucking agony. "
Ugghhhhhh trying so hard to sleep..........,I have restless legs bad. Need to sleep. Headache kicking in. 
Trying to put on paper whats in my head..cant sleep 12:16 cst,
Anybody awake?,
That baby from Eraserhead is keepin me up and the only thing keeping me safe is my blanket,
Sleep is hard,"I found this subreddit and decided to post here. So it is currently 2:30 am local time and I can’t sleep. I don’t know why but I’m bored, not tired, and contemplating life’s decisions. Worst yet, I know I’m going to regret staying up so late because I have school today/tom. Oh well. Hello r/cantsleep. Hope you guys eventually sleep and good night. "
Trying 100 backwards.,Keep ya posted.
$tre$$ed,Hate you money. Can’t sleep.
"Do you guys ever watch a show, then happen to watch it again drunk and notice certain things that you never did before?? It’s kinda weirding me out",
Too stressed to sleep because my cats potentially missing.,"One of my cats is maybe missing, hasn’t been home in about 8 hours now so I feel it’s too early to post all over social media to report him missing. And he does love a good wander outside for a couple of hours, but this is far too long. It’s also freezing cold. 
My mum remembered that the bins were emptied today and maybe the big bin lorry scared him as he’d never have seen a vehicle that big having only recently become an outdoor cat and got scared by it and accidentally run away and got lost. I walked around our street and some close by calling for him several times throughout the evening but no luck. 

He’s microchipped at least if someone finds him and takes him to be scanned. And I’ve heard plenty of stories of cats missing for days/weeks and just strolling back into the house one day like nothing happened. 
Just feel stressed as he’s never spent a full night outside, he always comes in, and the temperatures aren’t good at the moment. "

Anyone else planning an all dayer?,Haven’t slept a wink the past few nights. I’ve been talking to an old friend who’s in a completely different time zone. Have a lot of stuff I have to do tomorrow and I’m contemplating staying up all night. 
18 ways to get AMAZING sleep!,"Here are the 18 tips. You can also see them in this youtube video I've made!

&#x200B;

  

**ENVIRONMENT**

**Tip 1: Make your bedroom completely dark**

So the first step is to make your bedroom completely dark, because the blue light from street lamps and other sources will affect your circadian clock, which will delay the production of the sleep hormone melatonin.                              

**Tip 2: Avoid blue light from all your electronic devices**

Tip number two is to avoid the blue light from all of your electronic devices before bed time. Personally, I turn off all electronic devices an hour before bed and use that time for reading or journaling, which is much more productive than what I otherwise would have used that time for. If that's too much for you, it's also possible to make many of your electronic devices emit less blue light. For your computer, you can download F.lux. For your android device, you can download ""Twillight"", and for iPhone, there is a built-in feature called ""night shift"". It's also possible to set some websites like YouTube and Reddit to ""night"" mode, which will remove a lot of the white light, which is beneficial since white light contains all colors and therefore also the blue light we try to avoid. Otherwise you could also just buy some blue light blocking glasses.

**Tip 3: Make your bedroom cold**

Tip number three is to make your bedroom cold before bedtime. Our core body temperature starts dropping when it's bedtime, so if your bedroom is too hot, it will prevent this natural process from happening. Therefore, the recommended temperature for your bedroom when sleeping is 60-67 degrees fahrenheit, which is about 15.5 to 19.5 degrees celsius.

**Tip 4: Invest in a high quality pillow and mattress**

Tip number four is to make sure you have a high quality ergonomic pillow and mattress that will support your body in its natural curvature. You spend a third of your life in bed, so it's worth investing in.

**Tip 5: Get fresh air in your bedroom**

Now the fifth tip is to make sure that the air in your bedroom is fresh. Houseplants like the peace lily can improve the air quality -- reducing contrentations of benzene, x,x,x,x. --, and therefore, also your sleep. I've included a link to an infographic in the description where you can read more.

**Tip 6: Remove unwanted noise**

The sixth tip is to reduce unwanted noise in your bedroom. Even if you don't wake up because of noise, it can still interfere with your sleep quality. If many inconsistent noises keep you awake, you could consider either getting some ear plugs, or otherwise playing some white noise or ambient sounds.

**Tip 7: Keep your alarm out of hand's reach**

Tip 7 is to keep your alarm clock away from you when you sleep. Watching how much time you have left for sleep can cause unnecessary stress, and therefore make it harder to sleep. If you have trouble with snoozing, then place the alarm clock somewhere that forces you to leave the bed upon waking up, and therefore causes you to start the day immediately.

For the next 7 tips, you do have to change yourself, or at least your behaviour.

**BODY**

**Tip 8: Start exercising**

Tip eight is that you have to start exercising, since it will increase the build up of adenosine in your brain, which will make it easier for you to fall asleep at night. Just make sure that you are done training at least an hour before bed, because training is a stimulating activity.

**Tip 9: Eat healthy**

Tip nine is to eat healthy, so your body has all the nutrients it needs to repair itself during the night. In one study, researchers controlled people’s diets, and saw that eating more sugar, more saturated fats and less fiber was linked to lighter, less restorative sleep, with more awakenings. If your sleep quality doesn’t improve upon implementing the other strategies, maybe your diet is the main culprit.

**Tip 10: Don't eat too much or too little before bed**

Tip number ten is do not eat too much or too little before bed time. Eat up till 3 hours before you plan to sleep, but with that said, if you come home late, then it's better to eat something compared to nothing, but don't be tempted by sugary foods, since this can lead to sugar cravings and overeating. It’s worth experimenting since this varies person to person.

**Tip 11: Don't drink too much before bedtime**

Tip eleven is don't drink too much before bed. Make sure you are hydrated throughout the day, but don't drink too much 1 to 2 hours before bed, since you will risk having to get up in the middle of the night to pee.

**Tip 12: Get rid of stress**

Tip number twelve is to find a way of getting rid of stress before bed time, since during stress your body releases glucocorticoids such as cortisol, which wil keep you awake. A good way of getting rid of stress, that I personally use, is to have a bedtime ritual, where you spend some time meditating, stretching, reading or something else to relax before bed. Having this bedtime ritual primes your brain to enter a relaxing state more easily, so it will be easier to fall asleep.

**Tip 13: Reduce or eliminate Alcohol and Cannabis consumption**

Tip thirteen is to reduce or eliminate Cannabis and alcohol consumption. Cannabis and Alcohol may help people fall asleep faster, but will reduce the time spent in REM sleep, which is a necessary part of the sleep cycle where we dream.

**Tip 14: Get sunlight in the morning**

Tip number fourteen is to get sunlight as soon in the day as possible, since this will wake you up and reset your body's circadian rhythm, and your body will therefore know when it's time for sleep at night.

**Tip 15: Don't sleep on your stomach**

Tip fifteen is to not sleep on your stomach. Unless you can breathe through your pillow, you'll have to twist your neck, which can give neck and back problems, which will make your sleep quality worse. So sleep on your back or on your side. If you are prone to sleep apnea or snoring, then sleeping on the side can help.

And now the last 3 tips has to do with the timing of your sleep.

**TIMING**

**Tip 16: Consistent sleep schedule**

Tip sixteen is to have a consistent sleep schedule. A good way of letting your body know when it's time for bed is to have a consistent sleep schedule. So you should aim for getting to sleep and waking up at the same time everyday. Even on weekends. Naturally, life happens, so do not fret if your sleep gets dysregulated, instead, just revert back to a consistent routine as soon as possible.

**Tip 17: Take naps**

Tip seventeen is to take naps. Taking a nap has many health benefits, and the best time to do it is around 2 or 3 pm. The ideal duration of a nap is approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Doing it much longer or too late in the evening can interfere with your circadian rhythm, and therefore, interfere with you ability to fall asleep at night.

**Tip 18: Wake up during light sleep**

Tip 18 is to wake up in light sleep. When we sleep, we go through 4 sleep stages. 3 of the stages are Non-R.E.M. sleep and the fourth stage is R.E.M.-sleep, where most of our dreams occur. The goal is to wake up during stage 1 of non-R.E.M. sleep, which is our lightest sleep. Many people think it's possible to calculate when to wake up, because an average sleep cycle is 90 minutes. But the problem is that 90 minutes is just an average and can vary by more than 30 minutes each way! So another option is to download an app for your smartphone that will analyze your sleep patterns and wake you up during light sleep. Currently, no studies have investigated their effectiveness, but it seems to work for many people, but one study does show that after people start tracking their sleep with these sleep apps, it helps them get into the habit of sleeping longer, so it may be worth a try anyway.

I’ve been up for an hour because this random guy and his friend are messaging me on instagram. Any suggestions of what to do?,
Boyfriend loves league so much he stays up all night. Then he sleeps in and doesn't clean the house... I haven't had a break in 9 days working at a place I hate. Someone please just murder my life.,"im on my 9th day of work. I'm fucking tired and frustrated I have work in the morning and I'm pissed off because my boyfriend decided he wanted to stay up all night and play league and watch videos about league. Which means the door needed to be closed and we dont have a window in our room. So as I stayed cooking in my bedroom this guy just played league all night and did whatever...

I'm also like wtf because let me remind you going on 9 days of work now and he hasn't helped with cleaning the house or nothing.  And the cherry on top of the cake.... now hes fucking sound asleep right beside me. Keep in mind he doesn't have to work tomorrow.... I do..."
Im in so much pain! 😭,Went to the ER at around 12 AM because I was in so much pain I thought I was going to die. It's almost 6 AM and I'm just waiting for the pharmacy to open so I can get my antinflamitory and get some rest.
Making chicken broth in the Crock-Pot overnight is so easy.....,".....Except when it wakes you up at 2am, and won't let you go back to sleep because it smells so good! I swear I'm not hungry, but my sense of smell is just making my brain stay awake!!! Gah! It's been over an hour of being awake now.....*sigh*"
I want to die,"Yyyyyooooowowowowowo every night I can’t sleep
I hear my alarm going “beep”
There’s a lot on my mind
But peace and quiet I can’t find

Hello sleepless my old friend,I've come to see you again 
Not sure why I can’t sleep,"I’m stressed about school? It’s the new antidepressant I’m taking that sometimes causes this? I’m stressed about the antidepressant?

I literally have no idea."
18 ways to improve sleep!,"  

I'm going to make a youtube video on sleep quality and falling asleep. Can you see anything wrong in the 18 tips? Any tips i'm missing?

   
 

tip 1:  Make your bedroom completely dark, because the blue light from street lamps and other sources will affect your circadian rhythm, so your body will think it needs to be awake.

   
 

tip 2: 

Another source of blue light is your computer, television, smartphone and other things with screens. Personally I turn off all electronic devices an hour before bed and use that time for reading or journaling, which is much more productive than what I otherwise would have used that time for. If that's too much for you, it's also possible to make many of your electronic devices emit less blue light. For your computer you can download F.lux. for your android you can download ""Twillight"", and for Iphone there is a built in feauture called ""night shift"". Otherwise you could also just buy some blue light blocking glasses.

   
 

Tip 3: 

Our core body temperature starts dropping when it's bed time, so if your bedroom is too hot, it will prevent this natural process. Therefore the recommended temperature for your bedrom when sleeping is 60-67 degrees fahrenheit, which is about 15.5 to 19.5 degrees celcius.

Tip 4:

Make sure you have a high quality pillow and mattress that will support your body in it's natural curvature. 

   
 

Tip 5:  Make sure that the air in your bedroom is fresh. Houseplants like Peace lily can improve the air quality, and therefore also your sleep. I've included a link in the description where you can read more.

Tip 6:

Make sure that it's quiet in your bedroom. Even if you don't wake up because of noise, it can still interfere with your sleep quality. If many inconsistent noises keep you awake, you could consider either getting some ear plugs, or otherwise playing some white noise or ambient noise.

   
 

Tip 7:

Keep your alarm clock away from you when you sleep. Watching how much time you have left for sleep will just stress you out, and prevent you from being able to sleep.

   
 

Tip 8:

Exercising will increase the build up of adenosine in your brain, which will make it easier for you to fall asleep in the night. Just make sure that you are done training at least an hour before bed, because training is a stimulating activity.

   
 

Tip 9:

Stretching out can help your muscles relax, and will make you fall asleep faster.

   
 

Tip 10:

Don't sleep on your stomach. Unless you can breath through your pillow, you'll have to twist your neck, which can give neck and back problems, which will make your sleep quality worse. So sleep on your back or side. If you are prone to sleep apnea or snoring, then sleeping on the side can help.

   
 

Tip 11:

Eat healthy, so your body has all the nutrients it needs to repair itself during the night. 

   
 

Tip 12:

Make sure you are hydrated, but don't drink too much 1-2 hours before bed, since you will risk having to get up in the middle of the night to pee.

   
 

Tip 13:

Find your way of getting rid of stress before bed time, since the release of cortisol doing stress will keep you awake. A good way of getting rid of stress is to have a bed time ritual, where you spend some time before sleep meditating, stretching, reading or something else to relax before bed.

   
 

Tip 14:

Get sunlight as soon in the day as possible, since this will reset your body's circadian rhythm, and it will therefore know when it's time for sleep at night.

   
 

Tip 15:

A good way of letting your body know when it's time for bed is to have a consistent sleep schedule, so you aim for getting to sleep and waking up at the same time everyday. Even on weekends. 

   
 

Tip 16:

It's okay to sleep longer if you are in sleep debt, but if you find yourself needing more than 9 hours of sleep every night, then this can be unhealthy.

   
 

Tip 17:

Taking a nap has many health benefits, and the best time to do it is around 2 or 3 pm. The ideal duration of a nap is 20 to 30 minutes. During it much longer or to late in the evening can interfere with your circadian rhythm, and therefore interfere with you ability to fall asleep at night.

   
 

Tip 18:

If your alarm wakes you up in the midle of deep sleep or rem sleep, then you will feel groggy and tired, so aim for waking up during light sleep. "
Drunk people have no respect for sleep.,"Maybe it's my fault for not putting my phone on ""do not disturb""  

1:15, drunk friend calls. Me, single mom, awake, v confused. ""Oh, right, sorry, bye. ""

3:30, just started dreaming again. Wake up to loud crash in the house. Its my roommates friend, sans roommate. He passes out on the couch in the room adjacent to my bedroom, snores like he's sucking paint off the walls. 

3:45, thunderstorms begin. 


My kid will wake up naturally in about 2 hours 😐🔫"
Can’t sleep and running out of ways to occupy myself! Hhheeeeelllllppppp!!!!,
A sleep for two hours had part two of a horrible nightmare woke up and it's officially my birthday.,"I had a dream like maybe a year ago that me and my husband went an looked at these condos. In real life we are home owners and we have a pretty small house but we love it. In the dream the condos we're like 4 story loft condos. So like each level was one entire condo but no walls devided them. And a shared large yard/dog park in the from of the building. So in the dream we liked them and decided to buy one. I think that was pretty much my first dream. I woke up and just thought it was funny how the condos didn't have any walls and you had to hear and breath your neighbors air, cooking, everything. I told my husband about the dream and we both had a good laugh.

Tonight, I innocently go to sleep, not knowing what crazy shit my brain has in store for me. Upon slipping into a snoozing unconsciousness part two begins...

Now it's apparently been the right amount of time to wait before moving into this condo. So my husband and I and my daughter go to check it out. This time it was in the evening when people are home. Upon driving up there are like 50 dogs in the dog park/yard/field running around and dog shit everywhere. Also there is a horse sized pig who is lactating and is squirting breast milk constantly. I ask a person with their dog about the pig and person said ""oh she's a miniature pig pet"". It was huge! So we go see our condo and realized it's much worse than we originally thought. There are events going on in each condo and it's clear the condos are being rented out for like AirBNB or parties. Our was the middle floor. The condo took the open concept to the extreme and there were no walls, just railings breaking up the rooms. Then my husband says we need to get out of this. So I'm on my phone and some how realize we didn't actually sign anything. So we find the office and explain everything and they tell us we can move in and pay for a mortgage or declare bankruptcy. My husband was not talking and just kept saying ""you're in charge of the money, you need to fix it!"" My daughter was crying because she wouldn't get a bedroom and in my dream stared having a panic attack. I woke up at this point it took me a few minutes of laying in because thinking it was all real before realizing I was dreaming.

And it's midnight here so it's officially my birthday now!

Im pulling an all nighter,
I feel this to my core,
Slept a whopping 3 hours last night 🥰,
Guess I’m starting my day at 2:30am,"I work 12 hour nights shifts. 7 days on, then I get 7 days off. I like to adjust my sleep time so that I sleep during the night when I’m off work. I can usually completely reverse my sleep schedule the day I get off work. I get home at 7am and take a nap for 3-4 hours and then I’m able to make it to the end of the day when I’d normally sleep, usually around 9pm. This has worked for me for the last 2.5-3 years I’ve worked nights but the last several months I’ve had trouble falling asleep. I’ll lay in bed for 1 or 2 hours before fully falling asleep. But in those 1-2 hours it’s like my body is teasing me, because I’ll get into a half dreaming state several times and then I’ll be completely awake and just repeat that cycle until finally falling asleep. It’s frustrating because it doesn’t really feel like real sleep when it happens. The weird part is that when I’m working and I get home at 7am I am able to fall asleep with almost no issue, maybe 15 minutes and I’m out like a light. Anyone else sleep better during the day? Anyway, now when I’m going to bed at night I get really bad “sleep anxiety” (what I’ve started calling it) because I know what I’m in for and it just contributes to the difficulty falling asleep. Last week when I was off work I started sleeping on the couch because now I just associate my bed with that sleep anxiety and I actually had an easier time falling asleep on the couch recently. 

Yesterday I got off work for the week and took my morning nap but was pretty tired so I retired around 8pm. I moved all my sleep accoutrement (blanket, alarm clock, fan for noise) to the living room anticipating a good nights sleep. I feel the sleep coming on, but.... oh great I’m in the half-dream/awake cycle again. Queue anxiety. So it’s the same ole’ same ole’, laying there for probably two hours before I get any semblance of actual sleep, but it does come. Then I’m wide awake. “Aight cool I guess I beat my alarm by a little bit” (I wake up at 5am, I hate sleeping late). I check my phone and.... 1:30am. Kill me dead. I use the bathroom, get a drink of water and try to go back to sleep but my body ain’t having none of that. After an hour I give up and just start my day like normal because maybe by 9pm tonight I’ll be good and tired and maybe get some sleep. I guess I’ll move back to my bed tonight, since now the couch will probably give me sleep anxiety. Might as well be comfortable if I’m gonna be miserable. 

Trying not to depend on melatonin to sleep but maybe I’ll have to now. I’ve read that using melatonin will reduce my body’s natural melatonin production but at this point I think it could use some extra help.

Haunted hotel,"Currently staying in a hotel that's renoundly haunted except I didn't know when I booked it. My room seems fine but my TV turned itself on last night at like 3am. My dad's in another room and dreamt that there was a lady in his room - looked at one of the photographs downstairs today and it says it was her.

Supplements that help with sleep,"What are your opinions on taking supplements with melatonin, which apparently can help you fall asleep? I’m seriously considering it bec not being able to sleep is the fucking worst."
It’s 0317 and I can’t sleep and I don’t even know why,"I fell asleep at around 11pm or so but awoke at 1230am and can’t fall back asleep. I don’t even know why? I’m not anxious or anything. And this normally always just happens when I have work the next day too, which consequently results to me being grumpy af the entire day.

Cant sleep bout to play evil within 2,Fuck it.
Oh my fuck,"So…I spent a week and a half in the UK (I’m Australian), and they’re 11 hours behind. I spent 36 hours getting there, so that fucked me up, then jet lag was like “hey there” for most of the time I was there, then I had to come back to Australia, so 34 hours later (thank fuck for a short stop over), I’m back in Melbourne, go for a walk, get a huge kebab in the hopes it’ll put me in a nice food coma, back to my hotel, eat, thankfully pass out not long after, think I missed the jet lag this time. Ohhhh how wrong I was. The next night, it got me good. I was awake 26 hours before I was finally able to nap, and I slept well that night and thought I was cured. WRONG! Last night I didn’t sleep, and it’s now 3am, and it’s going that way again 😭"
"I managed to fall asleep at one point, but I woke up around 3:00",so now I'm stuck in bed feeling like shit but completely unable to sleep

-hate myself for being unemployed, yet scared to be interviewed, need to overcome fear
-hate myself for not being able to drive because the personal convienience of being able to drive would greatly help me in life

-proud of other people for doing things in their life, feel stumped because i hold myself back so much

"Assignment due ""next"" morning, stuck trying to form anything so I cant sleep until I get this done","I'm a Junior in Running Start, and my new History college course continues tomorrow, the first day of the school week. I've finished the individual assignment which was just to take notes while reading some pages in our big ass textbook, but I still have to come up with two questions to initiate a discussion in a group.

I've read about America's ""gilded age,"" ""Social Darwinism,"" and the many ideals regarding labor and socialist ideals for America. But the thing is, I've absorbed all this information and learned about it, but I don't even have an opinion on all this.

The question ""What do you think?"" never resonates with me. I feel like I don't have enough experiences in the world to truly come up with an original idea I could properly communicate to another person. But it applies to other assignments as well, not just everyday conversation. I've passed the online discussion assignments from last quarter's history class only because I read someone else's posts and used one of their opinions for my own post.

So now here I am, writing about it on Reddit rather than trying to struggle for nothing. I'm currently trying to search for ""how to make good discussion questions"" and ""discussion questions for history."" I feel like a rare form of stupid.

Dreams keeping me awake.,Does it count if I'm completely able to fall asleep but really don't want to?

I could take something that would help me sleep but I am a little nervous about it conflicting with the medicine. I think the only way to really get to sleep is to ride this thing out. This is ADHD medicine in case anyone was wondering, so my ability to focus is amazing right now, but I have no idea how to get to sleep. I can't stop thinking about things... just things.. literally anything. I can't stop. I try to think of nothingness but then I start to think about why people have issues with wi-fi and why nobody has really found a ""solution"" to it yet, and after thinking about it for acouple of seconds the simple answer would be that there is simply no solution to this, and that wireless technology can only go so far with the amount of collective knowledge that we have now-adays.

Hoping it just the holidays,"Its about 4:30 ish right now and I cant go back to sleep. My heartburn is kicking real bad and im out of meds for it. Things have been super stressful for me lately.

I'm reviewed the material enough times I'm confident I have a good grasp of everything.

I'm too afraid to go to bed because I know I won't wake up. I even tried going to bed as early as 11 or 12 and still can't fucking fall asleep. just lying in bed feeling my heart racing. So i just say fuck it just gonna pull an all nighter because for some reason not falling asleep is more relaxing than falling asleep. I fucking swear why the hell these professors gotta schedule these 8 am exams I know we med students are ignorant little shits but jesus fuck. 


then again, I don't really have anybody to blame but myself. my circadian rhythm is so fucked from so many nights of cramming and studying with no regards to my own health. nothing like having a major exam every 3 days for 3 weeks to really set me into a spiraling vortex of panic. I kinda now get why med student suicide rates are so high. this is pretty much a rant so don't worry I m not gonna off myself just like this gotta take the fucking exam first lol


edit: fuck oh yeah i forgot about the cup of coffe and 2 cans of monster I drank a few hours ago that might also be why heres to hoping I don't crash when the exam rolls around."
The most perfect girl and my stupidity. Yall wanna talk about stuff after?,"I know that this title is so bland and it wont garner much attention. It is of course my
first post ever but I felt that I need to get this off of my chest and I would like to see
what others may think. Before I even begin, I don't know how to describe the way I
have been feeling of why I do the shit I do. I guess I'll start.
I first met her approximately a year ago. I met her at a camp but me being the crazy
person I was, never tried to interact with much people and instead tried to bring chaos
through any means. I really was something before. Breaking people's trusts and
gathering information to set up shit. It was something I just sort of had going on for me
because I never really felt much. I saw her and I guess had a crush the first time but
brushed it off as just teenage hormones at its work. She was another pretty and smart
girl that eventually I would never see again and would probably never understand me.
Fast forward a couple 6 months later as the new school year began. The last person I
would expect to see at my school would be her. I was kinda still weird and really didn't
want her to see that I liked her so I tried to ignore her as much as I could. I only had
her in one class and she sat not so far away from me, so I believed I would go through
the school year without her talking to me or me ever talking to her again after a year.
Then Student Council came and guess who showed up. The last person I would want
there was there and I had to not show her my vulnerability. I would keep seeing her at
student council and in the hall and would learn she was actually on par with me on
intellect [This sounds very Narcissistic, but others in my school call me the smartest,
which I really don't like, but eventually i learned to accept some stuff :)]. So I decided
to I guess disguise my ""lust"" with a mask of sorts. I would put on a character as I
would do when I would try and get comfortable with people and gain their trust and
shit. I was used to it and once I found out she had a boyfriend already, I was satisfies
and at an unease. I was glad I didn't have to worry about her anymore, but at the
camp I believed she had one already. The quarter passed by and I would become
friends I guess with her. I would one day decide to talk to her and ask her for her
scores on the tests we took before our break. This was definitely the biggest turning
point in my life.
I tried to make the talk seem about just the tests when i just wanted to talk to her, but
me being the ""genius"" I was, I decided to joke about manipulation to imply I play
around with people. It's a small test I use on people. They would either brush it off as a
funny joke and write me off as a crazy jester or think I'm some weirdo. I'm fine with
either, trust me. But then she took it literally as I always try to imply it and opened up
to me and said she used to do the same. I was startled at first, as she was the last
person I would think would go as far as to hurt people through their trust and shit.
Again, I had to do it and took a leap of faith and asked another question. My theory
was that maybe she comprehends things in many lights because she went through
some stuff as I did which ended up pushing ourselves to the point of becoming
""intellectuals"" :). These risks I take are something I love and hate about myself.
[foreshadowing 0.0]. We went back and forth with these questions about things I would
never ask anyone because if I did I am very sure they would call me crazy and its very
different than being thought as crazy. We spoke about life, religion, and well I am glad I decided to talk because we would stay up to 4 am talking all night, every night, for 2
weeks of break. I can't say much about what we talked because I feel that would be
disrespectful, and well this was the beginning of something beautiful. We were way too
similar in many ways I was amazed. It really hasn't been a long time, but I feel that
that was the time I felt real true happiness at its most.
She was all I could think of. Hell I still think about her every day and anytime that I
can. We are way to similar and she was beautiful. I felt very uncomfortable and
superstitious about it as I thought well this might not end well. I didn't tell her that but
we went on to talk about the odds of this. We both believe in the possibility of anything,
and well we knew well enough that the way we both thought so similarly was erie but
somehow, maybe something was happening. Destiny or God's work? It kept getting
better and better as every passing second we would bounce back ideas and I never
wanted to stop talking. We were insomniacs so it sleep was no problem :). I can't tell
you how great I felt... but something was off. As I've said, I grew up different. I never
felt much as I grew up in a bad household and I felt the need to ""dispose"" of emotions
in a way to benefit my studies as I felt it was a survival of the fittest. She grew up in a
bad household too, but she took different approaches to many things and ended up as
a different version of me.... or I ended up as a different version of her lol. Anyways,
those small differences were the things that set her apart and were the things that I
admired and cared about from her. From that point on, I had to make this decision. I
know. You can call it love. I don't want to. I am happy to say it is something more than
that. I wouldn't say I thought of her as a sister, but I wouldn't want to call her a friend.
Anything with some sort of relationship was out of the question, as I felt that any sort
of relationship always ends. I never wanted this to end. I just want to take care of her.
She sort of reminded of a smaller version of me [Narcissist right here :P], and so I felt I
needed to guide her. I have had these hypothetical situations before in my head if I
met myself as an older or younger self. I had assured myself that both would help each
other out back and forth and both would become theoretically the best. I felt that
through time we would both learn from each other and would never stop and grow to
become what we dreamed together. I trusted her at this point more than others and so
I told her about my plan to learn from each other without telling her how I felt about
her. Of course she understood. I still remember the things she said to me. ""I guess we
are stuck together forever now, huh?"". Of course I was a pessimist at the time, so I
would also play devils advocate to try and find the best solutions together once we
headed back to school. I would doubt her at time and make small references that we
would only understand together. We were inseparable in my opinion. We had a small
running joke that we were mentally unstable which would explain why no one would
understand us and why were were so smart. Without giving too much details away, she
would then go on to tell me that she had these sort of conversations before, which only
made me look up to her more. She told me no one had been so similar though, and so I
felt happier every time I found out something similar between us. Unfortunately, I
believe that the way I used to act would now begin to make my life go downhill.
I was a pretty risky dude. I liked to plan things a lot ahead of time. Seeing that I never wanted to see her hurt in any shape or form, I decided to make a plan. I've told her
how I hate the sight of her being hurt, but she never took it too seriously. She knew I
didn't like it, but argued that she hated it when I get hurt when I do something stupid.
Hey, I'm a dude. I like getting reckless doing stuff I regret at times. It's life. So when
she told me she was in love with one of my friends after her breakup, I began to plan. I
didn't hate her for liking someone. I just don't want her hurt anymore from
relationships. The plan was simple and stupid... but spoiler alert, it worked out and
failed. I was to make it my goal to never have another relationship again until after her
studies because I know how they affect your studies. Either I was supposed to take
care of her from there on out or no one. This is where yall come into play. You can call
me the bad guy for doing this, but know I had to think about it as well and decided to
risk it. If it were to come that she would want more relationships, I would have to make
her see that relationships won't help her. Her parents never accepted any relationships
because they were religious, which is why I never really wanted a relationship with her.
I just wanted to take care of her. Maybe I could make it seem like a relationship but
deny it to anyone as we would both know it wont be one. Anyways, I had to go with
one or the other, and so the latter resulted to work because I managed to show her a
relationship isn't worth her time right now subliminally. The thing was, that it came at
the price of her not seeing me as the same person.
I used what I knew from deceiving people and shit into this. I can't tell you how much I
cared about her. I just want to know if she is fine most of the times and how she was
doing. She would teach me a lot of things, and finally helped me understand emotions
more and control them in a way. She is the reason I do most things. She was someone
many look up to and could talk to anyone. She was perfect. To try and make her leave
relationships, I tried to be affectionate. I would give her compliments on many things.
Keep in mind I wasn't forcing myself. these were things I would think about and she
was fine with hearing me out on a lot of things on my mind. She hated compliments
like me but another goal I had was for her to accept them. The one thing I still cant get
over is her smile. Though she calls it lopsided and not the best, I cant tell you how
much it warmed me up every time she would turn to me in class and smile. We decided
to sit next to each other and every time she would smile and I would get right back to
work giving my 1908374129348% effort. These things would come to an end because I
was selfish. I felt she was too good to be true. If I really wanted her to be safe, then I
really cant make her suddenly have a relationship again. These things end one way or
another. And so, with my planning, I succeeded in hopefully making her back off on
relationships but at the same time back away from me.
I feel stupid now. I still am smart to not get so depressed on it. I truly did love every
night coming to my phone to talk to her for hours on end. If it wasn't for what we had
talked about, suicide would have been a viable option, but I knew what may come of
that. I guess I was smart and stupid. After she told me she wanted space after I tried
to figure out how I should tone down my affection towards her, I wasn't the same. I felt
both happy and sad. Happy that she may be better. Sad that I can't talk to her. Happy
that she is beginning to talk to more people. Sad that she may break the promises we made together and maybe also begin another hopeless relationship where she may get
hurt in. Happy that I may not hurt her or do something stupid or drag her down. Sad
because I don't have much motivation to do things and she wouldn't work on things.
Happy because she showed me to always face problems with a smile. The masks we
used to wore aren't just for show. We can still use them and deceive people with good
intention. I was too stupid and bombarded with these feelings to try and hide how I felt
and ended up confused. I would call it that but my friends would call me depressed.
They would joke about it because that was something we all did. We all called it a form
to get attention but that was far from what I wanted. I wanted less trouble for her and
even worse, my life would eventually start falling apart as I would have people getting
very sick, hurt or even dying in my family. Through so much I managed to keep a smile
when I can because I knew that was what she would have wanted.
I swear I can go on and on but it is pretty late for me and I just hope you can all I
guess have fun at this weird story that is my life. It's not much about love. I have told
her that I loved her so many times because I felt that may be what she would like with
us being so similar. I grew up with little people to care about me and so did she. All
these things led to her not talking to me much before and me trying my best today to
smile on for her and let my emotions talk when they can. It is what defines a human
you know. I guess you could say she saved my life from going down a rabbit hole. She
saved me through an addition and she has told me I came when her life was bad. We
helped each other out and had a very wild ride that hopefully I could continue some
things some other day. Right now I still don't know how to feel. all I know is that I still
care about her so much. She has never hurt me or done nothing bad to me. It was my
actions that brought this. She has told me she is at her highest point in her life. I am
proud to say I am at my highest right now and also somewhat at my lowest. I couldn't
have lived the great life I am living without her. My next step... I'm not too sure. I just
want to know how you all look at this. Am I crazy? Am I right? What is life? I cant sleep because I keep thinking about this. this is my
first post and well I would like to know more people around here and see how every
person can be. She taught me that everyone is unique and special. Maybe someone
else can relate somehow and we can sit back and talk about the universe and reality
and whatnot... you know? thanks for listening"

Why is it that after sex I’m wide awake but my husband is already sound asleep?,
I want to be asleel by 2AM,"If I'm not and I find myself crying next to my sleeping boyfriend at 3AM then I'll know how much I've fucked up. I'll know how far back everything has been set back for me. I lived my life putting the blame on no one. Putting the blame on everyone. Eventually it came back to putting the blame on myself. Tuesday I was so frustrated and felt ridiculously pathetic that I want to cut my skin and peel it back to expose it to the hot air of my room. I want to cut my hair short again after painstakingly growing it back out for over two years. I feel unheard and unloved. I feel alone and like no one cares for me but the things that go on around me. 

My mom was on the phone with my boyfriend when he had decided to call her out per my sister in laws request.. He brought up how she let her boyfriend rape me when I was 14 for two months. She doesn't even try to deny it anymore just ""It happened six years ago why's it bothering her now?"" 

I know my mom doesn't love me and that my older brothers tried to find any implication that I wanted him to do what he did. They abandoned me and left me to rot alone somewhere. My dad accused me of telling lies when I wouldn't bend to his stupid rules about learning to be a dutiful daughter who's only worth marriage and giving birth before being tossed aside. It seemed like no one wanted to protect me. Not even the schools. I didn't lock my passions and my self away. I didn't bottle myself up and walk away for my favorite things in life. I died and became a breathing writhing mass constantly trying to reconstruct itself and failing every single time and no one gets it. No one sees it. 

And I'm here at 1:36AM trying to find somewhere else to go. A way to leave and to vanish. I'm not a tool for people to use for sex or money or to make themselves look far better when compared. I am a person. I am hurting and I am alone and I need someone to see me for what I am and what I once was and to tell me it's going to be ok and maybe for someone as bitter and ugly and so so unhappy that the sun is going to come back and I can raise myself from the dead and stop being some caged up freakshow. 

My pain is not a stepping stone. It consumes my light and my makes me swallow my laughter.

"So, I’ve trained myself to fully wake up to my alarm...","When I was in high school I would get up at 5:30am daily to see myself a new outfit for the day (but that’s a long story).

Whenever I hear it i shoot out of bed in a panic that comes with the trauma of having a Latina mother (late for everything lol). 

Now, years later, I have a night time job and am no longer a morning person. 

Fast forward to today, my SO had to get up at 4am for a flight. They asked me to turn on my alarm as well in case they fell asleep. I went to bed at 12:30 and set the alarm for 4am. It is now 6:49am and I am still awake. I have a meeting in 3 hours, rehearsal in 6, and a concert in 14.

People tried to rob us last night and now I can't sleep.,"It was around 4 in the wee hours of the morning and my brother and I heard a motorcycle revving in front of our house. We ignored it but suddenly heard someone trying to open our front door (the footlock makes a clanging noise when the door is pushed and it's still locked). It suddenly got eerily quiet, as if every thing in the house was listening and waiting for something to happen. After what felt like hours, we hear the sound of squeaking metal. Someone was trying to open our gate from the inside but was thwarted by the unoiled latch and the padlock. The motorcycle startes revving again for a few minutes and then it got quiet. 

As the sun rose, we saw a part of our front hedge ruined by someone climbing over our low fence. My brother and I fixed the hedge and left the outside lights of the house open tonight and here I am at 2am (Philippines), wide awake and paranoid of every sound I hear."

I can’t sleep and I know why.,"Three nights ago I had a little party at my house and everyone was having a good time. My friend had invited some of her friends from back home, I wasn’t expecting it but i enjoy meeting new people so I didn’t mind. People start to leave and it just ends up being my friend, her 3 friends from back home my roommates and myself. We’re all having a good time drinking, smoking, talking just enjoying the night. I had started drinking pretty early in the night so by 1 am i was pretty hammered. 

    One of my friend’s friends (let’s call him Ryan) starts talking to me and kind of flirting and I just go along with it. It was bothering me he was nice and I just figure you know what he’s drunk. I flirted with him a little bit too I’m not going to lie. I can’t recall how we all ended up on the topic of sex, but eventually everyone still at my house is sitting outside of my table and we end up talking about sex. Everything is pretty foggy but I remember going into the house after my friend saying “your window of opportunity is closing” so I go into my house and Ryan follows and I guess we go into the house with the intentions of having sex. This was consensual I did go into my house with this guy and think ok I’m about to have sex and I was ok with that, but as soon as he started I began to feel very uncomfortable. I didn’t enjoy anything that was going on and I honestly just wanted it to be over. He was very aggressive and it was very scary. He choked me and I felt like I couldn’t breathe and was trying to hold me down and restrain me. I’m not against rough sex and I’ve done it before but I felt very uncomfortable with the idea that a complete stranger was being so aggressive with me. 
  
    I have also been talking to my ex’s lot recently and couldn’t stop thinking of her the whole time so that just made things even worse. I tried to tell him to stop what he was doing but the words wouldn’t come out of my mouth. It felt like I as stuck. I tried to go along with it hoping it would be over soon but when I realized he was probably gonna be here for awhile I started to panic a little bit. I tried to fake an orgasm so he would stop but that didn’t work and I tried getting up from underneath him but he was way stronger than me. I still hadn’t said anything like stop or no and I don’t know why I didn’t. I knew I was uncomfortable and wanted it to be over with but the words just wouldn’t come out. Luckily my roommates knock on the door trying to be funny and “ruin the mood” but I use that as an excuse to get up. I say to him “I’m over it you can leave now” and he’s shocked. He’s says “you can’t suck my dick until I cum” and I just say no and try to put in this front as if I’m unbothered and act like I already got what I wanted so I don’t care what you want” I go into my closet to put some clothes on and he follow me and tries to turn me around and I say no I’m done leave me alone. I put clothes on as soon as I can and practically run out my front door. 

    As soon as we go outside he’s like talking to his friends telling them he made me cum 3 times and saying I gave him blue balls and stuff. At this point I’m silent my roommates fan tell I’m not ok and I just want them to leave. I say I’m tired and they get the point so Ryan and all his friends leave. As soon as they leave my yard and the gate closes behind them I just start crying.  I start t feel so gross inside like I’m gonna throw up and I just can’t be around anyone. I run into my bathroom and turn the shower on. I’m sobbing but tears don’t come out. I’m just sitting in my bathtub with boiling hot water pouring down on me and I feel like I can’t breathe. I’m grabbing my chest and hugging myself trying to calm down. I can’t stop scratching my neck and arms it feels like he’s still touching me and like someone is going to come from behind me and just pull me toward them. I recognize this feeling. As a child I was abused, so I know what it’s like to feel like something just isn’t right.

   I knew Ryan had triggered something inside me. The aggression was too much. The look in his eye was too familiar, he smelled like someone but I couldn’t remember who. Like cigarettes and cheap wine. Even thinking of it now makes my skin crawl. The water won’t get hot enough. I can see the temperature rising. My shower head has a thermometer in it, so I can literally see the temperature rising. 113 degrees. I take the shampoo off the rack and pout half the bottle in my hands. I start scrubbing and scrubbing and scrubbing but the feeling doesn’t go away. I can feel him between my legs and it’s won’t stop. I start scrubbing my genitals hoping that I can cleans myself if what just happened but the feeling won’t fucking go away. It’s inside me. The filth. It’s manifesting inside my body and I have to get it out. After scrubbing my skin until it was raw and almost bleeding I lay down on my side in the bathtub. I just stare at the side of the bath with a blank expression in my face, wishing I could cry but not being able to force out a single tear. 

   The feeling still won’t go away. I keep thinking about how I can cleanse myself. I have a usual ritual for these kinds of situations. 
Run the bath water without filling up the bath for half an hour 
Run the shower while sitting in the bathtub for another half hour 
Scrub scrub scrub
Shampoo my hair 3 times 
Purge 
Purge again 
Purge again. 
So that’s what I did. 
I lean over the drain and take my finger and put them in my mouth. 
I push them as far back as they go into my throat and just like that I can feel it all come out.
But one time is enough. I have to get rid of it all. So I do it again, and again, and again. 
I layback down with my thighs clenched. The feeling is still inside of me.  

     My roommate is fully aware of the self damage I like to partake in so he has already taken all sharp objects out of my bathroom. But that doesn’t stop me. 
I take the sharpest thing I can find. Which isn’t very sharp at all. And start slashing my upper arm. Keep in mind this thing isn’t very sharp. It’s just a hard piece of plastic I found, so it’s very hard to break the skin, but the feeling of inflicting even the slightest pain into myself give me so much relief. Still I haven’t cried. After laying in my bathtub for around 2 hours thinking what I had done. Thinking of my ex girlfriend who I love so much. I decide to get out of the bath tub. When I get out of the bathroom the girl that had introduced me to Ryan was still in my house. Laying in my roommates bed that we share sometimes because we’re waiting for another to be delivered. One of my roommates asks if I’m ok and I can’t even answer. He hands me a cigarette and I try to ask for a lighter. He touches my should trying to console me and I start crying. Tears finally come out but it’s too much to handle. I give him the cigarette and run back into my bathroom. 

   I sat down in my toilet and out the corner of my eye I see a razor blade my roomates had forgot about. I pick it up and start cutting my upper arms. This time it feels so much better. The blood calms me. It makes me feel something. After cutting a few good times I roll my sleeve down and make another attempt to go into the living room where everyone is. One of my roommates is asleep with the girl on the mattress and my other roomates is still awake. He asks if I want to smoke and I say yes. We went into the porch and sat in silence for a minute before I find the energy to say “I never want to see him again” and he says “you don’t have to” I explain to him that I couldn’t stop thinking of my ex and that he was too rough and then I tell him I’m going to sleep. 

   I stand up and he follows. He gives me and hug and for a second I felt safe. I try to go to sleep in my bedroom in the floor like I have done before many time but I can’t shake the feeling. The lights coming in my the street are too bright and the smell of the air is making me scared. I don’t feel safe at all. Usually I sleep in the same bed as one of my roommates but since that girl decided to fall asleep I had no room. I decide that maybe I’d feel safer in my closet. So I bring my pillow and my blanket and fall asleep in my closet. The next day comes and the feeling is still here. "
Too scared to sleep now,"I was doing so well getting to sleep after finally getting off Lexapro..it's been hard, especially with my anxiety ramping up right at bedtime because I don't know why. Melatonin, NyQuil, and Benadryl (not all at the same time, I alternate them) have been helping, along with reading ebooks til I can't see straight.. I've even been lucky enough to fall asleep before midnight a few times. Great, right?

So, tonight, I'm doing my usual reading, getting kind of sleepy...keep feeling a hair or something tickling the side of my face. It won't stop no matter how many times I try to brush it away. I panic when I realize it's moving, and slap the shit out of whatever it is. I turn my phone light on just to reassure myself that it wasn't a spider or something like that and I just slapped myself for no reason. But no, there's a dead spider right next to my pillow. I'm horrified. 

I'm trying sooooo so hard to convince myself that it's dead now and there's no way that can happen twice in one night, but sleep is nowhere in sight. I even took an extra Benadryl and I guess that little adrenaline rush is just cancelling all that out. 

Fuck spiders, man."
Can't sleep again.,"Recently my life has been falling apart. I've made some plans to uproot and move away with someone I loved. That plan fell through.
So I'm still uprooting my life and moving away, yet I'm not sure how it's all going to work out.
Everything is changing so rapidly and then changing again. I feel lost and alone. Awake and feeling sorry for myself. Leaving the TV on so I'm not alone with my thoughts. 
I know these feelings will pass. It feels nice to type it all out. "
Can’t sleep. Think my cold made it worse.,"For the past year I’ve been having trouble sleeping because of my anxiety, fortunately I was able to keep a stable sleeping pattern for the last 6 months. Here’s the problem, I’ve recently gotten really sick - fever, headache etc-, and have barely gotten any sleep. When night comes and I have to sleep, I end up just laying there for god knows how long. Is this common? What should I do?? Please advise.

Laying here trying to sleep and all I can think of is the plot to Requiem for a Dream...,"The fuck, brain?"
4th Freaking Night,Life is going super well! I am tiring out my body and mind and following a bedtime ritual. I'm happy and my anxiety is down. But its the FOURTH NIGHT IN A ROW that I cannot sleep.
4:16 on a Tuesday Morning,"I check my watch. 4:16. It has only been a few minutes since last I checked it. I sit in the chair nervously tapping my foot. Sweat has begun to drip down the side of my head. I worry for her. When I brought her here, the people at the front desk looked at her like she was already gone. Looked at me with sympathetic eyes. Like they knew it was all over for me. I check my watch again. 4:17. The doctor was supposed to come back at 3:30 with the results. That's what he told me. I look down at my hands. They are covered in blood. In her blood. She bled right through that rag I put over the wound to stop the bleeding. My foot starts tapping even more now. I am becoming more scared and impatient than I have ever been before. Is she alright? Did I rush her to the hospital fast enough? Are these doctors even able to save her life? Another thought passes over me. Our health insurance. It was cancelled several days ago. They won't be able to pay for any of this. We don't have any money to cover it either. I stop myself from thinking about this. How can my thoughts be about this right now? She is in intensive care, only a few hallways away. She is more important than money. Besides, we'll find a way to fix this money issue. We've overcome everything before. At this, I'm reminded about all the times we've shared together. All the memories we made. When we went out to our first date at that dusty arcade. When we spent a whole night lying in her backyard, looking up at the stars. When I took her out to see a movie, and was nervous the whole time, until she grabbed me by the tie, pulled me close to her, and kissed me. So many memories with this girl. It's been 4 years since we made those particular memories. Our first memories together. I can't seem to recall much else in those four years though. Maybe it's because of how stressed and tired I am. I look back at my watch. 4:17. It hasn't even been a minute, yet it feels like an eternity of sitting in this chair. Finally a man approaches me in the waiting room. ""Doctor?"" I ask. He glares at me. Looks at me like I am a monster. ""Doctor? What is happening in there? What is going on with Synthia?"" The doctor continues to glare, but looks almost baffled at me. ""Synthia Marks, your girlfriend, was pronounced dead 5 minutes ago. I thought you might want to know that."" My heart stops. I can barely breathe. He said it so bluntly. How could he say that so bluntly? The love of my life just died. He begins to walk away from where I am sitting. I manage enough breath to ask him how she died. As he is turning the corner, he pauses. He turns to me and looks at me in disbelief. Then he gives a sigh of resentment. ""Fucking junkie."" He walks away. I close my eyes. And it becomes clear to me again. I murdered my girlfriend. I stabbed her 8 times because she wouldn't give me the rent money to buy more dope. I started shooting it into my veins four years ago. A month after we started dating. I open my eyes again. I'm not in a waiting room. I'm in a police Precinct. I am handcuffed to a chair. It has been mere hours since the police came to the hospital to arrest me. I am a murderer. I am an addict. I will be sent to the chair, or stabbed in prison for what I have done. My shitty life is over. And as I think about loosing my love, and my life in a single day, one thought appears in my head: I could really use a fix right now."
I got school today and I can't sleep ;(,"Woops, I ended up sleeping around after 5 so I overslept 🙃"
I can't sleep,"I really want to sleep. Tommorow is my first day back to school (8th if that matters idk maybe it will) and I have to get up at 6:00 am and it's already 2 am and I tried breathing exercises, relaxing noises, music, sleep pills, and nothing has worked. (I've tried all these things through the course of school last year as well) I have no idea what to do anymore. This insomnia needs to end. Insom runs in my family, so I think that's why I can't sleep and I can't really find anything to sooth or help it in anyway. My parents are gonna kill me for being up this late even though they know I have trouble sleeping... I just don't know what to do.

Tomorrow, we’ll later today since it’s after 2am, I’m supposed to be at work at 10am to cover a shift and I’m still awake.

Ive got things to do god damnit.,"I cannot sleep reasonably lately. I used to go to bed around 10 and get up for work at 6. Perfect for me. But i quit my job to focus on school about 6 months ago and since then my sleep schedule has been fucked. Its even worse now. It will be 2 in the morning and im not tired at all no matter how bad i want to sleep. Il sleep from 3am until noon or 1 every day lately, which might not seem that bad but its very unlike me. Most of the time i avoid looking at reddit or my phone or tv in general while trying to sleep but i just couldn't resist tonight. I'm just filled with anxiety and dread about anything and everything lately, or for the past twelve years to be more specific, i just need to voice it even if nobody will respond.

The canons in the lake beware of the tale that stems from it.,"## The canons in the lake #cantsleep

This story stems from a vivid nightmare, I had a couple weeks ago. My cousin told me that I should re-tell my nightmarish dream to the #cantsleep for other people to read. This was by far the weirdest most real dream I think i've ever dreamt. It felt so real to the point that I was confusing my dream with reality. In my sleep I couldn't tell if it was something I was dreaming, a fragment of my imagination or a story I was living. A alternate realty I was sucked into only for the brief duration of my dream. Perhaps a distant memory from a past life, far reach but the universe works mysteriously in many ways or maybe I only dreamt it to provide enjoyment and curiosity to the readers who fall upon on this post. Now I think I've babbled on to much the rest of this post is up to your discretion, can you handle this dream or will you fall victim to imagining it next.

Crystal blue water thats overlooked by a temple on a hill in a small abandoned town. Not many individuals reside in this town as many fear the wrath of the water. Knowing the tale many stay away from the small quaint town, the ones who reside are locals whose families have lived their for generations. Knowing the story they know not to fear but abide the laws set through the tale. If the tale is true or just folklore made up to scare away visitors has never been proven. However, the mysteries left behind those who have broken the rules from the tale are proof enough to others to not to do the same.The tale goes that this beautiful water hides a dark secret.

The tale goes that centuries ago a young peasant female was in hiding from the villagers at the time. As all had the misconception she was a witch at the time witch trials were in action and a very real thing. No one could survive the wrath of the town council nor their suspicions. The fair young lady may have been innocent but an incident where she saved a young child from a major sickness at the time through herbs and prayer led others to believe she was a witch. As how could a illiterate young women know how to save a child. She was not a doctor and had no medical knowledge that known in that time. In suspicions of her identity the villagers set on rampage to hang this women and set ablaze to her body. As that was the only way she could be purified from the devil. In hopes of sympathy from the villagers she ran to the temple overlooking the crystal blue water and begged for forgiveness. Gaining no sympathy she angrily made a vow, that anyone who dares enter the water will not escape her wrath. To stop her from jumping two canons were fired, the first as a tester and the second to warn her. On the third canon she jumped to her death and a final fourth canon was fired on accident, dying instantly from the impact of the water and sinking. Her remains were said to never be found.The time she died 5:30pm. The folklore from this incident was that anyone who dared to go into the water or drink from it or even go near it would hear four canons, the first canon to warn you, the second canon to let you know she's coming, the third canon to let you know you're doomed and the fourth to guiding you to your doom. Those who have mysteriously died are said to have their souls taken and become creatures of the night. These creatures are possessed shape shifters who taken on different appearances to misguided the ones whom are doomed. The canons are heard by the ones who are doomed at 5:30pm everyday until their last. There is no cure for the lake, locals have accepted their fate and guard the lake in fear.

Not aware of the tale of the lake, a group of young teens visit the town where the lake resides. In hopes of a fun getaway weekend these teens arrive ready to party and make the most of their trip. Renting a old cabin near the lake because of the good offer. Little did they know what awaited in the near future. Three of the eight teens are acquainted with the tale and vow to stay away from the beautiful lake near their cabin. While five disregard all warnings and call bull on the tale. In retaliation they go in the lake and have fun not caring and drinking. Once proving the other three wrong they leave and call the the three losers and scaredy cats who fear a old folklore. They assumed the tale was only made to keep teens like them out of the clean crystal blue water. Until 5:30pm like the tale warned the five heard four canons in the background while drinking back in the cabin. Now fearing the tale the five make the decision to cut their vacation short and set out to take the next bus out of town at 10:30pm. When leaving the cabin the five witness the towns people in odd daunting costumes, walking in odd formations and behaving out of norm. Almost possessed like in a zombie like trance. Four of the five are taken aback and set off running saying they can't wait and run off leaving behind one of the five. The one left behind takes off in a different route when one of the innocent three follows suit from the cabin freaked out trying to go home.

In some miracle way the 6 aboard the bus when on the bus home they admit their wrong doings of venturing out into the lake. Its dark outside and the bus is heading on a ominous road, pitch black out nothing can be made out besides from the very dim light in the bus. Water pools start appearing on the road and bus abruptly stops, Little did the teens that a shapeshifter was on aboard. The doors of the bus open and the shapeshifter approaches the group of 6. With cold red eyes it turns into the human eating monster with a mouth of a hundred sharp teeth and a tongue of a snake.

The 6 run out of the bus into the woods where the rest of shape shifters wait. One by one each is cost and appear back in the lake where there doom awaits. The original women appears with eyes black and pitiless as a soulless being and the same appearance as the other shape shifters only bigger and stronger. Saying they denied her warning and ruined her rest she takes her Sharp teeth and bites the head off one of the 6. As the rest shape shifters tear apart and rip apart the other 5. With one vowing they never visited the lake. With one look at each other they attempt to run while then others limbs are ripped off. Running back to the cabin the innocent once warns the rest of their fate where they attempt to flee and hide to no avail shapeshifter and possessed locals surround their cabin breaking it apart piece by piece. One goes into the underground cellar where their are black magic protection spells written on the walls among other things and a skeleton is hung in a circle surround by voodoo things. The lady appears when the one approaches the circle telling her she cannot approach her remains. The one thinks of something in a rash decision prays to the lord and takes a lighter burning the bones. The ghosts screams and fades way.

It's now morning the ones comes back up and all their friends are gone, the house is torn apart and the friends lay surrounded in corpse bodies and remains all around leading back to the lake. When attempted to run away while crying about the loss of their once friends. The police show up and investigate where they rule it to be a cannibal case and the one with their crazy story is put into a insane asylum. The non locals leave and its a year later the cabin mysteriously restored. You are led to see the way to the underground cellar where the Bones are restored and a family approaches the cabin with shots of a cannon in the background."
Idk why I'm awake but I can't go back to sleep,"I've always had this problem where, once I'm up, I'm up. There is no rolling over & going back to sleep unless the thing that woke me up was external & insignificant (boyfriend talking online, phone ringing, etc.) 

But things like screaming in the night (I live next to a bar), doors opening, or something falling in the room will wake me up. It's like my brain processing the noise fully wakes me up. And then, if I want to go back to sleep it's going to take at least an hour. Which is super frustrating those days when something wakes me up at 5 AM & I have school or work at 8, & was scheduled to wake up at 6. Not getting that hour (especially during the school semester) makes me want to tear my hair out. 

I have no clue why I'm awake right now. It's 4:40, something woke me up at 3:50, & I wanted to be awake at 7. I have a lot of things I wanted to do, well, today so I think that stress caused me to feel wide awake as soon as something brought me out of sleep. It could have been my mom walking around in the house or my cat jumping on the nightstand but these things usually don't wake me up. 

I could also be nervous because I'm having a double date with my bestie & her boyfriend of 3 years tomorrow at an early-ish time. I've never met him since they were long distance & then she moved to be with him. I've had very little interaction with this guy & only know what she's told me - which is no way to judge or get to know a person. I don't even know if he likes tea! And this was my idea! Ugh.

I don't know if I should just go about my morning as if I woke up at a normal time & go back to sleep when I'm sleepy, but I feel like I won't wake up in time to get ready if I do that. If I just continue to lay in bed until I fall asleep I won't be asleep now until 6, & then I likely won't be up until 9, which sucks. I'm an early bird for people my age. I naturally wake up around 7:15-8. 9 is sleeping in. Which I DON'T want to do on a day I planned to game, do Pilates, practice a dance routine for an upcoming show, go on a date, hang out with my friend, update my bujo, work on some project planning stuff for my dev team, & bathe my cat that has fleas :'( 

When I'm up at these times I feel like a car running on the end of it's fuel. I can go for a couple hours but then I'm gonna run out of energy & probably crash. Dear scientists: please make a pill that will instantly make me fall asleep without knocking me out for 5+ hours or make me feel like hell. Thanks. "
The things that go through my mind at night...,
My strange story how I got here,"I was at a party at a friends house not far from mine. I went home on my bicycle, parked it in the backyard and tried to unlock the back door. My key did not work so I walked to my front door but the door would not open because it has locks that keep the door from opening despite having a key. Then I rang the bell three times. No one answered. I even called through the newspaper hole. If someone woke up they probably thought I was a burglar as no one rings at 4 in the morning. I then went back to try the back door again. I must be crazy I used this key this afternoon. Again it did not work. I then came to the idea of going back to my friend. He cannot have fallen asleep yet. I cycled back and rang a couple of times and just when I started to give up on waiting he was there. We then sat downstairs. Charged my phone as it was empty and tried calling my two brothers (fun fact we are triplets) and parents’ phones. No one answered. I then went to sleep on my friends couch where I am laying as of right now. Suddenly I hear my phone vibrate. It was my oldest brother. He asked where I was and I said at my friend and that I am going to sleep. And that is now 20 minutes ago. Now I am on my phone after trying to sleep, typing this while listening to music. Goodnight."
I can relate,
Fall asleep to the calming aesthetics of the 1990s,
I am ungrateful,"I don’t feel like I can talk to anyone. My boyfriend is my best friend but he is very stressed with school and fixing his house. So I don’t want to contribute. And my best friend has worse problems than me. I wish I could talk to her but she’s always exhausted with her life so that I feel like I shouldn’t complain about mine. She is barely able to keep up financially [she is a recent college graduate] and her new apartment is in horrible condition with mold and a kicked in door. And she had to pay two rents this month because of the lease. Her parents can’t support her financially. I try to give her suggestions like eating out less and not spending money on things she doesn’t need. To save her money. She says she doesn’t have any money to save. But I know she had random subscriptions. For example: I suggested to only pick Netflix or Hulu but she insists she needs both. I know that hat $12 or so a month saved can add up. Or even not buying that super cute coffee maker wouldn’t make a difference. I wish I could just yell at her and say she is causing herself to be financially unstable but her “friends “ that went to college with her already did. And they seem to not be good friends either. They like to leave her out of group gatherings and they always take her for granted. I’ve told her to find new friends but she insists to be friends with them. These are just a handful of what she has to deal with so when I try to talk to her when I don’t feel well. She usually just says she’s gets what I’m feeling. Which I’m sure she does but we don’t actually talk about anything. I really try my best to help her as we are long distance friends. We both live in two different states. But I feel like a broken record. Trying to help her save money but she just makes excuses for all my suggestions. 

I feel so ungrateful [i tried to tell her about this but she was exhausted from work so I didnt press it]. So my family and I are on a vacation in Europe. We did a cruise and are also stayin in Italy. Don’t get me wrong I know I am so blessed to be able to travel. But I wish to not be here. I don’t know why I would like to buy a plane ticket home to my bed and sleep forever. I miss my dog. It’s not even my dog it’s my boyfriends dog [weve been together about 6-7 years so his dog and I have gotten close, me and the dog often have sleep overs with our my boyfriend] when I feel like this I usually talk to her [the dog] about it and it makes me feel 99x better. But since i am away I can’t talk to her so this is what I have. It’s not like I can’t talk to my boyfriend about anything because I know I can and vice versa. I just can’t bring myself to do it. I don’t even know what is wrong with me. I am on vacation and I have cried myself to sleep 3 nights. I think it’s because I miss my boyfriend or his dog. But I really don’t know. I’ve been kind of talking to my boyfriend but I don’t feel much better. [hes also very tired for some reason and keeps taking many naps through out the day and is a horrible texter] I really wish dogs could text. I just don’t want to get out of bed ever again. My mom wants to go on a tour but I am dreading it because as I said I don’t want to get out of bed. I feel so ungrateful. This is a first world middle class problem. It’s not even a real problem. I basically just want to go home and cuddle next to (my) dog. 

I don’t even know if anyone can follow what I wrote but if you made it this far, thank you for listening to me I really appreciate it. "
Pissed off,Im so pissed I cant sleep its already 4:44 am & i was planning on going to the skatepark at like 10 so im gonna be way too tired for that. This sucks ass
The state of Colorado their beliefs and their people.,"As I have spent time in colorful Colorado I have found that this state is full of spoiled brats who should have gotten their butt's beaten more and for the right reasons, but they practice physical, mental and emotional abuse here like you wouldn't believe or imagine and everyone wants to fit in but what are they really going to lose? The head of the Jefferson county mental health department is just as twisted and the children she raised aren't much better. This state is so big on property and values it's so experiensive to live here by yourself and I swear they push women to look for men who will take care of them and their children. The men pamper the wrong woman who are abusive to them so they in turn are abusive to their spouses. Single women go after married men, I know that is normal but it's like groups of people who live here are all the same and they use grease for a pan or such as massage oil, the convict's and crimals are the enforcers well ex convict's. The foster parents do drugs allow their foster children to be around petifiles, and will even get the children to react so they can put them away to get money from the state. I know this all sounds weird but who can you trust"
Spider!! Spider in my roooom!!!!! I’m in London. Not Aus!!. Why is such a big ol hairy pider in my room? I felt something furry on my arm. I shook it off. Turned on the light and saw it on the carpet. I saw a red teeny one yesterday that I squashed. What if there’s a nest in my bedroom?? Can’t sleep,
How do you brute force yourself to sleep.,"I'm serious, any ideas. I've seen things where you hyperventilate until you pass out but I don't want to lose too many brain cells. I've tried running into walls and the whole shit show. Please help, I'm so frustrated and desperate. I don't need people telling me shit like 'drink tea' or 'listen to this'. My fucking brain has all of the energy in the world when my body doesn't. I can't do this much longer."
I don’t know anymore,"Though the past couple of weeks have been my happiest, I’m getting more and more depressed each day rapidly. The world is changing around me and I can’t take it anymore. I just want to end it, but I can’t. It would kill my mom, my friends.. I wish someone would crash their car into while driving, anything to take this pain away without leaving pain and quilt. I know I’m getting bad again, I just want it all to end. It’s 2:13am and already dreading when I’ll have to leave my bed in a couple hours."

The Best Noise Machine - For the Best Sleep You Will Ever Have,
Thoughts of death keep me awake,Every night for several weeks now I tend to have a crisis about death and what it feels like to die. It's like as soon as I'm left alone to my thoughts it's all I can think about and it genuinely freaks me out. I've tried using a sound generator to play the sound of rain or music to try and concentrate but it blocks out the stories I also tell in my head to try and get rid of them. Right now it's not 1am but I wanted to go to sleep earlier as I'm getting up earlier. The heat is bad as well which isn't helping. Hopefully the rest of you will be able to get to sleep soon 
I’m having trouble sleeping these past few days. I think my brain is just completely fucked that it can’t shut itself up. It’s too noisy inside my head! Aaarrggh!!,"There I said it, my brain is too active it doesn’t let my body rest.. So I tried to be productive. I got up.. continue my pending workload so tomorrow I’ll have lesser work to do.. but whenever I sit and face my computer to supposedly finish or at least continue working on some projects, I end up getting back to bed because I feel so fucking tired when all I did before getting up is just lying on the friggin’ bed.

What now? "
Did anyone else find this sub because it's late at night and they can't sleep?,"I found a house centipede on my arm right before I was about to go to bed, and it scurried away until a couple pillows so I'm in a different room on a couch now.  Anyone else who cant sleep in the same boat as me?


EDIT: oh boy, top post all time on this sub.  I hope you guys all get to at least get a few hours of sleep :)

Good luck!"
8:00,How come I can never fall asleep when I have something important to do? I don't know if it's just me but I'd say once a week I have a night where I can't fall asleep until 7 or 8 am. But during the school year I would have to wake up at 5:45. So I wouldn't be able to fall asleep to about 3 or 4. Typically it's when something important is happening the next day. Like during the school year it would be a big test or a performance for theatre. But now its going to a freinds house tomorrow. And when I can't fall asleep I always feel super tired. But my eyes won't close. My mind feels tired but my body dosent... Do I have minor insomnia? Or is it just my slight anxiety?
It's 11:24pm and some asshole bird won't shut up,"This douchebag of a bird is always chirping at this time every fucking night, little fucker makes all kinds of noises. I know it's the same one because of the noises it makes. Even with my windows closed I can hear it."
"I was working outside with a headlamp on at night, and the cutest baby bunny ever...","Jumped right out of a pallet in front of my foot while I was carrying a large potted plant, and I felt it crunch under my foot and it literally screamed...

I was horrified. I can’t sleep."
Have a fear of death at night,"For a long time now I've had trouble sleeping because I wake up to go to the toilet and then can't help but thinking about how I could die. It's like my brain just changes at night, because in the morning I feel normal again. I have spent hours lying awake in bed thinking that the roof might suddenly cave in, or someone could come into the house and stab me in my sleep even though I know all the doors are locked.

I can't deal with this and I hate myself more and more. I always try to sleep with a YouTube video playing because I don't want to be left with my thoughts. I just beat myself up for being so shitty.

10.26 hours,It’s been a long weekend. I have only slept for almost ten and a half hours over the corse of the weekend and I’m beginning to hear things in my room. Things I know aren’t real but things none the less. I began drawing these things but all the drawings are just jumbled up messes of lines that remotely look like figures. The idea of what it was I saw keeps changing in my head and I draw different features from what I had begun to draw before. There is only the clock ticking away that I can hear. I don’t usually use my phone at night and instead I just stare at the ceiling and wait. Has anyone experienced anything like this?
Week of Insomnia,"It's been about a week now, it's 542AM Pst. I haven't been about to sleep during the night. Usually just slipping into exhausted naps for a few hours during the day. I wake up pretty tired cause I never slip into deep enough sleep during those. I know this is probably cause I've lost my routine and now my rhythm is out of wack. At this point, I'm feeling really ill. I can't do anything during the day from the exhaustion.

Considering staying up the whole day to reset. I don't want to rely on sleeping meds, they don't work on me anyway. 

Any good tips on how to stop napping during the day so I can sleep the night? 

Thank you in any case."
Can't sleep because of earache,It's been like 4 nights in a row of the worst sleep. Probably the most painful week of sleep I've ever had.

Cant sleep and I have work in 4 hours.,Cant sleep. I took a five hour nap earlier in the day after work and haven't been able to sleep since. Been tossing and turning almost dozed off.

Anybody awake?,Just looking for someone to talk to.
Can't stop thinking about her,"I woke up at around 5 am after only about 4 hours of restless sleep. Don't know what woke me up, but I can't get back to sleep because I can't stop thinking about her. (We'll call her C) It all started about 7 years ago when I was a sophomore in high school. I had just started dating C's cousin (we'll call her A). A is a year older than me, C is 2 1/2 years younger. When A first introduced us, C hated my guts, mostly because I was dating her cousin.  Towards the end of my junior year, A and I broke up. After she graduated we basically never spoke again. Those last few months were hell though as we had several classes together and mutual friends. 

So my senior year, which was C's freshman year, we started to become very close friends. I started to develop feelings for her, but I just pushed them down because I thought it would be weird considering I had been dating her cousin less than a year ago. So I graduated and went off to college. Nearly as far away as I could be without leaving the country, went from Alaska to Pennsylvania. It didn't go well but that's a story for another day. Honestly my life is a mess.  For the year I was there I talked to her on a daily basis. And my feelings for her only grew stronger, even as I was seeing a couple other girls. 

At the end of my second semester I dropped out and went back home.  I had arranged to take her to see one of her favorite bands live at that years state fair. I was hoping that by then she would be my girlfriend. We had made other tentative plans for the summer, but we both ended up being too busy and could just never find the time. 

So the state fair comes around, we go, and talk a little bit about the possibility of us dating. She basically says that she doesn't want to date anybody at the time. (I know, that was a load of crap but i fell for it at the time.) A couple weeks later I said something dumb, can't remember what, and we didn't talk for a while. And during that time, I found out that she had started dating someone soon after we went to the fair. Obviously I was pretty hurt, and didn't talk to her for even longer. 

At the time I had no idea what I was gonna do with my life. I eventually decided to enlist in the Air Force, and went off to basic that spring, march of 2015. That in itself was one of the better decisions I have made in my life up to now. The mistake was the afsc I chose. But I'll get to that in a minute. So after I finished basic training and went off to tech school, we got access to our phones again so I reached out to C. We talked for a while and it was going well. But it didn't last. She is asexual. I am an idiot. I said something ignorant about her sexuality (to this day I still don't know what) that pissed her off and she just stopped talking to me. I didn't find out why until much later. 

So back to my poor choice of afsc. I enlisted as spec ops, which it turned out I wasn't cut out for. I washed out pretty early on, and got an entry level separation (not a honorable or dishonorable discharge). At the time I didn't fell up to facing my father who is ex army, and had wanted me out of the house, so I moved in with my grandparents who live in Utah. This was July of 2015. I didn't talk to C for about 6 months, but thought about her nearly every day. I missed her so much and was miserable the entire time. 

That Christmas I went home to visit my parents. The entire time the only thing I could think about was her and the fact that she was just a few miles away and how nice it would be to see her. However I had no idea how to approach her. 

Christmas morning came around and I decided to just text her and say merry Christmas. So we started talking, but by the time we had worked things out, it was time for me to go back to Utah, so we didn't get to see each other. From then on we were constantly talking, and my feelings came back full strength (they were only shallowly buried to begin with) and proceeded to get even stronger. 

This girl is amazing and perfect for me in every way. She is smart and has nearly an identical sense of humor to mine, she's absolutely gorgeous, and she is so caring for everyone, even people she barely knows. I could go on for days about all the reasons I love her, but that's not what I'm here for. 

So that summer I was hoping to see her again when I went to visit my parents for about a week. The chance to see her actually was a bigger part of my decision to go to Alaska than visiting my parents. But after I had already bought my plane ticket and it was too late to change my plans, we were talking and realized that she was going to Maine to visit family a couple days before I got to Alaska, and getting home the same day I was leaving. So that was another missed opportunity. 

At the time she was dating another guy, so I was still suppressing my feelings for her. It wasn't until that next spring, 2017, when I went on a couple dates with another girl that I realized I was hopelessly in love with C. Around that same time, my dad called me and offered me a job working for him in Alaska over the summer. Also at the same time, C broke up with her boyfriend.  A plan started to form in my head. 

So I talked to my dad and said, yeah, I'll come work for you this summer. I arranged it so that C would be the one to pick me up at the airport (my mother was understandably upset as she had no idea what was going on). In the mean time I was getting pretty flirty with C and she seemed receptive. I planned on asking her out when she came to pick me up at the airport. 

And then everything went wrong. She had a friend ( we'll call him W) who was also romantically interested in her. He had the advantage of being in Alaska, and by the time I figured out what was going on it was too late and it looked like they were gonna date for sure. And then he made some super sexist comments that totally pissed her off. 


So I thought I still had a chance. But before I got to Alaska, a guy from one of her classes in college, asked her out. And she said yes. This was mere weeks before I was gonna be there. So I think to myself( and everybody tells me) this is my last chance, tell her how I feel before things get serious with this new guy. So I talk to her. Tell her that I'm in love with her.  And she tells me that I'm too late because she has a bf now. 

Then I finally get to Alaska. She picks me up at the airport. I get to see her for the first time in nearly 3 years. It's the happiest I've been in nearly 3 years. This entire time, and to this day, I've been fighting with depression because no matter what I do I just can't seem to get anything right in my life. But whenever I'm with her, it all just goes away, and I lose myself in the moment. 

Over the summer we only see each other a few times, not nearly as often as I would have like, because we were both busy with work. But every time I do see her it is amazing and leaves me in a great mood and constantly grinning like the fool I am for about a week. 

About a week before I leave to come back to Utah, I spend one last day with her. We're out hiking, talking and having a good time. And then she says something. ""Stop making me want to move to Utah."" I'm speechless for a moment. And then I ask her about it. And then for the first time ever she admits that she has feelings for me and has seriously been thinking about us a lot recently. It also comes out that she has considered dating me that spring before W came along.  It was then that I realized that if I had just listened to the advice my friend gave me when I first realized how in love with her I was, and just talked to her, we would probably have been dating. (Don't worry, I've already beaten myself up over this plenty. No need to join in.) 

That day we talk a lot about us. She all but promises that if she breaks up with her bf, which she kinda thought was gonna happen pretty soon due to her being asexual and him not being ok with it. It almost seemed like she wanted me to ask her to break up with him, but being who I am, I could never do that to anyone, least of all her. I both wish I had, and am glad I didn't. 

And then I came back to Utah. I almost didn't. A couple months later, I'm scrolling through my news feed on Facebook, and I've been noticing for a few days that She has mentioned or had any interactions with her bf. So I go snooping on her profile, and see that she broke up with her bf and didn't tell me. Naturally my hopes skyrocketed. I don't say anything to her right away, assuming she didn't tell me because she didn't want me asking her out right after they broke up. 

That is when I notice that W (remember W?) is back in Alaska again (he's in the navy so he comes and goes) and he's getting rather flirty with C again. And she is getting kinda distant with me. The exact same shit that happened last spring. So I ask her about it. And this was her reply: ""Things with (bf) didn't really work out and I realized that I've really always had feelings for W. Like even when I wasn't very happy with him I still loved him. We actually started dating 😂 like recently. Yes I was thinking about us, but I honestly shouldn't have said that and I'm so sorry for the inconvenience done to you. And W has nothing to do with why I distance myself from people.""

I got this text 2 hours into a 12 hour shift at work. It broke my heart. But I just bottled it all up and basically shut down for the rest of my shift. When I got home I laid in bed and cried for a couple hours before I finally fell asleep from pure exhaustion. This was the end of sep, 2017. 

For the next couple months I considered it a good day if I made it through without crying. My good days were very few and far between. I would get up, go to work, come home and cry until I fell asleep. My two cats are the only thing that kept me from wrapping my car around a lamppost at 100+ mph. 

I couldn't bring myself to talk to her again until about a month ago when I was finally starting to get back on my feet. Well maybe not my feet but at least up to my knees, rather than face flat on the ground. But talking to her only brought all my emotions back to the surface and sent me back into the depths of my depression. So I am once again not talking to her, even though it's killing me. She is the only thing I want in life, and I will never be able to be with her. 



Tl;dr: I am hopelessly in love with a girl and have been for years who I can't have, even though she has said she had feelings for me before, because she is in love with someone else and is with him. 

I'm at my wits end and only hanging on by a thread. As far as I can see there is no way out of the situation. I can't be with her, but I can't cut ties with her entirely because she means too much to me, both as the woman I love and as my closest friend. "
Work nights / sleeping method,"Work nights are pretty much the only nights I can’t get hardly any sleep which sucks cause I work factory and I work 10hrs a day, depending on how slammed with work we are it’s 12hrs. I have taken pills and or liquid (z quill for example) for a sleeping method. I’ve also tried to sleep without any lights on and tv turned off. Lol I’ve grown up my whole life falling asleep with tv and or lights on. It sucks. Changing from 17 years of that to now trying to sleep with everything off is actually one of the hardest things to do but I’m trying. Sometimes I’m ignorant and don’t listen to myself. Anyone else have trouble sleeping on work nights like I do? Do you have to take pills and or a liquid to put you to sleep as I do? And do you need something on to help put you to sleep? "
"Can't sleep... Obviously.(Warning, probably incoherent)","I have this problem every once in a while where I think too much. Particularly about death. I think a lot when I try to sleep. My mind races and processes and plans and....KEEPS ME AWAKE. Seriously sometimes I just want everything to be quiet. Like, I can't just think about one GodDamn thing, it's gotta be every encounter with someone, every reddit post I've read and every song I've listened to for the past week all at once, like going to a best buy, playing a different video on every single TV and turning the volume to max. I used to be able to over come it. The best way for a while was to pick a song that had a lot of background noise and try to concentrate on all the different things I hear in the background. Nine Inch Nails Closer was my miracle song. It used to put me to sleep in 10 min or so.
But now it doesn't work and here I am at my desk wondering what the moon smells like with Lady Gaga's Show me your teeth stuck in my head because I heard it on the radio of a car that stopped at the same red light as me 4 days ago. And thinking about deathSHIT how did I get so far off topic?!
I laid down a couple of hours ago and started thinking and somehow I wandered onto the thought of dying in my sleep. Am I going to wake up? What if I don't wake up? What if I die? What if I never get to say goodbye to me wife? What if she kills herself? And I think oh it wont matter I'll be dead and wont feel anyhting.
AAAAAAAnd then it hits me. The nothing. Trying to imagine dying is a lot lot getting hit so hard you black out. Black. Nothing. Not even nothing. Like, non existence. How can I be me one second and not me the next? Is my soul going to live on? Are all those crazy religious people in the right? Maybe it depends on how you're disposed of... Maybe my body has to be burned to release me so I can move on and start my next life. Or maybe I have to be buried so that when it's time I'll come back with everyone else. What if I get stuck because I choose the wrong one SHIT WHICH ONE FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUUUUUUCK! And then again maybe I'll just slip away into the abyss that is nothing, forever gone, after a lifetime that doesn't even equate to a moment on the great cosmic timeline. I am completely and totally insignificant as far as the universe is concerned. I guess we all are. How did our species get so conceited? We're God's chosen people, or we're enlightened, or we are most liked by the Flying Spaghetti monster. We're not special. In the grand scheme of things we basically just figured out how to wipe our own asses as self aware beings. Fuck we thought we were the center of the universe for a long LONG time.
So that's it then. Nothing.

tl;dr: Can't sleep. I thought too much and had severe panic attack about death.

"As usual, I’m wide awake!","This is my first time posting to this subreddit as I am still fairly new to the site. I most spend my evenings readings from r/LetsNotMeet or r/creepyencounters. However, I thought I’d look for subreddits where people who are like me, and me like them, cannot sleep no matter how much we want too. 

In all fairness, tonight it is because I stayed up to finished a series I had been binge watched called “sneaky pete” on Amazon Prime. If you haven’t watched it, I suggest you do. I’ve just binge watched 9 - 1 hope episodes in less than 24 hours. 

Anyway, right now, I’m wide awake and find myself scrolling through the subreddits of reddit or tumblr. I suppose what I want to ask is; does anyone know any good subreddits to scroll through when they can’t sleep?

5:25am can't sleep,"Okay I know that I fucked up earlier by taking that long to ass nap on the floor with my two puppers, but it was so well deserved. I've had 5 vials of blood drawn and one hell of a trip to the dentist that left my mouth throbbing for hours so a nap was well deserved.

I've tried making my room as quiet and comfortable as possible but I can't sleep and I need to get back on schedule before the start of spring semester which is on Monday.

Even masturbated twice to orgasm but I can't bring myself to sleep with the odd feeling that I'll miss out on something. I'm so addicted to my phone/tablet by reading any little nonsensical article or watching vids on YouTube it's ridiculous. I love it, but I usually can't get to sleep at night on my own without relying on a Xannie.

I try to go about a week at a time without relying on the drug to get me through the day or to sleep to kind of lower my tolerance and not become addicted. It's crucial that I get to bed on time so that I can function like a somewhat typical human being for school after this long ass break.

My first sleep paralysis experience?,"I knew I wouldn’t be able to sleep, so I stopped moving altogether. After a while, I could feel my whole body kind of lock up, but not in a way I couldn’t move, but in a way I couldn’t bring myself to move. It was easy enough to twitch, but moving my limbs was hard as hell. I began to “dream” while still feeling my actual body, so I could feel both my dream body and my real body at once. In my dream, I began to think existential thoughts while floating through space, and there were giant cups everywhere. I went on a long monologue about some bullshit universe thing, using words like “cascading” and “ever-expanding”. It scared the hell out of me, as I could barely control where the existential rant went."

5AM thoughts about Lion King,"So I woke up at 5am this morning and really had to pee. I got up and did my business, and quickly went back to bed. Almost drifting back to sleep, I had a sudden thought. Why has no one brought up the race issue in the Lion King? Like there’s no such thing as dark colored lions. So the movie is either about the white man marching into Africa and trying to colonize the country, OR about slavery itself. Why can’t the light colored lions and dark colored lions live together happily? Why is every dark colored lion labeled as bad and the light colored lions labeled as good? It perfectly describes the race issue that was, and still is, going on in the world. "

Overactive mind or something else?,"So, this may sound weird, but all my life I have never been able to sleep properly, and it's all because of my overactive imagination. Whenever I'm in a dark room I can start to see things like creepy af faces pop up. The only way i can get rid of them is if i try hard to think of something else. Sometimes i think about forcing myself to seev them and drawing them out for people or therapists or whatever to see. I probably sound like a child right now, I know. I should've grown out of this, especially since I turned 18. But they never go away. I don't watch much horror movies. I don't really browse nosleep. I'm not much of a fan of horror at all.

I saw another car coming on that Lane and flashed to signal them to stop. Instead they kept going... She had no idea what happened, just that she was in a lot of pain. Instead of going home I went out to look for her and when I found her she was dead. I then spent the next 30 min going door to door to find the owners. The owners were of course asleep and I had to tell them. They were so sweet and I could see that Milly (the pupper) was in a loving family.

"Can't sleep, only in the day (usually) ??","Hello, I'm really worried about my lifestyle right now, as to why I am writing this. I'm an 18 year old, diagnosed with high functioning autism ( Aspergers ) and I have a few issues. I'm sleeping in the day but I can't sleep at night? I'm also getting really anxious and sweating a lot, these are new symptoms to me, but so are my autism symptoms, I was diagnosed with autism at the age of 16, very late and all these symptoms started affecting me, I was only diagnosed with autism but I feel like I should be diagnosed with a lot more. I have really bad OCD, which leads me to think I am some sort of OCD, I'm anxious a lot so anxiety springs to mind,  and now I'm not sleeping well, so many sleeping disorders spring to mind. I love the dark, this is a vital point to this story. I love the dark, I'm not sure why, I just like the dark. I'll go out walking at 4 am in the night and love it. I think this is why I like to stay awake at night and sleep in the day. I can be really tired, like 3 days without sleep kind of tired and I do feel tired, that's why I'm more worried, is this harming my body? what is happening to me? Why am I like this and can anyone give me any advice please. Should I be doing this? Do I have a sleeping disorder? I'm just a bit confused on everything right now. Please don't get me wrong, I CAN sleep at night, if I'm really really tired, or just feel like sleeping then I'll sometimes be able to sleep, but it seems eventually my sleep pattern always gets turned around, It's affecting my education a lot, as I go to college in the day. Can someone help me?"

How can I fix my f**ked up sleep schedule??,"I've been having prblems sleeping these past 2-3 weeks. Let me explain what happened before I startred having problems. It was before those 2-3 weeks, one day I was staying up to 4 am playing a game (Visual Novel). Then I decided to go to bed, but apperantly I was unable to go to sleep the whole night. Decided I would stay up for the whole day and probably go to sleep the following night. I was really tired the day and accidentally fell asleep from 12:00 to  16:46, which I think was a big mistake, because I couldn't sleep the whole night again. After another sleepless day I had no problems sleeping for about 5 days. And from then on I've been having other problems. Some days I would sleep only for 4 hours (from 22:00 to 4:00), or would have a broken up sleep (from 0:00 to 3:00, then fall asleep again from 4:00 to 6:00 then from 7:00 to 8:00 and such),or falling asleep lightly, or have another sleepless night like today. Before those weeks I never had such problems with sleep, except once but it was because I had to attend a friend's birthday the next day. Except that I've never had such problems. Also I've been going to bed from around 3:00 to 12:00 almost every day through the summer vacation before those problem occured. I've no idea what is up with me. Should I resort to pills, or have some kind of method to fix this. Please recommend something, anything helps.

P.S.
Been drinking warm milk every day before going to bed after those problems occured and had no effect most of the time."

Unfortunately I made a mistake and decided to take a nap at 12 pm and it turned out I slept 4 hours (to 4:40 pm), instead of a 20 min nap. I thought it wasn't a problem and that I could go to sleep tonight without problems, since I thought 4 hours are nothing, but turns out that I can't sleep tonight as well. I dunno, should I stay up all day again, this time without sleeping at all and feeling like shit and go to bed early (like at 10pm), or?
This is not the first time I've stayed up all night, but it will be the first time staying 2 nights (well practically not 2 nights since I got some sleep yesterday). What do I do? I really want to fix my sleeping schedule, the problem occured the first night because I went to bed too late (or rather too early - 3 am). Maybe if I go to sleep at 10 pm every day I might eventually fix it and won't have these nights when I can't sleep. Give me some advice, please!"
what do you think of instead of going to sleep,"I had my 1st day back to school @ChaffeyCollege today (technically yesterday). It's 1:30 in the morning. I mentioned school cus instead of jus chillin and tryna sleep, I completed a take-home-pop-quiz for a chemistry class THAT I DIDN'T EVEN GET INTO. I was on the waitlist and the class was packed. Unfortunately, the professor couldn't add anyone. Besides that, I have a past friend on my mind. Rahkeem Reyes, he was on local IE and LA news back in November of last year cus he was murdered. We used to be like best friends, lovers for a second, but we fell out and it was ugly. So like many random moments, he comes to mind and I feel a bit of regret, a lot of sadness and I jus dwell on it for a while. I miss him a lot. I tell him like he's listening but I'm not sure of that. I thought sharing what's on my mind would clear it but there's still so much more. I think I'm losing my best friend again because he doesn't like my boyfriend. He tells me that he supports me and wants me to be happy and if it's with him then well, do it. I just feel like he disapproves of me. I'm not sure my boyfriend and I are good together. I jus know, I am happy with him and I want to be with him. He had broke up with me a while ago and I acted like I hated him the whole 3 months but he apologized and said he wanted to try again and he wanted all the things he was hesitant about before. My boyfriend and this relationship kinda scares the shit outta me. I know he could hurt me so badly and I am doing it anyway. That's gotta be a trust thing right? I must not completely trust him. That's one issue, another is his ex who is like a ""best friend"" I guess. I don't have a problem with him being friends with any of his exes but she called me ""toxic"". I feel like I love my boyfriend and because he hurt me so bad and we got in this intense conversation where I was crying and asking him questions and he lied straight to my face, I lost it and punched him in the face. I didn't hit him hard enough to leave a mark and that doesn't justify it. It's just that I did, and I apologies profusely, he left the house and I cried alone til he returned. I felt so much remorse and I still do. I don't want what I did to be 'swept under the rug' and ignored. I want it to be 'water under the bridge', I want to talk about it, deal with it and move forward. I will never hurt him like that ever again. I jus don't know what to do when he doesn't talk about emotions at all. We have a relationship journal, where he writes to me sometimes but still even there it's scarce and obscure. I am not completely sure why he may feel how he feels sometimes cus he leaves stuff out. I'm jus lost. so lost"

"Wife/Kid went on vacation, found out my sleep cycle doesn't match up","My wife and kid went off to see her side of the family (I was too exhausted from the traveling we'd already done this year), and I noticed that I was staying up later and later, but also napping in the middle of the day, which I never used to do.

Apparently I'm on a [biphasic sleep cycle](http://www.dreams.co.uk/sleep-matters-club/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/4-sleeping-cycles-you-didnt-know-about.jpg) now. Maybe this was always what I was best suited to, but just didn't know it? I've been able to pull off the monophasic schedule for the most part, but I definitely always hit a wall in midday where I felt a bit useless.

I'm not really sure how all that figures in to why I'm up tonight, but I don't think I'll be sleeping at all until a midday nap later."

Weird thing about me,"I normally cut my hair very short, I've done this since I was very young. I really don't like having hair growing over my ears because it's annoying, plus long hair has always been more difficult to take care of than short hair. I was in the military and kept short hair there too, It's never been a problem. But for some reason, a few months ago, I didn't feel like cutting it so I let it grow out a little bit and just kept telling myself I would cut it later. Now, several months later, my hair is longer than its ever been and I still get annoyed by it being in my ears so I constantly move it out of them and go about my business, that's not the weird part, the weird part for me is that I get super paranoid that people are judging my hair... I have never cared what people thought about my hair because it was always too short to matter, now that it's long I care a lot. Sometimes I feel like I can't go in public because my hair might be a little greasy or I might have some weird cow lick from sleeping on it. I will even brush it and still feel like I will be judged harshly for it. I feel like I don't even want to leave the house to sit in line at my son's school because people will look in the car and see my hair. That's a weird thing about me."

The new apartment has a strict policy against my dog's breed and size; my brother and I rescued him in 2008.

Please review my year 9 horror story,"New Message 
Alex had just received a message from his sister, saying that she broke her ankle because of a group of preppy students who supposedly didn’t enjoy her presence. Her first day at a new primary school and students were already bullying her. Alex was fuming with a mixture of rage and sorrow. His sister Rachel, was twelve years old. Alex, Rachel and their alcoholic of a mother, have moved states countless of times; all to escape the problems their mother rose. Their mother is always on bad terms with everyone. Rachel and Alex have never had a friend that has lasted more than three months due to their mother always sleeping around. Alex sighed, Rachel was only twelve and her childhood was already flooded with scarring memories. He shook his head, he had to remain strong for Rachel. Becoming enraged about the past won’t help erase it. 
He reversed hastily, knocking down their empty garbage bin. He glanced at his phone numerous times to see where he was going. It was his first time going to this particular hospital, he had to use the GPS. He went through several turns and empty tunnels. He was now waiting at a red light, he was the only care going to the left.
 Alex finally arrived at his destination. It was dark, pitch black to be clear. There were no cars nor people to be seen, well it was late at night, it made sense, he thought. A loose entrance sign flashed wearily. Alex rushed towards it, as it as the only light in the area. He raced inside the building while focused on getting his Medicare card out. Alex fumbled around with his keys and wallet, cursing excessively. He was relieved to see the green card peeking out. 
“Hi I am Rachel Winchester’s Guar-” Alex was surprised to see no receptionist. 
He furrowed his eyebrows in confusion but then at that moment everything stopped. Alex’s mind, heart, eyes, everything, they froze. He slowly turned his head, not a single person could be seen, but what he saw next made the hairs on the back of his neck stand up. 
Bodies, at least thirty of them, laid like ghoulish mannequins in a waste of blood, the oesophagus and arteries sticking out, like corrugated pipes. Their raw, fleshy intestines spilled out onto the floor. Corpses dispersed all over the place. One of them groaned, it looked at Alex with inclusive eyes. Its eyes became wider but lost complete life as another body came soaring down. Alex flinched and looked down. No human was physically capable of doing such. The bodies looked as if they were dolls and had been dissembled from limb to limb. 
The walls, floor, ceiling and furniture were splattered perfectly in thick, scarlet blood. Body parts were thrown in haphazard places. More blood dripped from the ceiling, crashing against the floor, creating a light sound. A strong fresh, metallic taste blanketed the air. Equipment were scattered across the ground and the once pristine, white bed sheets were now stained in red and black fluids. The walls looked as if they were painted in grime. There was only one working light bulb.  Alex’s heart beat like a million mallets, where was he? Where was Rachel? He tried to move but his feet wouldn’t cooperate, paralysed, he tried to call out for his sister but his voice strained into oblivion. Alex breathed heavily, only the panting of his breath was heard. He couldn’t bear to think what had happened to Rachel, his heavy breathing turned into light sobs. Abruptly, the main door swung open, clashing with the blood smeared wall. Alex waited to hear the wind but the atmosphere still remained silent. The door wasn’t swung by the wind. 
“Alex, help me” a young voice cried. 
Rachel! Alex’s eyes scanned the area. He wanted to run to her but he didn’t know where to start, there was at least a hundred rooms on the first level alone. His mind was filled with worries and doubts. 
“Help” she whined again.
It was coming from the hallway. Why was she there? He made his way down the murky narrow hallway, using his phones flashlight to guide him. No lights were seen, all of them were broken, as if they burst from high voltage. He heard a quiet whimpering coming from the room across him. He followed the sound, nearly tripping on a ragged head. He entered a cold empty room. 
Contrastingly, the room was spotless. The tiled ground shone as the light hit the surface. The room was wide and open made for the use of four people. The bed sheets were pearly white, the windows were glistening, and even the ceiling looked like it had just been cleaned. The whole room looked new and unused. The beds, curtains, windows were picture perfect, too perfect. 
Alex couldn’t hear the whimpering anymore, it was silent again.
 He decided to exit the room and search somewhere else. Alex touched the door knob but his hand came in contact with something warm and sticky. He flashed the light on it, it was blood. The door knob was evenly coated in hot, crimson blood. Alex tried to get rid of the blood from his hand. He wiped it on his overworn, denim jeans repeatedly; he illogically wiped it with his other hand, only causing it to transfer. He couldn’t get the blood off his hands. His breath quickened as he panicked more. He fell on the icy floor. The blood stained deeper into his skin as time went. The blood spread, it was on his jacket, shirt and his jeans. No matter how hard he tried, it wouldn’t come off. He pulled his hair in frustration, dying his blonde hair a faint red. Then suddenly, a corpse had slipped from the low single bed to the right and laid staring up at him, the mouth open, the head almost cleft from the body. He saw again, the severed vessels. Then another came falling down, it propped ungainly as a rag doll, against the far wall. Its head dropped forward and over its chest, a great mat of blood covered his chest, resembling a bib. 
Before Alex could react he heard a cry again.
“ALEX, ALEX HELP, PLEASE!” 
 Alex’s mind was a mess, he pushed open the door and yelled for Rachel. He ran and he kept running, he looked through the rooms, kicking the doors open and pushing every large object. He tried not to become bothered by the corpses. He ran up the blood stained stairs. Everywhere he went, blood followed him. Alex stopped running and panted loudly, his lungs felt like they were being squeezed their life out.
“RACHEL, WHERE ARE YOU?” He yelled.
“RACHEL WHERE IN THE WORLD ARE YOU RACHEL?” He screamed on the top of the lungs using the last bit of his energy. 
He was answered back with silence. 
“PING” 
Alex had received a new message.
 He unlocked his phone.
“Where did you go? Come back home mum’s drinking again.”- Rachel
Alex’s heart dropped.
“PING” 
One new message.
“Aren’t you going to help me?”- Rachel Unknown. 
Rachel’s profile name swiftly changed before his eyes, reading “unknown” 
No muscle in his body moved except his pounding heart. The only light bulb in the room burst. 
Alex was surrounded by darkness.
But only for a while as he was greeted with two laser red eyes.

How to Sleep Better and Faster | Sleep Hacks Revealed,
Sleep... Meh,Like death but without the commitment
White noise app,"Hey guys just thought I'd share this as I am lying awake next to my bf who is happily sleeping... there's this app called White Noise which I use for smoothing background sounds. There's also a Market for downloading more sounds. There's also a timer to turn the sound off after an hour or however long you need.

I like to listen to rain falling on tent or rain falling on the car to fall asleep to. It kind of distracts you from your brain hyperactive thoughts, but I find that I have to set it at exactly the right volume so I can hear it but not be too loud.

Anyways hope this helps some of you. Gonna go back to trying to sleep.

There will be Anarchy,"This will probably get taken down within the week. Maybe sooner depending on how long it takes the government to find it. I'm not even sure if posting this is safe, but everyone has a right to know. They need to know. The world is ending. And not inevitably. Right now.

It started off small with the elevation of technology. Making computers mobile and so high tech that they talk back to you. The higher the technology, the easier the next step was: government control. Governments gained the ability to watch our every move and see our every typed out message. Hell, I'm sure they can see me typing this right now. They gain control over media, creating fake stories and testimonies in the news, altering our way of thinking to conform to theirs. They make us fear the world so that they can exist the way that they want. But the one fatal flaw to their plan is social media. In this format people are fearless and say what they wish, no matter the consequences. They beat each other verbally and shove their opinions down each other's throats. This creates chaos and hatred among the people. The hatred is felt worldwide. People begin to express themselves in public and then the unpopular opinion is beaten down. Riots break out and the government attempts to tighten their grips on humanity’s throat. Their efforts not only fail, but distract them from their enemies. A vulnerable government is sure to fall. And when the weaker has his back turned, the stronger is sure to plunge a knife into it. It becomes a domino effect. One country fires on another and the demolished country’s allies fire back and so on and so forth. It all ends back at technology. While we are so buried in our modernism and fancy-featured devices, we forget about the fact that technology bigger than all of us sits idly waiting in 9 countries around the world. Nuclear warfare isn't a new concept, but it hasn't been too terribly necessary in modern times. At least not to everyday citizens. Of course until now. But the world is so distracted by their online conflicts and their opinions being disagreed with that they don't even see. They don't see the war inching toward them like a lion to a gazelle. I wish I didn't know either. It's too late to stop it now.

I have the unfortunate pleasure of knowing first hand what the end of the world will look like. Nine months ago I was taken from my home. It was a few weeks into my father's 3rd deployment, and I had finally gotten back in a routine. Being a 17 year old with a father in the Navy, I was accustomed to being alone. I was never bothered by it. Not until now anyway. Not until I was snatched up like a rag doll by a man whose face I never saw, and whose footsteps I never heard. I was in my room one second and the next I had a rag clamped over my mouth and the world was going dark.

I knew I had woken up, but the darkness never faded. It felt like I was buried alive. Like the oxygen would be sucked from my lungs any second. However, once I calmed my breathing down, I was able to hear the dull hum of a running engine. I was in the trunk of a car, undoubtedly bound and gagged. I should have panicked, but a calm shock settled over me as the thought of being kidnapped buried itself in my brain. I let my brain focus on the movement of the car. How it moved smoothly over the pavement and glided around curves. I couldn't tell how fast it was going, only when it slowed to stops. The smoothness only last a while before the  crunching of gravel sounded beneath me. The road seemed to turn to a series of sharp bumps and hills. I slid helplessly around in the trunk, trying not to make squeals of surprise and pain when I knocked into other items. That's when the car squealed to a halt. I heard the door open and close before the distinct sound of a rusty gate being swung open. The car moved for another ten minutes or so before it stopped again and the engine’s hum subsided. I closed my eyes as the trunk opens and light floods the back of my eyelids. I kept completely still and tried my best to control my breathing. The man picked me up and swung me over his shoulders like I was nothing, the strength of this man and the sheer power in his bulbous arm frightened me even more until the ability to contain myself became less of a medial task and more of an inability to do so. First we went upstairs and then down some long walk before finally he sat me down on something soft. The bag was removed and I stared straight into blazing blue eyes shielded by a black ski mask.

“Where am I?” I whispered, shivering.

“I’m surprised you didn’t scream, not like it would matter, no one can hear you here anyways…”

I look down at the old flower print on the dusty couch and at the remains of a house that seemed more like a graveyard of old memories. It could’ve owned to some recently deceased old grandma, what with the overwhelming scent of rose candles, molded cookies, and mothballs.

“Where am I?” I repeated.

“Hell,” he said with a shrug and left.

For weeks it went on that way, he would lock me in a different room in the house that was set with only one item. Days would go by with only a water dish and a slice of bread in the corner to keep me alive until he returned. I was lucky if I managed to unchain myself from the furniture and crawl over to the rations before the mice picked it away. For the first set of three days, it was the den with a couch. The second set was in an upstairs bedroom where there sat a radio in a far corner. The batteries were taken out, so I could never have contacted anyone. The third set was in a room with peeling wallpaper and a  yardstick propped up against the door. The fourth had a helmet inside, an old and battered army helmet that had many dents from bullet wounds. The fifth had a newspaper that dated far back, an original copy from the assassination of John F. Kennedy. The sixth had a little arch sitting in the middle of the room. The seventh had a beautiful aquarium with intricate coral designs and a small school of fish that swam back and forth as if they were on a set track through the water and could go no place else. Seven sets of room, the setting changed but was always the same situation. I began to think it would never change, that it would go on this way until I finally died.

Until my eighteenth birthday.

The man lifted my frail body and carried me to the basement, locking me in a room with many computers. My hands were not bound, my head not covered, and no rations were available.

“This is your chance. If you survive, you pass the test, but if not, then oh well.”

“What do I do?!” I demanded though some part of me knew that the key to my escape lied with the high tech computers that were so out of place set in the darkness of an old house’s basement.

I approach the control table and presses the spacebar. A screen requiring a password appeared. A seven digit password.

“Seven letters? What the hell?! You have locked me in this house for nearly a month! Only one useless thing and enough to sustain my life, barely! Where could the hints to a password be?” I screamed out. A clock in the corner of the screen appeared that read 60 Seconds and was counting down.

That’s when it hit me.

Twenty-one days I have been here, three days--which is as long as a normal human can go without water--per room, seven rooms. Seven letters. One object. Couch. Radio. Yardstick. Helmet. Newspaper. Arch. Aquarium. Do those things all have something in common? No! 

30 Seconds.

First letters… C…R…Y…H…N…A…A…

Does it spell something? Cry hana? Arch nay? Yach ran? Maybe it’s one word. Yarnach? Aranchy?

10 Seconds.

ANARCHY.

It was a long shot, but my fingers blazed over the keys. With only one second remaining, I jammed the enter key. The screen went black before finally I realized that had gotten it correct. Nothing had happened.

In white letters a sentence appeared on the screen, and then more in quick succession.

A. Arch. The foundation of the society.

N. Newspaper. The media, the spread of lies.

A. Aquarium. The droning of citizens, thinking they have an environment but it’s all contained.

R. Radio. Communication between the citizens.

C. Couch. The cushion of the government holding against gravity, the absolute of the system.

H. Helmet. The sacrifice of the military for a populace that doesn’t care.

Y. Yardstick. Measure how much, measures only enough, measures not enough.

The foundation of the society is crumbling, people go on in their mindless tasks unknowing of what is going on behind the scenes.

Break the system.

Only you can see beyond the mindless fog. Only you can make the change. The system is collapsing.

Break the system.

Nuclear warfare, chemical warfare, highly trained soldiers… The world is ready. America isn’t.

Then images of all the horrible things running rapid in society began flashing on the screen. I watched, dumbfounded, my eyes flicking back and forth over the pictures. Then, the computer shut off and I was left awestruck. The man came into the room and pulled off his mask, I recognized him as one of my father’s commanding officers.

“Do you see now? I created this program to test the limits of future individuals in our organization. None is less than brilliant. You have a choice right now-” Then, through the light of the open door, I could see that he was holding a pistol at his side but it was quickly raised to my forehead. “Join or die.”

I joined the organization that day, set to stop the inevitable, but I know now that there is no hope. As I type right, I want you to listen to me. THERE IS NO HOPE. Nuclear war is coming and the only possible way to stop it is for everyone in every place in the world joins together and fights against their government. They think they what’s the best for us but they have us captured and trapped like sheep. Only they aren’t the herders, they are the wolves, picking us off one by one. Terrorism. Mass suicides. All of it. Only one at a time isn’t enough. No, it is time they annihilated us all. I don’t know why they decided that total nuclear war was the proper action to deal with us cattle, but they did… And there is nothing we can do to stop it.

I wrote this to warn you all, but knowing the way the system works, this might not even make it online. I might get tracked down and killed for trying to save billions of lives. But so long as there is the chance to change the fate of the world as we know then I will take it. Not too long ago, my father died for this country, so long as I am alive I will try my best to preserve it. I will not see it fall.

So I will post this and pray that someday, someone, somewhere will know where ANARCHY truly lies: in the media where people can say what they want and try to salvage what everyone else seems to be trying to destroy.

Nothing matters.

He waved and I pointed down the road...When I came back inside I was torn between screaming and crying...leaving me to just me silent for the rest of the day. Now my mind and heart are racing and I can't stop replaying him and I making eye contact...doesn't help he called me 5 times afterwards. Idk..."

Can't Sleep...Just need some friends to chat to,"Hi reddit. Created this account just now to say hi. I am a semi-recent transplant to a new city and this is the furthest away I've lived from my family. I live with one of my best friends from college who is a party animal and great roommate. We have a blast living together...but today as with many weekends my roommate is out of town and I feel super alone in a semi-new city. I haven't made that many new friends, and there's great people I've met here but it just doesn't feel the same, ya know? I miss my family and friends at home and often wish I hadn't left home to try out a new place. I'm a middle child and have always felt like I've had a big part in keeping the older and younger siblings together as the family. Idk, now that I'm hours away it just feels so different. Anyone else feel the same? I Just want to chat with some internet ""friends"" here. I'm not like suicidal or mentally ill so no huge worries there, just missing my family and old life and things and would love to chat about stuff. I like LOTR, GoT, Fallout, Skyrim, etc...tried the For Honor beta but then it expired but it seemed sweet...whats up friends?"

I'm so tired,"But I napped until noon today. Then I got very upset and spent two hours crying, which gave me a headache. I drank 3 beers, which made me feel very full and very carbonated.

I've been to 2 psychiatrist (1 only seems to want my money since she just wants me to talk about my day and draw things? but I see not help with this, the second actually had me talk about some things then without knowing had an idea of my problem so I'm sticking with him) and they just tell me to keep talking to them and do some family activities (we do a lot already only resting sunday evenings at home or movie & dinner other than that is biking, touring, getting lost, camping, etc...)

One year ago..,"Well it's been one year since my dad died. This night last year he was taken to hospice around 6pm. 

Now I don't live in the same state as my parents, but I'm a huge daddy's girl who had to move away for my husband's job. So when we found out my dad was only given 3 months- 1 year to live I told my husband I needed to go home to take care of my dad. So the following week, with my husbands blessing, I flew home. 

I flew home in October and started to be my dad's caretaker. I was with him 24/7. I barely slept, as he couldn't get much rest himself and couldn't do a lot by himself, he needed someone up with him to help him. This continued for 3 months. Now the day comes. January 2, he's very sick and not comfortable enough so the hospice nurses want to take him in to re-evaluate the medicines he in on in order to make him as comfortable as possible, and then send him home again. (His wishes were to be at home, no hospital and a DNR). This just didn't happen. He died at 3:30 in the morning on January 3.

The problem is, i decided to sleep. He went to hospice and I was tired so I took the opportunity to sleep instead of going with my mother that night. I was going to pack a bag in the morning and stay with him until he was released in a couple days, I just wanted one nights rest. I'll regret it the rest of my life.

Now...one year later, the same night and I can't sleep.

RIP daddy"

It doesn't matter anyways,
It's simple i can't sleep,"Even if i worked 12 hours today... now its 5:12 am and im still awake.. tired but unable to sleep... i know being on reddit is quite counterproductive atm, but i just feel like i have to keep myself somewhat busy and not just lay around doing absolutly nothing.. so what now? Gotta work today too and it doesnt look like its going to be any less work as yesterday. Propably its a lot more because its friday. Are those the thoughts that keep me awake all night? Is someone even reading this am i being heard out there or will people just be like tl;dr lul and keep going with their lives with normal sleep cycles? Maybe not on here given the fact its a subreddit about not being able to sleep so... at least i hope my thought process is so boring for some people that they actually fall asleep reading this, as its not working out for me. I feel my brain getting reactivated with every single word i type. As im quite enjoying to rapidly move my fingers on the virtual keyboard of my phone i lose precious time i could use to sleep but oh well im already way to deep into this to just suddendly stop without a real conclusion, now am i? If someone is really in a worse position then me and spent all the time they could've used to atleast try to fall asleep have my condolences. You're just in a spot as bad as mine. Maybe we can find a solution together i dont know. Just someone give me a sign im not alone in this a mind that just doesn't seem to shut up for hours to come when thenight falls a mind that even if shy in the day sometimes, runs through events, equations and basic human problems all night long. But yeah thats just good 'ol me... peace"
The Story of Patrick,"I would like to preface this story by saying that I do not know who Patrick is before or after this story. 

So I wake up at about 6am and I can't sleep. I'm tossing and turning, but ultimately I realize the reason I can't keep my eyes closed is because I'm hungry. I know I have nothing to eat in my kitchen (poor college student) except for a few boxes of cereal, but here's the catch: no milk. 
So I decided to make the trek to the local convenience store. I put on some clothes, walk outside my apartment complex, and begin my walk -that is only one block over- to said store. 

Almost immediately, I see this girl stumbling in the distance. It's fairly obvious she is an intoxicated college student. She sees me, or at least I think she sees me, and calls out ""Patrick?"" (Not my name). 
At this point I thought she was perhaps just meeting up with someone and had gotten us mixed up. So I keep walking towards the store and towards her, which is in the same direction. She calls again, ""Patrick?"", so I decided to respond and tell her I was not. 

Now at this point you assume something like: Oh she's just too drunk to realize you're not this Patrick fella and she tries to make out with me/punch me/some other thing because she has mistaken me for this guy. Nope, it's not as exciting as that.

We're about 20 feet away from one another at this point; I'm only about 100 feet from the store. She says something along the lines of, ""Oh sweet a free ---, I'm gonna take it!"". I couldn't see what she was referring to nor did I hear what she said at first. Upon a few steps closer, I see her bend over and pick up a soaking wet bra off the street (college, right?). ""I don't care if it's wet, I'm gonna wash it and wear it."", was her next fine choice of words. I respond with ""Hey, you do you."", out of awkwardness and a little bit of disgust. 
""Me do me"", she says. At this point we pass each other. I roll my eyes. A second later I hear her beginning the call again, ""Patrick?"".

I finally make it to the store, buy myself milk as well as some of those mini donuts to treat myself to an early morning outing. Then I return to my apartment without any sign of the intoxicated girl from before. As I stand over my kitchen counter, pouring my cereal, I think about the odds of me having that encounter and how no one else was a witness to it. I thought it both funny and very odd. Well that's college for you."
Can't sleep,Sometimes I wish I had someone to talk to when I'm up all night
Can't sleep because of dreams...,"I usually love dreaming and have never had dreams that make me not want to sleep, but this time it literally keeping me up. Now what else do I do besides play on Reddit, read, and binge watch red vs blue over and over again... why are you awake??"
I started doing writing stuff and now I am wide awake.,"I posted to /r/destrucitvereaders and hoped that I might get some feedback on something old that I need to pick up again, but now I am thinking about it too much. And the screen is bright. And I have been staying up late on Reddit anyway, so I am used to it now, but I really need to not because I gotta get up and go to school tomorrow."

Where are best places TO research this? Library books? Anything!

1:30 and I have school tomorrow!,"I didn't have school yesterday on Monday. Last night I took advantage that I didn't have school today, and I stayed up until like 5.
I was in bed, but I had this melody in my head, and I've been trying to make a beat out of it, and it's already 1:30. 
1:30 is not very late, I'm usually awake at this time on school nights, but in bed, on my phone. I'm very energized right now, wide awake, nervous. There's no way I'm going to fall asleep before 4, and I wake up at 6 each morning.

I should sleep now but I can't, I'm not sleepy, and I don't want to.

Not sure what to do and trying to give it another chance and not really finding it. Someone want to help and change my mind and keep me going through the bs that life has to offer..."
"School, work, confusion","This is my first ever post anywhere online. 

I'm 24 and feeling confused. Can't sleep. 

I need school to work out. I've got school loans from taking 6 years and still haven't got my bachelor's. Not to talk down on myself about it but it's too long to be in college. Weird thing is if it was someone else I'd assure them from here to Mars that it's okay they've been in school that long but I recognize the reality that no one is going to wait on me, especially life. Life will swallow me whole and I'm just sitting around waiting for someone to ring the dinner bell before I decide to start acting and save myself.  

I'm a hard worker and great at getting shit done but only at work. Not at school or at home or with friends. 

Socially, I've learned a lot and am growing but I enjoy lazy, dirty, angry and fucked up individuals. Personally, I'm pretty straight laced but I've always been around the fucked up crowd and intend to keep it that way. This does not help me with my responsibilities or my extremely high standards that I have set for myself: finish school, work in a career field, pay loans and save money, pursue a place to live that keeps me close to the things I enjoy and allows me to meet people who enjoy them too. 

However, I'm not down with the American dream. Contradictory isn't it? 

I contradict myself on every detail of my life. I want money because I decided school was a good idea but I don't want to live any kind of normal life. Again, I like the fucked up people of this world because I've always understood them and honestly...... They're way more fun than you normal fucks! 

I cringe at the realization that I'll never have good time management skills as to be able to do good on school or run a household. On the other hand I work so hard on shit once I get the ball rolling that I Iook at others and laugh when they even try to get close. 

I'm not smarter than most but I'm way farther ahead in introspection and understanding others. The childish insights of others is painfully pathetic because I figured those things out years ago. BUT others are painfully ahead of me in all of the relevant, professional ways as well as being way more relaxed than me. I'm too fucking serious, a dash of narcissism, overly modest about my talents, and I don't believe in myself as much as I believe in others. 

Contradicting but also makes sense. 

I basically think there's a lot of idiots that think they're the shit. They are not. I'm way better than them except that they perform better in many social situations and professional situations. 

I value telling the Truth. 

Idk.  Just like most others I'm  scared. Which is new. And I'm confused. Searching for motivation and practice at being better with studying. I wish I could care less about dumb fucks but they seem to be the loudest and most influential. And I'm angry. Very angry. I guess I'm synical. 

I'm so normal that it hurts and I think I'm better when I'm not although I don't feel like I'm better from day to day, just when I'm angry or sad. And that makes me very confused sometimes. 

I wish I could wrap this up somehow but honestly, I just wanted to sleep and idk how else to help me get there. 

Thanks if you read this. A psychoanalysis would be fun a dn appreciated."

After a few moments of looking for my family I find a few of them and got everyone into a car, but I can't find my little brother. So I start driving through the parking lot not caring who I hit. That's when I see him and freeze. I fucking froze. I was so scared of everything around me that I froze and as he was trying to escape he became surrounded and they attacked him. He struggled trying to crawl away. I was so scared in the dream that I left him. I left him and watched him struggle as I drove away. I woke up in hysterics and cried unable to sleep because every time I closed my eyes I saw him try to crawl away. I can't sleep anymore and thinking about it has me in tears. Please help me sleep. "

How to Sleep with Lots of Noise: 10 Steps,
bedhogs and netflix,"Yeah that pretty much sums it up. Boyfriend and dog hog the bed, binge watching the originals on Netflix, and wiiiiide awake.

Noisy Neighbors,"So... I've been living in the upstairs portion of a duplex with my boyfriend for almost a year. We have a thousand square feet and a pleasant quiet small dog (amazingly). We don't party, we barely if ever fight, and we barely invite people over. 
However the same cannot be said for the couple that live downstairs. With their thousand square feet they live with 2 tomcats, and a medium sized dog who loves to bark. The animals have seperation anxiety, and whenever they leave the house there is always a chorus of yowling and howling for almost thirty minutes, and this can be in the morning, afternoon or night, they also tend to leave the television on at a high volume for their pets (Diesel, Jack and Murphy). They have guests often, and their vehicles rip up the section of the yard dedicated to a fire pit and roaming space instead of parking in the spots left or on the road.
The girl downstairs often likes to dabble in cooking, cooking that ends up smelling like something Cthulu would unleash, that smell travels through the ventilation into my apartment.
But I would have to say my biggest complaint is that every week, at least 2-3 times, typically Tuesdays, Fridays and Saturdays... They leave in seperate vehicles and are gone for a stretch of hours (which is blissful after the animals downstairs quiet down), and then return, in their seperate vehicles drunk and loud. They come barreling into the driveway (they've hit the porch before but didn't demolish it), slam the front door enough to rattle the windows upstairs, and then proceed to fight for a good thirty minutes before you hear the girl scream at him, begin crying and then more doors slamming before its quiet again. This all takes place between 1am and 3am... every Tuesday, Friday and Saturday. While we, my boyfriend and I, typically have a good distanced and polite relationship with the people downstairs, I don't know how long I can stay quiet. The first few months we spent laughing as we were forced to listen to the couple downstairs have very loud, very descriptive sex...however those days are long gone. The constant fighting is exhausting, and I'm not even the one yelling... "
Nuclear war nightmare,"TIFU. I watched BBC Panorama's ""When the bomb drops"" documentary from the early 80's on my laptop, in bed, as I was trying to go to sleep. It was a pretty abrupt look at what would happen in Britain is nuclear war happened, and how woefully unprepared they were.

Real sleep after sleeping pills - is it possible or a pipe dream?,"I was taking seroquel for around 6 years. Last November I inadvertently found myself tapering off pretty quickly.  My husband was overseas for six months and my older kids would wait for me to sleep to act up so I stayed up. Over Christmas I went completely off and experienced the worst withdrawals. Since then I've gone from one hour of sleep a night to four but only with the help of things like Valarian root, gabba, otc sleep aides, etc. Whatever I use works well for a month or two and then stops. I was prescribed desyrel to help with less side effects  but afraid to go down that road again.  Not taking sleeping pills has relieved a host of side effects I didn't know were caused by it but now I'm having issues functioning under severe sleep deprivation.  Are things going to change or do I have no choice but to go back to being medicated? Are there other options available? "

I have a sweet and loving girlfriend, but she can't sleep. Every day she is having trouble sleeping, she tries to have sex with me. I don't have a problem with that, however I can't function properly without 6-8 hours of sleep. Tonight she went to the living room because she sensed that I was very annoyed. I love, and I think we have great sex, the few times a month that we do it, but I know that half an hour of sex, then half an hour of cooling down, and then sleep, is not great for my sleep. 
She won't have sex with me any other time than at night (often 12oclock) because she is bored because she can't sleep.

[update] She's ruining my sleeping pattern,"Update:

Went to a Halloween party and she was there. 

After drinking a little, we were goofing off and she tried to convince me to dance again-I just froze up and it turned into a long hug.
I wish that there was a way to obtain that feeling or moment forever. 

The rest of the night was interesting. 
She almost kissed me a few times. She kept making intense eye contact. 
A few hours later, we started talking about stuff and she broke down and started crying-her ex boyfriend really did a number on her.. 
It was pretty heartbreaking to see her that way. 
I didn't know what else to do other than hold onto her and keep wiping her tears away. 
She nearly passed out on my lap. I was softly dragging my fingertips over her eyebrows and down the length of her nose and back up it. 
After a while of silence and when she calmed down a little, she decided that it would be a good idea to find a sober ride home. 
At the end of the night, I walked her out and she kissed my cheek during a hug. I kissed her forehead. That basically summarizes the evening. 

God, she's beautiful.

Infinite feedback loop of anxiety.,"It's like this, right?


You can't get to sleep because you can't get comfortable. But you NEED to get some sleep because you need to get up early. So you get stressed out about not getting enough sleep which makes you anxious. Which makes you uncomfortable and leads into an infinite feedback loop.

First day of Junior year tomorrow and I can't sleep at all.,"I can't sleep whatsoever and I need advice.

It sounds like the back door is opening and there's light footsteps that make their way to the open doorway, then they stop and start again at the door every 10-15 minutes. Any advice? This is impossible."
I'm just worrying about too much.,"Honestly, I just needed a place to put things because I have a hard time talking to people face to face. And I get really reclusive when shit like this happens.
I have had a lot thrown at me and it is just stuck in my head and I can't stop thinking about it.

What am I going to fix? I told my mom about this quote angrily and she said sorry. That's it. I can lead a horse to water but fuck I can't make the horse drink.
My boyfriend recently talked to me about my emotional stiffness, he knows I have a hard time with that because any time I get too emotionally attached is when I get fucked over. And he's made me cry over this. I don't know what to do, and I'm trying so hard currently but now it seems like he's the one pulling away emotionally and just wanting to have sex all the time. And now that I'm trying this emotional shit more intensely, I'm getting jealous when he brings up his ex's and what they did together and I'm not used to this feeling and I don't know how to handle it. I just get so mad. And he drunkenly had sex with his ex fuck buddy and I'm trying to be okay with it and move on because essentially she took advantage of the state he was in. Why he got that drunk to begin with though still fucking stresses me out. but this is just icing on top of the issues I already have been handed. I can't sleep or eat unless I'm high, I have been throwing up any food because of stress when I'm sober, and I am just a mess, I don't want to be around people at all if I could.

Sunday nights - Can't sleep! Advice?,"I'm interested in hearing any and all theories on why I can't seem to sleep well on Sunday nights. I say Sunday, but really it's whatever night before I go back to work for the week. Usually Sundays, but I took a day off to recover from a volunteering weekend, so Monday was my Sunday. 

I remember going to sleep at 11pm, decided at 11:20pm I couldn't sleep. Woke up and txt'd a friend for a half hour, ate half a pancake to kill a tiny bit of hunger, went back to bed at 12am. Rolled, lightly dozed off and on all night, and remember seeing 1am, 3am, 4am, 5am, 6am, really wanted to sleep, but alas my alarm went off at 7. 

I used to think it was due to tv/light from my boyfriend beside me, but I can sleep mostly fine with it any other night. Last night he wasn't home, the room was dark and quiet and still I couldn't sleep. 

The rest of the week is usually fine. But my Mondays suffer more than they really should, and Mondays are bad enough as it is. 

Now, it's not like I hate my job. With or without stressful times, with or without head office visiting, it always seems to be the same. Sleep just fine Tues-Sat for the most part. But Sunday nights, they just suck.

I told her I understand if she wanted to be friends cuz she's going off to college soon. Though this awkward situation happened, we have still been talking and acting like that night never happened. We still act tight. I feel like I ask her if she wants to hang out too often. Sometimes I need to back up and respect her own wants. Just sucks knowing she just wants to be friends when she still shows me her true colors and how fun she is to be around, in and outside of work,  the reasons i started liking her.

Been needing to increase my melatonin dosage just to fall asleep :/"
couchpotato,"Hello, i'm not going to bore you with life story, but this is just something i need to get off my chest. I think i'm a nice guy trapped in a douche bag mindset, that i created when i was a kid. Manly because i got bullied for six years, kind of found out how to become popular, and it consisted manly of not caring about school, get beer and smoke. So i ditched those friends that stood by my side when i got bullied (other kids that used to get picked on). I was flying high, 8-10 grade, partying in the weekends and sleeping with the hot girls in the library during class, and when i say sleep, i mean actually sleeping. this attitude worked fine, until after ""Videregående"" witch is the Norwegian equivalent of High School. Every other friend left or started working, while i took another class, to have the opportunity to study other things on a university, instead of  starting a entry level job as an electrician, witch was what i studied to become in high school. After the last year extra in high school i went ant studied to become a kindergarten leader of some sort, that sucked, it was the first time i moved away from home, i fast became this unimportant blob in the world that is university. Became really asocial, sat inside my room an played video games and barely talked to my flatmates. So i quit the class and moved home, thought to myself that i needed a break from school, and should find myself a job and rather learn about the working world and become more independent before i started studying again. The exact opposite happened! I came home, started smoking weed almost on a daily basis for a year or so, lied to my parents about applying for work, and what i deed on a day to day basis, actually went so far that i lied about that i was working, and one year i lied and told them i was studying at the university in our city, while i was really home, smoking weed and playing wow. three soon four years later, here i am. I got no job, still live at home, no money of course, 100,000 nok (11560USD) in dept, and some depths from friends that loaned me money, witch i cant pay because i don't have a job as i said. Now, i'm going to a psychologist, had three sessions, she seems to think the drugs, alcohol and asocial activity's is just things i do to numb myself from actually dealing my problems, and i guess she's right, but i feel so low, no confidence and no enthusiasm. Thank you for ""listening"", good night."

I spot my fiancee on the couch, fast asleep to Frasier (thanks Netflix!) and decide now is the time. Nope. Now isn't the time. My neighbor owes me weed and I'm in need. I knock on the door.

No answer.

Fuck that. Tonight was awful. Fucking DJ's for the wedding, fucking $80 for a ring pillow and some kind shit for her ring to be taken out on, fucking brother that can't remember the fucking color of the jacket for wedding despite my sending an e-mail, text, and Facebook message with links to all the colors and options for purchase...what was I talking about? Anger, ADD, those things, yea.

She's fast asleep, Frasier. Thanks. I sneak in and creep my way around the couch, up the stairs, in to the makeshift man-cave. My shitty duplex's spare bedroom has been abandoned for about a week since a girl I used to know in high school moved out to live with her boyfriend's mother (wtf?). 

I've remodeled the room since she left. I now have my $3000 rig (2013 money) sitting up there beneath a desk that is littered with dirty wine glasses and empty beer bottles. An ashtray with a passed out Mexican, dick exposed, contains a few roaches and serves as a reminder of my last day in the military. I'm white, but from far enough south Texas that I consider myself in sync with Mexican culture. How does one describe that? I'm more Vaquero than Cowboy. I'm also nothing like either of those things.

What was  I talking about? Oh yea, the room.

I sit down. It's 11:00 now, how the fuck did that happen? I realize it's my first time alone, with semi-assurance of non-interruption (am I using too many hyphenated thingys?) (did I spell ""thingys"" right?) I re-read what I just wrote to remember what I was talking about. I close one eye. I realize that I haven't had sex or beat-off in like 5 days since the to-be-in-laws arrived and decide to correct that.

The sound of my dog and fiancee going up the stairs scares me. Please PLEASE don't open the door and ask me to massage you right now...I'd love to. You're beautiful. I'm in love with you. I can't wait to marry you in a few days! But damnit, I'm drunk and stoned and just want some me time right now.

By the time I finish the thought and the typing she's gone. 

OK.

My bathroom is off-limits, she'll for sure hear me sneak into the room and the dog will bark. To-be-in-law's (fuck that shit, English needs a concise description for this situation) bathroom it is. What's here...hmmm...some kind of organic arnica cream for muscles, toothpaste, facial cream, soap, organic tea tree something shampoo and conditioner, gold bond....fuck. What am I gonna try and beat off with?

I decide on an Arnica cream and facial cream cocktail.

Doesn't work, hurts like hell, instant regret, seriously hoping I didn't wake anyone when (mid-wank) I hollared and my legs jumped and I knocked off like 5 empty beer bottles that were resting precariously on my desk.

"Decision time: Stay up for an extra day, or sleep a little?","Sleeping a little (which could turn into a lot) may very well destroy any semblance of the normal hours I will need. Staying awake might result in a crash later on. 

I hate it when this time comes. 7:13 AM, and wide awake. If I can stay up 14 more hours, then sleep will sort itself out for Monday about perfectly. If I sleep now or anytime in between, I may find myself in the same position tomorrow, which would be worse than today.

"Too many lights, not enough sleep","I used to work at a observatory over winter and summer break. I would stay up for 8 to 12 hours a night, manning the telescopes, taking data for analysis. I would keep myself awake by reading, watching terrible movies like The Room, watching all of R Kelly's Trapped in a Closet hip-hopera, or just obsessively checking the focus of the images I was taking. Now if I stay up past 1 pm, my body thinks it's observing and won't let me fall asleep. The sad thing is I can't see any stars in this city, so I just stay up all night, looking at the haze created by all the lights until the sun washes them out."
It's been 36 hours since I last slept,"Nothing is really on my mind, I'm just simply not tired. Although the fact that I woke up at Sunday and now it's Tuesday annoys me a bit. Well, not that I have to do anything important in the morning really."
"Well, looks like there's 6 of us here right now. Kinda nice to know. Anyway, gotta wake up at 9:30 tomorrow so fml.",Still can't sleep. Any advice?

My life is a series of things I can't afford.,"I don't make enough money to afford them when I get paid and I don't make enough to save up.

When I do start making more money, my boyfriend, friends, the world, everyone starts asking for more and more from me. 

Isn't the point of making more money, to have more money?"
My body is ruined (NSFW),"When I was a youngin, I wa faaaat, my biggest weigh in was like 298; it was horrifying. (I'm 5'11"".) years later, I'm a flexible 160, but because of the changes in my lifestyle I can't stop myself from loosing weight. 
When I was a teenager, my boobs were goddamn DD's. They were things of beauty, round and huge (never especially perky) Now at 22, I've got boobs I can't tell if they're B's or C's. I hold myself to a high standard of aesthetics, and anything smaller than a D is UN-fucking-acceptable. (For myself at least.) 

A few months ago, my boyfriend and I were having sex in front of a mirror and I had to stop it, because my tits looked like elongated tube socks, stretched thin, worn out from being worm by too-big feet. (Bad foot metaphore, but you catch my drift.) 

There's no where I can go for straight answers on plastic surgery, apparently even asking for information is reason for people to bring out the rotten fruits and veggies. Everything else seems to be biased information from surgeons themselves. I'm incredibley suprised that there's no big web hub with averages and calculated information compiled from across the fifty states and/or the world over. It's impossible to even find average costs for procedures so I can't even decide if I should start saving up or if it's all a big farce and I should give up the ghost and accept my miserable body the way that it fucking is, and die in a corner oblivious to the world around me."
"2:10am, can't get comfortable.",I like how I'll see posts from this sub the next day and by then it's too late to do anything about it.

"Can't Sleep, worried about finding work.","Moved to the other side of the states with my boyfriend for his job, and i haven't been able to find anything. Worried that i'm not contributing anything to the house. Worried that our bills are rising."
Can't sleep because I dwell on the past.,"I, like many of I'm sure, am having trouble sleeping because I keep thinking about my last relationship. I lost my greatest love. 
Tonight, the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup. When they won in 2013, we had just met. He took me to the parade in Chicago and it was the most wonderful time. I'd like to go again this year, but I am torn. I would love more than anything to go with him, but sadly it's been (almost) three months of no contact. And it's not just about going, it's what it all represents, a time when we were happy together. 
I asked a friend to go with me and she is excited about it. I'm afraid that I will find a way to upset myself over it. I am trying to do things I enjoy to feel happy again, but somehow it all just feels like I am trying to replace memories  (which is not my intention, because there were many happy times). But I am also longing for those times with a person who may want nothing to do with me.
Ugh. This was a total pity party, and for that I apologize. Thank you, /r/cantsleep, for letting me rant and drain my thoughts."
My friends are asleep and I didn't know who else to tell...,so I have decided to post on reddit that I had sex in a car today. That's all ✌️
Sleeping Problems,"Hi fellow night owls. I've been having serious problems falling asleep lately. Once I'm asleep, I'm halfway okay but I end up waking up a little bit later or wake up exhausted and miserable. Like breaking down in tears miserable.

Tonight, boyfriend and I had a fight and he's sleeping on the couch. So I'm in a shit mood because of that anyway, but I was also secretly excited to sleep alone for the first time since we moved in together. (Terrible, I know.) 

I tried to relax for a bit and laid in bed watching a movie and finally felt a pang of sleepiness and decided to take advantage. An hour later, unconsciousness finally overtook me. Then I had a nightmare and here I am again.

I'm half tempted to break off a piece of boyfriend's Seroquel but last time I had half of one, I had an anxiety attack and was groggy the entire next day. I'm out of melatonin and don't know what else to do. I have two days worth of family funerals so I need to be on my A game, but my toes are curling in frustration. I've also learned through this ordeal that I actually feel a lot more at ease sleeping with the boyfriend, but I can't wake him up now as the Seroquel kicked in for him an hour ago.

Just looking for advice for tonight and the future. I'm a bit nervous about sleeping pills (Ambien and the like) because side effects. I just want a fucking constant restful night of sleep. If it matters, I suffer from depression and have been having conversations with my doc about possibly being treated for bipolar. 

I'm tired and angry and anxious and just want to sleep. :( Help."
"It's 1:18, I'm wide awake, and I have work tomorrow...",... but I'm too buzzed from having finally seen Maroon 5 live after 10 years of being a fan to fall asleep!
argh sleep just isnt working,"My mind is scattered and I can't seem to gather my thoughts. It's 340am, I tried to lay down hours ago and nothing works. I SHOULD be tired by now and just drift off to la la land.. But it just seems like it's not in the cards this time :("
4:06 AM and i have an important test in 3 hours,I hate my life
"Gotta wake up at 6:00 am, it's 3:38 am..","Got an electronics 2 final exam at 12 pm tomorrow, need to wake up at 6 to review with a friend, I'm fucking terrified of the exam, what the fuck do I do I'm not ready shit I'm fucked"
"How things change...(just talking to myself, but you can listen)","I remember just 4 years ago I was young...I don't feel young anymore. This girl just the other day (attractive, energetic) starts telling me about her night on 6th Street. Basically Austin's version of Bourbon Street. Picture college kids celebrating being young and stupid every day of the week in 100 bars crammed on a single stretch of testosterone and piss infused asphalt and concrete. Yea, so this girl tells me how much fun it was...all I can think about is how dumb it is. But here's the thing man, I was there making that shit happen and eating it up just 4 years ago in LA. No hangovers...could drink and butt heads with other assholes like me (4 years ago me) with the best of em. As she tells me about her night I sigh and recommend a few craft beer bars and some good live music joints when she starts laughing. ""I don't want to go to and old guy place...hehehheee."" Fuck. I'm old. 

Don't really care all that much what one 21 year old's opinion is...that's not what really affected me. But it was the spark that ignited the thought that became the feeling that's currently washing over me. Thing just change man. You just wake one day and realize you're different. It's not good, it's not bad. It just is. 

So much is different for me. Back then I was in the Coast Guard, in super shape and rolling in money. I had no debts and a cheep car, I spent liberally on video games and my gaming pc. On sushi, women, and mango sticky rice twice a week when I got home from duty. I didn't give a fuck. 15k sitting in my checking account just begging to blown and that money was guaranteed by Uncle Sam. Now here I am just proud I saved up enough to buy Witcher 3. I'll be playing it tomorrow on my Craigslist POS PC. A rig I literally pieced together one broken component at a time. I'm am amateur solderer/tinkerer with electronics (I fucking fix broken shit cause it's easy to me but I don't what that skill is called) and bought and repaired a bunch of college dude's broken nonsense to make a gaming rig on the cheap. 

Ranting...get's away from you. Point is, man, shit just changes. You just wake up and look in the mirror and you're different. It's not not bad or good for me. I just see what see and am what I am. I did what I could with what I had and I'm still doing it. Now I'm getting married and have a dog...and no money. haha. I traded them out. That part was worth it. Way worth it.

If you read this at all I guess all I really have to say to you, all I really give a shit about from your end, is....I don't fucking know. How would you end that sentence? I don't know what to say to you. shit just gets weird. One moment you're drinking Petron and sake with the sushi chefs twice a week cause you're loaded and frequent there too much and the next you're counting dimes and sipping Lone Star beer with your fiancee and new dog. I didn't lose anything, shit just shifted. The only real guy that takes the fall is your gaming rig. Your shit. The dumb things you think care about in a moment and time just let's you know how dumb they are. 

But dumb things are missed too...especially beautifully dumb things. Like being 21 and knowing Witcher 2 is coming out soon and blowing 6k on a PC just for that game. That beautiful moment when you realize just how awesomely dumb that is and that's it's ok. That you have the money and you earned it. And now I don't, now I compromise. I traded those things so I could devote myself to this girl. Cause what she gives back isn't beautifully dumb...it's a lot more. Waking up to another human that looks you right in the eye and says ""I love you."" with the kind of sincerity that assures you she'll wipe your ass if you can't. With kind of love that allows you to entertain the possibility that you might be wiping hers and that's ok. With the kind of love that makes you WANT to get up, even after the games are boring. Man, that shit's a worthy trade.

And now you see...I'm a sappy old fuck and I'm not even 28 yet. How things change."
At the crossroads....,Tried to go to sleep hours ago and now the sun is up and I have to be somewhere in 4 hours. The question is: do I catch a couple hours as a nap or just stay awake? Insomnia is the worst.

Can't sleep because I'm thinking about not sleeping!,"What do you do when this happens? You close your eyes and try to fall asleep. Then you get really close to falling asleep, and you think ""YES, I'm falling asleep now"". At that EXACT moment, the fact that you're realizing you're falling asleep keeps you awake and then you can't go to sleep. This cycle continues for 4 hours until you fall asleep somehow. Happens to me on the daily. "

Actual sleep aids,"So this sub is apparently dead based off other comments but I'm going to try to start something helpful for this page. After staring at me ceiling with my mind racing for 3 and a half hours, I decided to see if this sub existed and to see if I could get some help with falling asleep. No such thread exists from what I can find. Here is where you guys come in: we all know you can drink yourself into a coma, but that's not very helpful for getting up the next day. Here is where you can post actual effective ways to help fall asleep. It can be something natural, some pre-sleep activity, relaxing music/audio, anything that can help."
Can't Sleep,"I've been watching the hand for hours.

It slithers down my window trying to invite itself in.

It's a she, a he, both, doesn't matter, it wants to kill me.

But now its trying to get in. 

Its in.

Its near me.

Its breathing.

Its shaking.

It hurts me.

It haunts me.

HEAR MY STORY pt. 1,"Hi, you can obviously see my screen name, but this is a story about SWIM and the other person Rasta
Swim was a nervous 14 year old boy when he met rasta, very timid, shy, and just totally shy. He was a wreck. But one day after smoking points with his friends he met Rasta and they got to talking, Rasta developed a crush on SWIM, but SWIM didn't realize that. One day SWIM messaged Rasta and they got to know each other and that went on eventually to them getting together. Rasta was experienced but SWIM was new, he did his first everything with her, from an actual serious kiss, to sex, and eventually SWIM and rasta found out Rasta was pregnant. Swim only had sex with Rasta once, maybe 3 times by the time she found on she was pregnant and didn't announce it Until Rasta ""found.out ""3 months later. After a year and a half of.being with Rasta he decided to spend a summer at Rastas house to help watch their child, and because Swims father wouldn't let Swim stay due to fear of corruption and wanted to finish raising SWIM though his father let Swim visit during the week and stay the weekend. But During that summer Swim and Rasta went through arguments, Rasta pushed Swim away. Would never let Swim hold or kiss her, or even hug Rasta occasionally. Along.all that time Rasta also came up with lies saying that swim had to come complete certain tasks or a voodoo medium would make it so that Rasta never believed they dated and that Swim and Rasta only had a one.night stand but worked things out.and.stuck around each other to watch their.son, but.Rasta would supposedly believe that she wasn't dating swim, that rasta would be dating someone else. So Swim believed her, completed rastas ""tasks"" turned on his friends, his family, and everyone around him for Rasta. He loved her, but.one day a girl spoke to swim, saying he deserved better than that. That she wished she could.hug.swim, so swim felt.better, he'd talk.to that girl always, and eventually it turned into him flirting with 3 other girls, Rasta found.out, and said She was.destroyed, that Swim ignored.her and rasta knew something was going.on, even though previously swim found her sexting.other men. Swim was crushed, and rasta said they were.never going.to have sex, it just.made her.feel.better, though while swim worked until 12 at.night, rasta was.alone, and spent.time.with the boy. But after rasta broke.up with swim, swim hacked into her things, found.out she was flirting with all his friends, and sent.one.a nude while they were.dating, and Swims friends even.told.people that they were.going.to chill with rasta that theyd been flirting. Swim found that rasta was doing this before she left him, and still to this day. Swim admits, he flirted With other.women, but after his separation from Rasta. Swim eeventually got back.with rasta, and rasta would break up with swim.and get.back with him once he started moving on. But then swim just.got.tired of it all and couldn't handle rastas pressure anymore and split.from her and wants.to see his son. Rasta proclaimed that her actions were from all the voodoo and if she'd burn a book everything would.be okay. Swim then didn't believe rasta at all. Rasta would call and.call and call begging.swim for a chance. Swim eventually fell for the peer pressure and got with rasta. Things felt normal again, and swim had his family back. But it just didn't seem right to swim so He told rasta the truth, and went solo to find himself, nothing was the.same to swim, he just couldn't handle rastas pressure anymore.
Now again Rasta is calling his phone, texts swim all day begging swim for his attention "

It sounds strange and irrational I know. Because if you were even close to dying one of those nights, you would've eventually woken up in the ER, with an IV needle sticking out of your arm right? But what if you weren't close to dying. What if you DID die. And all of this, what you perceive as reality, is the so called ""afterlife"". I can honestly recall the exact night I blacked out that might have resulted in my death. Since that night, my life has felt...different. "

But I'm always afraid she's seeing or talking to someone else. I even check facebook like a million times a day to see if she's been on and ignoring my texts or she's just busy. I know that sounds bad. Like really bad. Like clingy. And I swear I'm not that type. But I think this is what's causing me not to sleep. I guess I just needed some closure over the Internet.

Not being able to sleep + weird dreams,"Hey all, first time posting here. I've had a sleep disorder (not being able to sleep) for about 3 years. I've taken Mellatonin and it has worked wonders. Lately, I haven't been taking Mellatonin and I have trouble sleeping. I would have my eyes closed from 45mins-1hr and I would fall into this unnatural feeling of sleep. I would be playing starcraft 2 HoTS like I'm in front of my computer screen playing the game. I'm able to intentionally wake up during these dreams and when I would go bad to bed, boom, playing starcraft exactly where I left off. That's not the weird part, the weird part is that these dreams usually last 4hrs, and in the dream, it feels like every hour is an hour in real life.

I turned all the lights off, but found myself feeling really scared that an intruder was going to get in and kidnap or rape me, so I turned one lamp on. I finally did manage to fall asleep at 1:30 despite my edginess and paranoia, but then at 2am, someone opened my door, said ""sorry,"" and then closed it. I swear this happened and I didn't imagine it. It was a girl's voice, so it must have been one of my female housemates. I don't know them very well yet and didn't see the person's face. However, I don't see why either of the two girls on my floor should have had any reason to open my door. They know it's my room and not the toilet! I have now locked my door, and I'm more pissed off and embarrassed (I sleep in my underwear and my room is a mess) than scared. I intend to leave a message on the house whiteboard first thing in the morning demanding an explanation for such behaviour. For now, though, being a combination of pissed off, panicky, and mortified is preventing me from getting to sleep, and I have to be up in 5 hours for a singing lesson. :( Someone help me get to sleep, please...

tl;dr: Panicky, pissed off, paranoid and mortified due to a combination of reading too much depressing shit on the Internet and being woken up after half an hour of sleep by a mystery person opening my door, apologising, and shutting it again. Please help me stop panicking and get to sleep!"

Nightmares are beautiful,"As I lay here in the dark im bridged between being awake and asleep,  I know I wont remember falling asleep. Ill see darkness, not that cloud passing over the sun, dimming the light, or even the darkness of night but that cold lonely deep voided darkness akin to what drifting through space would be like. I hate that darkness, the dreamless void, because in the end I know some dream happened but I can't remember it.  Thats why I like nightmares. Its rare I have them,  those terror filled moments when im trapped in my own head for time I can't determine,  not a void but a horror show.  Being chased by an unseen force,  or worse whatever my mind can twist up that night. I have a personal preference for my nightmares. I have a recurring nightmare with the ocean swallowing me alive,  the tides seeming to throw me into the air sending blade like vines shooting into me. I feel all of it but thinking on it now I miss it. See my nightmares are the only things I remember,  those beautiful heart stopping horrific nightmares. I hope when I wake up,  maybe just maybe it'll be with a scream trapped in my chest and a few beads of sweat running down my face.  I may even give a slight smile"

How can I get over my fear of a certain race of people?,"To exclude defamation I shall not reveal the specific ethnic group so do not ask. 

I do not want to be a racist, but there is one (minority) ethnic group/race that I am paranoid or nervous about, because they are said to crave blood - in fact they are somewhat infamous for it. Some sources state the motive for the ritual torture/cannibalism was revenge for mis-treatment and persecution, others state a medical cause. The victim was always an 'outsider', and a stranger (they selected a random person they could capture).

This is a minority ethnic group, but there have been at least 150 established cases of them luring and preying on people in this manner, since the 10th Century. What was left of the (blood-drained) bodies was discovered, and the murderer(s) confessed.The aspect which disturbed me the most was the fact that these people would pretend to be trustworthy, and lure people (often children) into their homes where they were never seen again. Cases of this still happen though not often. There is a town in Russia that has a high population of these people, and 3 years ago 5 missing children's bodies were discovered full of holes and slits - their bodies had been drained of blood. I live near this town.

So as you may tell I have a problem trusting these people, I am naturally paranoid, but I really do not want to be racist, how can I not feel bad around these people? I wish I did not watch this documentary which concerned this phenomenon, and also included a (realistic and gory) re-construction of a little boy being killed via exsanguination (after having his throat cut) followed by having his blood drip into a basin to be drunk."

Most terrifying dream I've had,"It started out as a going away party for my band teacher and a couple random people like a girl I used to play softball with. And I don't remember everything, it was afterwards and I was back in my house with older brother and my parents. And there were heroin addicts that shot up my house and I watched my mom and dad. My brother got away so I went to try and find him, I found him hanging off a billboard about to commit suicide. Then I watched him fall. I tried so hard to call 911 and I couldn't. I tried to run away from my house and I went into the woods and I woke up and sat still for what seemed like forever, just sweating before I grabbed my phone to text my brother.

I have also been on melatonim for time on and i didn't really find it was working either. Ive tried a few things but i would rather have a method to fall asleep. also any tips and tricks will be great. 

This is my second problem, When i manage to fall asleep at about 1am i find it very hard to wake up, i dont have a great time in school i usually find it hard to concentrate and tend to misbehave. all that and when i wake up i just sit there i just lie in my bed like i just did and feel sorry formyself its like im in another world cause i dont think straight. i usually dont open my eyes either and my mum tends to get annoyed at me. and i occasionally swear. what i want to be able to do would be come home from school play 2 hours  of computer games 4-6 then dinner 30 min, go out on my unicycle for 30 min do work out abit do homework go to bed. any advice is appreciated.

Your best sleep related story,"Here's my best story. I pretty regularly talk in my sleep and occasionally punch myself or a wall. This night was pretty extreme. I bow hunt for deer and I have my bow hanging on the wall behind my bed (this was when I was younger and still lived with my parents). I wake up around 4am clutching my bow across my chest. I was extremely confused and a little scared. I sat my bow in the floor and went back to sleep. When I awoke in the morning I tried to figure out what happened. I have my bow hanging on a dry wall hook that's rated to hold 80lbs. I had somehow reached back and ripped the entire hook from the wall holding the bow. This kinda scared me for a while and I began setting up a trail cam that takes pictures when it detects movement. I found out that every night I flail my arms around and just do weird things. 

Tl;DR: was sleeping, pulled compact bow from drywall, held it while sleeping. "

I turn of electronics, close doors, pitch black. I even cuddle with my toy Narwhal. It takes me usually a half hour to an hour of this to fall asleep and when I do, I wake up in the middle of the night.

This is really starting to kill me!!! Can anyone help?"
I couldn't sleep last night so I decided to doodle. Here is the outcome,
Strange glow-in-the-dark lines on my wall.,"Well, I've gone and scared myself sleepless by reading that UFO sightings/abductions askreddit thread. While I realize most of the stories are probably made up, or have plausable explanations, some of them still freaked me out.

But I spent the rest of the night watching videos, listening to music and I got it out of my system. I'd actually managed to lay in bed an hour, and honestly while the stories shook my nerves, I wasn't going to lose sleep over them. 

Until I noticed a grouping of lines on the wall above my dresser. I keep a whole bunch of crap ontop of my dresser - photos, mugs, ect. I have a few glow in the dark objects so I didn't think much of them at first. At first, I thought it was just some ambient light coming from outside, so I shifted my curtains to make sure there was no light coming through.

The lines didn't leave, and I was sure they were something glow in-the-dark. I couldn't fathom what object might be causing this, so I turn on my bedside lamp, and am startled to find there is no object there, it's just wall. My walls are a plain, light blue. Nothing special about them.

I turn off the lamp, but I can't ignore the lines. I put on my glasses, and they're still there, clearer this time. I finally get up close, and this is definitly no illusion. As I walked past, I thought it was a reflection, like a mirror, because as I moved the lines shifted. I wave my hand infront of them - no shadow. I turn on the lights, illuminating my entire room, and they dissapear. Definitally glow in the dark. I turn off my lights again and they reappear. I touch them, and get up close, and for a split second I think I can make out some kind of symbol.

That's when I freak out. Why are there glowing lines on the wall in my room? And is it actually writing? Keep in mind, my nerves have already been shaken by the UFO thread, and this just brings it to a whole new level.

So I turn on every light in the basement, I slip on pants, and I pace around with my heart pounding. I'm too scared to make my room dark again to examine the lines. Instead, I've turned on my computer, put on some music. The invisible lines are behind me right now. The rest of my family is asleep, and while I've sent texts crying help to my brother, he has school tomorrow and has probably turned off his phone. I will most likely not be sleeping tonight, because of those goddamned lines. I hope they're still there tomorrow so I can examine them.

While I realise my fear is probably irrational, that doesn't change the fact that I'm jumping at every strange noise (there's alot of that in basements) and my heart is pounding. And that is why I can't sleep."

"Future, hopes, dreams, and snoring, heavy snoring...","Nights like this always come and go, but have never left for a long period of time. I have worked hard in school, and I'm on track to getting into my career field I want. When thoughts of her rile up in my mind, I feel at a complete loss. I get to that point where I see her in my bed. Images of her walking around my room... I know it's been a very long time, but her ghost haunts me so(cliché,I know). I want to sleep, I want to dream of things that can't happen, I'd prefer the horrid nightmares to this. I Doubt I'll sleep tonight, but alas that is my burden. 

So it isn't just the horrible thoughts of her that keep me from my restful(somewhat) slumber. I have this insatiable want , to leave everything I've worked for, and ride off somewhere. I know the career field is what I want, but can I measure up to it? I don't know. I have the skills, I have the knowledge, and I have the power... But do I want to, I really do. Ive thought about leaving this in the dust and riding my bicycle to somewhere in the middle of nowhere, and leaving all of these people. Working in a farm, making friends with genuine people, hard working people. Leaving Los Angeles would be nice, I guess.

Now that the whole mental distress has been poorly written out, there is one more thing keeping me from sleeping. I sleep in a two bedroom apartment, and I share a room with my grandmother. She snores as if she was trying to warn the moon that there is a chance it might get hit by a meteorite sometime soon. I tried talking a walk, I smoked a cigarette, I meditated, and I even took some Nyquil. 

I don't know, but this night is either going to be productive and long, or unproductive, and long. Anyway, I ranted. Thanks for reading.

i cannot sleep. help,"I cannot sleep at night. I have not slept in two days and im it sucks. I am starting to see things moving that shouldn't be moving. I have tried focusing on my breathing, my SO breathing, listening to ""white noise"", relaxing music (nature noise apps), counting, sleeping medicine. I have no problems with a wondering mind. I just eNt to sleep"
graveyard messes with my sleep,"I work 12 hour night shifts 4/3 days a week.. and on my days off, I can't sleep. Anyone else?"

I found a dead subreddit and decided to post to it.,"Yeah, I can't sleep."
My mind races ,"My mind always races at night. Usually about girls. Keeps me up, even though I know it shouldn't. What do you guys/girls think about when you can't sleep? "
Finals in 4 hours...,I have finals in 4 hours and finally started using my reddit account about 3hours ago.....shit.
"Wow, I got lucky...","I blindly came here hoping there'd be other redditors awake. I just guessed that it was a subreddit.. So, reddit, what is keeping you up right now? For me, it's thoughts of my ex-girlfriend. Things ended..weirdly. It's been months, but we were still talking and today things went to shit and I can't stop replaying it in my head, trying to think of things I could've done differently.

How about you?"
Because I'll sleep when I'm dead!,"Just kidding, I have no idea why I can't fall asleep. "
So damn hungry for some reason.,"It's 2:15AM.
I gotta be up by 9/10AM to shower, etc, and leave the house by 11AM to walk and get to the mall by noon to meet up with my friend.

I wanted to be asleep three hours ago, but I'm so fracking hungry even though I ate a lot at dinner and had a sandwich a few hours ago.

I can't sleep because I'm too damn hungry.  Dammit!"
Does anybody else have a racing mind?,I have had this issue since i came home from deployment and I'm getting sick of it! It's causing me to not sleep even if I do take medication. Does anyone else have the same troubles? 
Wanna know what keeps me up at night?,Coffee
Can't sleep,"Hi all,

I am a lover of sleep and a damn good insomniac.  I lost my job today and I am just trying to keep myself together so I can get another job and keep living.  I've been playing the day in my head and I wish I had told my previous employer two things.  One that individuals in my group were using travel expenses to obtain gift cards for free food over the weekend and that their timing sucks.  My best friend's mom's funeral was Sunday and they fired me Monday.  I was numb from the other day and all the driving I did, they sit me down and now it's Tuesday and I need to sleep and stay productive.  I feel better writing about it.  Thanks to the OP for creating the subreddit I am off to attempt sleep before I meet with unemployment tomorrow.  If anything else can't sleep and can provide me with any advise, I recently moved to mass and am completely ignorant about the next steps to take.  I am researching what can be done, but it's the blind leading the blind."
My dog is an asshat.,"It's 3:26am and I can't sleep because my dog (half chihuahua) decided to stretch his paws into my ribs.
Now that may seem insignificant unless you understood that on my ribs are these little bumps that, if pressed, causes pain in all of my joints and in this case, just enough that sleeping or finding a comfortable position to lay in, is damn near impossible.
So now I'm awake and my dog is happly snoozing in my bed, undery covers.  :-C"
I hate my job. Nuff said.,Never ever work in a public (un)employment office. I get abused by dodgy welfare recipients about twice weekly at a minimum.
"I've been up since 3, it's now 5. Upset stomach due to crappy supper.","Not too sure if it's a first-world-problem or just sucky circumstances. I've tried reading, walking around a bit, having a snack, nothing. I just can't get back to sleep.  
Might as well browse reddit. "
"Can't fall asleep, maybe it's jet-lag, maybe it's my crazy relationship....","So, I just got back from a trip a week or so ago. So maybe that is why (was on the other side of the world). But I can't stop thinking about my relationship. My SO is super busy, and after getting back together (we've been on and off for a while) we've hardly talked at all. We talked more while I was away than since I've been back it seems. And I just don't know what to make of it. I can't seem to shut my brain off long enough for sleep to even have a chance to take over....


Edit: well overanalyzing the relationship was warranted. He broke it off the next morning.... Better to know I guess..."
"I can't sleep and dont know why, maybe it's the cigs?",
Emotionally demanding job + mental health issues = nosleep. ,"I personally can't sleep because... 
1) I work in a battered woman's shelter in crazy shifts, ranging from 8 hours to 26. When I get home, I crash. 
2) I then end up sleeping too much during the day. 
3) I have a lot of anxiety, was diagnosed with a depressive disorder when I was younger, so I just replay every little problem in my head over and over and over. I feel uncomfortable taking pills to help out because my fiancee usually criticizes me for taking them. 
4) I'm applying for a new job, which requires a drug test, so I can't use marijuana as a sleep aid any more. 

Anyone else with similar experiences? "
