Please be wary of people asking for donations. We have a scammer that makes their rounds every so often and she's duped a few of you.,"A day or two ago a post popped up by a girl claiming she was incredibly ill, bedridden, and that her boyfriend had tampered with her birth control. She claimed she needed an abortion. 

You wonderful, helpful people tried to direct her to abortion funds, hotlines, anything that could help. She said she wasn't eligible for any of it... so people started offering money and asked her to set up a gofundme.

While this is all very sweet, if any of you gave her money, you got scammed hard. There is at least one (maybe more) user that goes around posting variations of this story to /r/twoxchromosomes, /r/childfree, /r/assistance and offmychest to get money out of nice people. The mods of these 4 subreddits exchange info and warn each other when she's active so we can be on the lookout. She had posted a different sob story to /r/TwoXChromosomes two weeks before her offmychest post and I just happened to catch it. 

So I'm asking you all to please report any kind of soliciting for donations directly to the mod team for review. There have been cases where I'm able to verify that the person is telling the truth and is not requesting cash, we'll allow their requests. 


#**Do not offer people money. If they are hungry, direct them to /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza. If they need money or any other assistance, /r/assistance is the way to go. We do not allow crowdfunding in /r/offmychest.**"
Stop blaming your child's teacher for their low grades or shitty behavior,"I am so sick of parents who think it is all their kids teachers fault. Your child is not 3 grade levels behind because of me, nor did I cause them to act like an asshole on the playground. Sorry, but you created them, please take responsibility for them instead of making it my problem. Or better yet, make them take responsibility of their own mistakes.

I am currently messaging back and forth with a mother who thinks its MY fault their child hasn't been bringing home their homework, and is mad because there is a test tomorrow. I post online all the time reminding the parents of things going on in the classroom, including homework assignments.  You like them. Yet some how you didn't know about it? 

&#x200B;

These kinds of parents always seem to expect that the teacher writes down the homework in all 21 kids agendas, places each piece of work they need in all 21 kids book bags, and speaks directly to the parents of all 21 kids every day to communicate the expectations. The reality is, I can tell your kid to do something, but it is up to them whether they actually do it. 

Sorry Susan, its not my fault your kid fucking sucks. "
I GOT 100% ON MY ANATOMY EXAM,"I have been studying my ass off since the start of this semester for this class. I’ve gotten 84% on the first two exams, which were fairly easy. I was absolutely dreading this exam because the main focus was the Anatomy of muscles. I felt terrible taking the test today but I just received my grade and I got 100%! I have no idea how I did it but I’m so thankful. This grade has honestly given me so much motivation to finish the semester strong. I’m so proud of myself!!!"
What my sister will never know,"Tonight was probably the worst St. Patrick’s day I’ve had yet. I was the DD for my younger sister [21F] and her friends. We had plans to go to this club in Detroit. Before we went to the club we stopped at her friends apartment so they could pre-game. My sister was driving at the time because she was sober still and ended up parking in someone’s reserved spot.

Fast forward an hour or so one of her friends gets sloppy drunk and is throwing up outside. I go to check on him and notice my sisters car wasnt there, so I go inside and tell her. Turns out her car had gotten towed by the people who the parking space belonged to. So we all pile into one of her friends car and drive to the tow lot. 

They ended up charging her 380 dollars for her to get her car back. The whole time she is sobbing in the back because she didn’t have the money. By this time the night was pretty much ruined so we asked her friend to give us a ride home. 

On the Way home she is trying to figure out how to pay the money to get her car, and one of her friends dad (who is trying to sleep with her btw) tells her he’ll pay for it, in exchange for a date. Once we get home she tells me she is going to do it and I finally talked her out of it because that’s... well that’s something I never want my little sister to have to ever resort to. 

We moved some money around and finally figured out what to do, so I drove her back to get her car. We split ways and are going to meet at McDonald’s to get some food to make us feel better. While I’m sitting in the McDonald’s parking lot waiting for her I get a phone call from her that she was pulled over and blew a ,074 which is .006 below the legal limit. So she luckily doesn’t get a DUI, but I have to come pick her up because the cop wasn’t going to let her drive her car home.

We had to ditch her car in a liquor store parking lot, and the cop tells us that if we don’t move the car before 7 am the owner will tow it. He gives her a ticket for speeding and then send us on our Way. 

By this point my sister has probably had the worst night of her life and hits a low that I havent seen her hit in a long time. She used to cut herself and I knew it was on her mind. I assured her that I would get her car back and not to worry. She didn’t want to tell our mom because she’d flip, so I told her I’d figure it out. 

I sat up with her until she fell asleep to make sure she didn’t cut, and then bundled up and walked around 8 miles to get her car from the liquor store. She will never know that i walked that far to get her car back. And I don’t want her to. Tonight was horrible for her and I just couldn’t bare it getting any worse. Sorry this is such a long post, but I just needed to get tonight off my chest. 


Edit: thank you so much for the support! Family always comes first in my eyes, and I’d do anything for them. I’m sure she would have done the same for me. And I’m her brother, I forgot to identify my gender in there. Oops ! 

Edit: Also as some of you pointed out she was driving under the influence, which I feel like was partly my fault because I let her take her car home, we had to get it that night tho or the price was going to keep going up. Still inexcusable and I don’t have much sympathy for her receiving a ticket or anything either. But I couldn’t let her get her car towed twice 🤷🏼‍♂️"
My daughter had her first period and I’m terrified,"So a bit of backstory: my exwife and I separated about 9 years ago when my daughter was a year old she’s ten now. Her and I have a terrific relationship and she’s 100% a daddy’s girl.

So last night I was dropping off my daughter with my parents (they take her to school in the mornings I work) and my step dad pulls me aside and told me they were doing laundry and he noticed some napkins with blood on them and a bit on her underwear. It hit me like a bloody Mike Tyson uppercut. My daughter isn’t a baby anymore. I’ve tackled fatherhood pretty well so far but I felt pure terror last night. Like full on dread. I’m so scared of the next few years, I know this is normal and these days were coming but holy fucking Christ on a cracker I wasn’t ready.

She’s my baby girl, my baboo, my little tsunami and thinking about it makes my chest tight.

I just needed this off my chest"
One year sober.,"7th of April this year I’m sober/totally drug free. It’s also one year since I was sent into rehab. Before I was sent into rehab no one gave a shit about me, during rehab everyone started caring, telling me they were there etc. When I was released in September everyone just left again, I was kicked out of my fathers (even though I’m not even old enough to buy my own apartment yet) and forced to move into my aunts. It’s almost the 7th of April and I have no idea what to do, I really feel like I want to celebrate, celebrate the fact that I got myself out of that shit, But no one gives a shit, my parents thinks I’m ridiculous wanting to celebrate something that “I didn’t even struggle to do since the rehab did everything for me”  rehab gave me the tools to help me do it, but I did it, no one else. I want to burst in to tears just thinking about how far I have come, and I wish my parents could see that too, but my progress means nothing to them. "
"It's okay if you don't read, i just want to write it somewhere...","They teach us that love is a pure intense feeling that can't be explained.

But they attempt to dictate how it should be.

&#x200B;

""You're being too much, you're feeling too much."" They say.

""You're not showing enough, you could display more.""

""More.. Less.""

""Less.. More.""

Everyone loves in a different way.

&#x200B;

Love is respecting someone as if they were your family, your religion, your life.

Love is feeling a relief when close to that person, to feel at home.

Love is to be ready to do sacrifices, to die for that person or do whatever it takes for their own good.

Love is gazing at the person when they're not looking and think about how lucky you are to have them.

Love is to smile when they send you a message, even if it's a small simple one, wishing you a good day. Or saying ""I love you.""

&#x200B;

But we learn that we shouldn't flow too much. That we only have to show enough, or when requested.

&#x200B;

My love for you shouldn't be measured or controlled. 

I believe in love, because i feel it. Even though everything tells me it's wrong. I'm wrong.

&#x200B;

I'd kill and die for you, but that's too much for the modern day. 

I'd sacrifice anything and everything just for the sake of your smile. But that's usually seen as a red flag.

Loving is hard.

I can't seem to feel like it's expected.

It looks like i only show more than it should be accepted.

In a different prespective my love is surely a mistake.

For me, it's the purest form of sentiment i've been feeling for a long time now, for the first time.

&#x200B;

But now i'm left here to watch it die. To cut my tongue and hope it doesn't rush the process. 

Just tied to hope, a stupid hope that things will get better.

But i know they won't. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It's okay.

I'll still be loving you even when you no longer hold my hand.

&#x200B;"
My sister kept me from killing myself,"Today is her 10th birthday and that means that for 10 years, I’ve had a constant reason to keep fighting because the thought of hurting her has kept me in line. I now have a wonderful fiancé and my parents have always been incredibly supportive but throughout my teenage years, there were definitely times where without her I honestly don’t  think I would have made it away from the dark thoughts. Thanks for letting me get this one off my chest guys!"
I'm proud of myself for something no one will ever know.,"Last summer, I cut. A lot. I never really cut deep enough to leave more than two scars. Around December, i had a scare where i cut almost deep enough on my leg to put my life in actual danger. On January first, i cut for the last time. I bled onto a small paper, where i had written that i would never written cut again. I cried and cried and i began punching my own arm, but i still haven't cut. it's march now and i sobbed last night when i realized i haven't done more than punch my own arm in three months... i'm so, so happy...  "
2 suicides at my school in one single week.,"I can’t really begin to comprehend this. The first one happened last week. he shot himself in the head in his backyard. before he did it, he texted his friends and told them to come over so they could find his body. i went to his funeral on saturday. My boyfriend, who was acquaintances with the boy, was justifiably upset, but I can’t even begin to imagine how he feels now.  
    The second suicide was this morning. my boyfriend’s best friend’s little brother. although he was friends with his brother, all three of them were the closest friends i’ve ever seen. They were practically like brothers. Took his dad’s gun and shot himself in a secluded part of his neighborhood. When morning came, he was declared missing, until his father found him. It makes me sick to my stomach how devastated my boyfriend is.How does he begin to even comprehend this? How do 2 suicides happen at the same school within one week? How are we going to stop it? The sad part is that we can’t, not completely at least. There is only so much schools can do. When it comes down to it, we never really know what goes on inside a young kid’s mind. 
    And what really sickens me about this whole thing is that people won’t shut up about it on social media. It’s amazing that people are talking about it, but it’s not about the victims. It’s a bunch of “you are not alone”, “you are loved”
bullshit. I know it’s true, and furthermore i know that it is simply people’s way of coping with the situation, but it gets to a point where it’s a fucking bandwagon. Like, “oh everyone else is posting this cute picture and saying this jumble of words, that means i must do it too” i’m totally contradicting myself when i say it, but I can’t help but feel like it is true. 
     How is it that a person can be on this planet, one moment alive and full of blood and bones and light, and the next they cease to exist? It breaks my heart."
Since when was depression cool?,"Fucking tired of people using depression as an aesthetic. No, a caption that says “I wanna die” doesn’t make you look cool, it makes you look like a fucking idiot who has no idea what they’re talking about. Depression is a real fucking disease and it’s not something to just be taken casually. "
I’ve decided I want to stay single.,"I feel like I need to get this off my chest so here I go. My luck with men is terrible, and as far as I can tell, they’re a distraction. Most of the time, people get in relationships and completely forget about themselves, their goals, everything. I understand that there’s so many beautiful relationships out there and so many amazing men in the world, but I have a feeling that’s it’s not my time to date. I’ve learned that people come and go, men can leave you as soon as they want, a relationship can turn toxic, it can be painful. I just turned 20 a couple of months ago, and I feel like these years should be more focused on myself and my goals, on growing as a young woman so that when I actually get in a relationship, I can be mature. There’s so many things I need to work on myself. Now, I’m not sure about other cultures, but in my culture, I’m Hispanic, or maybe at least where I live at, everyone rushes into relationships, gets married or has a kid in their early 20s, and that becomes their life. I don’t want to be like that (no judgement to those who have children and settle down early, those are blessings!) I feel like these years I should focus on me. In this time, guys don’t take anything serious. They have so many options on social media, they don’t value women, some might, but most don’t. I’m not willing to put up with that. I deserve some love from myself first before trying to run into the arms of a man to feed my loneliness, etc. Dating has become too much for this age, no one has manners, everything is casual..so I choose to stay single and date myself for a while. I’m still so young and I’m barely getting to know myself, why not become the best version of myself before getting in a relationship. I wanted a relationship for so long and now, it’s truly the least thing that I want. I want a relationship, but with myself now."
Is it ok to never want children? And I mean NEVER.,"I’m f32 and single.
I would one day like to be married exclusively to one man. 
However I don’t want children. Ever. For a million reasons under the sun, that I don’t want to explain. That I shouldn’t have to explain. It’s my body and my reasons. 
I don’t want children. I think they’re lovely. But they’re not for me; Motherhood is not for me and that’s okay. 
That doesn’t mean my life will be any less fulfilling. 
And I shouldn’t have to argue why or why not. I know what I want, for me. 
I don’t want children. 
I am very happy not being a mom now and it’s not going to change.
That doesn’t meant I can’t still have a traditional monogamous marriage. 

I feel like I’ve hit a roadblock.
Am I alone feeling like this? 
When it comes to dating. I don’t want to feel like I’m going to be talked into wanting children. 
I “will change my mind someday.” 
Someone is eventually going to convince me. 
When I start seeing all my friends having babies, I’ll change my mind. 
My biological clock will start ticking.
Then it’ll be “too late.”
Too late for what? Kids?
Blah. I don’t want them. 
My life can be completely fulfilled with a life with no children and no grandchildren. Can’t you just be a couple? Do you need to breed? Why does there need to be more? 

Am I alone in feeling like this? Why can’t two people just want to be together and not want anything more? 

On top of it all, it feels like what’s the point of reproductive rights if everyone wants us to just have babies anyway? "
Got a potentially life changing promotion,"I am SO excited and also so incredibly nervous about the next few weeks. 

Originally from London, I left in 2016 after my dad died and cutting all ties with the rest of my family (it’s an awful, long story that still causes me a lot of anxiety and depression). I arrived in Canada in March last year and after going from job to job and province to province, I got a job at the pizza place with a red and blue logo. Figured I’d be there a couple months til I found something else.

A few days ago, my manager had some horrible news from his home country, meaning he has to fly home for a few weeks in a couple days. The other manager is dealing with a difficult pregnancy so I’ve been helping out with managerial duties in the last couple weeks and opening/closing etc. 

After a shit show of a shift and finding a lot of things that haven’t been done over the last few weeks that really should have been, I told the franchisee exactly what happened. He told me that he wants me to run the store while the manager is away as the other manager clearly isn’t up to it and if it goes well then he wants me to open his new store for him

This means that he will sponsor me so I can get permanent residency in Canada and stay here forever and never ever have to go back to London if I don’t want to. I can’t believe he would trust me to do this after knowing me only 3 months, but hey - I’m gonna give it everything I have! "
It's not my fault.,"It's not my fault he's manipulative, it's not my fault he's always angry, it's not my fault he can't see everything I do for him, it's not my fault he wont try to be better, it's not my fault he doesn't see my worth. I am worthy, I am good enough, I deserve to be appreciated and I deserve to be loved. "
I'm scared to come out as a transgender,"I'm a 23 years old guy who feels like a woman and have been scared to come out for years... Recently, I talked about it with my two best friends and my wife. All of them had really good reactions and support me. My wife even said she thought I was for a long time, but feared I would isolate myself even more if asked about it. Over the last two weeks, I started telling more people and it's getting easier, but then there's my father. I only met him when I was 17 but he's been really caring since then and I really love him... He knows that I'm bisexual and he stopped being homophobic overnight because he wanted to keep me in his life no matter what... What I fear, though, is that he might not accept this news as easily and I might lose him.  
  
A part of me is saying ""if he leaves, he leaves and it's probably better this way"" but another voice is saying that I could just hide it from him.  
  
I don't want to lose my father but neither do I want to keep living a lie...  
  
I made this account especially for this so it might take some time for me to reply in the comments. Thanks for the opportunity to share all this."
To the person who walked out on their 700 tab last night,"You spent 700 USD and ditched your bill on a busy Saturday night.Thanks. Thanks for not only putting my job in jeopardy, not only making the last 2 hours of my 12 hour shift a complete waste of time, but also for making me feel like an idiot. Who goes to a restaurant, orders the nicest things possible, has someone wait on them hand and foot, and then walks out on their bill? I hope you enjoyed the meal you can’t afford asshole. Not only did I almost lose my job last night but now I have to go into work for another 12 hour shift today, and all I can think about now is that if something goes wrong, I’m going to lose my job. So thank you for that as well man.

Edit: Thank you all for reaching out. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to those of you guys that offered to help cover the tip, that means more then the money itself. Seriously life’s been hard lately and it feels really good to be on the receiving end of some positivity!! So don’t worry you all have done enough.  The guy ended up leaving his real name and number under the reservation... So hopefully something will come of it. Your all awesome thanks again. Also I feel like I should clarify I’m a dude haha"
Stop giving up! Relationships are work!,"For those in relationships that want to leave when things are going fine:

So I’ve been seeing a lot of posts about people ‘falling out of love’ or ‘not feeling it anymore’ and just wanting to leave because they are not happy in a relationship. I know there are some legitimate reasons E.g. abuse and toxic partners etc. But majority of them I don’t get! Why would you try and find someone else when the person could do the same but they chose YOU! Now I’ve only been in a committed relationship for 7 years (married for 3) but I know that after the honeymoon stage relationships are work. They are not about YOU anymore they are about making the other person happy. Stop being selfish and start being selfless. Stop comparing and keeping a scoreboard of who does what/ more. Start communicating productively and stop arguing to win. Listen to understand not to reply. Communication is key. If you find yourself ‘falling out of love’ (I went through this stage too). Stop looking for reasons to! Look at all the positive and good things and just remember why you fell in love with them in the first place. 

It’s okay to argue/bicker/not agree on things. Just be humble about it and move on. 

Rant over. Kind of."
I shower in complete darkness,Okay so I shut the lights off when I shower and have towels laying on the floor in front of the closed door so light can’t come underneath it. I’ve been doing this for so long now I don’t even think of turning on the lights if I shower at another person’s house
Life is about to take a bog turn and I'm shitting myself,"I will try to keep this sweet and short. My boyfriend and I got the opportunity to move to another country and work for an amazing company and I'm so scared and excited. I'm mainly scared because I just turned 20 two days ago and I finished highschool last year and I don't know what I'm doing in my life. I knew I couldn't let this go because it is great opportunity to have better life. I'm trying to appear as if I'm totally fine with the fact that I'm about to leave my life behind and go to the country that I've never been before and start working in a field that I'm not that familiar with. 
But the only thing that's keeping me sane is my boyfriend and I know that we're going to make a great team on our own. 

Thank you for reading this, I know it's not written the best but my mind is a mess."
I think I saved my friend's life and I still can't believe it,"My friend called me and asked me to go out with her to a frat event at a sports bar downtown. She only wanted to go for a little because she told her friends she'd stop by but didn't want to go alone. I said yes because she's done stuff like this for me even though I didn't really want to go out. 

We got to the bar around 12:30 am and it was over at 1:00--we obviously were just stopping by. A lot of people had left by then but I saw another friend, someone who I've always looked up to who's a few years older than me, across the bar. I waved and she seemed really drunk but I didn't think much of it it off since it was so late. She was with some people who I didn't recognize, though, and I knew most of her friends mutually.

My original friend and I went to the bathroom and decided to leave. We were going to go to another bar closer to campus because we had some other friends who were there--we were out anyways so why not. 

We were walking out the door around 12:45 but my really drunk friend caught my eye again. I could see her yelling at someone who worked there and seemed really upset. I told my friend I'd be right back and I just wanted to check on her. I walked up and she was sobbing and trying to find her phone. The manager, it seemed, wouldn't let her go find it. I convinced the lady to let my friends and I look but we couldn't find it anywhere. I then had all my attention on her because she was clearly not okay. She was with this guy who I had never seen before and I asked, ""How do you know \[my friend's name\]""? He said that he had met her that night. She had no attachment to him and didn't ever glance at him. I immediately sobered up (you know how these feelings set in and immediately sober you) and told him to go. He kept saying, ""No, no you go I'm bringing her home."" And at one point got really aggressive and grabbed my arm. I told the bar manager to escort him out since I was not going to let him leave with her. I told my friends to leave since they clearly wanted to go and they left for the other bar we were heading to earlier. 

My friend was not okay. She was screaming at me and crying to get her roommates. At this point the bar was cleared out and they were getting ready to close. It was obvious her roommates were not there. She was completely delusional telling me stories that had nothing to do with what was going on. I couldn't get her upstairs to leave or to come with me. She kept telling me she could uber home but she had no phone and there was no way she could even walk without assistance at this point. She could barely talk. She was sitting on the ground of the bar and wouldn't come with me. I had security get her upstairs and thank god I knew where she lived so I could uber home with her.

She fell asleep in the uber which was the first time she wasn't screaming and swearing at me to go away. 

We go to her house but she didn't have her key. She was yelling at me to go home still but there was no way that I was leaving her outside her locked house with no key and no phone in the middle of a city. She has five roommates but none of them were home as I banged on the door repeatedly. I instagram DM-ed one of her roommates who gave me her number. I called her and told her that \[my friend's name\] wasn't okay and that she was with me. She ran from the bar she was at and helped us inside after waiting for about 30 minutes in the cold. It was around 2am at this point.

We got her inside and in bed and I left her under the watch of her roommate who is a nursing student. 

I got home and couldn't sleep. I was shaking and such a wreck. 

She called me the next morning off of her roommate's phone and told me she thought she had been drugged. She had a few drinks at dinner but nothing to make her that drunk at 1am. She told me that she was playing a game of shuffleboard with two men and another woman at the bar and whoever won would get drinks from the other team. She and the woman won. The men got her drinks. That's all she can remember. When I got there she wasn't even drinking--I never saw her with a drink in her hand. She was that messed up before I even got to her. She was drugged.

She described one of the men which was exactly the guy who was trying to take her home. He had no idea where she lived. She didn't even remember his name. 

All of her roommates thanked me for saving her life. Who knows what could have happened that night. They thought she was with another group of friends who had left hours before I got there.

This has been a reminder to me to keep an eye on your friends at all times. Even at a small sports bar. Don't take drinks from strangers, no matter how nice they are. And step in if you see something that seems wrong or out of place. I don't have any formal training but I saved a life because of a suspicion I had. I'm writing this here to both get this ""off my chest"" and to maybe use this horrible night as a lesson for others.

For some reason I went to that bar at 12:30 with my friend even though I didn't want to. For some reason I caught her right before I left. And I'm so glad I did. "
I just cried at work because I randomly started thinking about how great my girlfriend is,"Backstory: 

I went to a college out of state for three semesters, then decided to move back home and go to my local private college. My second semester there (Fall 2016), I met Paige. Literally the second I laid eyes on her, I was floored. She was absolutely stunning, beautifully done makeup, perfect hair, and she was wearing a Deftones shirt (my all time favorite band). I played it cool though, and refrained from being “that guy.” I was fresh off a relationship where I was cheated on, so I definitely wasn’t in a good place mentally or romantically. I became super close with Paige over the next three semesters. Only one problem, she was dating a loser boyfriend who treated her like garbage, but for whatever reason, she stayed with him. 

After about a year; I realized I didn’t stand a chance, so I started dating a girl I found on tinder, and stayed really close with Paige. I made my new relationship seem perfect on my social media, and when I was with her, but behind closed doors, it fucking sucked. She was so immature and everything I didn’t want in a relationship. 

Flash forward to October 2017, and one of our mutual friends throws a huge Halloween party. I had found out I was cheated on again (lmfao) and was newly single. Paige and I both got incredibly drunk and there was sexual tension so thick you could cut it with a knife, but I held myself back once again because I respected her way too much. And she did the same because she is the most wholesome person and couldn’t cheat on the guy she was dating, even though she was coming to grips with the reality that he sucked. It was still one of my favorite memories of the last few years, because we laughed so much and just enjoyed each other’s company. I also passed out on the kitchen floor and she helped me onto the couch and even tucked me in haha. 

Then, in December, we went to see one of my other favorite bands, Converge. We were right up against the stage, and one of the venue photographers got a picture of us with just the biggest grins on our faces, on top of the world happy. After the show, we smoked in her car, and she said that was one of her favorite nights ever and she gave me a ridiculously long hug.

I continued to be reserved, not flirting or overstepping my bounds, but it was starting to kill me at this point. Not only was she drop dead gorgeous, but she has the most incredible selfless personality, loves the same things as me, has goals and ambitions (going to be a doctor), and is fucking hilarious. I have this one memory from around this time of her bringing me cough drops at school because she knew I was sick. Totally random and not important, but I appreciated the hell out of her for that. 

Finally, in March, her relationship with shitty ex-boyfriend ended. We were at the bar one night with a whole group of friends right after it happened. We ended up going to a table by ourselves and just talking about things for almost three hours, completely in the zone and locked into each other. The next few weeks, we talked nonstop every day and were the closest we’d ever been. We also had a few classes together again and got together to study and hang out all the time. I remember watching American Beauty as a film assignment for a class and barely being able to focus because of her. 

Then, it finally happened. On my 22nd birthday, I went to the bar with my friends. She showed up looking sultry as fuck, dark red lipstick, a beautiful dress, hair done up, etc. and she gave me a Star Wars button down shirt as a gift. That night was all about me and her, and when I went to get in my Uber back home at the end of the night, she gave me a kiss. I literally did not sleep that night because of how fucking stunned and happy I was. 

Fast forward to today, and next month will be one year since the day she kissed me. This relationship is everything I could ever ask for. She does so much for me and appreciates me more than anybody I’ve ever known. We love all of the same things, and never get bored with each other. I still find myself awkwardly staring at her sometimes lol. This weekend we marathon’d the Star Wars movies and ordered pizza and laid in bed all day and it was everything I wanted. She loves all my goofy quirks and weirdness, she’s made me wheeze and cry from laughing so hard, she’s bought me awesome gifts and talks to everybody about me, and most importantly, she’s helped me through some really tough times recently. Over the summer, I had a severe panic attack and was hospitalized and diagnosed with GAD and panic disorder. She has helped me immensely with this, and is such an expert on the topic and went out of her way to look for ways to help me even more. She took my old roommate’s spot in my apartment in January and she turned the whole place from a dumpy bachelor pad into an awesome little place that I love now. Every morning when I get up for work I cant help but stare at her and how gorgeous she is, even when she’s fast asleep, mouthbreathing, and with no makeup on lol. I was having a rough morning at work today, and just the thought of her and how fucking amazing she is, instantly made me well up with tears of happiness and feel a lot better. I cant believe I’ve finally found my person, and what was once a fantasy is now a reality. 

Sorry for writing so much. I always want to tell my story, because I’m still shocked that I’m dating this girl I literally fell in love with at first sight 2.5 years ago lmao. "
summer makes me feel worse,"does anyone get absolutely furious on beautiful days when you feel like shit because you feel even more guilty for wanting to be in bed and waste the day? It’s such a beautiful day today and all I want to do is sulk is bed and i feel horrible about it.

don’t get me wrong, I love the sun.... but spring / summer is hard. "
I bullied the bully today.,"Since the start of school these two guys have technically been bullying me.  They take my stuff, break my pens, put things in my water.  So today when they put a bunch of garbage in my trash I was annoyed.  I had to walk to the other side of the school just to clean out my water bottle and fill it up.  When I got back they were about to put trash in my water when I said “GUYS stop I just refilled it!” And one of them stopped but the other dropped it in.  I was mad.  When he went to go take a drink of his water, I pushed his bottle up and it spilled all over him.  I told him “I told you to stop” and walked out."
Husband moved out last night,"I'm not sure if I'm angry or sad. He's been cheating, he lies, keeps finances from me, he drinks and sexually.. he's not nice, he says really mean things to and about me... last night I asked him if he loved me. He got mad. Packed his shit and left. So here I am. Finally got the kids to bed. So many questions from them today. I love the rotten bastard. I mean he's horrible and I've wanted him gone since he told me he had been cheating... but I also stupidly wanted him to leave her, end it with her, make some grand gesture and fall back in love with me, be kind again, that man I fell hard and fast for. 

I don't even know what to do today. "
i miss my mom,"trigger warning: suicide, mental illnesses

&#x200B;

so about a month and a half ago, my mom died. I'm only 16 and she was only 46. it was extremely hard on me esp bc i can't tell others how she really died. I've been telling people that she slipped on ice and hit her head, but in reality it was a suicide.

basically, it all started with a situation between her and the HOA not providing her an accommodation for a disability. the people who worked for the HOA started to sit outside our house to take pictures for if we ever went to court and harass our family. Over a few years time, this developed extreme paranoia within my mom. Now, there is an online growing community of people who believe in a phenomenon labeled ""gang stalking"". Essentially they think that the government, or whoever wants to stalk them, pays random civilians to help stalk a targeted subject. They pick up on random occurrences that could be deemed as an ""anomaly"", even if they're seemingly normal. for an example, my mom would see pizza delivery cars and would say it was a sign of her being gang-stalked. the worst part about this was the fact that the only way for her to realize that gang stalking wasn't real was to recover from her paranoia, which is a very difficult mental illness to deal with because seeing a therapist and being asked to take medication leads to more paranoia. 

One week, my mom was getting really bad, and before this had only thought that other people were stalking her, but something triggered her to think that I, her own daughter, was working against her in an effort to collect enough evidence to get her arrested. I begged my dad to help me find her a good mental institution to receive the help she needed, but there was nothing he could do bc at this point she thought of my dad as the enemy as well and only trusted her own parents. Later that week, a fight broke out in my house because my mom accused my 14yo brother of reporting information on her to the government to help arrest her, and since there was a lot of yelling our neighbors called the police. When they came, they deemed to situation a little hostile and resolved by saying that my mom should stay the night away from me, my dad, and 2 brothers (the other one is 11) so she went to my grandparents house. The next morning she was supposed to go to a mental institution for a therapy session.

So this next day I wake up and go to school, just to find out it's cancelled due to snow and drive back home. My dad calls and says he's at the hospital w my mom and to stay w my bros all day, but I thought he was only there to get her checked in and such. I stupidly decide to smoke a little weed to get my mind off things, and then an hour later my dad comes back home and says he has something to tell us about my mom. We all come downstairs and he said that while my Nonnie and Grandpa were showering before the therapy appointment, my mom was supposedly showering, but instead wanted to ""run away"" and crawled through the window of the second story of their house. She was in a coma at the hospital. She was announced brain dead a few days later and then let off the machines. I remember screaming until my throat was raw and crying, until eventually I come across the realization that this was a suicide, because there were other windows over grass she could have went out of, or just gone out the door if she truly wanted to get away from her parents. She also had a former suicide attempt that I still have PTSD from on her health records. 

&#x200B;

So that's my story, obviously a lot of summary involved but I just had to get it out. Some of my friends do know the real cause of death but I still can't tell them all the details about it, like how I can't even talk to my grandparents anymore since they could have gotten her help months before the situation even escalated to that level because those were the only people she trusted... 

Anyways I'm still not doing really well from it and to make matters worse I only have about 8 weeks left before all my closest friends who were there w me through the death graduate and I just feel so lost and lonely right now. I want my mom back and I don't want all my friends to leave but I know that's not how the world works and I'll have to pick myself up and start moving on, but for right now I just need to be sad."
I'm done with fake people.,"Ever since I moved to my new city I have made an effort to express myself more. Be more active, friendly, involve myself in activities, etc. I used to live in a small town where everything made sense, but here it's like all the rules have changed. 

&#x200B;

My friend, I'll call her Cameron, moved to my new town before I did and I thought we would connect well. We did, we had a lot in common. Over the summer we got really close and learned a lot about each other. But then as soon as summer ended it was radio silence. We didn't talk in person or over text at all. I thought that was a dick move but I didn't say anything the first time. 

&#x200B;

Over winter break the same thing happened. We talked a lot, but in person afterword she made an effort to ignore me and act like it's completely normal. When this happened I blocked her on everything. I was just so fed up because I recently got out of a relationship and I was going through an emotional shit storm. 

&#x200B;

One of her friends practically forced me to unblock her, so I did, and what do you know? It's the same stuff. Cameron just didn't get it. In a group chat I actively argued about it with her and a different friend of hers. Cameron just gave excuses like ""I'm super busy."" or ""I'm always super tired."" 

&#x200B;

I understand that people are dynamic and that everyone changes, but she thought that it was completely normal to have a deep and great conversation and then just ghost them. Over last week it happened again, and what do you know? The same thing happened *again.* I texted her a few hours ago and she responded to my best friend instead. Because he's my best friend he told me immediately. I'm about to block her once and for all because she's the reason that I can't connect with many other new people who might actually care. I put too much effort into her and I'm done with putting useless energy into people that won't do the same.

dealing with self esteem,"Hi all,
I am a 19 y/o female in college, and I’m just struggling right now.  I’ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety, and sometimes (by sometimes, weeks at a time) it feels like I’ve hit rock bottom.  It’s hard to hold a conversation, to even focus on going to bed or getting out of bed.  It feels like every time I go home, I am bombarded with comments about my weight, my skin, my hair, my attitude, my personality.  I know this sounds cliche, but growing up with constant comments about the way I am hasn’t done anything for my self-esteem.  My father was abusive and cheated on my mom, and sometimes if I do something (act grumpy, or snap at her, or any other number of things), she’ll say I’m acting like my father.  And it hurts, a lot, to be compared to somebody that I despise so much.  To be honest, I hate everything about myself.  I feel awkward in my own skin, and even when I try to change, try to fix these things, I find something else to hate.  It feels like an endless cycle of self worthlessness and I don’t know how to change my way of thinking.  Please keep in mind that I love my mother, and she is not saying these things to be cruel.  She knows I have depression and knows that it’s hard for me sometimes.  I know she says these things because she wants me to care about myself and wants the best for me, because she struggles with a lot of the same things, but it’s hard not to take it personally.  I am not suicidal, or a threat to myself, but there are many times when I wish I didn’t exist, or just want to disappear (or want the world to disappear).  Sorry for the digressions and ramblings, it’s hard to organize my thoughts at times like this .  I would like advice, though, if any of you have some to give.  It’s hard for me to like myself, much less love myself, and triumphing over the hopeless thoughts seems impossible."
"To the guy who went in my bathroom while we were closing,",Thank you for not messing it up like how some people do. I really didn't want to have to reclean them after how busy the day was. Thank you so much.
It was nice.,"We got to speak for a little again... it wasn't much, but it made me happy.
I wish we could talk just a little more though, but I really shouldn't be greedy.
But, I'm thankful."
I’ve just found out my guinea pig has cancer.,"My oldest guinea pig Oscar is five and a half, a good age for a guinea pig. He’s been losing weight for a while even with us syringe feeding him and today he was diagnosed with cancer after losing all his underbelly fur overnight. 

He doesn’t have long left, I know people will say and have said to me they’re only guinea pigs but they are my replacement babies after miscarrying several times and are part of my family. 

His brother Archie, knows something is wrong and won’t leave his side. I have a month or so at best and I’m devastated. I knew it was coming but he and his brother were my first pigs and I love them so much. 

Five is a good age for a guinea pig but it doesn’t feel like long enough. I’m going to spoil him with his favourite treats until I lose him or have to make that decision if he’s in too much pain. I’m not ready. I don’t want to make that decision. I don’t know why I’m posting this but my other half is at work and my friends don’t understand. "
Vent about something that happened earlier about my stepdad.,"(Sorry for bad grammar, typing on the iPhone 4 is shit.) I'm 13, My sister is 5, and my brother is 8. I was just told to clean up the kitchen which wouldn't be that bad, if I ever got a break. So after a bit I got out of bed to see how absolutely wrecked the kitchen was. Every single dish in the house filled the sink, reached the cupboards from the counter, and took all of the room on the table.

Toys, garbage, shoes etc covered the floor, and everything was out of place. I felt angry, because just yesterday I fixed the kitchen from looking like a damn pigstye. So I dragged myself to the sink, told my brother to clean up the table while I cleared out the sink from all of the disgusting food and dishes, and I overhear my step dad having a screaming contest with my 5 year old whiny sister. All I hear is cursing and screaming. My sister is on the floor crying and being the spoiled brat she is about getting dressed up. Obviously now he is furious, I overhear him shout ""gods name in vain"" which is surprising considering he and my mom are very Christian. I also hear something fall, an him nearly losing his voice.

To make matters worse, me and my brother begin to argue about who is doing which chores. He starts telling us to ""SHUT THE FUCK UP!"" and still continues to spaz the fuck out. My brother is crying and my step dad repeatedly tells him to man up. My step dad starts mocking me from something I said earlier In an annoying voice. After some more shit happens, he's about to leave and says, ""I don't know how long I'll be gone for, but this kitchen BETTER be clean when I back."" He then finally leaves.

After a couple minutes, he's back and talking on the phone. The only thing I hear is ""These assholes."" Before mumbling quietly and ending the call. The last thing he says to me is ""This kitchen better be finished and not half assed.""

Just a vent because of how stressed I am with all of these fucking chores and homework every single day. I better get going now, since he's still gone. Cya."
"Crushing on someone else while in a long-term, long-distance committed relationship","Title says it all. I'm in a committed, happy relationship but long distance is hard so I lean on my friends for support. One of them is a guy who, if things had gone differently for me (i.e. I hadn't gotten together with my current SO), I could see myself trying to pursue a relationship with.

I think we click really well and would work well as a couple (theoretically), and I really value him as a person and a friend. A couple weeks ago I had a dream about him as well, and I think what's making this crush more intense than it needs to be is that I've no idea if he would (theoretically) like me back, yknow, thrill of the chase and all that.

This is not a problem because I have no desire to cheat or anything, I'm very much in love with my SO. It's just a crush, but I don't want to have to explain this to my closest friends because they would make a bigger deal of it than necessary. Hence, this sub.

Thank you for reading :) this helped."
"My Dad said he wants DNR. It hurt me to know if his heart stopped, That would be the end of Him. I thought he was selfish then I remembered I'm selfish too & I have to change that for my children.","My Dad is 70, He has some health issues and Lately has been having chest pains. He was scheduled to have an angiogram done on Friday, But this morning the chest pains came back so he had to leave work to come home. My Parent's were getting dressed to go the ER when they both told me that My Dad did not want to be resuscitated If anything happened. I had a what the fuck moment with them and asked why... Then I said nevermind because He's lived his life and has worked so hard, I know he's tired!

 At first I felt he was being selfish because why would he want to leave Me and My Kids, We love him and need him. Then I remembered that I've said i didn't want a blood transfusion or to be resuscitated either, If anything happened to me. I realized I was being selfish by saying those things because my kids are still young and That means I would just leave them if I ever needed a blood transfusion and opted not to get one or if I didn't want to be resuscitated. I don't know why I thought like that, I wasn't even considering my children and I feel so fucking bad about it now! I don't want to leave My Children alone on this Earth while they are still little & Even tho I am not a child anymore, I still feel like a little girl who needs her Dad! 


His chest pain got worse, So I had to call 911. The ambulance came to get him. I'm about to head to the hospital now, I hope and pray everything is okay with Him. If you took the time to read this, Will you please say a prayer for this Reddit stranger and Her family. I appreciate it. Thank you."
I should have known when to stop trying,"This is a very long post, I'm sorry. But i don't have anyone to talk to about this. If you want the details without a lot of filler, skip to the last paragraph. 

  I have a friend that meant a lot to me and I really cared about her, but honestly i think she's been tired of me for at least a year by now.  We were really close, really fast.  We did everything together. At the time, i was moving into my first apartment with my boyfriend and since she was friends with both of us, she moved in with us, too.( For anyone actually reading this sad song, no, This isn't a cheating story. )  it was truly wonderful. We hung out every day, even worked at the same job, and everything was great. I never did consider her my best friend, but she was really one of my favorite people.  
    However, she and my boyfriend ended up not getting along. They would argue constantly about everything. I felt like i was always in the middle of an argument, or even the subject of most. They both liked me a lot and both wanted to spend time with me, but my boyfriend felt like he didn't get enough time with me alone. He also didn't like her sense of humor, which makes sense because admittedly we would both make jokes at his expense. Her jokes ended up going too far and hurting his feelings. I guess this part of the story could go on and on but really that's not what's bothering me. It's just a little backstory.
    After she eventually moved out, there was this disconnect. I felt it all the time, but never said anything, because what if it was just me being socially anxious? She would still come over every few months. When she did come over though, she'd act kind of the same with me. She even seemed to be friends with my bf again. Sometimes It just seemed like she would rather be somewhere else. She wouldn't tell me about things going on in her life, like a friend would. When things would come up, she would say ""oh i forgot to tell you."" Now these things weren't just small everyday things you forget. For example, she met her dad for the first time. 
  Six months after she moved out, I invited her and her boyfriend to hang out at a local event with my boyfriend and i. We had a good time, i thought. But when we were done  hanging out, I saw her post on Instagram. It was a picture of just her boyfriend, talking about the event we went to, but implying that it was just she and him there. Something along the lines of ""at _____  with my favorite person."" That one got to me. I tried to think about it from her point of view, but really she didn't even know about that event and was only there because I said we should all go. 
 After that, months passed and she would only talk to me if i talked to her first. She was nice and did seem like She wanted to be friends, but she never tried to make plans, while i put in all the effort. Slowly it hurt more and more.

Now it's been over a year since she moved out of my apartment. I should add that when she ""moved out"" , that really just means she moved back into her parents house. My boyfriend invited her to celebrate his birthday with us, since she celebrated hers and mine with us. She ended up not showing up and not saying she couldn't go. Just silence. I didn't really know what to think. I just assumed she didn't think she was directly invited because he put the plans in a group and added her to it. ... Well. This week I sent her a link to a 420 event. I said we should go. She responded with a message saying she moved 3 hours away and didn't have a chance to tell me.. She couldn't even send me a message? I know she's been posting to social media, (nothing about moving) but she "" didn't really have time"" to tell me.  I guess i should have listened to myself all along. I really should have given up on her like she gave up on me."
I most likely will get laid off soon,"So, my company got acquired by another big company and the vice president of my company just got forced out. My manager told us that its not good news for our team and that our future in this company is questionable. I found out later that a member of my team got laid off today and i am shocked. After i returned home from work, we got an email saying an HR person was let go. I am pretty sure im next. I'm a programmer and the project my team was doing was for the vice president. I'm feeling really low today and the thought of going through the process of finding a job, interviewing is just exhausting. I have social anxiety and its difficult for me to settle in a new environemnt. I was finally starting to get adjusted to my team. I'm just so sad"
My dad has dementia...,"I haven’t seen my dad in a few years due to him being deported to Pakistan and my siblings and mother being American we stayed here in the states. I’ve kept a good relationship with my dad over WhatsApp throughout the years, and a few months ago he ghosted. Today I got a message from his account on the app and it’s from my cousin saying that my dad has been put into a mental institution in Pakistan due to him having an aggressive form of dementia... The MAN that raised me and my siblings is alone in a country and has no idea where he is or even who he is... idk how to feel right now. I feel sad, angry, and most of all helpless... I have this pit in my stomach, I should’ve said so many things to him and I’ll never get the chance to tell my dad those things now.. I feel lost"
BE BLUNT,"God just please be blunt. You will get so much more stuff you want, if you are blunt . Don’t be me who wasn’t blunt and because of that I lost someone that is amazing and beautiful. So just be blunt and things should be good"
I think I have a lot of hate,"Let me explain. I am pretty depressed, I've actually had some great moments in the past few weeks, I think I am healing. But boy I fucking hate a lot of things, entities, people for ripping through me and abusing me when I was weak. I've become acutely aware of time and how fragile it is, how delicate it is, how deadly it is to lose yourself over years and how recovering from it is a task that seems impossible. I don't find myself sinking into it as much as I did, it doesn't swallow me as much so I am at least still standing despite the abyss. Progress out of this actually feels amazing and God is it nice to have that there as a counterweight against it. My aim through this is to stay human, but there's a lot of hate and resentment. We'll see how it goes"
Fuck my life,Can’t hold a job. Anytime I move I’d rather be anywhere than where I am. Tired of the pressure from my parents to “figure out what I wanna do with my life” I’m only 20 I’m not in a rush. I just don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tired of being compared to my friends that have parents that pay for everything. And I’m tired of my parents bringing up my ex that just got married and they telling me why I’m not where she is. Im actively trying to make changes in my life and find a job that’s decent and I signed up for school in the fall. So idk what to do now. A job would make things so much better. But then they take my truck away for a small mistake and now I don’t have a way to even get to a job. 
I can’t fucking stand my brother.,"He is the youngest and only boy my parents had. And during his childhood, they treated him like a prince. An absolute prince. 

He grew up to flunk college twice (now in his third time around and YES my parents paid every single time), and now has a DUI on his record (and YEP they paid all his legal fees for that one too!). He’s entitled, so selfish it hurts, and with a royal attitude to match. 

He uses their credit cards freely, works at a dead job he considers more important than school because it’s an easy pay cheque that is definitely not a liveable one, which he doesn’t care about because he lives rent free with my parents, and thinks all his faults are everyone ELSES’ problem with him. Because he doesn’t do anything wrong. 

I do hate him. I used to pity him. I used to feel so sorry for him because maybe, just maybe, it wasn’t his fault he was brought up a certain way. But now he’s 24 and has no direction, delusional dreams of being in a band (that he doesn’t even really commit to anyway because it’s too hard), and talking to him is like walking on eggshells because his temper is just unreal. 

It feels embarrassing to me to call him my brother. I come from an extremely dysfunctional family (if you couldn’t tell), and the only thing here keeping me from losing my goddamn mind in this circus of a house is knowing that in a few months I will be moving into an apartment. By myself. Because after living with this bullshit my whole life, I have decided I can NOT live with people. I feel bad about wanting to isolate myself from my family but I know I absolutely need it. I’m finally being put on anti-depressants too so in a few months I will have my own space AND that treatment and therapy I desperately need to work through 27 years of living in this environment. 

I don’t think I can love my brother. I don’t think he wants a relationship with me anyway so really, what am I losing here? 

This felt good to write. Thanks. "
I just want to be with my soulmate,I hate being alone. I can stand on my own two feet and have a rich independent life but I want to share it with someone.
"Thank you for making me not afraid of growing up, my love","

We started dating in March 2017. We don’t know the specific date but we sort of point to the 1st when he confessed to me that he liked me. It was a couple weeks later that I told him the crush was mutual and we “officially” started dating. And even then I knew something was different. 

I’d been in a relationship before and this was entirely different. It was like the world was suddenly in color, everything slowly got more vivid and intense like my senses had been muted for a long, long time. It was so intense I could barely handle it and I turned to him to help me deal with it. And he did help. 

And since I’ve been with him, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of my back. He’s really helped me grow as a person. I used to be so stubborn and close minded and harsh and an emotional time bomb, but now I’m more open to new ideas and more in control of myself. Still stubborn but at least I try to listen, right? That’s what I tell myself. The world is so much easier to deal with. I get excited about things again. I even started using exclamation marks more in texts! That’s how much happier I’ve gotten. And it’s mostly been him. 

I will never, ever forget the feeling of his arms being wrapped around me. I won’t forget the smell of his clothes when I.. heh, borrow them (don’t worry, I always give them back after I’ve sniffed them until the smell is gone and then put my own into them so that he gets to feel the same when I return the clothes). I won’t forget how I can feel my shoulders relax and actively get more loose when he holds me. I won’t forget how often just the thought of him makes me smile and melt. I can really, honestly say that I’m absolutely in love with him. 

He’s my best friend. I can be myself around him without any fear of what he’ll think because I trust him and I know he’ll still love me. I respect him and his boundaries and he respects me and mine. He LISTENS to me and remembers what I say and can so easily cheer me up when I’m upset. He makes me so happy I could cry. I love him so much. 

He’s got a reddit and he knows my username so if he comes across this then, uh. Hi. I love you. There’s nothing else in the world I can say with as much certainty as I can say the phrase “I love you.” You’ve really, truly made me the happiest girl in the world. With you I’m not afraid of growing up even though I mostly have already. Well, personality wise, I guess. With you I’m happy with who I am. With you I’m happy.

Thank you for being in my life. I’m crying as I write this because of how damn happy you make me. You’re the light of my life, my love. Thank you for two years. Here’s to a lifetime more. I love you to the moon and back. "
Please stay home from work when you’re sick.,"I know it’s difficult sometimes. You’ve gotta work to get money, to pay those bills, and I understand. But please, if you have the flu or some kind of serious sickness, don’t come to work. My immune system can’t handle all the extra times I’ve gotten sick this year, and I’m  pregnant now. I’m scared enough when I’m healthy, for this pregnancy. I’ve gotten sick, bedridden sick, 6 times in the past 5 months I started working at my workplace. I haven’t gotten sick that many times in the past couple years. 

So just, rest please. I look like an asshole when I have to call in because I can’t suffer through being sick like you guys can "
Online reliance for turning in assignments is the dumbest things,"Hi, i'm a senior this year (M18) and i haven't been doing the hottest in terms of grades, senioritis, having dental issues, etc. it's all been my fault, and i own to that, and i have been really trying to get my grades back up so i am able to graduate, BUT my history teacher has us do these videos once every 2 weeks, the videos are easy enough, but the only problem is that it is all online, and recently i had been turning in the videos (they are a big grade) and sharing the videos and documents with my teacher, but i fucked it up somehow because the way i have to submit my videos are so goddamn complicated i forget how to do it and have to wing it, so i've gotten a 0 on my video, lowering it down to a 52, i'm very frustrated because i wish i could just do it all on paper, but my handwriting is so bad she refuses to accept any papers i turn in, the organization is a mess, and it just pisses me off, i plan on talking to the guidance counselor about all of this because i did the work I DID THE WORK i don't deserve to get a 0 because i wasn't able to turn in it on a piece of paper like a normal student "
Found my school bully by posting nudes,"When I was in school, I was bullied by a big group of boys, but one of these guys was so much worse than the others. He bullied me for being fat, constantly teased me and made me question my life. I hated myself so much because of him. He made many people turn against me, and whenever people showed interest in me, he bullied them too. 

Recently, I started posting nudes to BBW subreddits because why the heck not, but always covered my face. On my posts, if I get a particularly nice direct message I will look at their post history just to be nosy. One of these messages was just like any other and decided to have a browse. Right as I clicked on his username a selfie came up. I recognised him straight away. I was actually shocked. I thought he must have figured out who I was, so I messaged back. We messaged back and forth until I decided he didn't know who I was. He ended up telling me he always liked big girls, and didn't like being intimate with skinny women... but from facebook all I can see from his exes is skinny... skinny... skinny... Lmao

It's been a while now, he messages and comments on my pictures a lot. I don't want to damage this guys life or anything so I'm keeping it to myself, but it is pretty funny to me and a good laugh when I need it. "
I'm a bad person and idk how to stop it,"I was throwing away some old papers and it reminded me of these friendships that I have ended. I read a little note this one friend had written on my notebook, and it hurt so much.   
This particular friendship I ended because he liked me in a certain way, and I didn't recriprocate. That's reasonable, right? Except it took me 3 months to end it. And in the process, I used him to try to fill the void from my broken heart. While I always made it clear with words that it wasn't going to happen, I now see that my actions didn't back it up. Back then, I thought he was just disrespectful for insisting on asking me out when I had already said no. Now I see why I gave him that impression.  
I cheated on my ex. I didn't see that as cheating back then. I didn't think he would be hurt either, since he had cheated on me multiple times and I had already broken up. I thought that breaking up would be enough, and that I didn't have to keep him updated on my dates since we weren't dating anymore. But while we broke up on words, everything else remained the same. I was still telling him I loved him, going to his house, it was a word break up. Again, my actions didn't add up.   
I'm trying to be more consistent on my actions and words. I have ended a lot of ambiguous friendships, some in a very abrupt and awful way. I regret it all. But I'm sure everyone is better off without me.    
I was being a toxic piece of shit for so long and I didn't even realize it. Wtf is wrong with me? I'm so tired of myself. I don't feel confident enough to make any new friendships. I might try, but I'll probably hurt them and be a piece of shit. I have done so many shitty things. I don't think I can really explain everything. I can't even begin to put on paper all the mistakes that I have done. It's too much.   
It hurts to realize you're the bad guy. I'm trying but the truth is, idk what to do with this info"
We’re too young for this,I planned and planned throughout high school how I was going to prepare for college and get everything out of the way so I wouldn’t have to stress over it and time flew by and everyone knows where they’re going and hat they’ll be happy and I feel so stuck. My grades were great and I’m still working hard but this semester has been so hard and I feel so stupid all the time. I feel like I won’t be happy anywhere I go and the last thing I want to do is stay home. I know this is so negative but I want to give up.
Needing to rant plus get this off my chest,"I have been in this relationship for 3 years now and its dead. No romance, no intimacy.. nothing pretty much. The worst part is we just signed a lease for an apartment. We are getting our own place and I hate to say it but its not what i want. I wanted to get a two bedroom so i could have my own space but due to money and whatnot we have a one bedroom place.   


With that being said, I do want to throw some good things in there. I moved away from an abusive situation and find a place to stay, this was May 2017. October of 2017 I moved in with him. In the beginning it was everything i wanted and what i thought i needed. Slowly our relationship has died and its a one way street. I give and give but receive nothing in return. I dont even get gifts for my birthday or Christmas. Not even a little card. This isnt how it should be, at least not to me.   


I tried to end this relationship but he always does something crazy or makes promises he doesnt keep. Which i have found out he is a liar and doesnt keep any promises. He broke up with me a few months ago and tried to hang himself after I told him maybe we just need to be separated, go on our own ways. However, I am used to this kind of abuse. My mother has done this to me since i can remember.   


He is controlling, manipulative and a narcissist. The only good thing to come out of moving up here is that i landed a good job and am going to save up to move on my own in 2020 after this lease is up. I just cant commit to a relationship that doesnt exist. We literally do not do anything. The only time we are together is when we sleep and thats it. We dont kiss or hug anymore.   


For me I am very untrusting in relationships now. I dont feel like i could ever be with someone 100%. I feel as though this is how my life always has to be. Manipulated and toyed with.   


TLDR; I am an idiot for not seeing the grooming at first and the abuse comes later. Mental abuse is real and it is so hard to get away after this person tries so hard to keep you contained."
"I found an amazing friend, and she has no idea how much she means to me.","Rewind to 2017 and I didn't really have any friends. I got a little retail job that I enjoyed but I didn't find anyone I felt could really be a good friend for me. Eventually, this girl started working there. To be honest, at first we hated each other, but over time we came to really enjoy being around each other and we found we had a crap ton of things in common, and now we're really good friends.

We hung out all day from Fri-Sun over the weekend, and it was pure bliss. I was a guy who didn't have many friends growing up, and she legit feels like a best friend and she has no idea how much she means to me. 

This is honestly the first time I've felt wanted, loved and appreciated by ANYONE besides a family member, and it feels fucking amazing!

I just wanted to get this off my chest. "
I no longer know if I truly prefer to be alone or if solitude has made me too selfish for close relationships,"Little back story, I'm in my early 30s with a stable job and pretty financially secure. Not crazy wealthy, but have climbed out of loan/car debt and now have a savings going. Immediate family is somewhat dysfunctional, but at least still all talking to each other. I'm close with one of my sisters as well as her spouse and kids. Overall, not too bad of a situation and I am glad for many aspects of my life, realizing it could be much worse.

&#x200B;

Growing up, I was the youngest and was sort of the ""lost child"" (to use the children of addicts term since one parent was an addict until shortly after I was born). I strove to stay out of the drama and conflict, so turned inward. Lots of video games, books, etc. Never popular throughout school and became unfortunately a bit of a NiceGuy because of my rejections. College was a better experience, I gave up my NiceGuy attitude, but I still never really felt included in any groups. Social awkwardness and anxiety continued.

&#x200B;

Fast forward another decade. I've since gotten two more degrees and I have made a small number of what I would consider good friends. Even if our relationships aren't super intimate in terms of sharing our deepest feelings, I am trying to get a bit better about opening up to anyone. My social ineptitude has continued, though. My job involves working with a large team and with the public, which I manage to do well enough to not have to be written up or receiving disciplinary action. However, I still feel unable to connect to most of my coworkers on anything other than a superficial level. I resort to comedy since I'm usually pretty good at getting a laugh, but sarcasm and snarky comments do not make for a real relationship with someone. I worked a job that generally kept me in an area for 3-6 months, which appealed to my lack-of-commitment side.

&#x200B;

On the romantic side, I've not had a relationship longer than a year or so. It's gotten to the point where no one even asks me any more if I'm dating or seeing anyone. While I rarely even go on dates any more, it seems like it's been years since I've really been interested in someone romantically. I find dating to be exhausting and basically don't even bother any more since a barrage of constant failure only makes things worse than the general numbness of being alone. At this point, I've begun embracing it more and now travel the country and internationally by myself if I have the time and funds. I go to movies, concerts, restaurants, hiking, etc. alone. And generally when I'm at those places, I stick to myself. When I am around friends or family for extended periods of time now, I find myself becoming more and more abrasive the longer I'm around them. I feel like I've gotten so used to being able to generally do what I want, when I want that other people immediately seem like burdens to me. Much of the time I'm alone, I'm okay with it, but there are still other times I wish just to be touched by another human. It just seems like I'm unhappy either way.

&#x200B;

A few months ago I did start on an anti-depressant and it seems like I wallow in self-hatred less at least. It still hasn't made me any less socially awkward and I still seem incapable of intimate relationships, but things are a bit better. I just got new insurance and am settling in a new area, so will hopefully work up the motivation/courage to get in with a counselor as well. Just wanted to get these meandering thoughts off my chest in the meantime."
I just left my abusive boyfriend because I just couldn’t take it anymore,"- He accused me of cheating for having male friends on social media; and he brought it up every time we fought just to show me how much of a “shitty” girlfriend I was. I never cheated.

- I have major depression, anxiety, and anger issues and as of this year, I have been trying to overcome them by training myself and keeping my composure when shit hits the fan. I stopped responding negatively when he would yell at me for no reason other than him being in some mood. When I ask him to stop yelling because I don’t do it anymore and that I don’t want to fight (it takes a huge toll on me when we do), he laughs at me and reminds me of how fucked up I was the years before. Mocks me for trying to better myself. He plays the victim every time I tell him that something he did bothered and to stop doing it, he turns the tables and puts me in the wrong.

- He diminishes my mental illnesses and compares his problems with mine to show me how trivial my problems are and that I have no reason to be depressed. 

- He beat me a few times and told me that it’s incomparable with my “cheating”. 

- Overall, I am fucking tired of feeling like the mom in that relationship because he always expects me to think for him; tell him what we’d be doing for the day, to take care of his health, to eat, to stop doing this and that. I am exhausted, I’m barely functional to take care of a 27 yr old who has major issues that he REFUSES to resolve!

Just uninstalled Steam,"I don't know where to start so forgive me if this post is a bit incoherent and rambling. I just uninstalled Steam and it feels like I've cut a cancer out of my chest. To give you an insight, I've got over the past 7 years, I've played about 7,000 hours of video games. I don't know what kept me in this vicious vicious cycle. This addiction - and I know see it as an addiction -  has cost me friends, opportunities both academic and professional - but you know what. I'm not angry at the world or at any ridicule from my peers. I'm angry at myself. These wounds have been entirely self-inflicted. But in a sick way - I'm grateful. I'm grateful that now I have this anger because now I can use that anger to pursue goals that ignite my soul. I feel more alive than I have in years - more real of a person than a resigned pit of self-loathing.

&#x200B;

I'm angry, not at Valve, Steam or anything - but at myself. But at least I'm now honest with myself. While I'm starting from behind, at least I'm starting. I'm not slowing myself down anymore. Perhaps typing all this out makes it more real for me. When this initial flash of motivation ends, I can come back to this post, for me, and reignite those embers, remember the pain, the humiliation over years and years and years, but also the hope that I have from today.

&#x200B;

I'll remember. And I'll grow. I'll be me. I'll grab the chance to be me. Upwards from here.

Almost got Valedictorian,"I go to a small school, my senior class is only 53 students. So at the beginning of last school year i was the 1st rank. And i kept it. But, a student came back from overseas and they mangaed to get Valedictorian. The reason for this is that while they were overseas, that school had alot of AP and honors classes that my school doesnt even offer. Usually there is only 1 AP class a year and im in it right now. My mom is furious about the whole deal.  She says that my one B held me back and the reason for that is that i got a girlfriend and she is my top priority. And to top this, the one B was very high, ive gotten straight A's for the rest of highschool. So now im the Salutatorian. 
Im just so frusterated and i dont know where elese to post it. I spent half of my days in highschool alone. I spent hours studying and drawing and doing things like that. It wasnt until last school year i finally made a friend and she is now my girlfriend. Regardless of this my Mom is just furious and wants to get in contact with the school board and she is even saying that i need to switch schools for the last 11 weeks. I just feel awful. I almost made it, and to be honest, I only wanted it so my Mom would be proud of me. But now I just made her angry with me and i dont know what to do. "
Everyday i find it harder and harder to get out of bed.,Its not because im tired or have nothing to do. I want to get up and out of bed. I have to be in work every day of the week for 7 in the morning. I just can never find the strength to pull myself out. I never had this problem before. I mean everyone loves to sleep in but it takes every being in my body to get my sorry ass out of bed for the day. Its just getting worse and worse at this point. 
Molested (?) by cousin.,"When I was probably about 6 years old (I’m 18 now) my female cousin who was 10 touched me and made me touch her. I don’t know if to call this being molested or what, because she was young too. It’s something that creeps into the back of mind a lot and makes me completely cringe, and shudder. I know kids do stupid stuff, and are curious so I feel bad for resenting her, because she probably didn’t do it creepily. I get mad at myself for feeling disgusting and awful about the whole situation, people have it so much worse than me and are violently raped, whilst I feel depressed over this? Not sure if I have severe anxiety and sexual issues as a result of it but yeah. This is the first time I’ve shared this...ever.  "
I need to get out of this fucking city but I feel like I'm stuck,"All of my friends are moving on with their life (getting married, having kids) and I'm sitting here not wanting that life at all. I hate the suburbs. I want to be in the middle of the action. I want to take the train to work, I want to get off that train and be surrounded by mountains of glass and steel. 

Unfortunately, I picked the wrong major in college. Sure I got a job in the field that I wanted to get a job in, but I fucked up taking this job. I have no one to mentor me, no good feedback for anything I do, and my work-load is back breaking.

I just want to pack up my bags and leave right now, but I fucking can't because I fail every technical interview I have. Sure I can design fancy, high-quality algorithms. But that doesn't fucking matter because I can't keep my terminology straight. 

The best I can do is study what I fucked up on and try again later, but it just feels like I'm constantly going be trying over and over again, waisting my life trying to push a pipe dream."
My roommate needs to shut up and realize what I've done for him,"So I'm a freshman in college, and am running with a guy I know from home. We weren't good friends  before college. Last semester he had a hard time adjusting to college and just sat in the room watching Netflix, pretty much depressed the whole time. I was the one who pushed him to go do stuff. I encouraged him to come to parties and hang out with friends. I introduced him to pretty much everyone he knows. This semester he joined a fraternity. He thinks he's a hot shot now and won't shut up about it. Hes always trying to one up me, and implies that my life is boring like his used to be before he joined the frat. He invalidates pretty much anything I say because I'm not in a frat. I told him I was tired and stressed about classes the other day and he told me ""you really have no reason to be because your not in a frat"". Fuck I almost lost it on him. I'm glad he's happier and know he doesn't mean to be an asshole about it, I just wish he'd realize that without me, he'd still be sitting alone in the room watching YouTube videos all day. 
     I don't want to sound like an asshole here, I wouldn't ever shove this in his face like this, it's just pissing me of."
It is often hard for me to feel happy for my friends whenever they share good news with me without feeling a twinge of jealousy,"18F here

Before anyone misjudges me for being a bad friend, hear me out.

I’m happy for my friends on the outside when they tell me about them getting a new boyfriend, hanging out with friends, partying, etc. I’m glad that they’re making memories and having a good times, I’m glad that I’m one of the first people they think about telling when something good happens to them. But in the back of my mind, I can’t help but feel jealous that they’re having a good life while I’m missing out on all of those things I described.

It’s hard to genuinely feel happy for friends that bounce back so easily and get themselves a new significant other 2 weeks after a breakup. It’s hard to relate and feel good inside when I hear friends talking about their sex stories and partying and doing weed when I’ve never done/had any of those things.

I’ve always felt like a background character in people’s lives. Hell, I sometimes even feel like I’m not even “present” in my own life, if that makes sense. I’ve been trying to get rid of the jealous side of my personality, but it’s so easy to just be bitter and fake being happy for those who get to experience and do the things you’ve only dreamed of ever getting a chance of doing."
I am so sick of not having a fucking job! I am so over this interview,"I had non stop contact from a perspective employer up until I sent in my test. What in the actual fuck, did I do that bad on it?! 

They seemed so exited to have found me and that I had a great diverse background they were looking for. After the interview they sent over the timed test and after I turned it in no contact. 

I’m so sick of getting ghosted"
I feel like I can’t talk to my friends about my problems anymore,"I don’t know man, lately I don’t want to tell my close friends anything, if I like something, when I have a problem, something’s bothering me or I just want to rant, I can’t do it. I feel like they don’t care or think I’m a burden. They are drifting and it’s my fault. I think I started to drift first, because I got really sad and I didn’t want to talk to anyone, now I’m sour. Of course I’ll still listen to their problems and help them, but I can’t do the same :("
Just want to have someone to love,"Yea I know you should give yourself love too and all that shnaz but it’s different. I have so much love to give and I just want someone to spoil with back scratches, head rubs, massages, food,  presents, and so much more. I want to grow mentally and physically with this person and become our best selves together. "
Scared About My Future And Who I’m Becoming,"I really don’t know how to start this this, yikes.

For most of my life, I’ve been a good kid. AB honor roll, honors classes, etc. It’s all starting to take it’s toll on me mentally though. While I do really well in school, I feel a bit unappreciated by my family. It just seems like they don’t really care, save for maybe by mom, but it still feels a bit superficial. Mainly from my grandma though. 

My mom, brother, and I live with her, and she’s okay for the most part, but she constantly complains about things and finds faults in what I’m doing. I feel like I’m living with a tyrant sometimes, and my mom doesn’t do anything about it because she basically lets my grandma be in charge. 

My family are really paranoid people, and don’t really allow me to have a normal social life. They constantly think people are going to kidnap or hurt me, preventing me from going places with friends alone. It’s absolutely ridiculous though, I’ve never gone to a public place with my friends, or hung out with them after school throughout my whole school career. If I was younger, I’d understand that, but I graduate in less that a year and a half, and I have absolutely no freedom. Each day, I grow a little jealous of everyone able to go out and have fun with their friends, and I don’t want to be like that. 

Their protectiveness of me has caused me to become this person that I don’t want to be. I have anxiety (health anxiety, and more). My health anxiety and symptoms have caused me to feel like I’m running out of time, which makes me want to live before it’s too late. I crave freedom with a passion, and I worry that I’ll lose myself and go down a dangerous path trying to catch up on what i missed as a teenager, if I even make it that far.

This is going to ruin me.

I still don’t think this explains things properly, but oh well. I don’t know what I’m expecting from this, but at least my feelings will be out there. 

TL;DR: My overprotective family and my lust for life are going to ruin me."
I keep all of my electronics in my bag.,"My computer, chargers, power banks, tablet, phone, ds, everything. 

In my old life, before i moved to the safe place i am now, i was often forced out of the house and told not to come back. But once the anger died out, i was invited back. I would spend hours in a starbucks or a library or at my friends house. But it gave me comfort in having these things with me. 

Now that i am in a safe place and dealing with these past years, i can't break the habit. It just makes me feel better...

Knowing I'm ready if i have to be. "
Thanks for confirming my fears,"I have exactly two friends who, occasionally, ever set a real date to see me. Everyone else is ""I miss you, we need to get together sometime!"" and then never reach out or make real plans, and when I reach out they're busy with no attempt to work out another date.

I realized I'd be in my friend's town for two afternoons this week, so I got over the fear of getting brushed off again and asked if they wanted to get together. They told me they'd be in Schooltown (fake name obvs)

They know I go to school and work there, and even mentioned once that they should totally come visit my apartment, since it's only 40 minutes away. They know I'm in Schooltown every day. Not even an attempt to see if I could make it over there.

Please, don't send fake sentimental messages to your friends if you don't actually intend to see them ever. I'm sure I'm just being paranoid and they do really care about me but I'm so frustrated and lonely right now and I miss having fucking friends."
First time being congratulated in a long ass time!,"I'm in the middle of switching careers and haven't really been good at anything that matters in awhile. I was  helping out a classmate with our first computer programming project, while the teacher was listening in. Later the teacher messaged me saying I killed it and that he was super proud of me. That was the first time in a professional setting someone genuinely congratulated me and meant it! Still so excited  "
Not sure how to use reddit - but I'm having one terrible day,"I just got arrested in Utah and charged with a DUI for marijuana. I have depression, bad social anxiety, HIV+, low self-esteem, never been in a real relationship (I'm 34) and I have terrible pessimism. I'm thinking I should kill myself, but my brother killed himself 12 years ago and it destroyed my mom. I have a twin sister that I love very much and I can't kill myself because I know it would ruin her too. I just feel like I must have been Hitler in a past life because my luck is the WORST. It's almost comical at this point.

I left town (Denver - where I live) on Friday on a trip to the Grand Canyon that I had been looking forward to SO MUCH for almost 6 months. Three hours in to the drive I hit a huge rock and my tire exploded. I got it fixed ($200 down) and continued on my journey.  I stuuuuupidly smoked pot while driving in Utah and got pulled over and arrested. My friend got charged with drug possession and paraphernalia too (as did I) and I feel guilty, like he was absorbed into my bad luck. From what I've read online, even though this is my first dui, first misdemeanor, etc, I can expect to lose my license. Losing my license will mean losing my job - period. If I lose my job I won't be able to make my car payments or student loan payments (not to mention pay rent, buy food, go to the gym, etc). I thought my life sucked before the dui, I don't even want to think about what it will be like afterwards. Sorry, I don't really know what else to say, but I want to dissolve away and disappear from this world. "
University makes me feel inadequate and stupid,"Hey. I'm in my second year of a Computer Science course at University in the UK. It could be going better.

My grades so far this term have mostly been C's. What really messed me up was getting an E in a class I was enjoying and thought I was doing alright at. I was taking notes and studying flash cards, but nope, even though I (thought) I had the right idea when it came to the core concepts I still didn't do great. 

Meanwhile, there are people I know that mess around on Reddit/Discord or work on their own personal projects during class, and ace assignments like it's no problem.

There was one instance where I had been working on an assignment for about an hour or two, then my mate sits down next to me and gets to the point where I am within 10-20 minutes. Things like this make me feel *really* shitty, especially when I have had issues about being insecure about my intelligence. It just makes me feel like I'm inherently dumb when other people can blast through things that I struggle with so easily.  

I also get really frustrated with assignments. I'd look at the question, start looking at the lecture slides for help, not get it, google around for more info, notice it's using slightly different notation, check recommended textbook, same problem, and I'd just end up in this spiral of frustration that makes me want to scream into a pillow and cry. I'd often email the lecturer, but I'd either get no reply to my email or something that's not too helpful. Sometimes when I see the lecturer in person I'd get patronised which just makes me feel even stupider. 

At least I like the programming. It's the theory I usually have trouble with. Shame that's most of the course...

Why should I try when my best is so easily beaten. I'm headed for a path of either failure or mediocrity and I don't know how to improve my grades with how things are.

Thank you for reading. Sorry for being negative. I want to learn the content but it seems impossible with the resources available to me while a lot of people blast through the assignments with no problems.

I just feel stupid."
Terrible week and a half,"This past week and a half has been quite stressful and a continuous flow of one thing going wrong and then another.

It started a week and a half ago when my school closed which sucked because I now lost 60% of my monthly income, have to transfer schools and everything else. 

After I had gotten that sorted out a close friend happened to be in my area which I awesome, I drive to see him and my car decides to mess up along the way where I lost headlights in the evening and car was struggling driving.

I get home same night and I'm told my Mom has gone to the emergency room.

The next day I had to go to a mental evaluation and am told I have major depression with anxiety.

I return to my car and I'm told at the Auto center that everything checks out. Cool. I go to my car and it is completely dead now and can't be jumped.

I got my car towed four days later to a shop to get diagnosed and repaired and the cost dips heavily into my emergency funds, and to top it off on the way back home I lose my wallet out of my jacket while riding my motorcycle on the highway. 

After I sort that out I had to reorganize my cabinets as I'm sharing a house and we have a new resident, and I finished a show that was some happiness yesterday. 

TL;DR: School closed lose income, car broke, Mom hospital, I get diagnosed depressed/anxiety, car extra broke, fix is expensive, lost wallet, lose cabinet space, and no happy TV.

Shit sucks."
I’m afraid,"This year has been terrible. It’s pretty much been a constant fear for the future (and with good reasons). I’m afraid if I say too much I will jinx myself and bad things will happen. I pray daily, and sometimes I pray several times per day. This year has just been filled with bad news, tears, and some of the worst things I’ve ever experienced in my life. I walk around with a heavy heart. I feel no joy. I’ve stopped doing things I normally enjoy. I barely ever go to school anymore. I keep thinking all day... which brings tears to my eyes. I’m so afraid of the future. I’m so afraid that I just decided to call my doctor’s office tomorrow morning (in about five hours) to try to get an appointment today. I fear time is running out and I have to deal with this now. 

This post is esoteric, I know... I have a small family. I have very few people I’m close with, and the close ones are all family members. One of them ended up ill shortly before the year ended. Didn’t last very long. I miss that person every single day. Another one is too close for me to feel comfortable. My one and only true friend. Doctor’s verdict? Prepare for the worst. This has all happened in just a few months. I have tears in my eyes this very moment. I don’t know how to cope with this. "
My band teacher is my dad,"Hi hello,
So I don’t know if a ton of people can relate to this, but my band teacher asked to adopt me about a year ago.

Around three years ago, my former dad got let off from his job because he has a really bad illness, and my former mom’s boss got her fired because she didn’t like her (she’s stupid and a biatch). Everything I had ever known was being torn down before me. We were planning to move out of our house into an apartment, and we would sell our house and a lot of our belongings. The only one who knew and understood what was going on was my band teacher, who was and is the most sweetest person on the planet, he would do almost anything for me. When he heard about this, he talked with my mom and ended up being able to take me in for the months my parents were trying to find a source of income. Beforehand, I had a really bad car accident, which left me in a two month coma and a bunch of symptoms that I still have, like a learning disability and hearing and vision loss. I didn’t know it at the time, but my parents had put in their savings to keep me alive, which is more than what I could’ve asked for.

My friends and everyone else at school (I’m pretty sure my science teacher knew however) had no clue as to what was happening outside of school. I was a pretty “popular” person at the time and when I started going home with my band teacher instead of going on a bus or getting picked up, people started talking. I denied everything they said, even though most of what they said was true, fearing for my band teacher’s reputation. I was considered a prodigy at the time, and even my own boyfriend was starting to ask questions.

Then the unthinkable happened. My parents got into a car accident and didn’t make it. That was the worst part, as two months prior, I had almost passed in a car accident. The guardianship had to be changed to my godparents, who lived across the sea. I had never met them before. My band teacher was having none of it. He and many other parents I knew in my community fought for my custody for a couple months. Finally, I was allowed to live with someone I never thought I would live with; my band teacher.

A year ago is when he held up a sign asking me if I would let him adopt me, so he would gain full custody. Of course, I said yes, and I’ve been living with him ever since. my sister, who is much older than me with a family of four, caught wind of this. She is the greatest sister in the world, but sometimes she can be very protective of me. She asked me if I truly wanted to live with him and his family, of course I said yes. She comes and visits from time to time, but can never really connect with him, but it’s okay, they have a lifetime to get to know each other better.

Fast forward about a year later, my new brother graduates high school, and surprise, surprise, he asks me if I would like to have his room. We’re both band nerds and have the same taste in regular music, so instead of sharing with my other sister, I share with my brother. I had become pretty popular then, because I had publicly came out with saying that I was being adopted by my father, which stunned everyone in the community. I still get some looks from time to time, because we’re entirely of different races (I’m multiracial but mostly Asian, and he’s white) but I don’t mind. I’m happy now and that’s really what matters to me.

Present day, I’m getting ready to go to Europe in a few months to play clarinet on a tour with some of my friends. My boyfriend (who I met through a band camp my dad runs), is coming up to see me in three days after his midterms, and both my brother and sister are back at home from college, annoying as ever but hey, they get me out of class to get food, I’m not going to complain. While I’m still getting used to a different mom (my mom and I aren’t super close yet; we had only seen each other and not met formally before my adoption), we have loads of fun. And my dad? He’s always bugging me about practicing, but now I can get private lessons for clarinet from my dad, even though we do go up to the city for private lessons as well. I’m rising through the ranks of our wind ensemble to the top. I’m forever thankful and grateful that I had such an amazing and caring person that saw through my facade quick enough to take me in. I don’t say it much, but I love you dad.

"I [22] desperately want to have sex, but I’m afraid of the guilt I’ll feel after. I haven’t had sex in 4 years because of it.","I lost my virginity in an idiotic way and the guy treated me terribly after. We’d only been talking for a few weeks. We started kissing and things went too far. The next day I had so much guilt I went home and cried. Afterward, he wouldn’t talk to me, wouldn’t buy me plan B.  A mutual friend told me he’d lost respect for me since I lost my virginity so easily.

I cried off and on for months after that. I was raised in a very religious household and raised to believe that your virginity was for your husband and having multiple sex partners is nasty. I just can’t bring myself to get over it. I KNOW it’s ridiculous and I KNOW I’ll have to get over it if I want a relationship because it won’t be with him.

I met a great guy and we’ve hit it off but it’s not serious. I’m really attracted to him and want to sleep with him but I’m so scared. If it doesn’t end in marriage, that’s another man I’ve had sex with.

I don’t know. I feel like my self esteem will decrease with every sex partner. 

I worry about what a future boyfriend would think even though I know a good future boyfriend wouldn’t judge me. 

But honestly, I crave sex and don’t know what to do with these feelings. Masturbation just doesn’t alleviate the desire anymore."
Proud of myself!,"I have been a mess since my boyfriend blind-sided me and left (with the final message to stick around for the future because that is when I might be needed again). Today I asked a boy on a date. It feels really good. Even if it does not go well, I have hope that someday I will feel again. "
I was fired today and my parents are happy about it,"For the past 10 months I've been working as a teacher outside my study and research area. Thing is, I was really enjoying it and considering changing my focus since it was a much less stressful area than the one I graduated in. My salary was decent and I liked everyone I worked with.

But my parents were never happy about my job and were always telling me things such as ""when are you getting a real job?"" and ""you can't give up on a real career"". Today, after I told them I had been fired, all they could say was for me to hurry up and get back with my old stuff because the clock is ticking (I'm 25).

It hurts me really bad that they completely ignore the fact that, when I was doing my Master's in my study area, I was on 3 different kinds of meds, having panic attacks and emotionally destroyed. Having this new job really helped me getting back on track with my mental health. Apparently this is not good enough for them."
"I have made myself homeless, to escape years of domestic abuse","Not that i regret my decision to leave, it had to be done. I have been in a horrible situation at home for the past 3 years, i have gone through sexual, physical and mental abuse  and this week i just snapped, i could not take another second of it. I didn't even pack a bag, just walked out the door and i'm not going back. I have no where to go and have spent the last 3 nights in a woman's shelter but i would much rather starve and be homeless than to go back there. 

It all started to change for me last week when i finally was able to find a job that suited him, a nice work from home position that paid quite well. I say suited him because i would be at home right where he wanted me. I started the job and all was going well until he realised that my manager was male and i would have to be in contact with him over the next week for training ect. Anyway as soon as he found this out he decided to lash out at me completely destroying my phone and computer meaning i could now not work. During that same night he had decided that he acted stupidly and went out the next morning to buy me a new phone and laptop so i could continue my job. But it was not over, This piece of shit absolutely humiliated me the next day while i was on a video skype call to my manager, in brief he tore off my clothes and started to beat me all before i could shut the laptop and my manager saw everything, i am so embarrassed. 

That was it, i got up got dressed and left i have not been back and i do not intend to. I was hoping to save up some money and endure this for a while longer so that i could at least support myself, but here i am now homeless, penniless and hungry with no one to help and no one to turn to. I do not know how i am going to get through this right now but i know for certain i will not be going back. i will starve to death before i go back there. 

Sorry for the rant i just needed to get it out.  "
I want to be extraordinary,"Not rich or famous.

Just for me to have the opportunity to see if I can be really great at something I actually enjoy or want to try and have people recognise it in me.

Without sounding like a spoilt, arrogant or pretentious douchebag, I really don't think I'll ever feel satisfied by a mediocre ""life's work"".

It's horrible feeling that normality isn't good enough I hate that I can't be satisfied."
I feel like I’m just running towards the end,"I feel like things get a little better, like I can see the light at the end of the tunnel, like my life will go back to normal, then I’m brought low again and I feel like such a fool, like I was running away from my fate, like I was meant to kill my self and there’s no escaping it. I’m so tired. I’m happy sometimes, but the thoughts come in, the self-hatred comes in, the attacks come in. I’m haunted in my dreams even. I hate everything. I can’t go on. I just wish things were normal again. I’ll keep holding out a bit longer, but I can’t help but feel I’m just dragging it out and the end is inevitable. "
i’ve been sober for almost three months!!,"hi reddit! this is my first post so i’m sorry if i’m not going about this quite right. anyways, i’m a sixteen year old girl and for about the past year or so i’ve been drinking alcohol and smoking weed semi-heavily. i kept it under control for the most part (didn’t go under the influence to family events, school, most social gatherings, or engage in social media posting while under the influence) and i can safely say that these past few months have been beyond amazing. my closest friends are all what i’d like to call “secret stoners” so this kind of behavior was always what i thought to be normal. I lost a few other great friends, was feeling constantly depressed, and i just lost sight of what’s important to me overall. i’m young and i know if i were to continue this habit it will to have a bad effect on my mental development and general well being. i hope i’ll be able to keep this up until i’m at least 19, i know it’s only been a short time since i’ve stopped but i have high expectations for my future! if you’re thinking about becoming sober i believe in you, i know it’s easier said than done but it’s possible! i didn’t want to really bother anyone else in my life with this information which is why i’ve decided to share it on here. thank you if you’ve made it this far, means a lot. "
You’re an idiot,"You rushed into a new relationship 2 weeks after a breakup. I warned you. This new dude sounds too good to be true. You hardly know him and you’ve been alone with him in a car and invited him to your house alone already? You’ve only known him for 5 days. Are you fucking dumb? You have no idea what his intentions are. I don’t even know why I’m still your friend, you ignore my texts and calls and only talk to me when you want to gush over some new guy you fucked. Good luck with your life, don’t come crying to me when shit hits the fan."
What I want,"I just want to find someone who captivates me. Someone who peaks my interest and draws on my sense of wonder and childlike curiosity. I want someone who sees my flaws as endearing and not as faults. I want someone who recognizes my intelligence and fortitude, who sees my drive and encourages boldness and pride.

I want someone who trusts me, who I can put my trust into as well. I want someone who makes me want to be the best version of myself. I want a partner that positively enables me to face my fears, and try things that intimidate me.

I want someone who reminds me of my best attributes when I’m feeling down. I want a partner that pushes me to be brave when I feel defeated. I want a partner who is always in my corner, who isn’t afraid to call me on my shit when I’m in the wrong. I want this person to understand that I only ever the best intentions at heart and would never knowingly do something to hurt them.

I want someone who would never knowingly hurt me. Who wants the best for us together. I want someone who wants a future with me and can’t imagine spending the rest of their life without me in it.

I want someone who misses me when I’m gone. I want someone who will always be by my side.

I do not believe that this person exists."
Fuck it,"At this point it’s fuck it, fuck this, and fuck you"
My life is falling apart,"I am a sophomore in high school. I used to live in Michigan, but I moved out to California with my dad due to issues with my mother. This move happened two Februarys ago. The move at first was everything you can expect: home sickness, lots of tension between my Dad and I because he too, missed our old life. My freshman year at my new school was perfect, I was making friends and the transition was easy. This year is different. I have fallen into the wrong crowd and have been going through some very hard times. My dad isnt someone I can talk to about this stuff, him and I have become very distant to each other and I feel that it will stay this way. I have no one to talk to, no one to give advice, or be there for me when I am down. I started smoking weed and letting my grades slip. I recently got them back up and have been sober since December. On Friday I got into a fight with one kid which then escalated into a big brawl of about 25 people. I got expelled for it. I have nobody but myself to blame and cannot put this on any other excuse except myself being a dumb ass. I feel that I have fallen into a pit I cannot get back out of. I just need some advice on what to do, because I want to be successful, I want to change. "
Got kicked out for talking to a gay,All I did was talk to a gay and now I'm going to be homeless 
I just pissed off the only woman I've ever been intimate with,"Long story short... I've been dating a wonderful woman the last two months. We connect on so many levels. And she is the only woman I've ever had a serious romantic relationship with (or been intimate with in general) and I am a grown ass man.

&#x200B;

I had a coworker ask me today to trade shifts with her later this week because of an important event she's had planned for months. And she's being going through some challenging times recently and asked for the wrong day off. I looked at the schedule and it looks like I'm the only one available to cover her shift on the day she needs it. I feel sympathetic for her and thought it would be selfish to say no.

&#x200B;

Unfortunately, this means I had to cancel my plans this week with the woman I've been dating... and she is upset (apparently she had a bad day and this just made it worse) and I feel like s\*\*\*. I was trying to weigh which action would cause more pain and I thought that the woman I've been dating would understand, we've had several nice dates together in the last few days and I was already working on another set of plans the following week for us. I've apologized and explained my logic and I told her I have every intention of making it up to her. Her replies tell me she kind of accepts it but it's made her feel worse. I just don't think there's anything else I can say right now to make it better. 

&#x200B;

I had to weigh which one caused more emotional pain... but apparently I chose wrong. Maybe time will help..."
Terrible day,I am sitting in a diner in panguitch Utah right now and my car just broke down. I have about 1500 dollars in my account right now and the repair is upwards of 3500. I was going on a camping trip for spring break and my car started making a funny noise so I stopped. It was put of oil so I had someone go and grab me a few quarts of oil... then I had to make the slow drive 15 miles away to an auto repair shop. When I got to the shop they told me my car was totaled seeing that my car is only worth about 3500. My friends still wanted to go camping so they left me here stranded without a car or a place to stay and idk what I am going to do tonight. Sorry if this isnt an appropriate comment in the sub this was the best place I could find to get something off my chest.
Chose to be a bystander outside of work and I feel guilty,"I was on a flight last night and one of the other passengers was not feeling well and fainted. She was lowered onto the ground right in front of my chair, pale as a ghost as the flight attendants frantically asked if there was a doctor or nurse on the flight that could help. Instead of jumping in and trying to assess the severity of the situation and try to help, I waited and hoped that there was another person on the flight that was a doctor or nurse. Sure enough, not a moment later, another passenger came over saying she was a doctor and jumped right in. 

I am a nurse in the ER. I have 2 years under my belt, which isn't much, but enough to know what I'm doing, yet I still have doubts in my skills/knowledge. I wanted to help...I really did but all I could think in the moment is 'maybe it's x, maybe it's y, but I don't want to be wrong', so instead I just kinda sat there and said a few things here and there that didn't necessarily help the situation.

The passenger ended up being fine, and I can go through what probably happened to her in my head and think what I should do if it happens to me again, but I just feel terrible. I mean these kind of situations are what I have dealt with in the past at work yet I didn't respond. The whole reason I went in to the profession was to help people, yet I failed to do so in this situation."
Ending up having to go to er after rough sex,"I wasn’t able to move all night after the guy left. Sharp pains in my back and stomach. I got in a car wreck two weeks ago so I didn’t know if it was because of that. Called my friend in the morning and she took me to urgent care. I passed out cold in the urgent care and they sent me to the er. (The doctor said we could either call an ambulance or that my friend could drive me...thank god my friend chose to drive me..saved me/ my parents $5000). 
Anyways, after hours and hours of tests at the hospital doctors came to conclusion that it was either an “absess” (that’s what I remember them saying don’t even know what that is) or a ruptured cyst in my ovaries. They decided it was a ruptured cyst in my ovaries bc of how sudden the pain was. I asked if it could’ve been caused by penetration and the doctor said possibly. I started crying because I felt like an idiot. And then after that she said it could’ve been cause by lots of things, maybe driving and running over a pothole or from falling down or even just laying in bed. I don’t know if she just said that to make me feel better or what. 
Anyways, I stayed overnight and in the morning my white blood cell count didn’t drop too low so the doctors said that I didn’t have to go into surgery. 
I texted the guy I had sex with just to let him know what was up, all he said was “shitttt.” Told him some more details and he said the same thing again. I said a little bit more of what happened and he just opened it and didn’t reply. Lol. 
I’m just thankful for my friends and family and the doctors that helped me to be safe."
I rode my bike for the first time in a long while and I didnt feel super self conscious,"I finally worked up the motivation to get out of the house and ride my bike. I live in Arizona so I couldn't wear long sleaves to hide my scars. I've got a couple less noticeable ones, and one big scar that you could see from a mile away. I rode to the park, sit down for awhile, then rode around my block a couple time before heading home. I struggle with my weight so getting out and exercising made me feel really good"
A PTSD anxious mind,"What's it like? A mind like this, runs non stop. Believes the worst until it doesn't happen, sometimes it might of course, which fuels it more. Weird thoughts that are not normal but they seem so normal. You are not normal, you watch how to act around others so you don't stand out. Can't show the real you because it's scary and you know it. You've seen deaths, you've seen heartache, you've lost loved ones. How can you be normal? You are called happy go lucky, just because you fight so hard to hide the sad. The guilt. Picturing horrific events, some have happened some haven't, but could. Anything that could happen is what wrecks your brain. You start to feel like you should run away from your life. Not die. But leave the life you created just to be alone. And maybe safe? You like being alone. You love your family more than anything but that love is crushing you. Anxiety hurts, it's not friendly it makes people angry at you. It makes them confused. How do you survive with this mind? "
Friends wife came onto me,"We were all out last night and my pal goes out for a bit so it's just us two and she says to me she wishes she met me first then starts kissing my neck. I wasn't expecting this and was still in shock so was a bit slow to cut it off. She acted like nothing happened when he came back

I could never fuck over my friend but I know he hates her, whereas I've always thought she was perfect for me. beautiful and smart and I think shes known all along how I've felt. I just can't bring myself to destroy such a close friendship. No idea what to do now"
I’m just so damn sad today. I want to feel less sad.,"It’s just been a hard week...

So my grandma died last week. My poor mom is understandably devastated. She traveled to meet with with her sister and brother to see the ashes. She then fell after a day of not drinking water and split her head. Luckily, she went to emergency and is all stitched up and is now okay.

My dad had his ID stolen and is worried as they’re racking up thousands of dollars on his credit cards he’s had to chase down. 

Roommates father just died of cancer and she’s doing the best she can. I’m so impressed by her. But I also know that there are days she just can’t get out of bed and I wish I could do more to help her.

I’ve been getting rejection letters all week from all the graduate programs I’ve applied to. My wonderful partner has tried to cheer me up the best he can, but when he saw what programs I’m considering if my good choices fall through, he think I should try just getting a job in field and transferring over eventually to the appropriate one. I miss living with him so much, and at least not getting in anywhere might mean a job where we can be nearby. I also think my moping might be getting to him a little. He’s been really kind and patient with me, but I don’t want to call him and bother him with this again.

The professional route is not a bad idea, but I’m just so worried nothing will come through, even from the job perspective. Getting jobs as a chemist/biologist is fuckin hard, and I want to be a bioinformatician ultimately. It’s what all of my research has been focused on and what I really want to do.

Doesn’t help that my dad is crap at cheering people up. He was a refugee and couldn’t get his degree because of the war, so he does this thing where he’s like “it’s not a big deal, I was gonna be an engineer and then I had to pay the rent by washing dishes. You’re gonna be fine”
Which should be reassuring? But he fucking hates his job and I don’t see how now getting a job in field and scrapping by is supposed to make me feel better, especially when he’s always so miserable with a pretty okay job.

Sometimes with both my parents, I worry that I never learned great coping mechanisms for how to be happier/change my mood. They both are sort of lonely, traumatized, and surly people who don’t have the healthiest coping mechanisms. Sometimes I think they had kids because they felt isolated.

I know my situation isn’t the worst, but I’m just down. 

It’s just been over a year of this and I want it to be over.  I’m just fuckin tired and sad today. I wish comfort food would make me feel better, but I get the feeling it won’t. 



If anyone reads this, maybe just link a picture of like a really funny animal video? That’ll make me smile.

I love reddit!,Just joined as a user recently not knowing I was surfing this app forever till I found its real great usage 😈 lol but it’s like I can’t stay off it ya know? Going back and fourth every couple minutes feels like the first time I fell in love with social media !
Premed with PTSD -- trying so hard just to keep my head above water,"\*Please let me know if there is any content especially triggering in here that you would like for me to edit.\*

&#x200B;

I live and attend university in a major city where there was a terrorist attack last year. I happened to be very close by in a library at the time, and was subsequently diagnosed with PTSD. 

My entire freshman year, I lived in the library. I never left. I read, studied all day and night long. It was my home. The coffee cart people knew me by name. I started inadvertently memorizing other people's study schedules as I watched them come and go. 

But I, a sophomore now, can't step foot in there anymore without thinking about that day. Every detail flashes through my mind. I can only muster up the courage to go for my weekly office hour (I am a TA). And honestly, I'm only able to do that because I deeply love helping my students. If it weren't for them, I probably would have forgotten what it looks like in there.  

I study in my lab now, but that's only unlocked during the day. At night, I go to my apartment. My roommate has a boyfriend now, so she is never home. Most of my friends are ""work friends."" So, I spend most of my time there alone. When it's time to sleep, I meditate, drink tea, and take deep breaths -- but all I see, hear, feel is a gun. 

Where is the nearest exit in all of my classrooms? My lab? What do I do if I'm teaching my recitation and a student tries to attack other students? How do I survive? 

Eventually, I am able to lose consciousness. But I frequent those early single digits on my clock. My IBS (embarrassing, I know) flares up because of the stress -- I curl into the fetal position in hopes of relieving the stabbing pain. 

Making matters worse, I'm falling behind on my research. When I do sleep, I dream of my PI becoming disappointed in me for missing deadlines or having sluggish data. 

I also flat-out failed my first college exam today. Granted, it was organic chemistry, but the average was relatively high -- a 66%. I got a 53%. 

I've had to call off of work numerous times for reasons I simply can't explain -- I just could not make myself go. I lacked any motivation. I work with hospital patients (many long-term), and I dream of them being upset that I did not come to visit. Or I dream of my boss firing me. 

My roommate is fed up with me too, I'm pretty sure. We got in a minor disagreement the other day and I lapsed into a full-blown panic attack for absolutely no reason. 

The gunman didn't try to attack me. It feels selfish to struggle with this. I've interviewed a few of the victims for a piece I wrote, and I just can't comprehend why I'm falling apart when I was never in any imminent danger. 

I'll stop now for length's sake. Sorry if this does not make any sense. I'm just rambling. 

Also, I know I need therapy. I'm working on finding a new therapist (other one was not a good fit). "
The college admissions bribery scandal,"I am dying of laughter these people's kids couldn't get into school on their own so their parents photoshopped their face onto bodies of athletes, lied about their ethnicity and they think their kid was capable of passing the classes they took in college? 

I want to go to college in America and I felt bad because I thought I was taking someone's spot because I'm an international student who is paying more in tuition. After hearing about this, I feel less bad because at least I didn't have to photoshop my face onto Michael Phelp's body, cheat on the ACT and lie about being a minority to get in. 

I feel bad for the students who were rejected and I can not believe these grown adults used photoshop to make their kids look like athletes. "
cant forget childhood incident,"This is really odd and something i’ve never told anyone

When i was like 6, i went to a like an indoor fair with my mom, and after a couple of games i decided i wanted to get my face painted. My mom stood in line while i played on, for what felt like hooours (it was probably only like 20 min tops) but then when it was almost my turn i chickened out and didnt wanna do it anymore. I remember feeling so bad that i had made her stand in line, and sometimes out of nowhere i still think about it and feel kinda sad about it. Its ridiciolous, and even if i mentioned it to my mum now she probably wouldnt even remember going to the fair, but i remember so clearly! Has anybody felt this?

I don’t know why I’m sharing this, i just need it off my chest, and i guess i’m saying sorry to all the moms out there with annoying indecisive six year olds "
I feel numb,And empty. And sad. And nothing. All at the same time. I just want someone to wrap me up and kiss my forehead and tell me everything will be ok.
I’m embarrassed for always being the “good girl”,"I’ve always been a good little girl ever since i was a literal little girl, in my teenage years i did all the shenanigans most teens do, the underage drinking, the minor lies to my parents about where i am but when it came to boys I’ve always been cautious maybe too cautious especially when started to grow more into a woman and guys started noticing me a lot.

I’ve always moved really slowly in the love department, I’ve never been in an actual relationship and I don’t hook up with random dudes either because for me i have to have a connection and to know someone a bit and care about him to even kiss his cheek. Anyway the point is because of how careful I’ve been  my entire life and of how little my experience is I’m embarrassed and I shouldn’t be but i am"
I will never rent a car again and I hate my life,"Long story short, yesterday I ran my car off the highway in snow and my car had to be fixed. I was driving 900 miles back to school from spring break at home.

I rented a car to get back to school. For one week, it costs half of what I make in one month. I feel hopeless and like I can’t buy food for the next 2-3 months."
I lied about something and now I'm not sure what to do.,"A few days ago I had a bit of a heated fight with my parental units while on the way to school. I yelled and cussed and was in the wrong, as it was over something simple but I had just let my anger get the better of me. We went home and they were very upset obviously and wanted to know a reason as to why I would act that way.

This is the part where the lie comes in. I had an abusive step-dad a couple of years ago and obviously none of us liked him. So I made up a story about how he messaged me a bunch of hateful stuff.

I didn't do it to try and pin it on him or anything. I just panicked and was scared because I didn't want them to think I got angry for no reason and so I could have a scapegoat.

Fast forward to today and my parental units have told me they gave my number to the police in cyber security I believe and that they would be able to go through the messages and see what he said(over Instagram is what I told them.) 

This all only happened three days ago and only today have they told me they have my number to the police. I hate my step-dad but I certainly didn't want to try and frame him for something-no malicious intent, and I don't lie about things like this. I was just really frightened at the time and I thought if I have them that reason they would soften up on me.

I need advice now. Another friend of mine told me I should just come clean. I'm not sure what to do at this point. If anyone has had a similar experience or advice or anything I'd greatly appreciate it.

I would really appreciate it if someone talked to me."
"He’s in love again, and I panicked so I’m ironing the fuck out of all my clothes.","I haven’t spoken to the guy in months now. We used to be the closest of friends, have known each other for well over a decade, and all that.

Anyways, we had a messy past two years that involved first loves. He was so messed up over love, which was my fault, by the way.

Going back, we don’t talk anymore. I keep tabs on him and his friends and siblings sometimes update me, just letting me know if he’s been drinking or smoking again. 

The last update was that he’s in love again.

I’m happy for him, I really am. I’m just worried.

He was so messed up the first time around, 

I want to message him and check up on him but I can’t because that’ll mess him up again.

I can’t ask his friends to elaborate because they’ll think I’m the one regressing this time around.

So, at a loss for what to do—

I decided to iron my clothes. These are perfectly crisp clothes, mind you, I just don’t have a fresh batch of laundry to do so.

Yeah, I’m ironing already ironed clothes."
A Poem About ADHD - Nothing Days,"  

I have nothing days,

Where I can’t get shit done,

And the little things get in the way.

I have terrible days,

When all I want is to run,

My feet are restless and tired,

And bored, all at once.

I have disjointed days,

When one thing starts before the other ends,

I wish I could keep my focus on just one thing,

For an ordinary length of time.

&#x200B;

I have Monday days,

When the blues are toxic, I’d say,

To a friend I am doing great,

While stirring in my thoughts

Like my brain’s a hot plate.

I have fed-up days,

When I just can’t cos,

And I’m a miserable fuck.

&#x200B;

I am tired of me,

This revolving scene,

The rhyme of history,

Repeat the same old shit,

Each hour, each day of every week.

&#x200B;

I wish I could find some peace,

Some quiet in the chaos.

Some love, from someone,

Who understands how I feel.

I’m reeling from it all.

I need a second away from this storm,

It’s always brewing.

&#x200B;

I have nothing days,

Where I can’t get life done,

And the huge things get in the way.

I’ve feel I fail everyone,

And all I want is to run,

So bloody far away,

I’m restless and tired all at once.

&#x200B;

I have something to say,

On this matter in hand,

I wish people could understand.

That ADHD,

Isn’t a trend or me being just fucking lazy,

I wish I could do the shit I want to do,

But I can’t, you see?

&#x200B;

It’s these misunderstandings,

That make my days feel like years,

That make my heart thud and creak,

And I’ve had growing fears,

&#x200B;

That maybe,

I’m just...

&#x200B;

weak."
Too much happening all at once,"A few months ago, my dad had a stroke.  Thankfully it was a mild stroke and he recovered.  After several tests, he has to have surgery and my mom wants me there to help out because she doesn't walk long distances. Surgery is scheduled for this week but late last week my dad complained of some chest pains during pre-op check up.  He has an appointment to see a cardiologist and surgery may be rescheduled if not cleared.  My parents live seven hours north of me.

I then learned last week my older brother fell and hit his head, had a severe concussion, bleeding in his brain, and lost the ability to speak.  He can understand what is said or asked of him but he cannot find the words to respond.  He is slowly learning to say words but it's limited.  My sister found out about it about the same time as me and she is worried, texting if knew anymore than what she heard--of course I don't.  My mother is worried, she is afraid he may get frustrated with not being able to express himself and become depressed (she's retired nurse and therapist, said it is common for TBI patients).  My brother lives six hours south of me.  

Over the weekend, my husband had a panic attack in the middle of the night.  I was supposed to work the next day and ended up awake for a few hours helping him to calm down, waited until I heard him snoring before I went back to sleep.  This was the first time it ever happened around me and he never told he ever experienced one, which I found out he had a panic attack a few days prior to that.  

I'm tired.  I just want everyone to be happy and healthy.  "
Should I tell his wife?,"My best friend of many years has been texting and calling me almost every day for the last 5yrs. We are both married and live in different states but I would be lying if I said there wasn’t a deeper emotional connection there. Well, that’s actually the traumatic part but I guess that serves me right. We have only ever called and texted but at times it was very flirty and just to be completely transparent I liked the way that felt. I have been married 11yrs and it felt good to have that extra emotional attention. Also this person has been my best friend since I was 13. So there is a lot of connection happening there. My husband knows we talk and didn’t love it but he works a lot and I am so introverted and closed off he was honestly relieved I had a friend to talk to. Again, this person lives far away and there has never been physical contact of any kind. I knew he was lying to his wife, well keeping this a secret rather and several months ago she found out and he suffered what I would believe as an emotional breakdown. Attempted suicide and all. This of course is going off his account and not my own witness because I am not at all involved in his life or close enough logistically to know what’s real. Prior to the breakdown though there was heavy fighting between us. He is a narcissist, without a doubt, he is emotionally abusive and I was just so blind to all of it. I was so easily manipulated for a year, I went and sought therapy and medication bc he had me convinced something was wrong with me. I was too sensitive, too reactive. And honestly I am both, I am ADHD and much better now that I am medicated, but that is def a reason why his manipulation  was keeping me in a toxic cycle. I am easy to confuse and manipulate. So fast forward to now and I am at the point of no contact. I’m not confused and I’ve never been more sure of anything in my life. After many attempts to help him and speak with him daily I have concluded that his manipulation tactics are much more advanced than I recently thought. So here is my question. I know he is suicidal. He has had that tendency since I’ve known him (all 18yrs) I know he has tried multiple times. I have tried to get him to seek a therapist and he says he will and he wants to but it’s always a bad time. Any time we argue heavily he uses the suicide attempts as a way to scare me or make me forgive him or feel sad for him. I need to know if I am obligated to tell his wife his situation mentally. Mind you, this will not come easy as she probably has been manipulated herself and she has no idea that he has continued to talk to me. So he will have to answer for that which scares me bc of the suicide attempt last time. If any contact is made to her I am well aware it has to be 💯 honest and sensitive and not at all accusatory. My intent is only to help him and honestly help her if she is stuck in this situation where he lies and manipulates. Am I at all obligated to do that or can I walk away without it? I have a fear of going no contact and finding out years later he went thru with a suicide bc he never got the help he needed. I also have a fear of forcing him to confront his wife and losing control. I also have a fear that she is in an abusive situation and maybe able to get help with him that she wouldn’t otherwise seek without my input. I honestly am lost. As much as I am done with this person I also really care about his well-being and the well-being of his family. He has two little children and I don’t want to cause pain to anyone by sticking my nose in. It’s just the suicide and manipulation tactics that I find extremely concerning. What do you think? Am I obligated to tell or do I just walk away?


TL;DR
Emotional affair went bad. I am the only one he confides in about his suicidal thoughts. Should I tell his wife about them before implementing no contact? "
I hate myself for being different. Advice is welcome and urgent.,"This seems weird but i cant stop thinking about my fucked up past.

Im almost 25 and i pretty much had a very horrible childhood.
I was the biggest outcast in elementary school, then in high school it became worse and worse. I have seen so many people there having a great life with friends and couples who fucking annoy me because im never good enough for anyone. I was always excluded to the point where even my teacher once forgot to put me into a group for a project.

I was nobodys first choice in anything. I was always the last or they never even thought about me. I was never invited to hang out with them no matter how much i tried to include myself in. They always take their excuses like ""nah sorry we forgot man maybe next time"" yet they keep forgetting me. At  this time i realized i was not even worth as a human being. I hated myself so much for being like this. I wish i was born into a different family, a different place, a different person.

My parents never loved me at all, i never got any money for them to buy food for 9 hours of fucking school. they verbally abused me, destroyed me inside so much that i eventually tried to strangle myself with a copper wire so hard until my neck had red lines.

When i was 16, that's where shit got really real.

when i almost graduated (berlin) we had a class trip in london.

these 2 weeks none of my family tried to call me and i couldnt reach them. when i got back i saw everyones parents waiting for their chlid in the airport where i had to wait almost 5 hours because i had no german money for a taxi.

when i eventually got home by hitchhiking i saw no family name label on it and when i unlocked the door it was completely empty. the only thing that was left intact was my very room the exact way how i left it.

everything else was gone. it turned out my family disowned me because of how different i was from others and never loved. they now live in the united states since 2010. i still havent got any contact with them. i have fixed my very own life myself, became a really successful chef and live perfectly. what still haunts me though is that i dont think my family still think about me, hell they probably dont even know if im still alive and havent commited suicide.

to this day i live with shit like this.

not loved, forgotten, left.

there's just me and reddit. i dont have anything else so please help me out guys what to do because therapys not helping jack shit.

i hate it when i see my co workers calling their girlfriend wife etc it just kills me in jealousy. i know its wrong but i honestly cant stop wishing bad luck upon them.

Help me please. I dont want to keep living like this."
"Thanks for the nickname, M","I haven't been feeling good cos I have not been taking meds lately. Today I just let myself stay occupied making stuff and doing the work cos that's at least how I feel like I can contribute to the cause if not by other means. I love your jokes, I love laughing at them. You always notice that I don't talk and you come sit and crack jokes just to make me laugh. Prolly not even a big thing for you, you do it for everyone I guess. I really like you, but you're probably not gay. I wish we could've been friends at least. Your stupid lil dance moves make me smile and keep me up at night. When you try to pull me and make me dance it makes my day. Today when you sat next to me helping me paint with your poorly made strokes and u gave me a nickname, my heart was going to explode and I wanted to hug you. I haven't seen much love, my family hates me, most of the others around me don't see me. The only person who cares about me and has ever called me with a nick is my best friend. I really wish I had you in my life M. :/ I wouldn't be this big of a mess then I guess.

College Interview,"I’m an eighteen year old male and I’ve been struggling with education and school since my second year at high school but I never brought myself to talk about it to anyone, no teachers, family or friends. They were all very supportive and helping towards me but I couldn’t do anything to help. I hated going to school. It gave me so much anxiety and fear. Now I’m going to my first college interview tomorrow and I’m so nervous. I’ve came so far and my mental health is so much better now I feel like a brand new person and if I get this, it’ll make everyone so happy and proud of me, they already are for me making it this far but if I get this I’ll not let anyone down. I hope I get it. If anyone’s interested I’ll let them know how I get on.

(I’d not wanna go too heavy into my health unless this takes off or people are curious as I can speak openly about it now but still within certain understandings)"
I keep coming back this thought..,"I was a caregiver for my aunt who passed away recently. She went from being adventurous to having the physical capabilities of an infant within about three months. This is going to sound heartless considering that she loved me and did so much for me but I was really at my limit. By the last few weeks I was starting to wish that I wouldn't wake up when I went to bed. 

 I don't think she saw the full extent of it because she basically couldn't move by the end but the cancer had caused the skin to rot and stink. It felt like seeing an insect with a million legs. My brain was screaming that this wasn't right, that I should run away. I knew life was fragile but I didn't realize Death really has no qualms dragging people by their ankles as the victims dig their nails into the ground kicking and screaming. It wasn't peaceful and there was so much pain. After the deed was done, it left a violently permeating sound that only silence could make, reminding the people who were left how truly alone they were in their own minds. 

I don't think I fully processed it while I was taking care of her but now that it's been a few months, it's coming back. I went to the doctor's recently bc I was feeling pins and needles. He referred me to a specialist. He thinks I have some problems with the nerves. I haven't gone yet but I keep coming back to my aunt. She really was such a wonderful person. Why did she die like that? Also, why couldn't I be the bigger person and be a better caretaker? Now  I can't help but wonder if maybe my symptoms are a sign of something more serious. Maybe I too will become bed bound, staring at the white ceiling of my bedroom for hours and hours. Maybe I too will feel the tired resentment from my loved ones who are at their wit's end. 

I just can't bear the thought of having them hear that sound again.

It's all so terrifying.

I guess I fell out with the girl I thought I had a chance with,"I didn't intend to make this so long, TL;DR is at the bottom.

Hello Reddit, I figured I might as well post this here since I don't really have anyone to tell. Last summer I met a girl through a mutual friend, he introduced me to her because she'd be attending the same school as me this year, I assume this was just so she'd have someone she could at least be semi-acquainted with in a school filled with unfamiliar faces. Of course I talked to her so I could get a feel for the kind of person she was and if she was someone I was willing to call my friend. From the moment I started talking to her, I was already picking up that she was a flirtatious person (I only say this because she never actually saw me until school officially started except but she was already acting like we were very close, we were talking over Instagram at this time). 

&#x200B;

 Fast forward to the beginning of the school year, basically nothing happened, we exchanged a few glances at each other here and there and she'd like to mess with me periodically (pulling my hood up, tapping me on stomach, shoulder, arm etc.) but we never actually had a full on conversation in person at this point, maybe just a few words. This period of basically no face to face conversation lasted for a bit, maybe about 2 months, this eventually changed when she had asked if she could sit with me and my friends while we ate lunch, her new ""friends"" had apparently been bullying her, which was apparently a common problem for her. So of course, I let her sit with us, why wouldn't I? It was around this point that we actually started having conversations, though they still weren't as serious or deep as they were over text. I believe it was around this point that I started to develop genuine feelings for her. Now I've never been too keen on relationships, especially at this age (I'm 17 and in Highschool), I have always believed and still do believe that Highschool relationships do nothing but cause stress, as neither of the partners know what they're really doing or have any general idea of what it means to be in a relationship, not to mention that the extra hormones just make emotions go haywire. Knowing that I stand firm with this ideology of mine, it caught me off guard to realize that I had actually developed genuine feelings toward another human being.

&#x200B;

Against my better judgement, I began to pursue my feelings, I flirted back with her whenever she flirted with me, rather, I'm going to assume I was flirting (I truthfully have no idea how all of this works). She seemed to receive it well, our interactions never seemed to make things awkward. Over text, she was definitely less subtle with her flirting, she constantly went out of her way to remind me that she was single, even going as far as saying that getting someone isn't hard, all I had to do was ask. At this point in time, I was incredibly dense and didn't take that opportunity for whatever reason. 

&#x200B;

These interactions between her and I continued for quite a while (they actually only recently stopped, hence the whole reason for me making this post). Now skip to February, night after Valentine's day to be exact.  We were just having a normal conversation, sending each other stupid things we found funny. Eventually, the conversation took an odd turn, I'm not going to go into detail, but the conversation basically forced me to admit that I liked her, which I was ok with, I had been putting it off for long enough at this point. I kept anxiously looking back at my phone for a solid 5 minutes waiting for her reply, she finally responded, and I opened up Snapchat (She had convinced me to download it a couple months prior) to find something along the lines of ""I like you too, you're a great guy"". At this point I was completely overjoyed, the one time I develop feelings someone, they just so happen to reciprocate them. I truthfully felt on top of the world because of this. However, after making our feelings known, we never really made it official, the flirting didn't stop, in fact it increased. We still never said or did anything outside of what we normally did before, though. This made me wonder if she actually felt the same way or if she just said that in an attempts to spare my feelings, I'll never know more than likely. 

&#x200B;

Come Monday, the first time we see each other since the confession, the first thing we both do is randomly greet each other with wide smiles. I don't smile much, if at all, it felt so odd that this girl I had only known for 6 months managed to get a genuine smile out of me. This time period is probably the best I have ever felt in a while. Unfortunately, it didn't last as long as I had hoped. Jump back to last Friday, something seemed off with her, she didn't seem very happy, she didn't seem very eager to speak to me, the most I was able to get out of her was a ""Hi"", keep in mind she was in plenty high spirits just the day before, she also interacted pleasantly with absolutely everyone except for me that day. I was a bit confused until one of my friends (who knows I have a thing for her) did some asking around, apparently she had just gone through a ""bad break up"", this obviously set off several alarms in my head. Break up? With who? We hadn't even had a serious conversation in days, why was I not made aware to any of this? Were her feelings towards me completely fake after all? With this new information in my head, I was obviously confused, anxious, and a tad bit hurt. But I assumed that there had to be an explanation for this, and more importantly I just wanted to make sure she was feeling ok above all else. The following afternoon I asked her if everything was okay, didn't get an instant response but that's what I expected, I forgot about it again until around 8 later that night. I saw that she had opened the message, but just didn't say anything. I can't even begin to describe how bothered this made me, I just tried to reach out to my friend who was obviously going through something and I had just been completely ignored. I didn't even get a ""I don't really want to talk about it"", I had just been completely ghosted and left in the dark. I spent the entirety of this weekend in my room wondering what it is that I did to her, is there something I didn't do that I should have? Was there another guy I'm completely unaware of? At this point, it doesn't even seem like she wants to be my friend, she barely even looks my way anymore, doesn't even try to speak to me, and still hasn't texted back, not even so much as an explanation. Despite this, she still sits with me and it's so unnerving. Something's obviously wrong but she isn't saying anything. At this point I have abandoned any hope of starting something with her even though I still have feelings for her. At this point, all I honestly want is just a chance at actually being good friends with her.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: Met a girl, confessed my feelings for her, she felt the same way, a month later her demeanor towards me has taken a complete 180 and I'm completely left in the dark as to why. "
I'm Such a Weird Person. Is it my asperger's syndrome and/or OCD?,"I know this might be a little jumbled, but if you would, stick with me.

I was diagnosed with asperger's syndrome in 6th grade. I havem't done good at holding eye contact. And sometimes I can't articulate what I want to say.

I'm really not that funny and sometimes its embarrasing that I tried. Sometimes it feels like if I say it, its not funny, but if someone else said it, then it would be funny.

I have a hard time with girls too. The first time I asked a girl out I was a sophomore in high school. She put it off every week for like a month and a half or so just saying that she had stuff to do. I was just inclined to just be like, ""okay, we'll try next week."" She didn't have the decency to just tell me that she wasn't interested. After that month and a half of trying to go out with her, she finally just texted me, ""I'm talking with someone right now, so to be clear, we're just friends. Okay?"" That week, I saw her kissing that guy.

Granted, I'm doing better at picking up on a girl's BS, loke when she just has no decency to just be clear and upfront with me. So thankfully, my asperger's syndrome is only a small case.

I sometimes wonder though if my asperger's syndrome is more obvious to others. Like, do girls see that I have autism and that turns them off from me? Do people become annoyed with me because I can get a little obsessive with things?

I'm also in my fifth year of college. I feel very stupid because I couldn't finish in 4 years. I haven't changed my major, I have only taken 4 classes a semester. Last semester I took 5 classes, but one class was only for 8 weeks. It tried 5 semester-long classes this semester, but dropped one. There is just a lot of resding this semester, but that one really had a lot. I just feel like I should be better at reading by now. I wish I was smarter than I am. I think it has to do with how introverted I am. I don't socialize much and so some social cues I just don't pick up on.

Edit: recently, a girl that I was seeing had told me that we need to just be friends. She was only, like, the 6th girl that I tried to get into a relationship with. I know thats not as much as other people. But still, I think I get too obsessive. So when she told me that, I felt sooo devastated even though we had only been seeing each other four 4 weeks."
I think my brother (m16) is falling into depression. Need advice on what I (m19) can do to help him.,"Hi guys,

&#x200B;

My brother, who is 16, has been showing signs of depression for a while now since the middle of last year and I’m really worried about him going forward in the run up to his exams in under 2 months. He’s been like this for around a year now, he was expelled from his last school for possession and smoking weed in December after hanging out with the wrong crowd. He is now at a good new school (by some stroke of luck they took him in with good faith) and is now living with my parents.

&#x200B;

At this time last year his mood began to change, less talkative, and just generally not really the same person the me or my family used to know. His mood swings became a bit more erratic (not bipolar however) and started to be noticed by most people around him. When asked about it by myself or others he said ‘I’m fine, leave me alone’. So we kind of passed this on as usual teen behaviour (I was the same).This continued for most of the year until last summer when he went on holiday with my parents and seemed to have a pretty good time (I was away working).

&#x200B;

However fast forward to September when it’s time to go back to school, he told my mum before she dropped him off in a very sincere tone, ‘Mum, I really don’t want to go back to school.’ My mum passed this off at the time not really thinking about it. His grades were dropping, teachers were seeing him change and he started to close himself off and get in and around the wrong crowd.

&#x200B;

2 months later my parents get the dreaded call ‘Please come and pick up your son, he won’t be coming back.’ Caught red handed rolling joints in the bathroom with his ‘mates’. All the while with all of this going on he also had a girlfriend in the mix. I phoned him as soon as I found out and he was balling his eyes out, and had no idea what was going on. I told him that it was time to turn his life around and start from a fresh slate, forget everything and everyone at that place and move on, regardless of what he did or didn’t do. It seemed that he had cried for help, but no one really noticed. My mum and dad are still in denial about what they could’ve done to prevent and help him but I also told them that it’s gone now and it’s time to start again.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to now where he has joined a new school that took him in regardless of what he did. He started well, made friends quickly and has joined the local rugby club to continue his hobby which he does very well in. However now as the exam period is slowly approaching, he’s in denial that he has to sit these exams (GCSE’s) whether he likes it or not. It’s now got to the point where whenever he is reminded of that fact, he closes off, doesn’t talk to anyone and stays on his phone. My parents have cried out to me to try and help him and talk him through which I have tried to do with a small amount of success but I slowly see him not even talking to me anymore and progressively closing himself off to the world.

&#x200B;

I’m worried. I want the best for him absolutely, and I’m worried that he’ll fall into this spiral of decline that will be almost impossible to get out of. I’m worried that he’s going to turn to drugs and hang out with the wrong people again, and with the recent rise in teen stabbing across the uk I would destroy me if I see he’s around or involved in it, or worse, a victim. His silent cries for help haven’t gone unnoticed, I’ve been watching over him from afar and checking in but the situation is getting worse and almost out of hand. I’ve mentioned depression to my parents and they haven’t quite clocked onto the idea completely yet but I’m sure he’s showing strong signs of it.

&#x200B;

Guys I really need help/advice, anything I can do to help him at least until his exams are over and done with and then I can deal with it much closer.

&#x200B;

Thanks."
Why hit and runs are so fucked up,"They say you never truly understand an emotional event until you've experienced it yourself. I now understand what that means. Less than 24 hours ago as of the time I posted this, I lost my dog to a hit and run. This was my first ever tragedy I've had to face in my life. I was only told this story as he was being taken care of by another family member, so it wasn't a first hand experience. He was approaching 9 years old. It was night time and someone was driving a car faster than should be inside of a community. Mind I say again, inside a community, not on a service road. The car ran him over, and instead of stopping, drove off. A car hit and ran over my dog. I wasn't home when this occurred, but hearing the news was just as emotionally upsetting. There's something genuinely wrong with you if you run over another living animal without the courtesy to stop and offer empathy.
I regret not having spent more time with him, I regret not having taken care of him more, I regret letting these things happen.

I'd like to offer two moral lessons from this story; 
1. If you've been involved in the injury or death of another, don't fucking drive off. Take the blame and anger. The least you could do is show some empathy for them.
2. Don't take for granted any special moment. Please spend more time with them, with anyone, that has an influence on you. Always find the time to take care of anyone who matters to you. And be thankful to have them in your lives too, even if you can't say it.

I hope this post positively influences everyone to make the most out of every moment."
I [21M] just wanna tell my love story with my gf [21F],"I don’t know how to do this but just wanna share my story.

I have been in a relationship with my gf for about 2 years now but I met her way back. I met her in primary school (I’m not sure whether elementary/middle school in other countries but that’s what mine’s called) when we were 11. I was a new kid in school and didn’t really fit in anywhere but try to get to know people. I didn’t particularly see my-now-gf who we will address as E in the class as there was tons of other beautiful girls in my class. However, E is always nice towards other people and kind of a shy and polite girl ie she puts her palm over her mouth when laughing (considered polite in my culture). That was what made me interested in her. She didn’t know that I liked her, I just kept it to myself. But I was an honest kid and always frank so when she and her friend asks me (maybe because I’m the new kid and they wanna make small talk idk)  “hey, do you like anyone in this class?” I went and said “yeah sure. I like you”. Her friend starts laughing and E went silent. That was the last time I spoked to her for the entire year, she avoided me at all cost. I was kinda a weird kid, I didn’t talk to her but I would go to her and I would say I like her, I would look at her from my desk in the class and make origami of cute animals and put at her desk. I was making a real effort to tell her how I liked her. A few nights in my 11-year-old self, listening to “Just The Way You Are” by Bruno Mars, my mind was like “man, this girl is perfect in every way. I gotta make her my wife.” Coming from an 11-year-old who’s yet to reach puberty, that’s a far reach.  So we went on to go to school and we were put in different classes the next year and I stopped seeing her day to day, seeing her only by chance. The following year we would go on to high school and before the year end, I spoked with her for the second and last time (at that moment). I read somewhere on Facebook that she was going to move to another state which made my heart sank. I was devastated. At 12 years old, there’s nothing much you can do to change that, we weren’t even in a relationship yet so that’s a downside. I thought maybe I should move on and the following year I got into a boarding school and that’s that with her. Or so I thought.

Fast forward 3 years later. I’m still not in any relationship, I liked some girls at my school but E was sometimes on my mind, that didn’t bothered me though. In that year we had an important examination and after that big exam, we had a week break from school so for my batch, the year was technically over and we would go to school just to hang out. So we were left with all these time in our hands. What to do? I haven’t been on Facebook for years and I only log in just to play Facebook games which were fun back then but this time, I wanted to meet new people or old friends so I started chatting with a few. I saw her name “E” and I thought maybe we can be friends now. I started talking to her about my then-current life and she told me about hers. I asked her this and that and found out that she didn’t even move and she was studying in the high school that my mom teaches. I was like damnnnn how could’ve I been so stupid. I felt like an idiot. However, I didn’t straight away think that I could have a chance with her. We started talking and chatting online. My school is still on the one week break and I went to my mom’s school just to see her, but I still help my mom out a little. Get to know her a bit more and found out that she liked me too back in primary school but she was too shy to do anything about it. I asked her does she have anyone particular in her mind and she said yes but refused to tell me. With some of my persuasiveness she told me that the boy that she is waiting for was me. She even stated that hoping for me was one of her motivation in studying. That was when I thought to myself that we can pick things up where we left off. We got together into a relationship. Things were great for 7-8 months until she changed her mind. She had this idea that being in a relationship would distract her in her studies and most importantly, make her unreligious. So for some time convincing her that it’s okay and everything. I failed and lost her. She blocked me on every platform of contact and I was forced to move on. I really thought this is going to be it. I later tried to forget about her but it’s hard when you pour your heart into loving someone, I brought her gifts and surprises. Sing songs for her but it was all in vain. I tried to meet other girls but it was hard knowing that I still want her. I met a few girls who were destructive towards me and made me feel worse, those girls were toxic. Deep down in my heart, I still want her back. I tried to find her, made new social media accounts that she will later block and search for her friends and any way that could connect me to her. But nothing works out. 

This continued for a few years. And then I met a girl who I thought could be my source of happiness. It was going great and all and I was really starting to forget E. But this girl changed all that when she showed her true colours. She held me back in my studies wanting to have more time with me knowing that I have submissions and exams the next day. A particular incident is when I wanted to study for an exam which was tomorrow. I had already called her and everything but she insisted that I spend more time with her. I told her no and continued studying. I stayed up until 4.00am and unlocked my phone to play with it before I went to bed. I saw that she was still online. I was shocked and immediately called her but the call said that she was on another called. I didn’t think much about this and sleep as I still had to focus on my paper tomorrow. The reason I was so shocked to see her online is that she always slept before midnight or 1am if she had an exam. But this was 4 in the morning. I tried to think that it was just a misunderstanding and after the exam, I got to work with my friend and texted her about what I experienced the night before. I hoped that she would say something like it’s nothing or I’m imagining things but she got nervous and started her sentence with the mother of all bullcrap. “It’s not what you think”. That moment I knew something wasn’t right. She got into her sad mode and told me that her ex-boyfriend called her and she didn’t want to act badly towards her ex. You should note that I’ve never called her for more than an hour, after midnight and she is always salty when I called her saying that she doesn’t want her friends to think she is gross which is fine I guess. I rarely called her because she is somehow busy or “this isn’t an appropriate time to call”. Now she is stating that she had been on the phone with her ex until 4 o clock. I asked when did he called her and she said right after I said goodnight. I didn’t know what to feel, I know she’s not that kind to me but to think that this thing happened behind my back, I don’t know how many times has she done this. But the plot twist is that I was the one to console her. Not the other way around. But I played her game. She’s a type of girl that “you can’t go out or talk to your girl friends because I would get jealous but I can go out with my guy friends because they just friends”. 

Towards the end of 2017, I was still with this girl and I’ve had enough. I needed to end it with her and I did, life went more smoothly after that and I still think about E at times of despair. One day, I got a hold of a number of one of E’s friend from a friend of mine and I couldn’t personally contact E so I talked to her friend to send my regards to her or if she would, ask E to text me as we were friends from a long time ago. She did but the response I got was that she asked me to stop disturbing her and her friends. I wasn’t mad but that couldn’t be it for me so I still pushed her to talked to me and give me one last chance. She didn’t text me after that and I went to my boring sad life. I was scrolling down my emails and saw that she had emailed me a few days ago stating that maybe we could start all over. Start from zero. 

From that moment on. I am happier every second of the day, my life is better. I’m in a healthy relationship. We are both doing law at different schools and join in the voluntary armed forces program to become and officer and if everything goes well, we will get married next year. 

TL;DR - met gf at primary school at 11 years old get into a pretty rough on and off relationship, everything is okay and getting married next year at 22."
"Can’t get over the amount of hate a person needs to physically bring harm to another person. Grandparents, Fathers, mothers and children died for some sick fuc*ks Argument.","From the deadly massacre of men women and children last week we witnessed first hand the potential of what type of actions can result when individuals with  dark motives are able to consume hate speech. 

Freedom of expression has a pivotal role in our ability to communicate and stand up for what we believe. However when an individual believes in something that calls for or directly harms another person, property or wellbeing should that be allowed? 

I would love to hear other people opinions on what they believe should be the limit. For example should the leader of the free would be given a free pass when he/she openly supports or advances a stage for individuals to pass comments which reflect hate and prejudice? 

Please be respectful, although I might not agree with you I do want to hear your point of view as you have read mine. 

"
"Old memories, and a reflection about the world","This happened when I was ten, so bear with me. 

I was best friends with [Kylie]. We spent almost every day together. We were best friends. Even as I type this, I'm starting to remember moments we had together lmao. 
Wow, I forgot about how who I was back then.


She was wonderful. I was definitely experiencing love. I trusted everything she said, and we were each others' rocks. 

We played a game one night. Kylie told me to close my eyes, and tell her what I thought I was touching. I was ten- I hadn't even begun to think she was about to do something sexual. I don't know how to put this, but she put my hand on her reproductive organ. It was absolutely nuts. It didn't feel immoral to my 10 year old brain, so we went with it.


It's tough to think about now. Although I did enjoy, and encourage the game we played, I honestly just thought it was the appropriate thing to do at that stage in a friendship. 

Don't get me wrong, I have no hard feelings, or accusations toward her. I'm sure Kylie holds the exact same opinion as I do now. 


What it did make me think about, though, was the idea of consent. It's absolutely nuts to think about how unsafe, and impressionable children really are. "
"Everyone is so unique, but I'll never get to know them.","So I live in Cali, and I see so many different faces. The faces I see, and maybe the faces you see we will never see them again (usually). Someone who has so much potential, gone from my life. It's not like I can make friends with everyone who catches my eye and even if I were to there would be too many people to keep in touch with. It's really saddening to me. That person could've brought me the satisfaction of friendship and help me understand and learn new things. But that won't ever happen because I let them walk by me. 

Luckily, I have gotten one of those people for my own. My boyfriend is like those people. He's good looking and tall but most importantly he has had experiences no one else in this world experienced because of his circumstances and feelings. His emotions completely unique to him. I love him but this doesn't fill the black hole. I'll never fill this hole consuming my feelings. It will get bigger and bigger. I just wish I could know everyone around me. But my life is either too busy or theirs is. 

I'll continue life envying the friendships other people have with eachother, because they are experiencing something I will never. So many people go by me, with untold stories I want to hear. With emotions and feelings that mold them. Gone forever."
My grandfather passed yesterday,"My grandfather was a badass and we had a special connection. He was 94 years old, served in the British Royal Marines doing special operations during WWII where he snuck from submarines into German-occupied France to take out strategic targets. He told stories that could chill your blood about the war and then ones that would have you laughing hysterically. 

After the war he went to work at a printing press for the Stars & Stripes paper in Germany where he met my Grandmother. They moved to the US in the mid 50s. He loved gardening, photography, fishing and sailing. 

I used to lay on the floor and read him the paper when I was 4 and had just learned to read (a story hed brag about later in the nursing homes about how smart I was). He was funny and kind and truly amazing. 

He passed on St. Patrick's Day and I'm sure hes up somewhere having a dram with his brothers singing an Irish drinking songs and sea shantys. 

I'm really really going to miss him and it hurts too bad to say outloud to anyone. 


I'll leave you all with something he said to me frequently, and one of the last things he said to me:


Enjoy your life. "
I figured out a big root of my anxiety!,"TL;DR at bottom

I've struggled with anxiety for a few years now, but I didn't realize it until August of 2017. Ever since then, it's been glaringly obvious, and a lot of what gets me down makes sense. It's just exaggerated, so it's more than the average person should experience. I also have a few documents that I write in whenever I get especially depressed or anxious, which is important to know. I have one from 2017, 2018, this year, and one for when I'm on my school email account. The school one I've only written in a few times, and the last time was in November of 2018. I went to write in it today because I was working on a project and got really upset at something completely unrelated, but I went and looked at what I had previously written. In November I decided to try winter track (turns out it wasn't for me, who woulda thought) and that Monday, I mistakenly thought there was practice. My high school has a pretty big campus, so I took a long walk, then walked down to the field hockey field. That night, I wrote this in regards to that afternoon.

"" The feeling of freedom from doing something like that, of just not caring if anyone saw me and listening to some good ass music. That’s the fucking dream right there. I felt freedom. Certainly not peace, but it was a damn good attempt. I felt fucking amazing, and I wish my brother hadn’t texted me right as I got down there. I wanted to stay forever. It’s not just the loneliness that gets to me, I can deal with that. The feeling of being trapped, in my room, in my head, wherever, is what gets me down the most.""

Freedom, or the lack thereof, is something that's tested me a lot in the past few years. The first time I felt suicidal was because I was having some of my freedom taken away, and it's caused many panic attacks since.  Taking a walk around the schools isn’t even that significant a thing to do, but it’s not where I was supposed to be. This time, though, I couldn’t be fucking touched. Not by anyone or anything, and that was pretty clear, so I took advantage of it. It was the best I’ve felt in a long time, because that moment was completely for myself. No one knows about that, that I just fucken did that because I wanted to, except for my brother.

“It’s not just the loneliness that gets to me, I can deal with that. The feeling of being trapped, in my room, in my head, wherever, is what gets me down the most.”

Holy fuck. I wrote this??? Holy shit. This is every problem I’ve ever had surrounding people and my anxiety, broken down. This is what’s been getting to me for the past few years. My biggest fear is incapacitation, and I’ve known that for a long time. My fears, I thought, surrounded purely physical incapacitation. When I was asked what my biggest fear was a few years ago, my mind immediately went to being in a capsized kayak with no way to get out from under it as it fills with water. That scares the fuck out of me. Incapacitation in any other manner?? Never crossed my mind. Not once. Not the fact that I can be alone, I can be around a lot of other people, but the minute I can’t change the narrative and put myself somewhere else? Not for a minute. I am an idiot if I’ve ever met one. I know the problem is freedom, but that’s the only label I gave it. I’m not afraid of freedom, and I never have been. But the moment that’s taken away is when it becomes an issue. I know the lack of freedom is the problem, but I only ever called it that. It never occurred to me to give it a different name.

I have faced my biggest fear countless times, and I've never realized it. I am speechless at my own cluelessness.

TL;DR I figured out the root of a ton of my anxiety by reading something I wrote five whole months ago. Shocked and appalled."
"Dear Family,","(background : I am 18, Burmese , & parents do not want me to go on a road trip with boyfriend this summer . This is what I plan on writing to them, so it’s not in the right tense ) 

Dear mom and dad , 

If you don’t understand this , translate it . Let me be honest . You guys aren’t good parents . I love you guys so much , but you don’t even care . I tried so hard to see the good in you guys . I tried to see that you came to USA for the family , but really you came for you . You say I drive the family apart , but  You never notice what I do for the family or see anything positive in me . I know you work to support the family , but what’s the point of having money for us  if you do not even care about all of our well beings . Every single one of your children , my siblings , grew up abused . They know it , and I’m sure you know it too . You just don’t see it . Oldest brother grew up abused , why do you think he’s so depressed till this day ?I feel so bad for him because the root of it is this family and he can’t escape it . He doesn’t deserve it . The middle brother, he’s a really loving brother . You guys just don’t understand him . All you ever do is blame what he does or whatever he does . For The youngest brother , he’s just a kid. Don’t let him suffer like all of us . No one is happy . Don’t you see that ? The thing is , you believe you’re kicking me out , but the thing is . I have the chose of leaving or staying . If I stay , I will have to listen to you . I’ll be trapped and constantly be controlled, and blamed for my decisions . I’m the one who is leaving you . I’m leaving all your negative endless cycles of abuse behind me . You’re my parents , and I’ll never blame you for what you’ve done because , to you it seemed right . All the bruises , and scars, I choose to let it be memories . I always try to see the good in people even if they have hurt me so much for years . I hope you can forgive me. This is me letting you go . I’ll take care of you guys when I’m ready , but for now , I hope you let me go too .

Love your only daughter ,

Aye Nanda Lwin 

Ps. Mom & Dad I really just wanted to go on a trip with my boyfriend . Many seniors go on a trip with their friends, boyfriend , or family in America . I understand you aren’t open to it , but it does happen. I’m sorry I lied to you, but I just want to be happy . I just wanted to go on the trip and come back happily to my family . And I hope I can come back but if I can’t , that’s okay too because I love you and that’s just who you are . I do have places I can stay at , so you do not have to worry . The plan is to stay at dorms at local college if possible or stay with friends . Luckily , even though I’m home and at work a lot , I do have friends that care about me . Anyways , Yes, I didn’t leave the SIM card you guys gave me , because I want you to be able to contact me since I don’t have social media like Facebook . You’re welcome to go shut if off so I can’t contact you , or if you want me to come return the SIM card I will when I come back . If you want me to pay for it , I’m more than will to send you 25$ a month for it . I heard you guys arguing that you’d kick me out if I went to California , that was really heartbreaking for me to hear , that my own parents would kick me out just because I wanted to have a fun time . I really feel like you guys are controlling and never let me go out . The only reason I work is so I can go out into the real world because I never have any opportunities to hang with my friends . I know you believe it’s shameful for me to go somewhere with my boyfriend before we are married , but that is your thinking . Not Burmese culture . I believe it is more shameful to kick your daughter out . 

Ps. Oldest brother , I love you and care for you deeply , but you make me uncomfortable everyday by touching my body . It’s not okay for an older brother to touch their sister in ways you touch me . You have sexually abused me when I was younger and I forgave you because it’s not like I want to do anything about it . I can’t . I didn’t know what it was at the time . When you talk about my future and me , you always seem so negative . It has made me upset , but at the end of the day , I control my future. If you were more positive , maybe you’d be happier . I’m quite an happy person even with all I go through in this family because I know I can have a happier life . I hope you can be happy or content too . 

Ps. Middle brother , Hey , I love you and I hope you stay strong . everyone is mean to you and I know it sucks . It’s okay if you like guys, or you like girls . You’re you , and you can’t change it . I know you are stuck here for now but someday you’ll be able to be happier and live your life . Just listen to mom and dad while you live with them and respect them . You’re only unhappy because they yell at you . They only yell at you because they aren’t happy with how you act. Everything’s temporary . Don’t worry . You can come live with me when I have my own house , but you have to be a good kid. 

Ps. Younger brother , you’re so young . I honestly don’t even know you well or understand you because I never take the time to talk to you . You’re my brother and I love you . I’m sure you get stressed , but know everyone does things because they think it’s for the best . Stay strong ."
Had to put down my childhood dog today,"He was 15 years old, we got him when I was 14. This dog was with me for half my life and he was a member of our family, I love him. He just got too old, and I’m heartbroken about it. Why can’t dogs live longer?? "
I don’t know who the hell I want to be.,"I know i’m awfully young, but the world is demanding me at this very moment I pick who I want to be and where I want to go for university next year. There are mornings where I wake up wanting to feel the passion of law for the rest of my life, meanwhile there are times I feel guilt for letting myself down and not going into Medicine. My whole life i’ve wanted to learn everything not to win a race, but to actually learn. I use to think I had so much time and so many years before real life came to kick me in the ass, but it seems like real life starts right now. I don’t have money to be picking n changing my mind and it seems as though no matter what path I take I will never be satisfied because I will always be thinking of the other. Isn’t it silly the world has made a 17 year old determine her faith so young? I’m starting to feel as though I may never find a happy life and just find myself settling. Just had to let my thoughts flow somewhere. "
I'm becoming suicidal because I don't want to become old & senile, My mother has very severe dementia and can't function alone. Seeing her struggle and practically become a vegetable is such a hard thing for me to handle. She can't even remember my name anymore and doesn't know who she is. I can't imagine myself becoming like this and forgetting my children and wife's names. I'm having a second mid life crisis right now and I'm thinking of killing myself at my 'height' rather than progressively deteriorate and become a shell of what I am now.
Wanting to become a runner/jogger... but have many worries and questions!,"In the past week I’ve decided I’ve decided I wanted to be healthier and I want to get involved in running. Currently I’m overweight. I’m 5 foot and I weigh 170. I want to lose weight and I’m hoping running can help. Also doing it as a hobby and for health reasons. My worries/ questions are as follows: 
1. I will lose to much muscle from cardio 
2. I’m not sure what to eat or how to eat to fuel my running or to help with recovery
3. I run out of breath quickly while running and I breath through my mouth. If I breath through my nose I feel like I’m going to suffocate. Is there a correct way to breath?
 
I’ve read a lot online but nothing seems to help. If anyone has and advice or is experienced In this kind of stuff any comment is appreciated!  "
I'm an alcoholic and I don't care,"I understand that I'm an addict. I understand that it's a problem. I just don't care. I don't want to get better. I don't intend to live too much longer anyway. I've gone through five or six years of mental health shit. I'm drunk tonight, I've been drunk every night. I drink 8-15 tall boys a night. This is my life. I've been on meds, therapy, all that shit. I'm here to die. I'm going to drink and do drugs until my body shuts down or I kill myself. Fuck you, don't try to tell me I'm wrong, I'm just here to die. Get over it. You don't care about me, I don't care about you, we're all here to die. Get used to it fuckers.

Edit: and just to be fair I'm going to be rude to anyone that comments on this. I know you fuckers are going to try to convince me that I'm important or worth existing. I'm going to be argumentative. Don't comment, I'll delete it in the morning anyway. I hate you all."
Sleep and a Panic Attack,"Sorry if this is wrong subreddit, but i don’t know where else to go. I was going to sleep and successfully falling asleep, but kept waking up because of a heavy weight on my chest. I would find myself thinking and hoping I was dying for the feeling to end. This continued back and forth for about 20 minutes before I got out of bed out of desperation. Shortly after came the panic attack. I hate this. I just want peace. What am i doing wrong? I try to sleep at a reasonable hour because I work an opening shift (have to be at work by 4:30am). I try to practice yoga 2-3 times a week. I’ve recently started meditating. It seems like no matter what I do, this will always be a part of me. Sleep has always been my only true escape and now, tonight, even that has been taken away from me. I don’t think I have ever felt this hopeless. I’m trying to breathe and calm myself, but nothings working. I don’t know what to do anymore. "
Here’s a weird but great thing that’s happened to me (long story hope you don’t mind),"A weird but great story of how I met my fiancé 

So I went through a bad break up my ex broke up with me thinking he can get away with the fact he abused me for years! I’ll explain this as short as I can.... he abused me for 8 years..... couldn’t live with it but felt like I couldn’t live without him ...... I was afraid to leave him because yeah I’ll admit it “I was afraid of being alone” “who else will love me?!” With those horrible thoughts the (which I thought) was the best idea at the time was to take my own life! I took pills my brother found me high as a kite and crying hysterically he woke my dad up and threw me in his car to the hospital..... I was lucky my stomach didn’t get pumped I just had to drink water and let what I’d taken flush out my system and sleep it off! 

Because of that I had to take time off work and I was afraid to leave the house but 2 weeks after I started feeling better enough to return to work.

I work at a super market I worked on checkouts at the time so that means I had to serve customers sometimes make conversation with the certain types

I was okay to work but I was still depressed for a few days after what happened one day I was at work and randomly I served this guy(my now fiancé but we’ll get there soon!) he didn’t talk at all he was quiet but for some reason while I was looking at him in my head I thought to myself “I wonder what dating this guy would be like” I pictured myself having cuddles with him sleeping with him ALL sorts you’d do with your other half! I don’t know why but I just randomly thought about it in my head then he left and he was the first person I had that thought with and I did the same with only guys I’d serve that would just smile and be friendly.....

Well after a few months since the break up with my ex my best friend took me on a night out for the first time in years(as my ex forbidden me seeing my friends) I got crazy drunk and all I did that night was drink and danced to music with my eyes closed I never felt so relieved and stress free for ages I was so happy for the first time in years and by myself! I was so happy when I got home I cried after that I thought damn I should do this more often... I should of done this years ago it opened my eyes that I wasted so much time being walked on my an asshole for maybe a quarter of my life! 

Yeh I kinda dated(not officially) other guys but it always went first date.....friend zoned...... next guy first date, second date.....ghost...... I had enough when that guy ghosted me I went out had a few drinks pulled a guy and I had my first one night stand as I thought well now it’s on and crossed off my bucket list and that’s it for a few months after that I just enjoyed the single life yes I had tinder but I thought meh ...... probably be a while before a decent guy comes along on this I’ve swiped right on a few guys then waited but I wasn’t desperate 

Until I met one guy on there(not him yet!) he seemed friendly we had things in common we liked rock music and we’re into video games just one in particular Gears of war 4 I added his GT and we had a game online together with his friends we had a laugh then the day after he asked if we could meet up I thought sure but I thought he’d be a good friend I didn’t have a crush on him I thought he was great to talk to

We met up we went for drinks(responsibly) he was driving we sat in his car listening to music where I picked up a CD which had a picture of some guy on it and I thought it was a mix tape burned on a cd with a funny picture of his friend I asked is this your friend? He said no look at the side it was an Arctic monkeys album we laughed so hard then next thing we kissed and I was like woah! Okay I never thought I’d go from meh he’s cool to wow! I have a major crush on his guy now after that we texted each other non stop until we had a second date we went to the movies then after that we just made out in the back of his car then one thing lead to another we ended up having sex but he promised me he wouldn’t ghost me after this he promised me a third date..... but on the day he cancels and tells me he went through a bad break up recently and felt bad for leading me on but I told him I’ve been there and we can still be friends we can still hang out if you like we still did..... since we talked about music I did buy him The Neighborhood album as I think he should listen to this he liked it but I’ll put this story to an end here ...... all his kindness I learnt the hard way that it was all just an act to get in my pants! And I pretty much fell for him accidentally 
He ghosted me for so long until I took the hint and here’s the thing when I was seeing this guy it was around my nieces first birthday I went to a toy shop to buy her a present and I saw him(my now fiancé) I thought to myself I’ve seen this guy before and I was in the toy shop for a long time trying to think what to buy 


I couldn’t believe I let myself fall for another asshole 
 I had enough of tinder and signed up for POF 

While on there I saw (my fiancé’s) profile I thought his face is familiar checked his profile to see where he’s from yep close to me he messaged me so I gave him my number and a few odd days I’d get a text or have an odd conversation with him 


I dated another guy(still not him!) he was a lot older and I thought okay this will go well but I kept my guard up cos this wasn’t long after the last guy and of course he dumped me for a dumb reason that you’d expect from a 12 year old he was 33! (7 years older than me!) 

After that I thought fuck this! If guys can do it why can’t I right?! The 3 Fs

Find em
Fuck em
Forget em

I met up with a guy just to have sex with him I thought just this once but because he was damn good in bed I wanted more! We arranged to do this again I paid and book a hotel room twice! He stood me up twice! But those 2 times he stood me up I replaced his side of the bed with another guy first guy was someone I talked to for a long time he was a fuck boy so I thought he’ll come over he did worst sex ever wasn’t worth the wait! 
Second this is funny! I went to the bar pissed off! I thought fuck this I’m heading out and I’m gunna have a good night! I knew this guy that worked at the bar I told him what went down and he said well think of this you got a hotel room for the night you’re going to have a good night I thought yeh I am he made a bet with me if I don’t take a guy from this bar home with me and shag him I have to send him nudes (it’s on) but I thought I’d up the aunty! I hung out with 2 girls I asked does it have to be a guy he said anyone so I thought I’ll have a threesome with 2 girls! But they left before I invited them back as the bar was closing I grabbed this one guy and said come back to the hotel and I’ll fuck you.... he did we had sex and we had a conversation but then he had to rush cos he had work in 3 hours I asked him what does he do ..... he’s a post man..... I told my friend she doesn’t let me live it down  and while I was doing all this I was still having odd phone calls from (my fiancé) 

Forward on. Few days after that night I met one guy through a girl I went to school with that night he asked me out on a date I agreed thinking he’s probably genuine but all he did was objectify me he was only dating me because of my good looks! After that date he dropped me off home and asked me if I got another date with another guy soon I said no and I honestly didn’t but when I got in the house it gave mean idea .... well while I was doing the 3 Fs and other shit I’d have phone calls with (my now fiancé) and they were the best conversations he did ask me if we could meet but I always made excuses not to..... until 

I text him “hey wanna meet up for a drink?” 

He came in a heartbeat 

I was nervous at the fact I’m going on a “date” with a second guy in one day but this one was different 

He wanted to get to know me.... he didn’t try to flirt or drop hints we just talked and the whole time I wondered why isn’t he making the first move!? 
We walked back to my house so he could get a taxi home I thought ok let’s try this I leaned on him for a cuddle he was just nervous but just let me cuddle him..... but nothing I gave him a hug before he left 

Second date..... same thing only just cuddling and holding hands....(come on kiss me fool!) 
I went outside for a smoke I called my friend asked her what should I do she said get back in there and eat his face!(haha) so I came back and just kissed him! We were seeing each other for 2 weeks I went to his place to watch a movie 
It was late so I stayed the night he was such a gentleman he was about to head for the sofa I told him come on we can share this bed we ended up making out and almost one thing lead to another but then I stopped I thought no! I can’t fuck this guy then forget him he’s such a nice guy this will hurt his feelings then he said we don’t have to plus I want you to be my girlfriend ..... I said yes then seconds later gave in we had sex and damn for a guy who was “out of action” for 6 years I actually had an orgasm like ladies! Proper orgasm! 

We were together for a year an a half and within that we moved in together and he proposed to me...... after all the crap I went through I thought I’d never love again 
"
I don't know if I want to stay with my girlfriend...,"Hi All,

First and foremost this is a throwaway account. One I used a long time ago and hoped I would not have to again.

I am posting here because I am unsure if I want to continue to be in a relationship with my girlfriend.

The basics of our relationship: We are currently long distance and have been for the past six months. Prior to being LDR we had been together for 4 months. We usually see each other once every month/month and half for around 4-10 days. She will (hopefully) be back in mid June. We have dropped the ""L"" bomb. This is my first ""real"" relationship.

Why I am unsure: There are a few reasons.

1.) The feeling of growing apart. The last few weeks especially. We have both noticed that we don't talk as much/as long. I have told her many times that my life has become very routine (Go to school weekdays, go to work weekends) and that most of my days are the same. I do not have much to talk about. I don't think she fully believes this because I find her bringing it up more and more that I don't talk to her as much. I don't know how many more ways I can explain this to her. I visited last week and it was incredibly awkward. Due to her work our time together was very limited. When we were together it felt very awkward and like I was with a stranger. She is usually very touchy with me (wanting to hold my hand, kiss me, have sex, etc) but when I was there she didn't make an effort to do any of these things. I did not feel wanted.

We also argued practically the entire time I was there. I expressed to her I am feeling a lot of the frustrations that she is feeling (not talking as much, feeling distant, etc) yet the issues never seemed to get resolved.

I've made an effort to talk to her more via text since it's easy and can be used at just about any time, yet when we do text she appears to have nothing to say. So I guess I am confused why she's getting upset at me for not talking, since she appears to be the same way.

We used to feel very close and comfortable with each other, but I have noticed that begin to change.

2.) I am not present on her social media.

This may sound petty, and I apologize if it is. But it truly does bother me.

She is very active on two social media apps; snapchat and instagram. When we are together I will post photos of us with each other; she does not. This by itself doesn't bother me.

What does bother me is she previously had photos of us together on Instagram, but later archived or deleted them. I don't understand this. She told me she was trying to get rid of a bunch of posts on Insagram, but later re-added a lot, but none of them with me in it.

This is a minor one, but it does seem a little weird to me. I feel like she is keeping me a secret, strange considering her family and friends know about me (I've met them)

3.) She talks to guys I don't like/she's had issues with.

I want to clarify that I in NO WAY have an issue with her having male friends. I have plenty of platonic women friends that she knows about and that I see regularly.

What I do have a problem with is she still talks to guys who have blatantly flirted with her/tried to get with her while we are dating. Now let me be clear; she has not hidden this from me. She has told me about whenever if has happened. I have told her about 1,000 times ""Just block them, just ignore them, just tell them to eff off"" but for whatever reason she won't do that. At first it didn't bother me, I assumed it would blow over, but it hasn't. It has not been the same guys for these past 10 months, but when a new guy starts pulling this she doesn't seem to tell him off.

Example: She was here for her birthday and this guy, who I know she has has relations in the past, began to message her on snapchat, saying they should ""hang out"". She knew what this guy was about, she knows what he wants, he has made it clear he wants to hook up with her (she has in the past, she has told me this, I do not have a problem with that) but rather than say ""I am not interested, I am in a relationship"" she just kept saying things along the lines of ""Sorry, I'm busy aha"". I asked why she just didn't tell him off and she didn't really give me a reply.

She also still talks to this guy who I really don't like. She told me several months ago (when we were not LDR) that he was asking her to send him inappropriate photos, and that she figured out he has a girlfriend; a fact he hid from her. She told me he knows that we are dating. I talked to her about it, told her to confront him, and she just never did. From I understand she kind of just ignored it until he stopped. Now I find out, from the last time I was over, that they are still talking. I know they have been friends for a while, but I also know that this guy is WEIRD (We went to a waterfall once, she posted a picture and he said ""That's where I will propose to you""). He lives in America (we are Canadian) so I know they aren't hanging behind my back or anything. I do not understand why she would be friends with this guy. If one of my lady friends messaged me something like that I would probably not continue speaking to them.

4) Her life is incredibly chaotic.

This may be the biggest.

A few months after we got together she told me she had to move back home to another province for work. The month leading up to that was an absolute nightmare. She would cry everytime she had to leave me to go to her apartment, goodbyes took up to 40 minutes of me hugging her, letting her cry and telling her everything would be ok. She also struggled to make rent during her last few months here and I lent her around 300$ which she still has not paid back to me. I spent virtually all my time and money on her to ensure we had a good summer before she left (camping, roadtrips etc), I probably spent upwards of 4,000$ (nearly all my savings). I did not hold any of that against her, I willingly paid for everything and I do not regret that, it truly was an unforgettable summer.

She has a rocky relationship with her mother, who she is staying with at the moment. They fight quite a bit; her mom is really overbearing and not at all supportive.

She has several mental health issues that she is seeking support for. She usually attends counselling once a week, though this has stopped for a bit due to work. She is also on several medications. She actively seeks help, but when she is off her meds or not at therapy she is a cloud of negative energy that I can no longer deal with.

I want to make it clear that I hold no ill will against her. I love her very much and I want to support and help her however I can, but I don't know if I can be in a relationship with her anymore. When things are good they are really good, when they are bad they are really bad. I am not sure if I can handle this much longer. I find myself stressing over this more often than not.

We have had many good times. She is the first girl I have ever loved. We have memories that I look back at fondly.

But I don't know if we will be able to make many more.

If you took the time to read all of this, thank you very much.

Any advice would be appreciated.

Many thanks."
Guys on motorcycles...,I’ve always thought guys on motorcycles were so hot.. gawt dayum
Why it's so hard to get up in the morning.,"Hey guys. Gonna start off this post by saying who I am. Im a 19 year old female. Im graduating high school soon and going off to college. Im well liked and have a mom and sister. My dad passed away when I was young from brain cancer. My mom just remarried to a jacka$$ who is loaded with money, but empty inside. I live in a beautiful house with everything I could want. 

With that being said. I am chronically depressed. In and out of my relationships in my life, I am completely lost with no reality of anything. I want to die. I pray every night that god takes me. I live in constant pain and constant emptiness. I want to take my life. But don't know a way of doing that. 

I do not want college. I am being forced. I want my dad back. I want happiness i want to die. I hide everyday behind a smile and nobody knows, but they will soon because I will be gone. 

I just want to die. Please take me universe. "
I feel like my fortune and streak of privilege is leading up to a tragedy,"All of my life, I’ve never experienced the death of an immediate family member. The last death of a loved one I was most affected by was my dog. Up until then and after that, I’ve been lucky enough to never feel the heartbreak of losing another close loved one. Because of this, I feel like in order to make things fair, life will send me a horrible tragedy involving a family member. As a junior in high school, this is one of my main issues right now. I feel like my life is determined by a written script and my life is predestined. Can anybody relate? This is something that I’ve REALLY need to get off my chest for quite some time now. Thanks"
My 4-year-relationship ended late January because I found out he was cheating on me with strangers.,"Honestly I’m so hurt. This is such a fucked situation and I’m so angry. Someone I really loved and trusted hurt me. They may not have intended for me to find out, but I did. 

They claim that they still love me and never stopped caring about me, but they don’t care about me enough to be faithful, honest, and committed. They don’t care enough to want a life with me. I mean more than a fuck buddy but less than a girlfriend. 

That’s so, so fucked. I don’t deserve this pain. I was a great girlfriend and I’m a beautiful, caring girl. I’ve never intentionally tried to make him feel bad, but the other day I was feeling so much anger and pain that I went off on him and blocked him. 

Then, of course, unblocked him and apologized for what I said. And he hasn’t texted back. I told him it’s okay if he doesn’t want to talk anymore. He didn’t text back. I have no idea if he’s blocked me or not, and if he did that’s my fault, because I told him to leave me alone. 

Everything hurts so much. I’m proud of myself for dealing with it and I’m taking care of myself with sleep, a good diet, skin care, exercise, and getting work done. I’m being nice to myself. I just can’t believe this is happening to me. It feels like a long bad dream. Nothing makes it better, it’s just pain that comes and goes in a never-ending cycle."
"""I Can't Wait for You to be a Mom.""","I was laying in bed this morning, I just got these new pajamas a couple days ago, but last night was the first time I actually wore them. Navy blue pants, the top I was wearing had different blues in an abstract design. All was soft and loose.

My shoulders don't stay in place when I lay on my side since I have Ehler-Danlos Syndrome (and neither do my hips really, but they're harder to fall out of place, fortunately), and so my hips look really big when I look in the closet-mirror when I lay down. Particularly, with these pajamas, my hips/butt looked *pretty* big compared with how small the rest of me looked. I don't even have a pear-shaped body (much love to my friends who do though, you're beautiful) but it definitely looks that way when I side-sleep.

So this morning, I looked at myself on the mirror while I was still laying down, hair a mess, mom-glasses, mom body-shape, mom-pajamas, and then it hits me that I totally look like a mom. That's not a bad thing, I just realized it and found it funny. I chuckled and Sarge, my boyfriend of 7 years sits on the edge of the bed and asks what's so funny. I say ""I just realized I look like a total-mom. Oh Lord- I'm so dorky!""

He smiles and leans down to kiss my temple, and in response says:

""You're not dorky, Mayhem-Love. *I can't wait for you to be a mom*.""

*INTERNAL SCREAMING INTENSIFIES*

I don't think I've ever loved a person more in my life (I've never been in any other relationships but that's besides the point). We've unofficially begun trying for a baby for almost a month now. We're starting early since A- we're ready, and B- I have some fertility issues as it is, so we *better* be starting now.

Hearing him say this was indescribable, I just needed to get that off my chest. <3"
Can't stop thinking about my crush and I hate it so much:(,"For some context I am a 23 year old male who has never dated anyone before. That being said i've had a crush on the same girl for months now, and I see her every morning at my gym, I doubt she knows and to be honest when we talk she really does not appear interested in me. Ok then if thats the case then I need to just forget it and move on right? Well I agree, but I just cant get her out of my head, and I keep fantasizing about a relationship with this girl. Im very self aware of how delusional I am but yet I have no control over my thoughts. It feels like ill always be crushing on this girl and I hate it so much. I have been trying hard to distract myself by staying busy, and focusing on myself but eventually ill always end up thinking about this one girl and how much I want to be with her. my mind seems to be convinced that this one girl is the only one I want, but on the other hand I know my mind is just playing tricks. It's just an overall frustrating situation that shouldn't bother me as much as it does."
A Few Months Ago I Accomplished My Dream and Flew My First Commercial Flight as an Airline Pilot and All I Could Think About Was My Parents.,"I'll keep it short and sweet.

I always lacked quite a bit of confidence in myself when I was younger and I didn't think much would come from me. My dream was to be an airline pilot and my parents supported me the whole way. 

It took some years of hard work but my whole life changed. My outlook on life, attitude, personality all improved for the better. 

I remember I almost cried when I called my parents to let them know I got the job. A few months of training and studying and I finally had my date for my first flight. I told my parents and they we're excited for me. 

I remember lining up on the runway and being passed control of the airplane. We got cleared for takeoff and my hand advanced the throttles, feet off the brakes and we started rolling. I couldn't help but smile and think of my parents. Hoping they're proud of me. 

The best part of it all was that my first day of flying ended in my home city where my parents still live. They tracked my flight and watched me come in and land. I knew they were there watching me and I can't explain to you how happy it made me. 

They gifted me a beautifully framed photo that they took of me coming in. It's so clear you can see me in the cockpit. It's incredible and I look at it all the time. 

I finally feel like I've become someone my parents can be proud of which I realize is the most important thing to me.

What do I do now? This is my story #Metoo,"The summer before I became a junior in high school I was becoming more aquatinted to someone who I had mutual friends with, we'll call him Blue Eyes. You see Blue eyes was a troubled young boy, who grew up in a very tumultuous situation. He was raised by his single mother, who worked long hours and was gone from the home frequently, he also had a much older brother who was a gang member and a drug dealer. Blue Eyes was in band with me, and he had invited me to go to church with him on Sunday Morning. I'm not particularly religious but I was happy to be out of the house. After all, band camp started next week. We went to the sermon, and afterwards we decided to go back to his house to smoke weed. I was 16 and he was 18. He was growing it in his room, next to the mattress that was leaning up against the wall. He had a large couch across his room, that faced towards his computer with the window behind it. He told me to take a seat on his couch and he was going to be right back. After a few moments he walked in and said the bud wasn't ready, but his brother had something else: magic mushrooms. I had grown up enjoying hippie rock, and was curious about trying psychedelics, so I agreed to take them. He left once more and came back with what must have been 5 or 6 grams of dried mushrooms, we split it in half and began chatting about the effects. He had taken them a couple times before, and reassured me that I would be fine. After about a half hour I asked him if I should be feeling anything yet, he said yes, and then left the room. He came back with a couple more grams of mushrooms and told me to take more, he told me it would be okay, so I ate them. About thirty minutes later the mushrooms kicked in and I started having an alright time laughing at the ceiling and seeing the fan blades whip around in the dim room. He had closed the door and turned off the lights, the drugs were hitting me tenfold. I began to feel tired, and uncomfortable in my denim shorts, so I took them off and asked Blue Eyes if we could sleep. He said sure and spooned me on the couch, my face was towards the back of the couch, and he was spooning me. I fell asleep, and I recall having an extremely vivid dream. I was floating on my back in the ocean, and waves were splashing over my face, making it hard to breathe. Suddenly while looking into the bright sky, glass shattered above my face, and came crashing down over me. I started violently shaking my head back and forth, realizing what was happening. I was awake, and Blue eyes was inside of me. He was raping me vaginally while I was unconscious. We were both fully nude, and I was now screaming and crying. My commotion must have scared him because he pulled out and tried to get me to be quiet. I didn't know who I was, where I was, or what was going on. I kept repeating over and over, ""You had sex with me, you had sex with me,"" and each time he would respond, ""Yes we had sex."" He finally managed to calm me down after about an hour or so, and I told him that I had to pee, so I got up and ran to his bathroom, through the hallway, and past his living room. I was still nude, and he came running after me with a comforter trying to cover me. I had stopped in front of the bathroom door when I heard him calling, he came up and wrapped the comforter around me and at that moment I blacked out and my body went limp. He opened the door, and shoved me in the bathroom. I fell to the floor, and he shut the door behind me. As I got up to crawl to the toilet, all I could hear was Blue Eyes brother screaming at him, ""What the fuck is this about?! You fucking owe me for this! You fucking owe me!"" Suddenly the door opens and blue eyes puts my clothes on the counter and tells me to get dressed and closes the door. I put my clothes on, and wash my hands. Unsure of what I'm about to walk into I open the door and am greeted by three men completely silent and staring through me as if I was a ghost. The older brother and his friend had come home, and they knew we had taken their drugs, but his brother seemed more concerned about if I was okay. He helped me up and we went back to Blue Eyes room. I sat on the couch, as blue eyes brother stood in front of me keeping me distracted. He made blue eyes sit outside of the bedroom door like a dog. His brothers friend left to get some milk to try and help me sober up. We talked for a long while, and I managed to get lost staring at all the different textures. Eventually I was able to drink some milk, and feel a little better. Suddenly there was a loud knock at the door, and I was sure it was the police coming to take me to jail for doing drugs. It turned out to be one of my good friends who I had told about blue eyes (The friend we'll call DOJ). He brought me outside and I realized that he was there with another mutual friend (Leonardo), and of course my incredibly angry and scared mother. She yelled at me all the way back to DOJ and Leonardo's apartment complex. Leonardo left, and DOJ told my mom that he would look after me, since I was sill extremely out of it, and she had work at 5am. It was now about 12am. We go back to my moms house, and I go to the bathroom, my mother, and DOJ are standing there watching me piss in the toilet and simultaneously vomit into a small waste basket. The last thing I remember about that night was looking up at my mom and smiling the biggest smile after she said, ""You're stoned out of your fucking mind.) The next morning I woke up to an empty house, and sat in the shower until the water was ice cold. Trying to scrub the grimy, dirty feeling off of me, but it didn't work. Blue eyes, if you ever read this, I hope you know how much you have torn me apart as a human being, I have evolved into someone who wishes you would have murdered me that night instead, because at least there would be a sliver of hope that you would have been convicted.  Sincerely, SunflowerPits790."
I'm finding it difficult to control my negativity towards African Americans.,"I'm a Chinese-American, born and raised in California. I've always lived by principles of tolerance and acceptance, coming from an immigrant family, but lately it has been getting hard for me to look at African Americans in a positive light. There have been more than a few experiences that have led me to this point.

&#x200B;

\- I'm on the street talking with family on the phone. Car drives by with two African American males who proceed to yell out the window ""Get your Chinese Ass off the phone.""

&#x200B;

\-I help an elderly African-American lady into her wheelchair. She complains that I let her down too hard. Her daughter proceeds to say ""He's Chinese they don't know what they're doing.""

&#x200B;

\- Walking along the street I pass a group of African American youth who shoulder check me and call me ""chink""

&#x200B;

\-I am returning a rental car with a friend, and the African American woman at the counter accuses us of a scratch on the car that was already there. When we explain she makes fun of my friend's accent and maintains that we do not know what we are talking about.

&#x200B;

These are just a few excerpts from my daily life. I kept my mouth shut every time, not wanting to stir up trouble but I'm really fed up with this. For the record, I haven't gotten this kind of treatment from any other demographic, it's limited to the African-American populace in the area. 

&#x200B;

Of course, I know this is not representative of the entire population. But after so many incidents I feel despite my best efforts I can no longer maintain a healthy attitude towards this demographic."
A life sentence: Married to a mentally ill person who has literally nobody but me.,"We have been married for nearly 10 years. We spent the first several years rather happy, living abroad and travelling. He asked to return to North America so I got a job and we moved back.   


He hates it all. To be fair it is a red state so there's not much to like but he is miserable every day. I've tried to take him to places, meet people, get into hobbies, but none of it takes. I don't see my loved ones much because even though he says I can, he always gets annoyed that I was ""out all day"" while he was alone (even when we invite him). 

&#x200B;

No, nothing is all bad. He loves  me very deeply for who I am in spite of  how damaged I am and how bad my communication is with him (I'm one of ""those"" people who get excited and interrupts. I've really been working on it). Our jobs are both openly hostile to us and we will not be returning at the end of our contracts. He wants to move and I've been doing everything I can to find jobs for us elsewhere, but very few cities pass his smell test. 

&#x200B;

Anyway. We are both mentally ill and have tried multiple treatments and doctors, which doesn't make anything easy. I mean, it's hard to blame a person with psychosis for choking you when they thought you were a robber through no fault of their own. 

&#x200B;

Our financial situation is shit. He asked his family if we moved to their country if we could stay in their spare suite and we just got ""We'll talk about it"".  So we all know that means no. How the fuck could I ever be mad at someone who wouldn't even have their family to back them up if I decided to part ways? He has nothing at all in this world but me. You'd think he'd realize that and stop what he's doing to me... but I guess that's mental illness. 

&#x200B;

I swore a vow, sickness and health, good times and bad. At least the bad times will make me stronger somehow. 

&#x200B;

Young people, listen to me. YOU CANNOT FIX A PERSON. You can love them, be there, etc, but at the end of the day you cannot FIX them. The voices in their head will tell them what they want to tell them regardless. If they are a narcissist then nothing you say or do will change it. Don't have babies or get  married to people like this or you'll end up like me.

"I (20F) just want to move to California and be loved, but I feel shady for it","Hi everyone. This is my throwaway account. This topic has been on my mind for a while now and my apologies if it isn't coming out perfectly. I'll try to keep this short. I've always wanted to live in California. I was born in Poland and I moved to Vancouver Canada with my family when I was 5 years old. I speak fluent english, everything ""American"" is how I want to live my life. I've always wanted to meet a nice American man with family from somewhere like Colorado or Wisconsin. Then we would move together to live in Los Angeles and be happy, doing stupid shit like learning to surf. I want to do this with someone from somewhere cold, where they'll also appreciate California and all it has to offer just like I do. I feel like a gold digger or a green card scammer when I only swipe on guys who are from Seattle as opposed to Vancouver on dating apps. Is that wrong of me to discriminate that? I just want to be able to enjoy this ""fantasy life"" I have created for myself and I want someone who wants it too. Los Angeles just feels like home to me. I love it so much and I want to love a life partner in that city. We could visit their family and fly out to their home state for american thanksgiving and to mine for canadian. 

&#x200B;

I don't know what I'm ranting about honestly. I just feel like a dick for preferring Americans, but I want to live a very specific life. Is that wrong?

IDK"
My dad died yesterday.,"He had a heart attack while he was running with his friend yesterday morning, and died immediately. He was only 53, in great health (an ultra-marathon runner) and we have no family history of heart problems. We were so close, and I have no idea what to do with myself. 

I'm only 23, I don't want to bury my dad. I don't know how to feel or what to do. I'm so lost. I just miss him. "
I don’t understand my ex-girlfriend,"We've been together for 4 years (also living together). I'm 27 and she's 29. We broke up a month ago. I did want to stay with her (even though we were having problems that needed to be sorted), she's the one who decided to leave.

Before the break up she was always crying about us. She asked me to stay in her life, to keep seeing each other and that maybe we might get back together in the future. She even asked me if I'd like to sleep at her place from time to time and if she might come to mine when she wanted to.

All of this changed the day she moved her stuff to her place. She almost stopped texting me. She rarely wants to see me. She never wrote anything like ""I miss you"", or something. She almost seems annoyed when I get in touch with her. She doesn't even want to have a phone call with me.

I mean, this is not the same person that walked out of this house a month ago. What happened?

I'm talking about a woman that was so jealous of me that she'd have killed if a girl was interested in me. Now she doesn't even want to know what I'm doing and where I'm.

She was so worried that I'd just forget her, because she didn't see me crying or anything. Now I'm the one thinking about her every single second and she's the one that doesn't even care.

Any ideas?

Thank you!"
I hate who I’ve become.,"I hate myself overall, I wish I could restart my life. It ain’t that deep. Dammit so many opportunities I’ve missed. So many moment I’ve fucked up. I wish I could reset."
Afraid of letting my husband and daughters down,"TLDR- I’m depressed. Recently got my PhD. My family is depending on me to make a career move and I just want to stay in bed all day. 

So I was diagnosed with dysthymia, insomnia and social anxiety about 3 years ago. I’ve been “feeling” depressed for over a decade though (lack of interest in everything, crying everyday, not feeling genuinely happy anymore, just feeling like a failure), just confirmed it when I went to see a psychiatrist and got started on medication immediately. 

I considered myself having lived a decent life. I was the valedictorian at my high school graduation (highway GPA), had 2 friends I liked hanging out with, always had scholarships to pay for all my college and university studies. Graduated last week with my PhD in a biological science field. In the meantime, I got married 7 years ago, we have two children (5 and 2.5 months old). We dropped everything and have been living in Japan for almost 6 years (during which I got my Master’s and now my PhD degree). And I’ve been feeling increasingly worse about living and myself. I can’t explain why, it’s just something that’s been growing in me.

I genuinely want to find someone to kill me just so I don’t have to do it myself. All my life, I’ve had pressure from my parents to be the perfect student and I’ve been that for them. 

Now, I have a whole family relying on me to make the next move. If we decide to stay in Japan, I would be responsible for getting a work visa and everyone, including my husband, will continue to be a dependent of me. My husband will never qualify for a work visa here because he has no education beyond high school and you need a college degree to even be considered to receive a working visa in Japan. So being on a dependent visa, he can only work 28 hrs max (not enough money). I’ve been trying for the 9 years that I’ve known him to motivate him to get a degree and he’s started things and stopped every time. At one point, I’ve even offered to take some online courses for him so that he could get the degree but the one I started, I didn’t have time to finish because at the time I had to write some papers for my PhD. 

So, anyway, I applied, got the visa and got a job where I’ll have to be separated from my soon to be 3 months old for nearly 12 hours a day (8 hours work, 2 hours lunch break and 1 hr commute each way) for 5 days a week while he gets to work 3 days a week.  

If we leave Japan, everyone is still relying on me to start a career elsewhere because I’m the one with the specialized PhD degree so obviously I should be the one working. And he says he will follow me wherever but we agreed that the safety in Japan is suitable for our children at this age, that’s why we are still here. We can’t go back home right now because our neighborhood has become a war zone and it’s not a place we want to raise our daughters.

Problem is I spent most of my days unable to go to my lab (during my PhD program) because I was too depressed to do anything. I literally spend weeks at a time, stuck on my bed, no joke. 

And I genuinely need an hour to motivate myself to step outside the house. I cry for seemingly no reason. I feel like I’ve done all I could do, I got my PhD, I have two daughters, and I feel like there’s nothing else I can handle at this point, in terms of pressure from others. I’m so incredibly tired of being that strong girl/ woman that everyone is relying on. I just want to stay in my bed as I normally do. 

The thought of going to work and having to be there everyday with a smile on my face (English teaching job) is scaring me because I just don’t think I have the strength anymore to please people and pretend to be happy outside of home. 

I feel like I’ve been working hard my whole life to be great and now I’m completely satisfied being a bum at home, I’m just over life. "
I don't know why I still wish you cared,"It's been over a month since I've heard from you. Your asshole of a husband, the one that cheats on you, abuses you, decides what you can and can't do with your life. The one you've known for only a year, decided that you can't maintain a friendship with me anymore. We've been best friends for 6 years. 

I got into an car accident today, had I been a metre further into the intersection I most probably could have been killed. I sent you a message on Snapchat, because that's the only form of communication you haven't blocked me on. I thought maybe you'd ask if I was okay. You spent a lot of time in and out of hospital during our 6 years, and I was always there constantly checking up on you, to the point where I was disciplined at work for keeping my phone on me when I shouldn't have. You opened my message, but nothing. You don't even care enough to ask if I'm okay, I could see that you find the time to talk about whatever bullshit you were talking about to other people, but can't find the time to check up on me. 

I wasn't expecting this to fix every thing that's broken in our friendship, but I did hope that it would at least establish some form of communication between us again.

Fuck you"
$2..... NOTTTT 2$,The mother fucking dollar sign goes BEFORE the number... I see this all the damn time and it bothers me. 
Gums are receding,"I'm not old, 32, and they're receding on the upper left, and I think even the front two. There's sensitivity in one tooth on the upper left.

I don't know why it's happening.

I also don't know how long before it's bad enough that I have to remove teeth. It's so fucking depressing because nothing can be done about it. Fuck."
I am a Muslim hijabi and I pray every single day for peace and harmony amongst everyone.,"We live in divisive times, and more than anything, I wish to have peace, harmony and tranquility. I wish we could all work together, live alongside each other and be respectful and understanding of one another’s cultures, beliefs, traditions, faiths and ways of life. Why must there be so much hate in the world? Why must there be violence? Cruelty? Racism? 

I am an early childhood teacher and I use my job as a way to affect change as much as I can with the kids I teach. I teach kids of various walks of life and I teach them to that each person have their own lives, their own stories. And each of those stories are valuable. It doesn’t matter the skin colour, the faith, the culture, the country, the way a person speaks - everyone is the same inside. Everyone wants to belong and everyone wants to be heard.

We are all humans. We feel, we think, we breathe. We live and we die. Why do we fight amongst ourselves. To what end? 

I just wish all the hate and violence would stop. "
Im stressed,"This is a very stressful time rn. It is the end of the marking period and i just got accepted to my dream high school.
I have to choose whether or not i want to transfer hs (im currently a freshmen).
I want to go to study art but i dont want to loose my friends. 

Just stressed and have a limited amount of time to make the decision. 
There is an open house which im going to for sure. 
Feels better to talk about it.
Thanks for reading

Peace✌️


Edit: this completely unrelated to what was said above, but i have a friend who recently broke up with a boyfriend who was sort of abusive. She doesn’t talk about it much

She came to school the other day sobbing because she was stressed, scared, and just depressed. 

I want to help but i don’t know what to do. I had her go to the guidance counsellor for some help, but she isn’t talking much. 

I know what she is going through with depression, and sometimes for me it’s best to just be left alone. But i feel like she needs to be around people she trusts and people that care about her.


I just want her to be happy. But i don’t know how to help her."
fuck college,im currently at Juilliard doing acting and i wanna drop out. i love acting but this is. WACK. 
I'm addicted to sweets/chocolate,"Some people says chocolate/sugar can't be addictive, but I disagree.. As someone who is 23 and 420lbs mainly because of sweets I completely disagree.. I eat fruits, veggies meat etc. I love healthy food but sweets are killing me.. 
I get nervous, mad and aggressive if I don't eat chocolate every day.. I realise it's killing me and constant fight with myself is ruining my mental health.. I know I need to lose weight and I've started many times but I keep falling for chocolate.. in fed up and thinking locking myself on the unfinished apartment in my 
House to battle addiction.. 

Sorry of this doesn't have any sense.. it's written in anger "
Thought you were slow-fading from a great week of dates.,"Actually contacted you twice to ask what was up. You said you were confused how you were feeling and swamped with work so I attributed it to losing interest and a perfunctory excuse. 

&#x200B;

Anyway you texted yesterday. You said you've been fantasizing about me fucking you for the last two weeks. Whoa whoa there! 

&#x200B;

That's a huge compliment. I want to for sure, but I want to get to know you a bit more before it happens. 

But if we get dinner and/or drinks and you invite me up I'm going to push you up against the wall and stick my tongue down your throat once we get inside your place. I don't know how long I can hold out. We already got a bit hot and heavy before and I stopped it. "
Early birthday present to myself ... law school rejection emails,"Besides being the only senior probably left in this town while the others frolick in joy on spring break, I've had a wonderful pleasure of finally hearing back from my law school of choice. My hope school. Not much to my surprise it was short and to the point. Why must I constantly fail? 

&#x200B;

\*stars\* said if you think it and say it aloud it will come true. Its less than 24 hrs from the day this life cycle started 22 years ago and things have just flat lined.

&#x200B;

I don't want to do the same although I've peeked over the edge of the sidewalk almost everyday.. i feel like I'm on the floor getting jumped.

&#x200B;

kicks to the stomach. punches to the face"
It really is better to tell someone how you feel instead of holding it all in.,"I am so sorry about the other night. I am sorry I overreacted and made you upset. I should not have acted the way I did and I know you are probably still angry with me and I completely understand. 

&#x200B;

A few months ago, I realized that I still have feelings for you  and it has been killing me inside. I know I shouldn't feel this way because we are such good friends and we worked so hard to fix things the last time I told you how I felt. I can tell that you do love me as a friend, just like I love you. But I think things would be so much easier if we were more open with each other about our feelings. Instead of holding everything in, I should have told you. I know you don't feel the same way. I feel like I probably missed my chance, so I probably deserve this. 

&#x200B;

I really did mean everything I said that night. I still love you as a friend. I have learned to appreciate you and I would hate to lose you, but maybe after all this, you probably don't want to talk to me anymore and that is ok. Yes it kills me to know you are about to go on a date with someone. I am sorry my jealousy got the best of me that night. I really do wish you the best. I understand that I cant force anyone to like me back so if you found someone, go for it. I will not intervene. 

&#x200B;

To answer your question, I cried because of you. I was angry because you spent the whole night flirting with all those girls. I know you wanted to go home with someone who wasn't me so you don't have to pretend to be the nice guy who stayed with me because he wanted to.  I am sorry I held you back. and also, no I did not have a good time. I was angry most of the time because I really wanted us to catch up. I wanted to hear more about you and what we have been talking about for months, but you didn't want that. 

&#x200B;

You gave me my first kiss that night, and I am guessing that most people make a big deal over this or possibly get attached. But don't worry. I will not get attached. I don't think this is a big deal because I am sure it didn't mean anything to you, so it doesn't mean much to me either. I am not even going to wonder why you did it. We can pretend it never happened. We can blame it on the alcohol.

&#x200B;

If you ever decide to talk to me again, I hope you don't use anything I told you that night against me. Please don't take advantage of my feelings. You don't feel the same way and it's ok. I'll be fine if you treat me the same way you always have. I will still be there for you if you need someone to vent to, or when you need help on something. but please don't let this go to your head. Don't ever think that everything I do is because of you. It really isn't. I am a grown woman. At one point, I thought about changing to become someone close to your type, but I have come to realize that I love myself too much to do that. I am who I am, and I am not changing for anyone. 

&#x200B;

So for now, I'm ok with not communicating. I think we both need time to clear our heads, and you probably want to be ready for your date next week. I wish you the best and that it works out. Maybe this girl will be the one. who knows. and I hope she's everything you wanted in a girl; everything that I couldn't be. "
Really big crush on gym manager,I think he’s like 10+ years older than me too.... Homie really got me buggin... Got bit hard by that love bug 
I'm Sinking,"Hi, all, this is a throwaway account.  I use it to vent out my depression and bad occurrences in my life.  I recently got into a minor accident and lost my driving privileges and now a psychic basically called me a failure, after a reading.  Her cards said that I'm never going to be able to hold a job...  Funniest thing:   currently, I'm trying to land a tech job.  Tech (well IT) is something I've had passion for since the 5th grade.  If I'm able to secure a job in my field of study, I can try to rebuild my social life once I save enough for a decent car. Here's to hoping all goes well.  Anyway, besides mental issues, there are outside forces that are draining me emotionally such as the lack of a social life, declining family relationship, and scarcity of relevant postings on job boards.  After getting certified, my hope in achieving a better future has been declining at a slow pace... Shit is starting to hit the fan with my folks, I lose my driving privileges, I'm starting to believe that I have autism, I'm cutting off therapy because my dad is going to lose coverage, and I just might lose the only friend I hang out with soon...  I don't know what to do."
Dad broke my heart(again),"I will try to make this short, here is a quick trivia on what happened in my ''life'':

I've been assaulted(physically/mentally) by my mother since I was a toddler, all those years I thought it was a normal situation because of her constant manipulation and making me feel worthless until the day I turned 18(legal adult age here), where she kicked me out and told me she wanted to abort me. So fast-forward, I live exclusively with my dad now, things have gotten a bit better for me but I'm still not loved as a child (or at all), he only worries about what I will achieve in academia/joblife and said on multiple times that I'm a complete failure, shut-in loser. 3 days ago things got worsened because I felt belittled by the way I was treated(constantly yelled at/remarks) so I stood up for myself and said ""Be careful with your words'' , which resulted in him yelling at me to leave the house. So I did pack my things in a hurry, took my uni books, some money in a backpack , got down the stairs, my aunt stopped me and begged me to stay, he didn't do anything to stop me. I broke down and cried all night in my room because it's the second parent to tell me to go away, it felt like re-opening a wound. It's calm with my dad for now but I still feel immensly hurt and holding my tears in public is difficult, the fear of having nowhere to go is permanent after this. I don't have any friends or somebody to talk to, so I say it here."
My mate keeps unintentionally cock blocking me,"I’ve started seeing a girl that I met through a mutual friend’s birthday party. We’ve hit it off brilliantly after a few dates and admittedly I’m really smitten for her. However, the mutual friend we have seems to be doing everything in her power to fuck things up for me without even knowing it. 

We were out for St Paddy’s and I was queued up to buy both girls a drink. After a considerable amount of time I finally make it back to the table and hand them their drinks. Miss cock-block however decides to take both drinks and down them before I can even say anything! I’m noticeably pissed at this but keep my cool and proceed to queue up again. Its frustrating for her to do that because it’s giving me less time to speak to this girl I like and also more money spent unnecessarily. 

Fast forward to later when my crush is leaving for home and we finally have our first kiss, but we can always count on miss cock-block once again to ruin the moment. She interrupted us and spewed all over our shoes, completely killing the vibe. 

This friend of mine lives a couple towns over from the city so I of course offered her to crash at mine instead of paying for a taxi home. We got back to mine and I had blankets and all set up on the sofa for her, but by this stage I was pished and she had to help me to bed. Next thing I wake up in the morning with her beside me in bed.. completely unwarranted and creepy. 

To make matters worse, she sent photos of me passed out in bed with her to a group chat that the 3 of us are in. Whilst the photos were admittedly quite funny, it obviously gave off the worst impression and my crush was noticeably upset about it, assuming the worst. The air is cleared now and I’ve assured her that nothing happened between the two of us, but I’ve been raging about it since and felt the need to vent at least somewhere. "
why am I still in love with my ex?,"I dont know what to do anymore, i want to get over my ex but its hard I cant really explain the feeling its almost of feeling of not finding someone else? i dont really know. This girl honestly changed my life for the better so I thought she found me at a bad time in my life I was super depressed and she came at me with some super genuine things I thought it was real. everything was good between us for about 3 months and them when she saw her ex with a new girl she completely changed tldr she did seem interested in the slightest after that didnt put in any effort. I loved this girl with all of my heart, I loved her, her family and most importantly her kid so that could be a reason Its hard for me to move on. skipping forward towards the end of the relationship after months of not getting treated right she really turned into a different person then she set herself up to be it felt unreal so I brought up the idea of breaking up and she agreed and had the whole sob story of she needs to find herself and that she needs to be alone and better herself and agreed that we were meant to be but it was the wrong time. skip forward a week she says that her baby father found out something that I did on fb something really small like looking at his page or something so my ex blocked me on everything and i havent talked to her since then and that was last summer. skipping forward a couple weeks after that one of her friends let me know that basically everything she told me about herself was lie and everything that she did was a lie and at that moment when I was told that I felt some type of closure idk. so i felt over her for awhile then I thinking about how she treated me and I become to hate her and at this point I become super depressed recently the hate has wore off but Im still super depressed tbh Ive been super depressed since we broke up and its even to the point where Ive wanted to kill myself its crazy. Also I forgot got to add about A month after we broke up she had already gotten new bf so you con imagine how I felt about that, and also a number claiming it was her texted some lovely dovey stuff so you can imagine how I felt when that happened andf thatwas a month ago. Im sorry for the long essay but I felt like I need to get thing stuff off of mychest this has been in me for a long time and any advice would be helpful(also forgot to add the depressionand thoughts of her basically run my life and I sick of it I theres not a day where I dont think about ending it all because of the pain this all  causing me) "
Oh god I’m scared of dying,"Inb4 ‘everyone’s gonna die’

Ugh I hate the paranoia of planes coming to blow everyone up and meteors coming to kill us all and headaches which are brain tumours 

Ughhhh"
Demographic gatekeeping has been bothering me for a while,"Irl, it’s not really seen as a big deal around my groups of friends or any other person I’ve talked to outside of these groups, but online it seems to have become such a big deal recently. 

Lately there’s been a lot of generational gatekeeping and it honestly bothers me. I’m aware of how controversial and cringy of a topic this is but I had to get this off my chest.

I know it’s mainly a lot of media doing this, but I am 18, and I am an adult. It irritates me whenever I read or hear someone reference 18-19 year olds as “teens” because it just seems purposefully demeaning.

It’s especially frustrating whenever some of the people on certain subs and irl start gatekeeping me and other people around my age, 18-22, into generations, not to mention the constant, neverending argument of ‘generation dates.’

Now I’ve always seen myself as a millennial, I’ve had the same experiences and went through the same phases as everyone else in my age bracket, I’ve grown up around and knowing these people for the majority of my life, and a good number of elements I grew up with and my beliefs align with the majority opinions of my age bracket. So I can’t help but feel frustrated whenever some random stranger on the internet tries to gatekeep me into the newer generation, gen z, trying to tell me and others around my age what I “actually experienced,” despite me having never experiencing any of the ‘gen z childhood’ things.

So I usually scroll and ignore, but it still bothers me.

It’s even more frustrating because some years ago there was no doubt which generation I belonged to and no one seemed to care, me included.

Irl, I don’t feel as frustrated because the majority of people I’ve encountered don’t really care, and when the topic does come up, it’s generally agreed that 18+ is an adult, and I’m treated as such. Same goes for generations, pretty much everyone’s in consensus that all legal adults are millennials and vice versa. It’s when I’m alone scrolling through reddit and catching up on the news is when it gets difficult to contain my frustration and keep scrolling because of the sheer amount of gatekeeping I read on a daily basis.

Does anyone else feel this same way, or am I just letting the little things affect me too much?"
“Hey” - a text from an ex,"“Hey”


My manipulative and abusive ex texted me this two days ago at 10:45am. After a year of not speaking, a year of his insults and verbal attacks in my head, a year of me being alone after he manipulated our friends to his side, a year of me trying to get over the worst time in my life. A year of trying to figure out if I was sexually assaulted numerous times by him. I haven’t replied, more on that later.


The last time we spoke, or should I say he spoke at me, he told me that I was a horrible person. An emotionless robot who never cared about him. That his family hated me. He told me he only pressured me into sex I didn’t want because of something I originally did; as repayment for me upsetting him. Stuff like that. He never took any blame, for anything.


It was the worst time of my life. It still hurts sometimes. I miss the people who used to be my friends.


But guess what, you abusive asshole? I don’t give a shit about you or your opinions anymore. You’re manipulative, self centered, never take the blame, and you have a small dick. You had the audacity to text me “hey” and nothing else? Are you stupid? You think I would respond to that? ...Ok well I was considering saying “new phone who this?” but held myself back. Why would I say anything besides that to you? I could not care less about you.


And guess what else? Some of the people who you got on your side have reached out to me recently. Apologized for not standing up for me. Agreed that you did some horrible things. Agreed that I was treated unfairly. They want the best for me. So fuck you and your holier than thou attitude and victim mentality. 


I guess I kind of lied before. I want you to text something stupid like “hey” again so I can rip you a new one. If your reason for contacting me is anything besides wanting to apologize for the two years of absolute shit you put me through, then you can kindly go fuck yourself with a cactus."
I felt a bit embarrassed and hurt by what my friend did.,"They recently sent a pic of me in my old uniform at some fast food place I was training for (which took a whole damn month to do and I never really got to work), that I then quit. 

I ignored my anxiety because I really wanted a job to make my own money and be responsible, but that led me to almost having an anxiety attack in the restaurant and the employees asking why I was nervous. Plus, my mom had to have surgery on her knee and I wanted to be there to help her walk and all that. 

She gave me a ""told you so"" talk when I told her the incident and it just upset me a little. I knew I had anxiety, but that not excessive and I thought I would get over it. 

My psychotherapist even suggested not getting a fast food job because of my severe anxiety

Anyways, my friend poked fun at it (knowing all of that happened) and I felt humiliated in a way on our group chat, so I showed some offense and closed the app. They said they were just kidding, and I knew they were, but knowing how much of an embarrassing and serious fallout that was and everything else with it, did not sit well with me. 

I'm usually a laugh it off kind of comedic person, not really sensitive that much, but that just wasn't ""right"" for me in a way. Is it weird that I just didn't sit well with that? I didn't get pissed or anything, just had a ""but why"" king of subtle reaction. I'm not an angry person. So I didn't throw a tantrum or make a fuss about it, just a bit offended that's all. I don't want to make my friend feel bad either. It's a mess of mixed reactions. "
Is there still any light at the end of this?,"I just found out this subreddit and wanted to get off this one over my self that's been weighing me down for months already.

I seriously don't know what to do anymore. I have a job, I should be proud of my status, but nevertheless, it feels like this is just an escapism to my part.

I tried to review for my board, but for the nth time and already lost count on it, I failed again on the preliminary exam which is required to pass before I can take it.

Going to 30's with only a job that's been for a year and a half. I should have been in a stable one, building my life, but no, I'm still stuck in this loop.

I wanted to try to change, but this body is not cooperating with me. I know, I know very well that I need to do this, do that, easy to think, easy to plan within my mind and brain, implanting those thoughts over and over again, but actions on my part isn't doing well. 

Currently on medication on inactive tb, despite that, I can feel that there's still wrong with my body that I do feel weak, every time I wake up, being tired after work, despite that I should have more energy to do things, to read my book, to learn things but no. . . It's falling down on me.

Whenever it's my off on work, I can't do anything at all, despite of wanting to push myself to do this, to pursue this, my mind and body keeps falling asleep a lot of times and the next thing I knew Monday is waiting.

I wanted to do more, I wanted to achieve more, I wanted to improve further, but why isn't my self cooperating with me?

I don't want to think about it, but I may be on the depression side already, the one I wanted to avoid the most as I don't want my grandparents who are already old to be bothered by this.

I just don't know if there's still any light of hope at the end of this road. . ."
mother in laws be nice to your childrens spouses,You dont know everything. Dumb moles
i wanna be completely honest with my parents.,"both my parents are very kind people and i love them, although i never actually in my life have told them. i have, for the most part, told them everything and told them when i’ve done something wrong. just recently i’ve come to terms with my sexuality and told a couple of friends and they have been very accepting! which is a good thing! 

it’s not that my parents are homophobic, which i’m very thankful for, but the thought of coming out to both of them is terrifying. when talking about lgbtq+ things they always tend to stay off the topic or get too into it. my parents grew up in completely different time period then i have. when mentioning things like queer eye or queer artists, actors, or anyone my dad always says something that puts me off. he says things like “i respect but it isn’t normal, at least not for me” or when i mentioned queer eye to my mom she said “don’t you go turning gay”, but i think she suspects i am. most of the time i try not to think about these things. 

i so badly want to tell them and just have it off my chest but i can’t. the only family member i’ve told was my brother right after he picked me up from a friends house late at night. i really don’t have the guts to tell my sister or my parents over the fear they will treat me different. i’ve talked to friends about this and they told me that i necessarily don’t have to come out, just one day bring home a girl and see what happens. it’s kind of stressful keeping this all to myself because none of my friends really understand. :( 
"
Mixed feels,"There was a woman standing on the corner of the street, in the parking lot of a wal mart. She was holding a sign that read “Just lost my job, I have kids, need food and shelter. Anything will help.” 
I gave her the only 8 dollars I had in my wallet. Now all I can sit here and wonder is if that was legitimate or did I just give my last 8 dollars to a scammer. 
It always hard to tell, and you want to the right thing and lend a helping hand, but you don’t want your money going to someone who is scamming you. 
Does anyone else get mixed feeling when donating or giving money to a homeless person?"
The internet has made me feel that most people are nasty towards others,"Using message boards and seeing the way people talk to each other when no one can see them has made me feel cautious and wary of people in real life. People are a lot meaner than I thought they were... 👀

I wonder what people say about me when I’m not there now "
Why I hate myself. Short,"So I hate myself because of one reason

Personal abuse,depression, awkwardness, and feeling left out because of my adhd. I always can’t meet my parents standards, while my little step-sister can easily and it hurts. I have tried therapy but we just played fecking card games XD. 

Also it’s because I’ve gotten a more rebellious phase now. I hate listening to my fecking mom. Ever since they got divorced I’ve sided with my dad because he is easy. Also his house (my OG house; mom had to move) It’s way easier to be at my dad. But now I feel like my adhd and rebelliousness has gotten to me and taken over my soul making it black af. Now some of my teachers I don’t feckin listen to. I used to be a good child


Also can someone please explain what TL;DR means"
What would you do if you were me in this situation?,"If I sometimes mention something cool or interesting to an acquaintance, he will usually respond with a condescending answer. Some examples from over the years:

Me: So check this out. This guy worked at Kmart and he preserved these cassette tapes that played over the PA system. They played over and over again.

Him: *chuckles* Well that sounds like typical corporate punishment.

Me: ... (Don't know what to say)

Example 2

Me: So I got some new records for Christmas. One of them was Bill Haley and his Comets: Rock around the Clock

Him: You know it's actually pronounced 'Holly'. They had to change the pronunciation to fit with the comet.

Me... (am put down from his response)

Example 3: (he has long hair)

Me: Can you headbang?

Him: Kaydus, What do you think? I've listened to heavy metal since I was little, do you THINK I can't headbang?

Me: ...

I usually dread being around him a lot. I've tried to cut him off, but other friends invite him and they don't see the problems with him that I do. I try to talk to them but they don't understand how I feel. I've had to decline invites with them too. 

Not only does he come off as one-upper, it comes off as bragging to me that he buys expensive anime figures with his high paying CAD job he got straight out of college. It drives me fucking nuts. I've known him since middle school, and even then, he was constantly corrective to me. Because I was dumber and had a thinner skin, I tolerated and went along with it. Now I am older and fed up with this behavior.

he is the only person I feel competitive towards. Interestingly enough, I don't ever feel this way towards anyone else. If a close friend were to graduate, get a good job and such, I would pat him or her on the back, say 'Good job, dude.' and move on."
I think my anxiety is destroying me,"My family has always known me to be a worrier and to be cautious. I like all of my plans in life- big and small, to be well thought out and executed. I’ve always had a plan to be successful by 30 and to me that means house, marriage, kid. I’m 26 now and I feel like everything I’ve had my focus set on is going down the tubes. My job sucks and everywhere I’ve applied doesn’t even respond to me. I hired a resume writer that turned out to be a scam. I live in a shitty apartment in a shitty city and can barely make ends meet because of my crippling student loan debt. On top of that, all of the people that I thought were my friends have completely written me off with no explanation. I have no friends in the city that I live in and can’t afford to go out and meet new people. I’ve developed some health problems that I can only attribute to CONSTANT stress and worrying and it’s to the point where I cry every morning and every night thinking about the next day or the day ahead of me. I’ve reached out to family, friends, my partner and my doctor and no one has given me any advice or encouragement that things that are going to get better. I feel like my life is a constant nightmare that is never going to get better. I used to be the life of the party with friends that I would die for. Now I feel alone and invisible to the whole world. 

It’s nighttime so cue the anxiety. I feel like such a failure. 

Sorry for the long post."
"Tried to stay with “friends” for St. Patty’s, ended up in middle of domestic dispute and a hand on my throat.","This is still developing. I just got home after a long 14 1/2 hours with my so called “friends”. They’re a couple, the female being one of my former coworkers and I had known very well. Her boyfriend is someone I’ve always had great interactions with and he considers/ed me one of his closest friends (long shifts with him at the bar lemme tell ya). Things start off great. We’re drinking, cooking fish n chips as well as shepherd’s pie, and singing to some good classic jams. The whole night is great. Something I’ve REALLY needed as of late, because my depression and anxiety have been CUHRAZY. We all laughed for hours and had a great time.. until about 2. Around then, my friend and her boyfriend start going at it quietly subtly... until it escalated over the hours. I had put on Winter Soldier for us to watch because they hadn’t seen yet. They started yelling and went to their room. At this point is when I THINK I heard a slap. I wasn’t sure, but my friend came out crying. I out loud started saying “what the fuck, what the fuck, what the fuck.” He stormed out and said “you talk to her and help her.” I exclaimed that I’m not her boyfriend and I shouldn’t be the one to help her, and he just left. So here I was... sitting on the kitchen floor while my friend sobbed and said “it’s my fault, I’ll fix it, it’s my fault.” I have family who have been in abusive relationships, so I was having none of that. I calmly just said to her that it’s not her fault, that she’s a beautiful strong person, and gently rocked her. He came back for a moment to get a beer and I said “dude I wanna go home, come do this, you love her right?” He ignored and just went downstairs. I kept up the same thing for awhile until finally I had enough. She got up with dignity as well and we agreed I was gonna go home and she was gonna figure it out. As I walked down the steps and to my car, He exited his vehicle and started begging me to stay. “Stop man, c’mon you’re my friend, don’t you see what she does, I love you, you’re a great person, you help her in ways I can’t.” I was just... I was so fucking tired you guys... and I had several beers. I shouldn’t have been driving. So I relented. I said “okay, I’ll stay, but I have to sleep. Please. Just let me sleep.” He understood and hugged me. He said he was sorry multiple times. I marched to the steps with him and back inside. I laid onto the couch and he talked with my friend. Everything seemed great... SEEEEEEEEEEMED... I was almost asleep when I realized I heard a hard knock and my friend was in the room with him again. Round two. I was positive there was a hit this time. My blood boiled. I started collecting my things as my friend came out into the living room. Boyfriend fumes behind her but sees me leaving and starts the act again. He tries to pressure, but I said “you guys have to figure your shit out. I recommend just sleeping separate for tonight the talk after a couple hours. You love each other.” I just wanted to leave at this point, clearly throwing concern to the wind because she can’t be helped if she doesn’t want to... that’s when the boyfriend yelled at me and said “SHUT THE FUCK UP, JUST SHUT THE FUCK UP!” I warned him that no one talks to me that way, not even family. I got angry and he apologized.. until I said I wanted to go. That’s when he took his hand and pushed against my throat and squeezed. This man has four inches on me and is a bodybuilder. I am lean and a runner with a “cute” build at best. I was scared for my life. I didn’t know what to do. So I hit his jaw as hard as I could and pushed him back. He flew back at a table and to the ground. My friend got between us and started telling me to leave, that I would make things worse. At this point, I was adrenaline survival mode, and I was ready for blood. I wanted another hit. This mother fucker put his hand on me for harm, I was ready. He got up and immediately tried to apologize, all while ALSO ordering us BOTH to leave “his” apartment (that she pays for). I said I was fucking out, which prompted him to try to hug me and apologize further. I pushed again and said not to touch me. He got huffy and screamed “It’s all my fault!” and ran into the bedroom. My friend went to the balcony for a smoke. I gathered my shit and went out for a last word of parting advice. 
“I’m not here to save you, that’s on you. This is fucked up. You gotta go.” 
She didn’t look up at me and said “just go, you’ll make it worse. He’ll get angrier. Just go, I’m gonna sleep.” 
I had said my peace and realized clearly I wasn’t going to do anything. I was still shaking. I was exhausted. I AM exhausted. I went for the door and heard the bedroom door open. I didn’t pause for anything, I ran out the front and to my car. I drove straight home and immediately started balling my eyes out in all the pent up fear and adrenaline. I was vibrating. I felt like I could hurl. I called my mom, who calmed me. I went to take a shower to cool off so I could sleep when I realize I had blood on my hand. It wasn’t mine. This sent me into a further tizzy, and I have spent the last 45 minutes in a shower crying and scrubbing. I was beyond scared. I’ve been through a lot, but never through someone with hands on me like this. I was terrified of the whole thing. I’ve blocked both their numbers and now I’m typing this before I pass out. I just needed to type it all out before I went to slumbertown. Thanks for making it this far, I appreciate the shared experience. Oh, and if you’re the boyfriend or my friend reading this (because I know they reddit sometimes) GO FUCK YOURSELVES YOU PSYCHOS! I EMPATHIZE WITH YOU BUT JESUS CHRIST!!! 

TL:DR - friends had me over for a blast and I ended getting choked out by my friend’s drunk boyfriend who clearly has a history of violent erratic behavior. "
"For the first time in my life, I feel so down, lonely and depressed. How do I overcome this?","I literally just created my Reddit account and can't believe this is my first post here :). But anyways, I just wanted to get something off my chest and seek some support or motivation or whatever..Not even sure if I'm in the right place.

As you read in the title, I feel so disconnected and unhappy over the last couple months like I never felt in my life before (I'm 27). I left my country and family behind to immigrate nearly 4 years ago. At the beginning, things were just fine as it wasn't the first time I got away from home on my own for a long time. But now, it started getting harder and harder everyday. My parents love and support me all the time, So, I don't have an issue there.

Now, I know that my long term loneliness plays a HUGE role in this. As per my personality, MAYBE I've never been a VERY easy going, or VERY social guy, BUT I don't really have problems with people either. The most common feedback I get from people is that, I have a sort of wall that prevents people from seeing/feeling me/my soul/my head.. and they get pushed away by that.  What really concerns me is that, I've been losing sleep and I hope it doesn't get worse because I can feel that as I sleep less, I feel weaker.. I'm also an over thinker, I worry A LOT about lots of things, specially my health.. and get anxious out of nowhere.. an insignificant problem on my body gets me thinking about a serious disease and trust me I go see a doctor every single time, imagine that ..

I've been thinking to change stuff in my life that I think it might be the cause of my feelings. Today, on the way to work, I read an article on LinkedIn and decided to delete my social media account (Instagram) where I spent a lot of time daily. I mainly use instagram to follow sports updates and news but in the mean time, of course I see the highlights of peoples lives and now I'm thinking maybe subconsciously that is depressing me? I also think about going to Gym and get in shape, maybe that will make me feel better too. I think I SUCK at making new friends, but if you guys have experienced the same and you know a way out, please help and share your thoughts.

Sorry for the long and disorganized scribing, I just wanted to start something here and get it out my head to see what other people think. Thank you for reading this.

Ive spent 5 years crying *long*,"
 I've just realised, I have cried every single night for the last 5 years although probably closer to 10 years when this all began.

  5 years ago, I was homeless, depressed ( with the added fun of auditory hallucinations and extreme fear), drinking every night so I could sleep and at a massive risk of harm from family members and an ex. 
  I had a son when I was 16-17 as a result of a rape.. I was too young and much to unprepared for him. 

I managed until this point when, living in a homeless shelter.. I followed his night time routine before taking a lot of antidepressants and alcohol.  I wasn't thinking at all of course, in my mind killing myself was the only logical answer to stopping the pain.

 Well, of course someone found me (routine checks in that shelter), called an ambulance .. I had vomitted whilst I was asleep so I guess that helped the OD, but I had to go into hospital... I had no one who could look after my son so children's services took him. 

  They homed him with his paternal grandfather, who was definitely the safest option considering how shit I am. He is so much happier there. 

I fought so hard to get him back when I had gotten a home but it was just too late. Children's services had taken out a protective order and special guardianship order because I am a piece of shit who was so far up my own ass with depression and homelessness that I couldn't be a good mother. 


 I attempted to kill myself again of course, I'll never forgot that pain, but obviously failed again.  At some point, I realised I had two options in front of me - kill myself successfully or to give life one more chance . I decided to try life one more time.

I stopped drinking, smoking and changed my medication to a better antidepressant (was taking mirtazipine, diazepam and zoploclone). I worked with counsellors and a CPN. I decided to go back to education and study nursing, which I am currently doing now. 

  I met my now husband whilst I was in hospital after ODing, he was visiting his father who was ill and he was such a sweet kind soul who then visited me every day I was in hospital just to let me talk.  It took a long time to come to a relationship but it was always going to happen I think. I didn't want to rush and he didn't want the circumstances to be wrong. 
  Naturally, we eventually had a baby together and she is absolutely amazing. Children's services had to visit me as protocol but after that 20 minute visit, they had no concerns whatsoever and we never saw them again.



I still hurt though, I deserve it beyond a doubt, but every single night I can not stop crying. I'm trying my hardest to do something that will help others because it is the only thing I can do to give me an excuse to still be alive.  I regret not being successful at ending my life, but I can hold out a bit longer until the pain becomes too much."
I was one of the organizers of a freshman camp for 3 years and they kicked me out without telling me,"This is a long story so tl;dr at the bottom

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I hated most of my class in high school, so I looked for other communities to be a part of; I got accepted into the freshman camp organizers and instantly fell in love with the whole thing. When I first started most of the old organizers already graduated except for 2, whom at that point did it for 3 years already. We made many changes some for the better, some for the worst but overall we improved the camp. If I look at the whole picture the past 3 years I spent making this camp were the best 3 years of my life, the community was amazing and after the first year I became the left hand of the camp leader. I was responsible for making the shirt designs for each year, making some of the promotional videos, taking most of the photos at the camp and taking around half of all of the videos that were made during the camp. Aside from this the 4 of us (the old guys, me and one more guy whom I’ll talk about later) knew the whole camp, the surrounding area and the 4-5 five day camp plan by heart and if anyone had questions we were the ones answering it.

The 2 older ones graduated and left 1,5 years ago, so the other guy who was younger than me (lets call him Rob) became camp leader because I was graduating as well the next year (1 year ago), but the other guys were helping as well from the outside. For the record the whole group was 18-23 people, depending on how many new students registered for the camp, a lot of the organizers were freshman under my hand in the previous camps. So last year when Rob was the camp leader it was the last camp for me and a few others and in the end Rob decided that he would leave with us, because he started with us and wanted to finish it together. Therefore, we had to get a new camp leader and had to get him fast. Some of the older organizers choose a guy (let’s call him Andy), that was in my opinion narcissistic and overall full of himself and to make things worse last years was his first camp so he had very little to no idea how the whole thing worked. On the last meeting, around half a year ago, I voiced my concerns about him, and the others reaction to this was that they put 2 others next to him to help him make the camp happen, the only problem was that these people for the past 2 years weren’t capable to do anything but what they were told.

I thought if I helped (on the expense of my very little free time) this year from the back, as the previous leaders did it, I could help the camp to not go off-rail. I put 3 years into this thing I didn’t want it to crumble because we, who made it this big and good, left.

I didn’t have much free time until recently, so I left them work things out. The first red flag was when Andy named himself “Boss” in the group chat (it was an ongoing inside joke that a few guys called me boss). The second red flag was when he recruited around 15 people to the 23 that we had (keep in mind that we had 120 freshman each camp at most). I messaged him that I don’t really get what he is trying to do, he said that they will figure it out, they are experimenting.

I wanted to go to one of the meetings to see how things are going, maybe help them a little, tell the new members how things usually go etc. but two and a half weeks ago I had to have an appendectomy, so I told them that I couldn’t go. Today I checked the group chat and I saw that I got removed. I instantly messaged Andy on what has happened and why didn’t they say anything to me. All he said that it was a quick decision and they could have handled it better.

**what. the. fuck.**

I put 3 years of my life into making this camp the best of it’s kind. (I have never heard of a high school freshman camp like this in my country and we searched for it). I have spent countless hours with the old ones preparing and making everything as perfect as possible each year. We thought them everything they know on how to make a camp happen. Everyone else of the old guys left but me, I was the last one who knew everything by heart and wanted to help. I was going to bring my full camera gear to record the whole camp and to teach the new media guys for fucking FREE and this is thanks. I didn’t even deserve a message telling me that they don’t want my help in the preparations. ~~Well I guess my fears got confirmed about the new leaders.~~

After I calmed down I sent a message to Andy stating that I’m not going to go to the camp, and that they can forget about the free camera work. I also told them that they have 1 week to save everything from my google drive (which was used to store pictures, shirt designs, videos and basically everything) because I’m going to remove the files from there.

&#x200B;

Well I guess that is it. I don’t even deserve a message telling me that they don’t need me.

I feel like they tore out a part of me. I want to scream and cry, but I can’t. I put 3 years of my life into this. I thought the people there liked me and that we were friends. After this half of me wants the whole thing to crash and burn, but the other half does not. I don’t want to see all of the hard work of me and my friends and ones before us got to waste, I don’t want our “legacy” to vanish.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

tl;dr I was the organizer of a freshman camp for 3 years and this year I was going to help them from the outside. The new camp leaders removed me without telling me and it hurt me really bad."
I'm like... Pretty attracted to you,"Everytime we speak, I feel my face flush red. My pulse quickens. My palms get sweaty. I know it's the initial stages of arousal and my sympathetic nervous system is perfectly functional, but I wish I could chill. 

I love when I make you laugh but it makes my heart race when I watch your nose scrunch up and your mouth smile. I wonder how you think of me? Maybe I'm just the silly, young co-worker who is still naive af on your eyes, or maybe you think something else about me. "
I don't have it in me to forgive my parents,"I dislike my parents. My mom is always so loud and I don't want to be like her. My dad has been absent almost all of my life because he works abroad because currency in Egypt is apparently trash. Earlier I had a clash with my mom and she involved him and he had the audacity to tell me ""you have changed"" and he knows nothing about me to even say those words, but regardless of that it really hit me because yes i have changed from how i was raised up. I smoke. I get sexual and to them and to the society i live in ""a muslim country"" i can fit the category of disgrace and disappointment really well. I lie to them almost all the time because i don't want to get into useless loud arguments. I get high to distract myself from my family. My dad has always been toxic to my mom. He used to physically abuse her and these memories still replay in my head to this day , seeing your mom's head crashed to the wall by your father and her blood spots on the wall and mirrors and her passing out on the floor while your dad shouting at you to get her water to wake her up is just a typical day in my life. But I think my conscious tend to hide it all the time because denial helps me a lot honestly and i can go a day thinking like stuff like that never happened. I just came to terms earlier that my family is dysfunctional. My mom used to take the anger transferred to her by dad on us. She used to beat me when I was younger and now that I've grown up she still does it when she loses it just not as much. I don't remember my parents ever showing affection to us. My dad acts cold all the time but i don't blame him since I don't really know him as a person. But when it comes to my mom I realize that she never hugged me. I can be sobbing in my room and my mom would hear it and still go to work anyway without wasting 2 mins comforting me. She can lie about me to dad to gas him up on me because i used to take his side when she had arguments with him and in spite of how emotionally careless she is to us, I think she has done a lot for us but isn't it how parenting is? My mom acts all the time as if we owe her something because she didn't leave us behind. She uses religion all the time to back herself up. But it's just never valid. I don't have it in me to show them love anymore and it's killing me. I can't bring myself to be empathetic with them because i know i would burst in tears because they always break my heart. People always overrate how a  relationship between two individuals in love can fuck you up when it's over but family can screw you up even more and in that case you can't do anything about it but stay silent and show love because how dare you not do that when all they did was work their heart out to provide you money to go to uni, travel for vacations and have smart devices and let you live your life however you want with your choices because according to them when you are not a hijabi and are able to wear whatever you want from tight jeans to bikinis is considered freedom at it's finest to my parents and they make you feel privileged for just being a human being. They screwed me mentally. I still have bruises on my body till this day from my mom but I just can't complain.  i just wish they could own up their shit and admit they were wrong, even slightly wrong I would be satisfied so much. It's just they never do, and they never will and i don't know if i'm able to forgive them for making me the person I am today. They are getting old now. They are on their 50s and nothing can change them. I just wish i can be able to be nice to them without having to find it harder to breathe. I don't have the courage to tell anybody about it because i hate playing the victim card. My mom is obsessed with making her family(us) look the best and make you wish you were her. She cares about how people think so much. I could go on forever but digging it up would make me feel even worse. "
Help. Girl dropped the L bomb after 6 days.,"Da fuck. 

So basically, I met a girl last week at a club and ended up going back to hers which would seem like a typical one night stand (something I rarely do). 

We’ve messaged each other every day since, talking quite a lot. 

A bit of background info - I’m a 20 year old guy and constantly get told how good looking I am off a lot of people. I always feel really embarrassed when people tell me this and don’t know how to respond, often feel quite uncomfortable since I’m somewhat shy, I guess I don’t like the thought of people being jealous of me which I sometimes feel, especially over something that I had no control over. (I know it’s not something to complain about as well but ye)

If I was looking for a relationship with someone then obviously personality is the most important thing and can make someone infinite times more beautiful to me.

This girl is 18, not bad looking but not really my type, and her personality (to me) is mediocre. We’ve seen each other a couple of times since the first night, went to dinner once and the other time she came over to mine. She’s already asked what I’m looking for, whether it’s just a bit of fun or if I’m open for it going further. I’m going away this summer for a few months so I told her something along the lines of ‘mostly just fun since I’m leaving but you never know’because I’d feel like a dick for saying ‘just a bit of fun’ but I should have just been honest so this is something I’ll need to clear up.

Anyway we went out on a date tonight, it was okay but I think she knew I wasn’t all there. I told her goodnight over message and she replied saying ‘good night LOVE YOU’ followed by several hearts. Me being an idiot and not knowing what to say I just said ‘aww gd night ly x’... so less enthusiastic but still, I’m silly. We’ve literally known each other six days.

I know she’s not as mature as me and maybe doesn’t mean it but fuuuuuk I feel uncomfortable and I never make things easy for myself. I’ll probably bring it up tomorrow and be honest that it’s moving a bit too fast, and that I’d like something causal but is that even an option now lmao. Shes also told me not to leave,  that she’ll miss me loads and that she will probably cry. Definitely feels like she is quite immature compared to myself. We don’t have much in common but do get on well and have a laugh. 

Thoughts pleaseeee "
my sister molested me when we were younger .,"i know the title sounds so fucking weird . 
but was around 6 when it started shes 3 years younger then me (im also a girl) , and i dont exactly wanna go into detail of what happened but yeah . it was bad . the last time it happened is probably when i just turned twelve. im now going on 14 . 
and i want to let someone know so bad . but my sister is the golden child , there isnt a thing in this world she can do wrong and know it starts to feel uncomfortable just to look at her . i just now started to realize this wasnt okay WHAT SO EVER !!! 
and she knows that but she moves on like it never happened . ive began to have nightmares and random panic attacks while sleeping in certain positions, 
because we used to share a bed . and that when it would happen ... i just want it all to stop . 
everything . ive always used to deny that something so horrible couldve happened to me , by someone whos supposed to protect me . and now its hard for me to connect with people and the reasons im so rude to her no one knows . but now i just feel like crying all the time . she gets to have this life where she doesn't give a damn what she did to me . 
id tell her to stop or i dont want to do this anymore it feels wrong . but she'd always find some way to tell me its okay .. or even tell me other sisters do it too . 
or this is the last time . or some other BULLSHIT . 
and now its just all too much . i cant not think about it. 
i dont know how to end something like this .. so yeah .. "
My father's really messed me up,"   I'm seriously done dealing with this bullshit. I go downstairs for dinner, or I'm sitting on the couch watching tv and my dad just HAS to fucking do something to me.

 If we're eating dinner and I'm sitting next to him, he'll grab my leg or pretend to stick his hands in my food. He'll make vomit noises or stare at me while I eat, which makes me lose my appetite and want to leave. 

 Let's say I'm watching tv on the couch, if my dad is sitting there he'll force me to go sit by him or he'll move closer to me. He'll grab my hair, hold me down, or keep trying to tickle me. I hate it. Even if I just walk downstairs, if he tells me to ""come here"" and I do, he pulls my hair or some shit. If I say no, he'll be petty as hell and get up, follow me around staring at me or try to grab my hair and tickle me. My mom doesn't do anything. She either thinks it's fine because ""I'm laughing,"" yeah no shit... it's the normal response to being tickled even if you hate it, or she says ""I'd be careful of that little one, she can fight back if she wants.""

 He constantly says he ""owns me,"" he ""brought me into this world and can take me right out,"" or that since ""it's his house, he can do whatever he wants since I live here."" The fact that he always acts like, and says, he owns me, especially since I'm not 18 yet, he can do literally anything he wants.

 I'm at a point where if I'm sitting in class and my friend makes a slight movement next to me, I flinch because I assume I'm going to be tickled or grabbed at. It doesn't make things better that I have a cleithrophobia, the fear of being trapped. When I'm caught in his grasp, it scares the shit out of me in a way. I'm so scared of not being able to move or get out, being powerless or not strong enough to move myself away. I had an anxiety attack that lead me to tears because my friends dogpiled onto me before.

 It's not that he's a bad person, he's not trying to hurt or scare me, but he doesn't ever fucking stop. He's part of the reason I never leave my room. He's the reason I'm so scared of being raped or powerless to a future partner one day. If my own fucking father won't take me seriously when I say ""No"" or ""Stop,"" then what should make me think my future spouse would? 

 I have a physical aversion to any kind of close contact people make with me, yet I can't explain or put into words why. My friends just think I'm a little weird or mean about it when I say they're too close to me, but I just can't deal with it. I've lost trust in the people I know wouldn't ever pull shit on me, all because of a small, daily thing my father does.

 I kind of feel bad for my friends, they don't know why I hate physical contact or being really close to someone. They just think I'm one of those people that naturally don't like to be touched. I always get this weird feeling inside of me, like I'm not myself or something's off just because I'm too close to someone. At this point, I feel better off just being a little mean or strict about my boundaries if it means they won't do anything.

 Sorry to go off on a rant, and if you managed to read all of this... then damn, good job I guess. "
Have you ever watched your food travel across town for no reason?,"I have. I love having food delivered. To me it is the height of luxury. Obviously it costs more because you have to pay and delivery fee and tip and usually you have to buy more food than you normally would to not get charged a “small cart fee” so I don’t do it all the time. It’s a treat. Which is why it’s so annoying to watch your delivery driver get so insanely lost on the way to your house and there is nothing you can do about it. 
Has this ever happened to anyone else?
It’s happened to me a few times most recently it happened today. I won’t go into specifics because chances are you aren’t familiar with my town but the restaurant was between 5-10 minutes away and the driver ended up looping the city for at least 30 minutes. I sat there in the app and watched him get further and further away. 
I should have got the food myself but I was a work. It’s Monday. It was a weird weekend. I thought this would be a nice treat. Now the food I paid too much for us cold and my lunch is almost over. Yay!"
Only 3 people wished me a happy birthday today (not including my parents),"This year, I decided to get rid of my birthday from facebook and you know what happened? No one wished me a happy birthday except 3 people.

first person was my sister, and I appreciate the fact that she gave me a gift this year. Sadly, this probably will be the last time bc she's probably going to forget me when she gets married and moves out of the house probably by next year. I already don't have many friends, so it's kind of crummy knowing my only friend won't even have time to remember it.

second person was a friend I only know for 3 years who I see on and off bc we have the same classes in uni rn, but don't really do much outside of class together. The only reason she remembered my bday is because hers is the day before.

Finally, my best friend of 8 years. I share everything with her and do everything with her, only texted me hours ago.

I'm the friend who remembers your birthday and puts effort to remember your birthday and text you personally while also posting and texting a meaningful heartfelt post. Hell, I event wait until midnight strikes to wish you a happy birthday. I wish I had a friend in my life who would do that for me. Maybe I'm just too sensitive or too nice but man, do I feel like shit. My own brother minutes ago just texted me and didn't know how old I was turning,..My parents didn't even wish me a hbd and we live in the same house. I don't think they remembered until this afternoon in which they said we can celebrate maybe next week ""or something"". no special birthday dinner or anything (don't really care about presents). They are the type of people who say ""birthdays come and go...nbd"". 


Man, I feel so sad and lonely today. Just goes to show ppl only remember bc of a fb reminder. That's the only reason another friend of mine (friend x) for 10 years posted on my fb wall, after they saw the post of my other friend who had actually remembered and texted me (else friend x would have never posted, hell even personally texted me?!?) 

Hell, even FUCKING Google forgot my birthday and there's a different google doodle today when usually there's a birthday one. cries... just sad to feel forgotten or lonely/no friends."
"I (20, M) have gotten most of the emotional support in my life from men and have a fear of most women","In school I got made fun of by girls a lot. My mother and my sisters were constantly fighting and getting involved with the wrong crowds. My older sister told me most days “you have no friends”, “you’re ugly”, “you’re scum, adopted and a pos.” To be fair to her, she’d had bad choice in company consistently. Friends talking behind her back, she’d do the same. Usual teenage girl bullshit.
My little sister followed in the same trend as she did, except hers somewhat involved kleptomania.
I was the middle child, and they took it out on me, physically. My older sister beat me up until once in 5th grade I’d had enough and choked her out. She was in 8th grade at the time.

My younger sister did the same to me through high school, but because I was a boy. My criticisms were never taken seriously by my mother, only my father. And I would be grounded for retaliating. Which never involved punching or kicking as she did, but literally grabbing her arms or legs tightly as she attacked me. So that I wouldn’t have more bruises at track practice.

I learned to be gentle because hitting someone full strength regardless of your size fucking hurts. I learned to avoid most of the females in my life, because I couldn’t trust their behavior or any of their words. My mom tried to make us believe our dad was cheating on her, and didn’t care about us. Despite having numerous affairs, and once forgetting to pick me up from school because of one.
She wrote a letter to her lover that my dad and I found this past summer. She was going to leave all of us and my dad, for some guy J. But when she showed up at his house, he told her he couldn’t leave his family behind.
I mean if they were lying this consistently to their family how could I trust anything a female ever said to me.
When I was in 7-8th grade my father started divorcing my mom. Because of that letter, he’d found it much earlier than I’d seen it and confronted her about it.
He tried to have us over as much as possible and make his new house a new home.

I got pretty depressed with getting made fun of as one of the ugliest guys in my grade. The constant bereavement of my sisters and so on.
I once mentioned to the females in my family that I had thought about committing suicide before. They all did a complete 180, and started acting nice to me. However, it was only on the surface. They didn’t ask me about my day. Ask what was going on, they had a freak out and shoved me to a very sexist female therapist who assumed I was a problem child in the classroom and home.
I never said anything to them again, I bottled it up and pretended to feel better. I then stopped feeling anything all together, debated cutting myself, my face. Or just leaving.
I mentioned this to my friend H, He didn’t have the typical reaction or answer. The guy started pushing my buttons. Getting me really angry at him and being mean for “no” reason. I said let’s take this outside and I started a real fight with him. After we were done I kinda realized he went easy on me, he was 145 and I was 105 and he was 4 inches taller. And I asked him why he had to piss me off so much while we were cleaning each other up. Dude, hugs me and said man “I just wanted you to feel something. I know you’re not a psychopath, you’re my bro and I love you, I don’t care how gay that shit sounds.” I look back on that moment and think he saved my life.
We went to pax east both years after that, and he invited me vacationing with his family in Martha’s Vineyard. And with him it was always a great time. We never hesitated to talk about anything emotional after that with each other. He became my pillar of support.

A few years earlier, my dad had quit his job at credit Suisse, started a company nearby. And started spending more time as our father. He coached little league and softball for us as well as was just there more often.
When I opened up to him, he took me to the gym. I had to start with like 5lb weights on nearly everything and he was buff as shit. He can still do 275 on bench, squat 365 and dead lift 405 at 53 years old. He told me everyone’s there for the same reason as us, to look better naked. There’s no reason to be ashamed of anything you do. And he introduced me to some good guys all throughout my teenage years.
He taught me how to talk to random people, to be polite and kind. Told me about his crazy teenage years. Said I wasn’t a bad kid.
He urged me to go back to therapy and talk about all the shit in our family so I could work through it all and process. So I did and still do.
He taught me to laugh when people judge you in public, how to laugh at misfortune, and how to be a good person. How to apply for a job, that you should never talk shit about your friends.

One thing that I consistently saw the female members of my family do, was to talk shit about their friends. My sister complained that her friend A wasn’t showering, skipped a couple classes, smelled, was sometimes a moron, was becoming ugly. I told her, she’s probably just depressed. She said no way, and continued talking shit. That friend ended up attempting suicide later. And she survived thank god, but I remember thinking to myself. Damn I wish I talked to her. It’s no fault of her own my sister and her friends are like an ouroboros. My sister did a 180 and acted like she supported her through it but I knew better.
I am heterosexual, but I wished for most of my middle and high school years that I wasn’t. Being gay to me, meant that you could literally date a friend. And my dads best friend was a gay dude from the gym. He had a very healthy relationship, and I remember envying it. I know that not all gay relationships are perfect. But it felt like less drama. The girls in my life created most of the drama, so being with guys lessened it. My sisters had dreams of being powerful doctors or actresses, but all I wanted was to relax. To be able to chill out.
They pushed their chores onto me, blamed me for not doing them. I fed our animals, walked them as much as I could, did some laundry, loaded, and unloaded our dishwasher with my dad’s help. When he would request their help not mine, but they always had another excuse. The animals would be neglected and our sink full as soon as my dad traveled anywhere.
My dad’s my role model and my hero, he’s kind and also is probably another reason I’m alive.

To this day I still really don’t like being touched by females, despite having had a few female friends, some girlfriends, and finding love. I go to Brandeis, and goddamn some of these girls are really creepy. I had girls pull my hair at parties, quite violently, to get my attention. Had girls rub my chest, abs, or grab my butt, while dancing. Had girls pet my head. Had one girl lay on my bed and start undressing. Someone else also stalked me. The whole time I thought, what if I was doing this to you, and you didn’t find me attractive.
That would be sexual assault. What you’re doing is sexual assault. But instead of getting angry and telling them to fuck off, I say sorry I’m not interested. Or that I have other plans tonight. Realistically I’m walking away so I don’t punch them. My personal space is mine and those I choose to share it with. I barely hug my female friends, because being that close to a female is unnerving and scary to me. I’ve told this story to a few girl friends, and some have never talked to me again. Some called me a mysoginist.
Once while blackout drunk a girl got me to bring her to my room. I was too wasted and too nervous to get hard, so I couldn’t have sex with her. So I offered her to spend the night, have pancakes and bacon in the morning, maybe do some stuff then and drive her back the next day. She said nah just fuck me instead. I said no. She said well then eat me out. I did, then she tried to put my very flaccid dick in her. I said no. Then my friend knocked on my door and she left. Then ignored a text asking if she got back safe, another asking if her day was good. Hit me up a week later to smoke and fuck, told her I don’t like to be used like a fuck toy. Called me an asshole, I mean maybe I was being a bit judgy. But still I never called her any names.
Once a girl and I got caught having sex by police in my car. He asked if she was being raped. Really killed my mood, you know. I looked at the time and realized I was gonna be late to meet a friend. So I told her I’m gonna drop you off at your dorm, or you can come smoke with us and we can do stuff later. While in front of her dorm, she proceeded to get naked in the passenger seat and slap me, demanding I have sex with her. I told her it wasn’t going to happen, sorry. She refused continuously for 20 mins, until my friends almost cancelled. I told her, if she didn’t leave and get dressed at that point I would leave her there in her bday suit. Then she got dressed, left and spread rumors that I was an asshole. That I threatened to leave her naked and stranded for no reason.

I’ve never reported these incidents because people wouldn’t take them seriously. I’m a buff guy and some of these girls are barely 5 ft tall.
Brandeis says some guys are creepy, but Jesus I think these girls take the cake.
I’m now happy in my relationship of 6 months, but like idk if I’ll ever be able to trust females in my life with as much as the men.
"
I escaped a emotionally/mentally abusive relationship from someone on the other side of the country.,"I know it sounds absolutely ridiculous because how the hell do you even get yourself into that situation in the first place. If he’s in Maine and I’m in Washington and the only communication is FaceTime, texting, snap chatting and calling, then it should be easy to cut things off since it’s not face to face, yeah? I really am not trying to type this whooooole thing out but realizing that I was being held emotionally hostage and that I was being mentally abused was almost worse than actually getting out of it. Actually, no. Ending things was the for sure the scariest part by far. I started to feel as though I was craving his abuse because that’s all I knew. I accepted the love I thought I deserved. It went on for a year and he had me so wrapped about his finger I was completely blind from what he was doing to me. I kept him a secret for a year from all my friends and family so I had absolutely no one to talk to about what was happening. I couldn’t ask for help because I wasn’t supposed to be talking to him in the first place. I was really about to save up enough money and fly to Maine and stay with him and not tell anyone. If I ended up doing that I know for a fact I would not be coming back home. He’d guilt me into staying because he was so good at it. I’ve never met someone more narcissistic, manipulative and just flat out twisted in my life. I’m 18 almost 19 and he’s 19, almost 20. I let a boy 1 year older than me control me and change me to be someone completely different. I didn’t know how to operate without him the first couple weeks after ending things. I was a mess and I missed him. I REALLY MISSED THE ASSHOLE EVEN THOUGH HE ABUSED ME. This concept and this part in my life will always blow my mind. I’m proud of myself for escaping. "
This LDR is consuming my emotions,"We started off as LDR but after each visit these last 6 months, I got used to your presence and the routine we made where we had constant communication. It’s been a week since I dropped you off the airport and now you’re in Germany for military orders. But you just dropped that if your ROTC packet doesn’t work out you could be there for three years. So far the 8hr time difference isn’t bad, but you’re all I think about. I’m so sleep deprived from wanting to talk to you..I know you’re tired and still adjusting so the quality of our conversations aren’t all that right now. I’m learning to be patient and take it day by day..my schedule is gonna be busy again and I know it’ll take time but after another visit I’m gonna go back to being like this.. kinda paralyzed from this love for you. "
drfting apart from everyone,"i hate how everyones drifting away,

but then again..

if no one will make an effort to keep me in there life..

then why should i ?

It hurts my feelings when my coworkers talk shit.,"Two of my female coworkers always talk shit about “boring” people. They label someone boring and immediately dismiss them as a person because they aren’t fun enough to hang out with or into crazy partying. 

It hurts because I know this is aimed at me as well. I’m super shy and introverted, and I noticed my coworkers have been excluding me more and more out of events. Recently they were planning a karaoke night and literally invited everyone at the office except for me. Then the day before the event they acted surprised “oh OP are you coming btw?”

I was literally sitting next to them the whole time they were planning and asking who to invited, all while saying shit like “oh I won’t invite this person because they are too boring and quiet...”

And I’ve noticed over time they have been giving me more and more attitude. It makes working there so much less enjoyable

I can't feel anything anymore (?),"First of all sorry for my poor english and for the lack of formatting, not a native speaker and I'm from mobile
For almost four years I've felt ""depersonalized"" and I can't feel a damn thing ever since I've started feeling like this.
Since I was 13 (parents got divorced, they had been living in the same house till that point which meant a lot of fighting and all that jazz) I've felt depressed and anxious, now I don't know if I actually was because I never sought help from a psychologist but during that time I spent my day playing videogames, neglecting myself, social life, school and relationships with my family.
At some point (I think it was around October of 3 years ago) I started to notice what was going on in my life, what I had and hadn't done and what I was going to get myself into if I didn't act quick and so I decided (at 18) to go back in high school and get a diploma and to go to university and get a degree that would make me a molecular biologist or something like that.
So I'm currently in my 4th year of high school, I'm doing great at school and I've achieved decent things considering how bad was my situation 3 years ago but of all the good (and bad things) that happened since the first time I depersonalized I haven't felt one ever since.
I can feel emotions only partially (muffled probably explains better the way I feel), I haven't loved, nor actually cried every since, I haven't felt any emotion completely ever since and I don't know what to do.
To make the matter worse, since my parents divorce I've moved with my mom to a city +500 km away from my hometown, where at least I had 4 friends that I still love and that I get to meet during holidays and summer, but now I'm here and I don't have any actual friends, only acquaintances. I've also deleted mysocial network accounts some time ago because I spent to much time on them and I didn't want to become addicted to them and that made the friends matter even worse, because having social network at least made me feel like I had a ""connection"" with people.
and last but not least, a venting about my love life and how much I fucking hate myself: I haven't loved someone in a long time, and even if I find someone that makes me feel good and that I love I would probably have to stop talk to her because whenever I start to get serious with somebody I get too much jealous to the point where I am toxic and almo abusive which I fucking hate and I don't want anybody to bear something like that.
Sorry for this stupid and late adolescence venting post, if anybody made it to the end I hope you have a beautiful day. "
How to get over my first heartbreak,"I don't know how to move on from my ex. He was my first love and now my first heart break. I am 20 and he was 21. He always liked me since high school, but I didn't really like him and just wanted to be friends, but eventually I fell in love with him and we were making plans to move in together.

He said that he loved me and that he was afraid to lose me. We had plans to get an apartment together, as my parents are somewhat controlling and he wanted to help me out while I was in school. I had just lost my virginity to him after a five month relationship and then he dumped me the next day over a text message, saying that he was a bad guy and that I'm too nice and emotional for him. Most of my friends say that I got played. I find this hard to believe, as we had plans financially for an apartment and everything, but even if he did play me, I still love him regardless. I keep thinking I've moved on, but then his personality pops up in my mind and I remember all the things I love about him. I know that from the outside it seems like he was somewhat manipulative at times, as that is what my friends say, but I still see him as a beautiful person. I feel like no matter who I try to fall in love with now, I won't be able to move on, because I've already learned to love his good characteristics and overlook his bad and no one else is him. It's been a month and every morning the heartbreak feels fresh. The rejection is the worst part of the feeling I guess.

I just don't understand where I went wrong. He said I was emotional and I guess that's why he doesn't love me, but I'm going through a lot at the moment it seems like he would have been a little more understanding. I was understanding about so many things with him. I stayed with him and encouraged him while he didn't have a job and always made the extra effort when it was hard for us to see each other.

I feel so embarrassed for opening up to him, as I am usually shy and keep to myself. Even when I think I'm okay for a little while I end up crying in the grocery store or something. How long will this take get over and how can I cope?

TL;DR first love left me with little explanation and I just need some advice. Not sure how to move on without closure

"
I’ve never had a friend,"I’ve never been the social type to talk to people or go to parties. I’ve always kept to myself because I guess I have social anxiety or just regular anxiety that’s taken over my life completely. Over the years I’ve never had a friend and I know some people say that even though they have plenty of people on their side, but I really don’t have anyone. It’s hard to explain how it feels not to have someone to talk to about something exciting or something sad that you need to vent off to someone else just to feel better. It’s frustrating, sad, lonely and tiring when you don’t have a friend. I’m jealous of girls at the mall who joke around with each other and chat about anything because they are comfortable with each other. I don’t think there’s anything wrong with me, I’m not ugly and I’m not rude to anyone I do talk too. I feel like a freak knowing that I’m 21 and I’m alone and I have no one to go to in times of trouble. I want to know how you make a friend, do you just click? Or does it take a while to build a friendship? I feel so dumb even talking about this but there’s no one else I can say this too without sounding like a depressed millennial or something like that. It’s just something I wanted to say for a while. "
I made him mad again,He came in the room and turned the tv on loud so I grabbed my headphones and was probably gonna watch videos soon until he was done. After play fighting but deciding I didn’t want to anymore because he’d make sure to hit me harder than I was hitting him. So I laid down and put headphones in. Not too long after it mad him mad and I can already feel my chest hurting and my eyes welling up. He kept saying I was being stupid and idiotic and I apologized for it. He said I wasn’t sorry and slammed his fist against the wall and walked out to cool off I guess. I tried not to cry because it makes him more mad because that’s all I do anymore. ( he thinks I do it to play victim) 
To the asshole who hit my cat last night:,"What the fuck. I can't even begin to process what you might have thought. Did you think it was not your problem because it was just some stupid animal? Or did you freak out and not know what to do? Gods, I hope it was the second one.

&#x200B;

We were just leaving for the gym. My girlfriend saw him first, lying there in the street. It took me a moment to comprehend what I was seeing. I was certain he was just being silly and playing in the street, but as my girlfriend got closer I realized what had happened.

&#x200B;

The blood was still fresh. The body was still warm. It had happened literally minutes before. I know because I had seen the cat alive and well less than twenty minutes before seeing him in the street. Yet you were nowhere to be found. I know you live in our neighborhood. It's not like we live on a main street. So where did you go? Why didn't you even bother to move him? He was six months old. SIX. We tried to turn all four of them into indoor cats but we could only keep two and it didn't feel right to separate them, so we let them be. Of course now I blame myself for the kitten's death, and my girlfriend blames herself, but honestly . . . I mostly blame YOU.

&#x200B;

I saw him in my dream last night. He was happy, playing in the fields of Folkvang, climbing the tallest tree he could find and hunting as many cardinals and butterflies as he wanted. He's happy now, he doesn't blame anyone, and I know that should be all that matters, but it still cuts deep. He was just six months old . . .

&#x200B;

Goodbye, Smokey. Play well."
I'm tired of logging onto Facebook to find that a friend has died.,"I've lost lost three friends to suicide, one to brain cancer, one to a motorcycle accident, and one to the ominous ""found dead in her home"" at age 24. Another good friend was born with a disability called Spinal Muscular Atrophy, and he gets deadly pneumonia every winter. 

I'm so tired of losing people and wondering what I could have said differently to them so they wouldn't take their own lives. I'm not even into my late 20s and most of my friends are dead."
My boyfriend said he would buy me an engagement ring,"My boyfriend and I have been together for  almost 7 years. 3 years in he did this sweet proposal and said he would buy me a ring when he could afford it. Since we’ve had my son 2 years ago he isn’t worried about getting married anymore because “you never know what’s going to happen “. Fine. 
Then in February he says he wants to get me an engagement ring come tax time. I show him pictures of ones I like. I’m really excited. Taxes come and go and no ring. I don’t want to bring it up and sound bratty but I’m so upset. I’m a stay at home mom so I don’t have many things to get excited over. I was excited and let down"
"Often times, I do not care about my well-being.","Often times I wake up at 9am and I just lay there for hours on end. I avoid all calls/text from family and friends. The only time I leave the house really is for work and sometimes food. Really just for necessities. Every now and then I put up an effort to dress up and a fresh haircut but then I feel like...what is the point? Nothing really matters so why do anything? I am a lazy, good for nothing 29 year old. My life serves no real purpose and I'm basically just wasting space. "
This won't be very interesting,"Got a lot on my mind. Paper journaling doesn't cut it sometimes. Lost my job last week due to poor performance. Not all my fault though. Training was terrible. Got some ADHD and anxiety issues to work on though. Don't really know where to start. I'm going to the gym about 3 days a week, diet is reasonable, taking SSRI as prescribed.

I sent a resume to my best chance of finding a new job with **3** typos today, but they are not particularly noticable. Still feel fucking stupid though. 

Gotta fix my sleep cycle. Getting drunk early and passing out might actually do more good than harm. The quality of the sleep will suck, but the hours during which I sleep will reset. Maybe it's not that simple though. "
Thanks,"You made me realize that I never want to be with someone who made me feel unimportant. I would’ve given you everything but you left me with nothing. You changed your mind at least : times about us and I want someone who’s certain not someone who I’m worried will leave me .  I was never enough for you so I’ll be the nothing to you, you wanted. You fell for someone else while we were dating, you left me in the dark and distanced yourself then complained why I was clingy, and I’m sry my scarred heart was too much for you. I realize I did stuff wrong too but you could have given me a chance to change. I’m done wasting my time on someone who made me feel like nothing to them even though I thought so much u.  

I hope the next person you’re with you’ll show them how important you are to them. You’ll be the kind, caring, compassionate, and funny guy, I fell for, and not the flaky, inconsistent, and somber one I see now."
Fuck this,"On 3-4 my wife got let go from her job.  3-6  my dad got hospitalized due to a medication issue that sure as hell presented like a stroke.  The 12th he got moved to a nursing home for a rehab stay.  The 15th my wages got garnished for a medical bill(stitches when my daughter got cut).  So here I am with $4 to survive till the 29th.  No clue where the fucking hell my next meal will come from.  No clue how the fuck I'll make it till payday on gas.  A fucking tire in my car that is so bad I'm afraid to even really drive it(no choice tho)  and a dad in a nursing home that's called me all 4 of my siblings names but cant fucking recall my name.  Fighting with the wife who apparently thinks a lot less of me than I ever knew.  The worst part of all this is I was actually making progress on better myself.  Studying for a certification that would hopefully be a step in the right direction.   At this point, fuck it, honestly fuck it.  I'm with it enough to know eating a bullet would be wrong but holy fucking hell does it sound like a positive.  "
Looking Younger than Your Age as a Guy is Terrible,"I'm a 20 year old guy who can, depending on who you ask, pass anywhere between 14 years old up to my actual age. It's something that I've lived with for my entire (not so long) life. And it's terrible.

Every benefit anyone can think of for someone with a ""baby face"" and just looks young, has an abhorrent downside. Of the most popular:

***You'll love it when you're older!*** - I'm sure I will love the physical appearance, but when I'm older I want to have my life situated and settled; at least somewhat comfortable. Right now I want to live my life being young, making mistakes, and learning from them! All things that when I'm older, people will think weirdly of me for doing (as long as they know my age).

***You can get away with a lot since you look innocent!*** - And it's true. I've gotten away with speeding tickets by just playing the whole ""I'm still learning"". Except people also tend to not trust you, or deem you irresponsible. You have to work *twice* as hard to impress anyone. Imagine getting turned down from a baby sitting gig just for looking ""a bit too young"", or going to a job interview only to have the interviewers instantly go ""wow, are you sure you're in college?"".

***Girls will find you so cute!*** - You're right, they do find me cute-... and that's it. Despite being good-looking, healthy, going to the gym, and taking care of my physical appearance, I only look ""cute"". And that cuteness is equated to something of like a ""little brother"" vibe. If I go to a bar, a club, or anything like that with my friends, I'm always the adorable runt of the crew. It's incredibly hard to date since people see my advancements as more ""cute"" than ""*alright*"". Hell, my Tinder got deleted for ""not being over 18"". 

And there's plenty of things that just get me angry. Despite the drinking age in Germany being 16, I get carded no matter what. I have no issue with being carded (I'm used to it now and I have my ID in my hand), but have you ever been carded when buying things like energy drinks (non-alcoholic), condoms, or Advil? Or have to prove your identity with two, sometimes three, IDs (who carries more than one government ID on them!?).

It just sucks. And it's just something you can't change, and have to live with. "
"I've been thinking about my ex-wife a lot lately, but I don't miss her.","Well, the title summarizes it very clearly, but I will try to explain it further: I have been divorced for almost 5 years, had a new girlfriend and just a week ago got married again. I’m incredibly happy with my wife, she’s everything I wanted and needed in my life. I absolutely love her and we are a very happy couple.

But lately I have been feeling a little bit confused because, well, since we divorced I have never been able to stop thinking about my ex-wife. Just thinking what she’s doing, where she’s living, stuff like that. I haven’t contacted her since, an neither does she, but I have been finding myself constantly thinking about her. The weird part is that I don’t miss her. I really don’t. I don’t want her in my life and couldn’t care less if she’s doing all right or not.

I don’t know if this is “normal “ or if this means something like I am not “over her” or something like that. It’s a very weird feeling.

I just needed to get that off my chest."
Does anyone else wonder where they might be if they had more support in their lives?,It's taking me so long to figure things out and achieve goals and I wish sometimes I could have come from a family that helped me explore my interests a little more as a kid or could help with college. I get by alright but I do wish I had more help sometimes. All of my closest friends have moved as well and I have had terrible luck with dating for the past couple of years so I'm in a bit of a rut and I guess I just needed to vent. 
I want to settle down and be with one person.,"I am a 22 years old female who does not want to hookup or date around and experiment. 

I want to be with someone who shares the same values as me such as honesty, commitment, family and ofcourse goofiness :)  I don't care for their job, income, social status and upbringing. What matters is whether they are a kind, loving and understanding person. 

I want to get off my chest how hard it is to find someone who wants to settle down. Most men my age, have this belief that their 20s is for experimenting and for playing around and once they reach their 40s then they want to settle. They are usually work oriented and do not invest in relationships. Most of them don't want to deal with any relationship ups and downs, and once something goes wrong, they opt out or lose interest. They see relationship as an option, while I see it as a priority. 

I genuinely want to wake up to the same face everyday. 

To kiss them on the for-head and drink coffee/tea together. 

To hug them goodbye for work and to think about them when I am working. 

To come back home early to make them dinner and ask about their day. 

I want a relationship that is not fleeting. A relationship where we both feel safe and loved.

There are no mind games and no ""where is this going?"". 

I want to be there when they face financial, emotional and physical troubles. 

When they need someone to hug them tight and hold them still because the world is moving too fast. 

I want something real and stable.

I don't want someone perfect, I want someone who wants to invest and put effort into a relationship. 

Someone who is there for me and they know I am there for them. 

&#x200B;

I do believe that there are some men out there who want to have a serious relationship. 

I do hope I meet my man one day. "
I'm only 23 and I'm already starting to think that love isn't in the cards for me.,"I just celebrated my birthday last week, and for the first time in my life, I actually dreaded turning a year older. Another year older means another year I've been single, and another year closer to an age where I should be settled down, married, and have my life sorted out. I'm nearly a year out of college, I don't have many friends in the same city as me, and I'm SINGLE single. I always had this idea in my head that I'd meet a nice guy in college, get married young, be able to start a family when I'm ready, and just generally have shit like that figured out by now. That has not been the case for me AT ALL.

I dated my high school boyfriend for (admittedly) longer than I should have. We drifted apart in college and decided to break up at the end of my sophomore year of college. He's a really amazing guy, and I have nothing but good things to say about him. We just got together so young, and we outgrew each other and the relationship. Shortly after that, I dated a guy my roommate introduced me to. He (unfortunately) ended up being the literal worst. It was a very emotionally abusive relationship that ended with him cheating on me. After discovering all the massive lies he told me throughout our entire relationship, I had severe trust issues for a long time. It's something I still deal with.

When that relationship ended, I was halfway through my junior year of college. I decided to ""have fun"" and ""date around"" for a while, because at this point (I was 21) I hadn't been single since I was 16. It was fun for a while, but I got sick of that lifestyle fairly quickly. I realized that I hate dating, and I would way rather be in a relationship. Honestly, at this point though, I'm really having a hard time believing that anyone could ever like me enough and think I'm special enough to want to give me that commitment that I'm looking for. It feels like every guy my age is either already in a relationship, or ""not looking for anything serious"".

I really can't figure out what my problem is. I'm going to say this next part purely for context, and definitely not because I'm some conceited headass who's completely full of herself (I swear, I'm not). I would venture to say that I have a very good ""dating profile"" if you will. I would definitely say that I am conventionally good-looking. I'm your typical all-American Midwest girl. I've got long wavy hair, big blue eyes, long legs, a fit/athletic body. I was a division 1 swimmer in college, and I'm headed to law school in the fall. I'm ambitious, I'm driven, I have goals, I know what I want, and I have a really bright future ahead of me. (I know I probably sound like I'm just using this as an excuse to brag, but I swear I have a point).

All that being said, it's not like guys AREN'T attracted to me. Based on how I just described myself, one would think that I'd have guys all over me, but I genuinely DO NOT. I've found it so hard to meet guys, and so hard to get any guys that I do meet to want to stick around. It's terrifying because I really want someone to share my life with, and I really want kids someday, but every day that goes by that I'm still single makes that dream seem more and more unattainable. Dating apps have been a complete dead-end. I don't go out a lot, but when I do I always try to be fun/flirty/outgoing, but nothing seems to work.

This is something that's constantly on my mind. My loneliness is present in every aspect of my life, and it's really starting to get to me. It's so hard to not think that there must be something wrong with me. If there wasn't something wrong with me, someone would want to date me. Every single one of my friends and family members is either married or in a serious relationship and I always feel like the odd one out. I get told all the time to ""just be patient"" and that ""the right one will come"", but I just can't see that happening. I hate that I'm only 23 and already planning for a life of loneliness. I also get told all the time that I'm being dramatic, and that it's not that big of a deal, but that only makes me angrier. My feelings are very real, and I can't stand when people (who more often than not, HAVE a significant other) try to invalidate them. I'm on the verge of just giving up.

Okay wow this ended up being a lot longer than anticipated, thanks for reading, I really did need to get that off my chest and typing this seriously helped so much. Thank you.

learn how to take care of a fucking dog,"i now have two dogs. Toby (5) and Cooper (turning 6 months). i've always debated if my family should get a new dog because in 2014, my mom, dad, brother and i went to vietnam for a month or two. Toby was a few months old at the time I think. Most of the trip I was homesick and cried 24/7 because I missed Toby so much. Coming back made it worse.

&#x200B;

Toby was 10 times the size he was when we left. All my grandpa fed him for a month straight was rice, noodles, you name it. It made me so mad and I got sad for a decent amount of time. I never had enough time to walk Toby every day, but I tried really hard. Whenever my grandpa gave Toby a bone (like from a pig or something), I would say ""don't give that to him"" and he would just say ""it's okay it's just a bone"". well i don't think it's okay to feed Toby huge bones and human food. With Toby eating rice for the longest time, it took awhile for him to get used to dog food. Every time he would throw up because he ate too much rice, my grandpa would yell at him for making a mess and eating too fast. I wish i could yell back at him in Vietnamese so he would know how i felt.

&#x200B;

Years went by and Toby wasn't that overweight for his average weight, but I wasn't satisfied. I got used to his weight and I carry him over my shoulder now. My brother and I always begged for another dog so Toby would have someone to play with, but I started to debate with myself because what if my grandpa overfeeds the next dog? It'll make my depression go off the charts. With no notice at all, in November my mom facetimed me holding what looked like a stuffed animal. It started moving and i squealed ""is that a puppy????!"" and she was all happy saying ""yeah! Toby has a brother now! don't tell your brother until he gets home."" i was all excited and posted it on snapchat. Toby wasn't really paying attention to me because he was waiting for people at the dinner table to drop food or something. I sat next to him and said ""Toby, you might be jealous at first, but you're gonna have a little brother coming home soon. never forget that i'll always love you."" 

&#x200B;

his reaction was expected. he ran away and wasn't really playing with Cooper. days went by and Toby was so distant from me because Cooper was always around me. I got really sad that my best friend of 4 years stopped kissing, hugging, and smiling with me. i googled about how dogs cope with new ones, and it said it'll take 3 days, weeks, months, or even years. i knew Toby would get used to him in 3 weeks, but the distance he put between us broke my heart. he stopped sleeping in his bed next to mine and would barely greet me when i came home. one night, toby and cooper started fighting and i thought it was really cute. now, they fight on the daily barking and growling at each other, but i think they're just playing.

&#x200B;

anyway, the way my grandpa just plays and feeds the dogs worries me for when i go on vacation. when we had just toby, my dad, brother, and i went to chicago for a few days. on the ride there, i started thinking what toby was doing and how he's just waiting for me to come home. i cried a little bit and tried to forget about it. even if my grandpa feeds the dogs with the right food, he'll overfeed them and forget to refill their water bowls when they're empty or dirty af. spring break is coming up and my family and i are going to canada. my dad tried looking for a pet-friendly hotel, but he couldn't. last time i went on vacation, i tried getting my friend to take care of toby. i just didn't want my grandpa to yell and overfeed the dogs. 

&#x200B;

when he takes the dogs outside and toby doesn't want to come in, he yells at the top of his lungs for toby to come in. little things he does to the dogs annoys the fuck out of me, but i told myself 2019 was gonna be my good year. it just isn't going well this week. when the dogs are barking and scratching the backyard door to come in, my grandpa acts like he can't hear them and continues to cook. the worst part is, he started smoking again a year or two ago, and he walks through the house with cigarettes, picks cooper up and stares at him saying things in vietnamese (which is something he never did to toby when he was young), and other things that are just insanely annoying. 

&#x200B;

just a few hours ago he picked cooper up and said in vietnamese ""let's take a bath"" and takes him to his bathroom. i say to myself ""uh, what?"" i walk to the bathroom and my grandpa is just washing cooper with HUMAN SHAMPOO. WHAT THE FUCK? HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT TAKING CARE OF DOGS. i called my dad immediately saying what he was doing and my dad just said ""oh no."" which just made matters worse. i ran to the other bathroom to give my grandpa dog shampoo and i yelled at him saying ""you can't wash cooper with that shampoo!! you have to use dog shampoo!!!!"" and he just said ""okay."" as if he didn't hear a word i said. i bet he didn't even use the fucking shampoo. i googled what would happen when a dog is bathed in human shampoo, and it ruins their skin or something cause it's not meant for their bodies. knowing that cooper's not even a year old made me worry and i tried to hold back my tears. 

&#x200B;

2019 will not be a good year."
Let's all be happy! :),"It hurts losing you but I'm proud of you for doing what you think is best for you. I love you so much and I forgive you.

I just want you to be happy. For everyone in this world to be happy. :)"
"As a business owner, that frequently gets miss identified as a staff member, what the fuck am I supposed to do when a customer gets loud and aggressive with me?","I guess for a decent percentage of people it's understood that if you get loud, aggressive, and angry with retail staff or clerks or fast food staff it gets results. It intimidates and scares them. They're afraid to lose their jobs so they can't fight back verbally or physically so it's extremely safe for the customer to do this. Most likely you're going to get your way.

The problem is I own the business. I'm in my early thirties but people often think I'm in my twenties. I've had a few instances where a male customer isn't getting what he wants or he's having some issue and he starts getting loud with me. Usually they get this angry loud aggressive tone and they'll get in your face or glare at you. 


If this wasn't happening to me in my business I'd be very alarmed and afraid the person would assault me. But because of the context I know 99.99 percent of the time the customer isn't going to do anything beyond get loud. They are assuming I work there and I can't and won't fight back. They wouldn't talk to me like that if the didn't think I was a low level employee or if we were random members of the public. They are bluffing and playing a game making bad assumptions.

I really don't know a tactful way to deal with it. They aren't yelling at me and they aren't yelling at my staff. Every time this type of thing has happened to me it generally freaks the customer out that I'm unafraid and not phased by them. I'll usually look at them dead in the eyes and ask them to stop yelling at me and that usually freaks them out even more. Most usually put two and two together and realize I'm at least a manager or maybe an owner. Some, i think, who don't realize I'm not just a staff member think they fucked with the wrong person. Every one of them looks and acts scared almost terrified. Many never come back.

Let me add the 95 percent of the time the guy yelling at me or my staff is some wimpy looking out of shape fat guy. I swear the guy is looking for someone to bully.  It's almost never some guy who is in shape and / or looks like a scary guy."
I got my supervisor (a former high school bully) to quit her job and possibly ruined her marriage.,"I'm a 28 year old dropout, was bullied pretty much straight up to college. I had started working part-time jobs and managed to land a maintenance/operation work job which has been nice for the last couple years.

Our old supervisor just left a and the replacement turned out to be one of my former high school bullies. She wasn't the worst compared to the others, the worst she did was dunk me in the toilet to force drink the water and trying to choke me in the bathroom at times. Some of the other girls and guys were way worse so this was pretty tame. Still, I didn't like her at all.

She didn't recognize me for some reason, or maybe she did? I don't know. Either way, I thought that this might be an opportunity to get some payback since I'd rather not work with her or any other girl for that matter.

I worked in the same facility as her for about a month and during that time I noticed that she always left her personal phone (she carries both a work and personal cell on her), in her office whenever she goes out to grab coffee or sometimes when she's in a rush for meetings.

I used that opportunity to go through her phone (which I know the password to at this point seeing her unlock it multiple times), and found texts of her talking to other guys other than ""Hubby"". I screenshotted these, uploaded them to imgur and then deleted the pics on her phone.

Then when I got home later in the day, I found her husband online and anonymously sent him those texts she's been sending to other people.

After the weekend today, we found out from another supervisor that she stepped down and we'd be having a temp cover us until a new replacement can be sorted out.

So yeah, I think I managed to get some payback. I don't normally go out of my way to do these kinds of things, but this one felt good."
So... I'm taking a civil service examination even though I know I don't deserve it.,"This Sunday I'll take the exam. And honestly, I hope I don't get approved. I feel demotivated to study and take the test because I don't deserve to work on the public sector. It's not imposter syndrome because I know for a fact that I don't deserve it. I've never had to work a single day in my life, while the other contestants are sick of being exploited and humiliated in their jobs in the private sector.

I've never flipped burgers, I've never bussed tables, I've never cleaned toilets. This is literally my only chance of ever finding employment in my entire life and I know I can't take it, or else I'll be doing a disservice to all the poor people who need it more than I do. Even though I really want a job.

I'm so sick of crying in shame of not having a job. But I understand why nobody will ever hire me. I understand that you who are reading this must be rolling your eyes at me crying over my first world problems, because you must've started working when you were 14 or so. Yes, I know, I deserve to be executed.

Sorry for the cringe."
I HATE seeing that guy pop his eyes out of his eyelids on Snapchat discovery!,"When ever you go to check people’s snap chats stories there is a section of different snaps called ‘Discovery’ that has snaps made by various corporate entities or different collections of users snaps that fit a certain theme. Often I see this one snap on different discovery stories where a man has the ‘talent’ to pop his eyes out of his eyelids and it is just disgusting! I swear I’ve seen it 3 times just this week, it’s not the biggest deal but I just can’t help but wonder who the fuck thinks this is a talent. It seems more like a medical issue."
Damn I really have been having this festering hate for my roommates boyfriend and I don’t know how to manage it. It’s starting to show.,"Never liked him from the start, I think this might be one of those you hate that person because of the smell of their pheromones situation. He really hasn’t done anything to me, I can’t stand the sound of his voice and the way he carries himself. If he died a horrible death tomorrow I would be so happy and that’s a really horrible thing to think. It sucks that i have to see his face everyday at school and even worse that he tried coming over to our place everyday. I told my roommate not to do that please as it made me feel awkward, but now I feel really weird around her too. I once over heard them talking about me in a sort of negative way and damn I’m not the type of person to get offended but it made me a little mad and kind of used. Since they sort of always asked me for rides and stuff since I have a car. I started just going out a lot on my own now which I hate since I am sort of introverted, I’m starting to not like my roommate either. :( anyone ever had bad experiences with people thay live with."
Shame after outbursts,"I get really huge mood swings sometimes, and I tend to get really low. When this happens, I say really intense things. Afterwards, I experience a lot of shame and guilt for the things I said, and the things I thought about. Like I really despise the person I become when I get low. 

Ugh. Mood swings are the worst."
I HATE traveling for work...,"Stuck working out of town for 3 of the next 4 weeks.  I hate being away from my wife and kids.  I feel extremely un-motivated and honestly it doesn't matter how much work I get done while I'm here.  They basically want bodies in chairs.

&#x200B;

I think what bothers me the most about being away from home is that while I'm there, I like to tell myself that I'm an integral and necessary part of the family.  Like that things wouldn't function correctly while I'm gone.  Then when I'm gone I find out that everything runs just fine without me.  Of course some things that I normally do will be waiting for me when I get home, my kids will call for help with homework if they need it, my wife will have questions about where things are or what needs to get done, but honestly it all makes me feel a little, unnecessary.  Don't get me wrong, I know everyone misses me, and I'm only gone for 3 and a half days on the weeks I'm out of town, and I am happy and proud that they all handle my absence so well.  If something did happen that they couldn't fix or handle I'd feel even worse about not being there.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile I can't stop thinking about how my kids (13 and 15) only have so many days left at home and I'm wasting them sitting at a desk out of town not really accomplishing anything."
Dear Mom,"Dear Mom,

&#x200B;

Do you remember when I was little and you'd lay me in your big bed, rub my back and softly sing ""you are my sunshine"" as I drifted off to sleep? Sometimes, it feels like you've forgotten.

&#x200B;

Sometimes I think I forget. I forget in the moments when you call me ""the problem"", the endless days of spitting names out at me like I am to blame for all that has gone wrong in your life. God, sometimes I sit up in my room and sob for hours wishing the Mom you used to be would hear, and you'd snap back into who you were and come scoop me up in your arms and tell me that you love me again, and  tell me how wonderful I am and how it's ""us against the world.""

&#x200B;

It was on Halloween night when you had your stroke.  I remember rushing you to the ER and sitting next to you for hours as they pumped you full of liquids. I remember being so afraid that you'd die right in front of me there in that hospital bed. I remember they had you doped up on meds so you'd stay calm for your MRI, and I held your hand as you cried.

&#x200B;

I knew in that hospital room that things would be different, that I'd have to grow up and take charge. I smiled at you, told you everything would be alright even though my insides were imploding. I waited until I walked out of that hospital, into my room and locked the door to release all the pain I built throughout the day. I sobbed, just screaming and sobbing. I couldn't help it. I couldn't stop it. It just flowed from me, with the thoughts always running through my head that you could still die. That you still weren't stable. I was so angry at you. I was angry because you were in the hospital instead of at home. I was angry because the doctor told us your stroke had been caused by smoking. I was angry because since I was a child I begged you to stop smoking and you selfishly refused. 

&#x200B;

All my life, Mom, you had been there. Through the horrible bullying I endured, through Dad drunkenly spitting hate and insults at me, YOU were the one that protected me. You were the one who always took me out for my birthday, who always made me smile and laugh when things were falling apart around us.  You were my angel...

&#x200B;

And then, suddenly, you were different. The stroke changed you. You became so lost in your own head. Most days, you would scream and throw tantrums like a child. I didn't understand it. I cried out of anger and sadness, wondering where my Mom was, but I stayed strong for you, like you had always stayed strong for me. 

&#x200B;

You survived. I can't say that your entire self survived, because so much of what you used to be is gone now, but in some rare instances, between the anger and rage and fights, my Mom comes back, even if it's just for a split second. A smile, or your soft, caring voice telling me that rare, sweet ""I love you.""

&#x200B;

Don't ever forget that I love you. Through the arguments, the random bursts of anger, the insults, and the pain. Even now, Mom, I wouldn't replace you for the world.

&#x200B;

YOU are, and always will be, MY sunshine.

&#x200B;

Love,

R.

I Can't Stop Thinking About Suicide,"UPDATE: I'm sorry but I've realized that no one can help me if I don't want to be helped. For some reason I think I WANT to think these thoughts and feel these feelings. I'm sorry that I made you all waste time on me. Please find someone else who can actually be helped. I'm going to meditate in my room. No music or anything, just my thoughts. I'm sorry. I promise I won't kill myself.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm finishing my senior year of high school now. My mental health took a huge hit during my sophomore year.  Ever since then I've been thinking about suicide at least once a week. Sometimes everyday.

&#x200B;

It's been worse than usual lately. Over the past month I've spent a lot of time reading about suicide methods and statistics; just before writing this post I was reading about suicide by train. I spent hours finding the least gory method so I wouldn't be hard to clean up. Even though I live an extremely privileged lifestyle, the thoughts won't go away. I was almost ready to cry a second ago, but now I'm just sitting with a blank stare, feeling horrible.

&#x200B;

So long as I parents and siblings are alive I won't do it. But if they were gone, I would do it in a heartbeat. I just wish I would stop having suicidal thoughts. But at the same time, I like them. I know that sounds weird, and I don't know why I feel that way.

&#x200B;

I once blocked all of my friends on social media and avoided them IRL, but I changed my mind and stopped. I've been thinking about doing it again. I didn't know why before writing this, but now that I think about it, maybe it's my subconscious trying to lessen the impact of my suicide. That scares me.

&#x200B;

If you have any questions about why I feel the way I do, please ask. I know I didn't give much background information, I just wanted to be sure someone would actually look at it before I spent the time typing it out."
waste of air,"new to this . just need to get this off my chest . i'm a 30 year old woman already in menapause, cant have kids , bladder prolapse can't have intercourse with my husband which he have only been married a year and my prolapse has been exactly that length and still kicking. mental issues. fibromyalgia. depression. bipolar. borderline personality disorder, seizures, post concussion syndrome memory issues, rage issues, the list goes on and on and its getting to be to much im so ready to just end it all im a failure at everything even death apparently because no matter how many times i try it doesn't work or i chicken out and regret it later. "
I hate my job.,"I’m 20 years old and work at a grocery store fuel kiosk. I sit alone, in a box 8 hours a day, five days a week and deal with the most entitled and stupid pieces of shit I’ve ever seen in my whole entire life.i didn’t think it was possible. Luckily, my last day is in two saturdays. I can’t fucking wait. This shit is going to kill me as the days count down. I have been waiting for this moment for months now. Holy shit. "
"I’m a single, childless woman in her mid-30s who had cats. I should be pathetic, right? But I got to do something today that I’d never be able to do with husband and children, and fuck it feels good.","A good friend of mine was randomly widowed a couple years ago. She hit a bad spot recently, so I wired her a few hundred dollars. 

And you know what? I didn’t have to ask anyone before I did it. I just did. It’s my money, so it affects no one but me. 

I’ve been married before, so I know what it’s like to have to constantly run money decisions past a spouse. 

But I’m single, so no one gives a damn. I can help my friend without justifying it to anyone. 

I’m definitely a “career gal.” I’m on the local board of directors for our professional organization, and I teach night classes for my field at the local college. I’m employed at one of the more prestigious companies in the area for my field. 

I’ve been able to throw myself into my career because husband and children have not been a thing. 

And I can throw money at a friend who’s hurting and think nothing of it. 

Goddamn, that feels good. "
I don’t like this feeling,"For the first time in my life had to admit that I need help I’m not feeling myself anymore and all because one of my best friends.

I’ve met her for 6 years, a really good friendship we hang around like almost everyday and we are really close to each other but for the last two weeks I just can’t stop thinking of her constantly, I can’t even do normal things in my day like play games, do homework or just reddit. The problem is that I think I’m starting to fall in love with her so bad, and I keep saying to myself “you don’t love her, it’s just a phase” but the more I think of if the more it gets worse, I need to get out if this loop.

I’m a bit scared because for the first time anxiety is getting into my mind (if this is what it feels like) and I don’t even know what to do.. I never felt this way before. I even thought about distancing myself from her but just thinking in that option gets me kinda sad and nostalgic, I don’t even really know if i feel like an physical attraction to her but my God I’m really happy when we are together... don’t really know if it’s love what I’m feeling, and why now since all these years? And all of the sudden? 

It’s the first time I express myself about this situation, my eyes are watery and I’m a really sensible guy but feels really good to write about it, I just needed to just to let go this “thing” and maybe read another thoughts.

"
I came!,"I don't really have anyone else to tell this to, but I got together with my boyfriend about 6 months ago. We started having sex 5 months ago. It took me a few weeks to be able to make him finish, we are both young and I was the first girl who could make him finish/he has had sex with. He is my first as well. I love having sex with him. I love giving to him in a very sexual way. He is very gifted in that area, he is a very loving partner, and he is just very hot. What I was getting frustrated with was that I never finished. Not once. No where even close. 

Until this weekend! I was trying out some things I had been reading online, we had the house to ourselves and could be as loud as we wanted, and I had plenty of protection with me (lol stay safe!). It was perfect. 

I can't believe I finished. It was the first time I ever have with someone else and it made me feel amazing. It made him feel less pressured during sex because those 5 months weighed on him. He felt like he wasn't doing enough for me and got frustrated during our sexual escapades. 

Funnily enough, even though I came during that session, he couldn't. Not sure why but we think we are cursed lol. 

One day we will both finish :)"
I’m 32F and I have no friends and I’m so lonely,"I use to be ok with being alone but not anymore. When I’m home by myself my mind goes and I think about all these things and I can’t mentally escape and then I feel more and more depressed and I think about my loneliness and I cry sometimes. I feel like a child again crying in my pillow because I have no friends. 

I’ve tried desperately.. but my sort of friends have people they’re closer to or would rather spend time with and so my attempts are barely second thoughts to them. 

Anyone have any suggestions for an introvert, socially awkward, single mom, to make some friends?

P.s I have no really hobbies "
"Im pregnant and im sad about it, but im also very happy and these horomones, man.","At the beginning of the year, I was 5'4"" and weighed 191lbs. Fast forward to the beginning of March and thanks to Keto, I'd dropped down to 176lbs! I was imagining getting to my goal weight of 140 by July. Having a cute bikini and being proud of my body for the FIRST time in my life. 

Cue the missed period and the ungodly rage pouring out of me. Cue the positive pregnancy test. And then the next one and the next one and the next one. 

My partner and I struggled for about a year to get pregnant before I finally said I couldn't keep trying with so much heartbreak and disappointment and neither of us was ready to go down the medical vortex of doctoes. We changed our goals and decided if parenthood wasn't going to happen, then we would work on a different dream. Better bodies, better eating habits and focusing on traveling and learning new hobbies. It took awhile, but I was finally OK with where our life was taking us. I would still sob privately when my friends got pregnant, and bless them they always came to me and let me know privately before the public announcement so I didn't find out blindsidedly on social media (can we talk about how freaking great they were for being so kind and loving for doing that). But it wasn't something I though of often any more. 

And now, after readjusting our trajectory we're back to the original plan. And I feel a bit sad about it all. Don't get me wrong, this baby was something I'd never dreamed we'd have and I am overwhelmed with how lucky we are that it happened at all. But some of me is sad for the life we started building. 

Tldr, I'm pregnant and emotional"
"I need to get this off my chest , I don’t know what to do","I am a freshman in highschool, and I think I might be pregnant. My mom would literally kick me out, and we have a terrible relationship. I don’t want to go to my dad because I can’t stand to see the disappointment, and disgust. The kids at my school are very rude and misunderstanding. You make one mistake and that’s your title forever. I don’t want to be that one girl who got knocked up by an older guy. People already hate me for no reason, but that’s highschool. I just recently had sex so plan b is still an option, but not for long. I just can’t afford it and have nobody who’s willing to go that far for me to help me.

I think I might be pregnant because there were times where it took the person a couple seconds to pull out depending on the position, and I know it’s stupid of me to have unprotected sex at this age. I’m on birth control for my horrible periods, but I mess up my pills regularly so it’s probably ineffective, I’ve been cramping bad all day at school, and I bled the day after sex, it wasn’t my first time but it had been almost a year since I had lost my virginity. my period supposedly comes in a week, but I’m just unsure.

I feel alone and don’t know what to do, I know I have bad luck but I pray to god this isnt happening/wont happen .... And the person I’m with, has to be the worst timing for me to be pregnant. It’s a bad situation on both sides of the fence. Not only that I’m too young, I have plans and a future and participate in a lot of sports. I just wish I had somebody or support or advice, help, just something without being judged.

Maybe I’m just overreacting, worrying myself and and I’m not pregnant. But there’s a huge possibility and I don’t know if my symptoms are normal for my situation or if their an early sign. I had to get this shit off my chest. I’ve already gained a lot of muscle weight from powerlifting, but now I just stress eat. So people already think I’m pregnant from my weight gain, and I’m barely chunky in my stomach. 

Just had to get this off my chest because I’m tired of bottling everything in, I’ve already been dealing with enough stress and depression. This was the last thing I needed. Advice, thoughts, information.....anything. "
Random rant,"I meet guys off tinder or bumble all the time, who may ask for my number and or snapchat. I got a random text from someone saying i was texting their boyfriend. You should be talking to him, not me. I don't talk to taken guys, and your ""man"" shouldn't be on a dating app. People are so annoying."
My quarter-life crisis,"TLDR at the bottom

&#x200B;

So I'm a 19yo male and I've been holding a lot in for a while now, ever since my second semester of university started (around January). I now have zero interest in my major, which is computer science, and want to pursue business. My university doesn't have a business program, and, quite frankly,  I'd rather not go even deeper into student loans by switching majors this late (almost done my 2nd year of university, currently $11k in debt). I've reconsidered just pushing through and continuing computer science many times, but the next day I just can't do it. I hate it, I don't want to learn more about it, and idk if I should dropout.

&#x200B;

For the past year or so I've fallen in love with business, specifically online business. I've ran two small online businesses that I made around $1000 from, and I just feel best when I'm learning/doing business. Another thing is that I'm losing faith in my religion. I grew up in a religious family, but the more I read about my religion the more faith I lose, and at this point I just consider myself agnostic. I definitely don't plan on telling my parents this, they're always telling me to pray and stuff. I love my mom so I wouldn't want to give her this kinda news. She's already in a horrible relationship with my dad (not abusive, they just argue all the time and she does not like him at all).

&#x200B;

I haven't done my past two comp sci assignments for one of my courses which both were worth 10% each and I don't even care at this point, it's weird. I have a test tomorrow that I haven't studied for, and I'm not nervous about it or anything, I'm just pissed that I'm stuck in this situation. I'm sure many people have it worse, but I just had to get it out. Whenever I'm asked how university is going I just smile and say its going good, no one really knows my situation so I thought I'd tell you guys.

&#x200B;

TLDR; Lost faith in my religion, lost all interest in my computer science major, haven't kept up with assignments/tests, want to pursue business"
If i'm being honest,"It always seems like everyone blames the male for only wanting sex, but we do too. We just don't come off like that. I reallty wish a decent guy would come along who fits what i'm looking for, including the sex. I never say or mention that, but ofcourse females want that. Just not as bad as guys."
Found a opened staple in my take-out,"My family and I ordered take-out from this grocery store chain and then we got home. 

It was close to dinner time so I quickly opened it and started to devour it. After eating the majority of it, I stab (?) another piece of roasted garlic potatoes and then lo and behold - a motherducking *open* (not flat/closed) staple, with one side that looks like its been deliberately bent opened by someone else. Im mentally freaking out in my head as I remember biting down something *really hard* in the beginning, at the back of my teeth, but try to pass it off as a ridiculously hard bone.

I feel infuriated as I wonder ""how can this even happen??"" and think about how crappy the staff is managing their food. My mom then suggests that ""what if it causes of OP/ they didnt like us..?"" which makes me even more upset cause I live in Canada?? why did you even bother to come live here, if you are racist??? (I also realized were kind of stuck out as a different ethnicity) And then, i remember it happened to me before and even another time...but I wasnt sure...

Today, i decided to call the health help-line and when I told the nurse over the phone what happened; simply that I found an opened staple in my food that i was enjoying a lot......I dont know it kind of got to me. I wasn't really afraid for myself (since it happened before, but i guess im still here) but more like really hurt or upset, if it was true that it was *completely* deliberate and meant to physically harm me. 

The nurse basically tried to ask me questions about my background, to distract me or focus on the real question.

The only thing i can do really is maybe check out the ER, but i usually dont do that since my family doesnt really bother about health stuff in general. Anyways, in conclusion, sometimes people suck, so be wary. (I ended up writing a negative review with pics, not sure if that will do anything).

Feel like a mom to my over-sensitive BF,"Im 21F, he 20M. BF has zero life skills. No idea what a credit score is, never had a real job. He will sit on the couch and watch me clean, never offers to help. He tries to do chores but does them half assed. Washes dishes in cold water so theres grease left on them. Just throws the blanket on the bed and calls it ""made"". I have to repeatedly remind him of the same things and he will do them for a few days and then he ""forgets"". I could go on all day on bullshit he does half assed and has never heard of because he grew up a mommas boy with a housemaid to do everything for him. 

The best part? When I tell him Im tired of being his mom and Im concerned about it he get his feelings are hurt. What do I even say to that? 

I understand were young but my god i dated a man a few years ago who was incredibly literate in life skills. I cant help but compare them and it makes me feel bad but its incredibly annoying having to explain what a parking break is and why you cant wash dishes in cold water. Why do I have to be his mom? I want to date a real man. But i do love him and dont want to leave him. Im just frustrated that i feel like im his mother and anytime i mention im concerned that he is essentially clueless (not the words i use when speaking to him, i put it very nicely) he says i hurt his feelings. "
I hate that im doing it but I love doing it,"I'm have a boyfriend and we have been together since 3 years. a year ago  went to a bar I was drunk and kissed a woman IDFK how it happened and since then I was seeing that girl, my bf dosnt know this. I feel more loved by her than my bf, I'm planning on dumping my bf soon."
I am afraid to start dating because of all the things that could go wrong,"throwaway because I don't need this on my main account 

The process of dating to me is both confusing and scary(i'm young and inexperienced, cut me some slack). Like it says in the title, you know what this is gonna be about let's just jump into it: Outside of what the title says (and what some people may think) I am not afraid of the opposite sex (i'm a guy). I can talk to girls and behave like a proper human around them and not completely have my brain turn to mush.

I have somewhat of an idea how to go on dates and how to get one( a combination of clichés and just swiping right) and how to not be a dick enough to not immediately repulse them. That's not where any of my fears lie: my fears lie in the what ifs. 

What if I somehow mess up and they don't like me anymore? what if they have a major emotional/family problem and I am not equipped to help them through it? what if(this is my biggest fear) they cheat on me? I have seen so many stories here saying that their partners casually cheated on them... and i'm not innocent, what if I cheat on them? I understand that people sometimes grow distant over time but I don't want to go through that and I would rather not put someone else through such emotional distress.

Hell I may be leaving things out but i'll let the nihilists out there fill in the blanks. I know some people on the extreme ends of the spectrum will accuse my of certain buzzwords but I've said my peace. hopefully this doesn't come off as whiney or cringe but I just need to get this out.


"
2019 has been a hard year,"Ugh, I’ve been holding off on bringing this up on Reddit for some time now, but here we go. It will be better to get out then to hold in. 

Me(27M) and my Fiancée(27F) dated for 8 years, and talked about getting married in 2019. In September I had purchased the ring she always described she wanted, I had I custom made and had my Mom, Sister and Aunt help me find a great place. We had just got over a family death and I really wanted to include everyone in picking out a ring to bring up everyone’s spirits.

My Fiancé has been looking forward to being engaged for a while, she always talked about our life together and she had just recently bought a condo and we had been furnishing the place together for months before I proposed, we even bought a cat together. Things were really starting to feel like they were moving well and we were both excited to spend the rest of our lives together. But her parents were strict, even after being together for 8 years, being 27 and engaged to one another, living together in her condo wasn’t an option. I would stay over every weekend behind her parents back just not to cause friction. I would sometimes have to park my car in another visitor parking lot because if they saw my car there they would assume I slept over and people would talk. 

I work in Graphic Design, and she is a Teacher. My career has not been the best and it was hard to even find a local job outside of a major city. But I did land a job that payed fair but caused a lot of stress. My Fiancee on the other had found her job almost immediately after finishing teachers college. Her parents are teachers and she has had every advantage there was in finding her job. Unfortunately this caused a lot of fights in our relationships. My Fiancee would see me stressed out a lot but instead of giving me the space I needed she would argue that I go and look for new employment. I would constantly be putting out resumes every week to places without any responses, it made the stress even worse but I always looked forward to our time together and never let it get in the way of the relationship. To her she just thought because I cannot land a job a love, I do not love myself. 

Fast forward to the beginning of  this year. Her parents had been driving around her condo and saw my car parked there, they flipped and this was the last straw for me. I told her that I was uncomfortable staying at her place and risking confrontation from her parents. I told her I wanted more time to workout (slim down for wedding) and that I was upset that a 27F who owns her own place cannot tell her parents to STOP. She brings up the usual I don’t love myself enough fight and that I just want an excuse to stay at home and be lazy. I assure her that it’s ludicrous, I have a full time job and that I don’t want to tackle on the stress of her parents as well before our wedding. 

I go to visit her the first night after I told her I was feeling uncomfortable staying over. She tells me she doesn’t want to get married anymore because I don’t want to be with her as much, I tell her that’s not what I meant at all and clarified why I was uncomfortable. She then hands me a list of things she has had doubts about, a lot of them are fixable but she keeps insisting that she doesn’t want to get married. After hours of trying to talk to her about things I decided to leave and give her time to think about what she is doing. Not even a day goes by and she tells me she doesn’t want to get married anymore. I am absolutely gutted. 

In terms of the wedding, her grandfather passed away years ago and theft her some money, but it was always distributed to her by her parents. It’s how she was able to afford her condo alone. She also had money to put towards the wedding. The arrangement was her parents would pay half and I would pay half.  Up until she called things off I had already payed half on all the deposits we put down. I e-transferred all the amounts to her parents who booked and payed. I trusted them and thought nothing of it. 

Fast forward to this day, I have been trying to get my portion of the deposits back from her family that has ghosted me. It’s hurts me everyday that the person who called things off is treating me this way. My ex-fiancée has only given me back half of the costs I made for the condo in terms of furniture and other things. I am thinking of turning to seek legal action against her very soon. I don’t know why everyone just decided this was the best option to take and not be accountable for their daughters actions. 

The worst part of all of this is my life has deteriorated ever since we broke up. I went into 2019 being so hopeful of life. It has not been easy at all to come to terms with everything.  Recently my mother has been hospitalized for a brain tumor that had been growing since the beginning of the year. I am typing this out as we await the news of her biopsy. Life has taken such a hard turn and I feel like I have no sense of control of what is going on in it anymore. 

I have not even considered the idea of dating again and I cannot imagine the amount of baggage this year holds to me on a mental health level. I just need to take each day in one at a time and learn to move forward.    "
I still love my ex...three years later,"I do feel I have moved on, but I have this feeling that we should still be together. I know she doesn't feel that way because she has had multiple boyfriends by now, plus she is not the person I used to know / who I fell in love with, and I never see her anymore. But the thing is, that she has been my first and only love ever, and when I see a future with a partner the only futue I see is with her. No one has been able to understand me the way she did. No one has loved me the way she did. No one has cared for me like her. And I haven't had an intimate relationship and close friendship like I did when I was with her. She used to be my best friend. Someone whom I felt comfortable with. And now, even if I had made tons of new friends, no one has been close to how she was and what we had. I'm not looking for a lover. No. I just want a partner in life, and I feel like years will pass until I find someone like her. This simple thought makes me feel lonely. I'm tired of having to hide things because people don't care. I'm tired of having to solve other's problems. I'm tired of loving others but not getting that love back. I know they are not bound to return it, but this makes me feel alone in this world, and like it is a one sided relationship in which only them are benefited. 

To my ex: I will forever love you. I'm sure that the moment I die I will still regret hurting you and not living life by your side. You are irreplaceable. Thank you for the two years we spent together. You are the love of my life."
Migrant Caravans,Who keeps encouraging these massive groups of illegal immigrants to come to the border? 
I know i'm being ridiculous...,"I'm 24, F and so jealous and sensitive when it comes to my step dad. He is not even my real dad, but he is the only dad that I have ever had. Now he is with a woman with 6 kids, all different dads of course. He's told me over and over that they have their own dads and he has no interest in being their dad. It still stings though when I see them on vacation together....or him teaching one of them how to drive. You know, doing everything he used to do with me. I rent my house from him and were in the process of me owning it since he doesn't want to be a (MY) landlord anymore. So lets just put all this debt in my name and leave it up to me when something goes wrong. Which is understandable...he is tired of fixing things that go wrong and tired of hearing me complain when something breaks and needs fixed. Just needed to vent a little bit since it's been bothering me that he doesn't seem to want to help me anymore but is all hands on deck for these kids."
I want to go back to prison.,"I caught a weed case recently and I'm looking at having to serve another prison sentence. I've done a three year bit before and it really wasn't so  bad despite how horrible everyone thinks prison is. 

I'm so stressed out with regular society that I long for the simple structure of prison life.  It's really fucked up but I'm less depressed when I'm locked up. Out here I feel constantly judged as a failure. Most my family shuns me now because of my weed charges and honestly I'm over trying to fit in.I feel disconnected from things that I once loved. I've been so down lately that I've had sucidal thoughts, thoughts I never experienced while locked up...

Being locked up is not half as bad as society pretends. There is something very peaceful about not being part of everyday society. You don't have bills to pay, you are fed and clothed. Gym membership is free, and you and the guys play cards every night. Start the day with a nice cup of coffee. End the day with a nice book in bed. It's not a luxurious life but it's much less complicated one.

I hate that i feel this way. But I do and I needed to put it out there. Keeping it in was driving me nuts."
The person that gives me anxiety.,"There's this boy who knows a kid and we're cool and all but he makes me feel so anxious. I thought it was just a crush but no. That's not what a crush is supposed to feel like, they aren't supposed to scare you.

I feel as if I have to change, and my friends start to notice. ""Why do you talk different?"" I just want to be cooler. ""Why do you always wear black? Quit being edgy"" I just like the color black. ""Why are you so sad?"" I fell into depression. 

I have to change my dorky, weaboo nerdy persona to someone who just shows no emotion, I even get made fun of by him, criticized constantly and I wish I could just erase him with the other toxic person in my life. I can barely handle it and I don't want to tell my parents or any close friends. What do I do?"
Has anyone else made the transition from business owner back to being a traditional employee??,"I just figured I would put this out there because it has been weighing heavy on my mind lately. Any input would be appreciated. Advice, tips, similar situations? Even just your 2 cents. 

I recently have been attempting to re-enter the workforce as an employee. My boyfriend and I have been running our own business for about 3 years which was dissolved at the end of 2018. There were many factors which contributed to the decision to close the business. Many of which being out of our control. But now looking back, I can’t help but see all of the decisions I would have done differently if I had the chance. I see all the mistakes I made along the way and even though my logic tells me it’s not entirely my fault our business failed, my emotional brain tell me otherwise. 

So now I am currently in the market for a new job. I have some pretty good employment experience as well as a Bachelors in Business behind me but it never seems to be enough. I am feeling somewhat lost and also very bitter about everything. I have been applying for various management positions but none are really anything I “want” to do. Ever since I was young I’ve always wanted my own business. When I first started looking my boyfriend asked me what I wanted to do and what types of jobs I wanted to apply for. And my answer was always “I don’t know because what I really want to be doing is the business still”.  I was so bitter when everything ended and I still am and I don’t really know how to let it go. When you have and lose your dream job, how do you come back from that and move onto something else that isn’t your dream?? 

I just turned 30 and everyone keeps telling me I’m still young but I feel like I am running out of time and if I don’t secure something long-term soon I will just end up with a “job” and not a career. "
Give me two months credit on my closed account for the two hours inconvenience I experienced. Warning long rant,"The self-entitlement in this country is out of control! People think they can just demand ridiculous things and everyone should bend to thier will.

Guy closed his account and had issues returning his router. So he filed an executive complaint with the BBB. 

Refused to even entertain the idea of going to a store location. Instead just pisses and moans about the time spent trying to return his router.

1) Request a return kit and never received it (probably a system issue...it happens)

2) Does an online chat and they send him a link to request a prepaid shipping label. Link doesn't work

3) He sends a tweet and gets no reply

4) Sends another tweet and then complains that they replied to him ""publicly without my consent""

5) They give him a link which happens to be the same as the other one that doesn't work 

All this happens over a couple hours and he thinks he deserves TWO MONTHS OF SERVICE ON HIS CLOSED ACCOUNT credited back to him. We don't even credit for inconvenience on open accounts. You're not even a customer anymore! But he's doing us a favor because he could bill us for his hourly rate which is more than two months of his billing.

Then he goes ""You have two options: either credit me two months or I want a detailed report of the steps taken against the representatives I dealt with. I want to know what action is being taken to fix these issues. Companies can't just treat their customers like crap and nobody is held accountable""

Told him that any corrective action would be handled internally and that he wouldn't be informed of such results, especially not being a customer anymore.

Still not good enough. Went round and round with this guy until I finally just told him no credit is going to be given, no report is being sent to him and his return kit (that I processed 25 minutes prior) will be there in 3-5 days, have a good day and hung up. 

Who the hell do people think they are? Wanna complain about companies constantly treating customers horribly and yadda yadda. Well if you acted with them remotely how you acted with me, it's no wonder you get poor service. Who the fuck are you to call up, not even a customer and make ridiculous demands? Two months credit for two hours of your time. Grow up. It happens. We all have to call customer service at some point. Mistakes happen. It's called life. crybaby. "
Socializing with people is so exhausting,"I hate it. I don't like people and I never have. I prefer to be alone. 

It is so much work to talk to people and constantly have to be afraid that what I said was wrong or that they are judging me or dislike me (I have social anxiety). I relate to hardly any people and that is why it is hard for me to make friends. 

I have trust issues so it is hard for me to open up and I also suspect I have BPD which makes me split on my friends. I either love them, hate them, or feel nothing, it depends on the day. It is exhausting pretending to like people at school and pretending that they are my friends when, in reality, I mostly dislike them and am very annoyed by them. I just wish I was like other people and could make friends easily, and I wish I could have more empathy for other people but I just can't."
To the people who don't show up for medical appointments.,"Using a throwaway because of my position where I work. No, I'm not a doctor, nor am I responsible for booking patients for appointments.

&#x200B;

I've wanted to get this off my chest for a while. I have a managerial position in a medical practice located in a, to put it mildly, not so nice an area, and I've held it for the last few years. For all of that time, our biggest issue has been long wait times (something frequently cited in bad yelp and google reviews).

&#x200B;

I get it, and I sympathize. I hate waiting at the doctor's office too. Yet these same patients routinely skip appointments without prior notification, forcing us to double book just to be able to fill the doctor's schedule on a given day.

&#x200B;

The results of this are as such: a particular doctor can see about 20-25 patients in one day. They will have 35-40 on their schedule, and on average, 20 will show up with anywhere from 10-15 of those either confirming the previous day that they will come in and not, or simply not answering their phone when called. The average may be 20, but that's because on any given day, 10 of the 40 will show up, causing the doctor to do nothing for long stretches, or 35 of the 40 will show and patients will complain of long wait times.

&#x200B;

I don't understand why so many people think it's OK to book a doctor's appointment and just not show up. Would they do the same for an interview? Or for dinner with a friend? Or for, really, anything else? Now, I don't know about you guys, but I've always assumed that everyone was taught as I was: it's common courtesy to let people know you can't make it, and to either cancel or reschedule.

&#x200B;

For me, it's a simple matter of disrespect. Disrespect for the staff, the doctor, and for fellow patients.   


I would understand it if the patient simply did not want to see the doctor, or didn't want to wait in line. That makes sense. No one can guarantee being able to show up. Just let the staff know a day in advance so we can fill the slot with a patient who might want to see the doctor earlier. You can even let the staff know when they call to confirm your appointment a day in advance. But don't just not pick up the phone (or not answer the text/email/VM) from the doctor asking if you are still coming in.

&#x200B;

To answer one common question that does come up: charging patients in low income areas no show fees is usually illegal and always immoral. "
i feel so lonely,"i recently broke up with my boyfriend of almost two years because i kissed another boy. I'm a bad person i know. We ended things on good terms. I wasn't happy with him either but i still shouldn't have cheated on him. I loved him he was my best friend, i don't think breaking up with him was a mistake, cheating on him was a mistake. He didn't deserve that. But i wasn't happy. However, i lost my best friend, and i don't have many friends. I feel lonely. I feel so lonely. It just hit me weeks later, and i don't know what to do. "
Trying to be supportive for my girlfriend is starting to drain me.,"So here is the context. My girlfriend of 7 years is going through a rough time right now. Here mother is very sick. Not entirely sure what all could be wrong, but every day it seems like something different. This has been going on for a while now.

My girlfriend is very close to her mom and this is killing her. If something would happen to her mom, I’m not sure what I would be able to do. I can only say the same thing so many times. I not sure what else to say. 

When her mother gets sick, it’s all my girlfriend can think about. It puts everything else on the back burner. I mean she does try to do things to take her mind off of it, but it’s always there. I’m 100% supportive of what she is doing. She needs to be there for her mom. I am just not sure how I can help on my end.

I’m there as much as I can be. I offer to pick things up or do this or that. I try to say supportive things and they sometimes work. I am just scared of the what if’s. What if her mom gets worse? God forbid what if she passes? I guess I’m just rambling here. I’m just scared that no matter how hard I try nothing will be enough. 

This is not a pity party for me or anything at all. I guess I’m just scared of all of it. I’m nowhere near running out of gas, and I will stay supportive. But I know there will be a breaking point. I don’t even know what I’m saying. This doesn’t even make sense. Just needed to get it off my chest, but it honestly does feel like it helped."
My abusive ex died last year,"You died last year and I never got to apologize. Though I doubt you would have listened. In your eyes I was the one at fault, the one who abused you. To me for the longest time, it was the other way around. Perspective changes a lot. So does age.

It's been five or six years since we last talked. I had been angry for the longest time at being manipulated, at being cheated on and being accused of something that I didn't see then. I had a right to be angry. You did too.

Truthfully I still think I got the short end of the stick, and a lot of how I acted towards you was because of what you had done to me. But I hadn't voiced it until it was too late. I've never been good at sharing how I feel. You would tell me I was doing something or acting a certain way and I could never see it. It's been so long and now I don't remember what happened or what I was accused of. Even then I just wanted you to tell me what I had done so I could fix it. I've never had a good memory. To me telling you I didn't do something or that I didnt remember probably felt a lot like gaslighting. To you it was. I never wanted you to feel like that and I'm sorry I got angry when you told me I had acted mean or said something that made you upset. I couldn't remember. I still can't. I wish I did so I could properly apologise.

We were both so young then and neither of us were healed from things we had endured when we were too young to cope with them. Neither of us fit for a proper relationship or discussing things between us without it turning toxic and unhealthy.

When I found out you died it was on a whim to check the profile of your best friend on a site we used to go on. I saw the post he made talking about how you passed. I felt so glad. As if a huge weight had lifted off my shoulders. I felt like that for at least a week, every time I would think of it. I'm sorry. I feel guilty now. 

While you're gone, I'm moving on and getting better. I'm growing up and experiencing healthy relationships and working and having a home. You get to experience none of that. I wish you did.

I've finally started to heal from my past and our relationship. I have an amazing boyfriend of two years. An apartment away from my family. A stable job I'm excelling at. I'm still depressed and have a long way to go, but I've gotten better. 

Thank you for the years we spent together, even if it was awful for both of us. You helped me become who I am today. I hope that you leave this life behind for a better, more peaceful one. A happy one. That you forget all you have gone through and the tragic way you passed. You deserve a happy, healthy life and family.

And I'm sorry, for all that I have done."
Mid life crisis at age 25?,"I had a stable job for 5 yrs and made pretty decent money, bought myself a nice house and nice things, enjoyed being independent. One day I think I let the stresses of every day life get to me and had a break down. Decided I hated my job and decided to look into other options. I took a real estate course and passed. Before taking the state exam I quit my job of 5 yrs. (obvious mistake now) Two months went by of me being completely unemployed, I took the state exam 5 times and finally gave up, feeling like a total bum and failure. 

I took the first shitty job that was offered to me. An early morning shift at a hotel restaurant making min wage. Then I also waited tables at a restaurant on Fri nights. I continued this for about 6 mo. every day trying to figure out what to do with my life. My bank account at this point has been depleted. Going from making 50k a year to min wage has been obviously rough on my life style. I have medical bills in collections, missed a payment on my credit card. Had to borrow $500 from my dad to help pay essentials like car insurance. Never in my life have i felt so low. 

One day at my shitty hotel job a frequent guest asked me if I’d be interested in a sales job. I 100% jumped at the opportunity and sent him my resume and was hired in 2 days. 

I have now been at the sales job for a little over a month. It sucks. The money is good , if I stick with it I could be making 50k again. I work every sat and sun and the hours can be odd. It’s taking a toll on my fiancé and i’s sex life and I feel like we never get to spend time together. Just having a really hard time being happy with my life. Currently applying for other jobs. 

Shoutout to my fiancé who has been extremely mentally supportive through all of this. He keeps telling me to do what I need to do to just be happy again. Thinking I could be suffering from slight depression or something of that nature? Last night I drank too much and took my anger/ emotions out on him and am feeling so guilty about it I never want to drink again. Which is saying a lot for me since I am usually a party animal. 

Just posting this to get it off my chest. Thanks for reading if you got this far. 

Does anyone have a job they actually enjoy? Wish I could find a job that actually made a difference in people’s every day life. Not just selling bullshit. "
Apex legends is scary,"It’s got that core mechanics of a first person shooter that I’ve grown up loving my entire life. shit the majority of Respawn Entertainment are the same devs who made call of duty 4, that alone speaks for its self that was the first game that made me sneak a god damn wire through my house so my mom wouldn’t know I was playing online.

It’s literally got everything right now. I dumped 400-500 hours into PUBG when it first came out cause it was my first battle Royale experience, unfortunately it just got kinda boring cause besides shoot the other guy and move in with the circle there wasn’t much else. 

Then BAM!! Fortnite comes along, not everyone’s cup of tee but god damn that game grabbed me by the balls with all the crazy awesome shit they add into that game, like there’s no such thing as a basic firefight in that game. The enemy might see you build a fucking skyscraper only to blow your builds up with a stick of dynamite strapped to a god damn plunger then jump out of his build with a flying snowboard into a portal that teleports him 1000 feet into the air so he can fly across the map. Or come screaming at you like a fucking hyena while pumping shotgun shells into you Just pure insanity that always kept you guessing. But the building got so ridiculous the shooter aspect of the game kinda got lost for me. 

And then........ APEX LEGENDS DROPS!!!!!1!!!1!!!!! HOLY FUCKING SHIT How in the literal hell does a game have almost Zero advertising besides a 30 second trailer 48 hours before it drops and still be this popular? I’ll tell you how the game is fucking dope that’s how. It’s got that tactical FPS feel that we all fell in love with on call of duty 4, a ping system that every BR should of had from the start. The sliding? Yo that shit feels clean as fuck and the hero abilities throws just a big enough curve ball into the game that it keeps stuff fresh and creative without making you feel like you need to play Minecraft for 10000 hours just to not fall behind. 

This the type of game every gamer secretly wants. The type of game that’s gonna fuck up your entire life, the shit that’ll jeopardize your marriage, make stock markets crash, have Firefighters accidentally burn down a city block cause they’re only running on 30 minutes of sleep due to the “just 1 more game” effect. 

This game has me by the balls, The game is my Daddy, I’m at your will Apex. Due whatever you’d like with my body cause I’m ready for it. "
I sometimes wish my suicide attempt worked,"I tried to kill myself last year and before I could bleed out I asked for help. I went into a mental hospital for a couple of weeks and when I got out everything was worse. One of my closest friends told a bunch of people that I attempted, my counselor was extremely condescending, and my mental health was worse than before. Even though it’s been a few months everything still sucks. I’ve tried my hardest but I’m exhausted. I have dark moments where I just wish I waited for a few minutes and maybe I would have died. I try my best to push those thoughts away and think I can have a future but I’m still so tired. I’ve tried medication before and I’m in therapy. It’s not working for me but I’m going to keep trying. I want to be ok so bad. "
What’s a “healthy” break/break up?,"Recently, I’ve been having thoughts about my future. 
Some context: Me & my boyfriend have been dating now almost 5 years. I’m (21) I started dating him after I got out of a very toxic/abusive relationship of 3 1/2 years right before I started college & before that I was in cutesy relationship for 3 years in middle school. BEFORE that, I had a crush and “dated” another boy in my class for 3 years throughout Elementary. Obviously some of these were adolescent relationships. My point is, I have always been familiar with the dating dynamic. I’m the type to fully invest myself in the person & don’t do petty relationships. 
The guy I have been dating is truly wonderful, I cannot say that “I don’t love him” or there’s no “connection” anymore. It is still definitely there. However he replicates, or shows tendencies of insecurity or possessiveness occasionally that can really tear down my mood and make me feel like doing my own thing wouldn’t work while being with him because it brings back memories of how easy it is for me to become that “controlled girl” again and to be scared to do what I want to do with the fear that I will be judged, or looked at differently by him. He works 5 hours away and travels weekly away from me which I guess gives us our space. However we’re supposed to move together and be with each other 24:7 after I graduate college. I just don’t think it’s a good idea deep down even though I want it to be so bad, he has lost all his gym progress within the last 3 years of all the traveling & working, and never has anytime to work on his own ambitions or career path. I feel like I’m retarding his potential. In a way I guess you could say he’s pretty head over heels for me, puts me first instead of himself even. Now that I’m going to graduate college I have to seriously think about my career and I guess my mentality is if I want to marry someone I need to not have any regret about not dedicating enough time to myself. I don’t like relying on anyone else but myself for security. (I want to Model, launch my Art brand, and get a bangin’ healthy body, as well as travel & truly find myself) he doesn’t necessarily suffocate me. I like being around him, but I’m not productive or nearly as creative as I once was. He’s almost like a distraction I can’t help be infatuated with. I could see how his current dynamic would work for me in the future, but not until I feel financially stable and know who I truly want to be. Is it possibly to break up with someone & them truly understand  “it’s not you, it’s me” 
I feel like I just need to break away & can’t stop thinking about the future instead of remaining in the present. I don’t want to hurt him. He has never cheated and is loyal, he’s not interested in other girls, he made that clear. I am also not interested in dating other guys, however I am not the type to believe in “breaks”  where we still talk, as I feel this would in the long-term put me right back to square one. I also don’t like the idea of having someone wait around for me to decide I’m ready to be in a relationship again. I’m so stuck... HELP

Just end up re watching Rocky Balboa ( 6th movie) and here I am somewhat broken inside .

You've have to understand I grew up watching theses flicks. We were dirt poor and when my stepdad snapped and bought a VCR he bought the 4 first Rocky VHS with it. Money was ,as I said short, and I must have seen theses movies a billions times each.

To the point were the soundtrack was lullabies for my little brothers and I grew up with Stallone as a role model ( well at least his character) and got really attached to the rest of the cast.

I used to joke that as some family have a crucifix in their house we had a photo of Rocky.

&#x200B;

I'm not here to discuss if the movie is good or not . As always its a simple but moving story and I enjoyed it.

&#x200B;

It's more about what it wakes up in me.

&#x200B;

Memories of a time where I could not see the flaws in my parents, hard times when money was short but I felt like I belonged.

&#x200B;

I don't have a family anymore,well apart from my children and my wife.

&#x200B;

My brothers only contacted me when they need some help as I'm the oldest.

&#x200B;

My dad was never in the picture and my stepdad tried his best but I never was his son.

&#x200B;

Mom prefers her dog than spending some time with me or her grand children.

&#x200B;

And the rest of my relatives cut me off because I got married in my wife's town instead than in my area...

&#x200B;

I have tried a thousand time to make things right, tried to stand my ground, tried to apology , I got angry, nothing can work this up , no one just wanna discuss or explain things so I finally gave up

&#x200B;

I usually manage to keep things quiet but this situation haunted me . It s like a fire deep inside. I got used to the burnt but sometimes it s painful enough to make me wanna cry.

&#x200B;

I'm a grown ass man and that' s just a movie it should not make me feel this way but it does"
Im This close to blowing my fucking brains out,Im This fucking close to a mental breakdown. It’s my fault too. Fuck this 
"I just got back from the vet with my dog for what we thought was a hurt leg, found out he could slowly becoming paralyzed instead","I don't even know how to start this. I've been crying on and off today, and over the weekend as well even before I knew it was something serious. I'm 20 and still live with my parents, and on Saturday we noticed something was wrong. He was walking funny and looked like he didn't wanna put any pressure on his legs. He also didn't or couldn't wanna go to the bathroom that well but he was still eating a little bit and drinking water so we made a vet appointment for next Monday. But I went down to check on him again and something didn't sit right so I went to tell my mom we need to take him in today. He was panting and not getting better. He couldn't even lay down properly. We got him in, had to carry him everywhere because he couldn't walk, and the vet assistant gets his history and says she thinks its just a hurt back and they go to exam him. Vet gets back and says he has ataxia and a slipped disc that's basically squeezing part of his spinal cord. She wanted us to immediately go straight from there to a neurologist to get him surgery, but it could be up to $8,000 and we don't have that money. So all we can do now is pain management and cage rest and hope that he gets better. But she didn't sound hopeful. 

I had already been crying before we went, and I tried to keep myself together but I ended up crying anyways. This is the first dog I've had, and I don't know if I can ever go through something like this again. He pretty much kept me from doing anything stupid to myself when I was younger and pretty suicidal because I couldn't stand the idea of him walking around looking for me and me not be there anymore and have him end up depressed, which that might not've happened anyways but it still pretty kept me from doing anything. He's one of the reasons I haven't been concerned with moving out yet (on top of having literally no money), because I didn't like the idea of him passing away when I wasn't there to be with him. Like I know someone is gonna think, ""Dude its just a dog"" but I hate this so much. The last couple of weeks I've had a few dreams where I had to rush him to a vet because he was sick, and I had another one a few days ago before all this happened. He's a 10 year old chihuahua and I know stuff like this happens, I just didn't think it would be anything like this. I didn't think anything bad like this was gonna happen, that he was gonna live a few more years and just pass away because he's old. But he's in so much pain right now and it's not fucking fair for him. Best case scenario, he gets better and can use his legs almost as good as he did before. Ok case scenario is he doesn't, but he can still go to the bathroom on his own and he gets fitted for a doggy wheelchair. Worst case scenario is he becomes completely paralyzed, can't go to the bathroom and we have to put him down. I wanna be hopeful, but I don't wanna be too hopeful. I haven't eaten anything today, and right now all I really wanna do is sleep. I can't look at him without crying but I know the next couple of weeks I should spend as much time with him as I can. And get more pictures of him to keep.

And I know its kind of selfish of me right now and I haven't been in a relationship since I was 18 and I don't really get any urge to be most of the time but right now all I fucking want is someone that can just fucking be there with me, and let me cry and hold me or whatever. Because I have a feeling that in a few weeks I'm gonna feel the loneliest I've ever felt in my life. "
I've had a computer since I had turned 4 and I'm starting to wonder if it's the cause of all my problems.,"Just as I turned 4 I had one and never stopped using one since. I've spent more time on a computer than I've spent doing anything else, literally. I'm 23 and my life consists of waking up, working, hitting the gym, and then going on the computer til bed. If I'm not working, it's generally wake up, computer for like 6-8 hours, then gym, then computer til I go to bed. It's definitely an addiction for me. I can't remove myself from it, time spent away from it feels wasted unless I'm with friends. The reason I feel this way now (and have finally noticed it's a problem) is because when I had started dating my current gf, I never touched it. I felt so motivated and inspired to do more with myself so I would wake up, make myself and my sister a coffee, have a long chat with her, go to work if I had it or the gym, come home, read a bit, hangout with my sister some more, and then go to bed. Life felt very efficient, I was being social with family, working, working out, talking to my girlfriend, it was just an amazing feeling, but now I'm back on my bullshit, can't get off the computer. I still work out daily, but only after I spend 6-8 hours on the computer so I can get my fill for the morning, work out, then feel like I can spend another 6-8 hours on the computer.

My work sends me documents that take 5-10 minutes to finish, yet I literally put them off non-stop, and for what? To browse Reddit, to read things I don't care about. To play a game, maybe, whatever it may be. I literally have zero motivation to do ANYTHING work related, or not entertainment computer related. I really don't know how to quit and I kind of want help but I can't afford it.

I want to ask my work if my benefits cover therapy, I only get $650 a year in benefits but would that be enough to help me annually? Thanks guys."
I just don’t know what to do,"There’s got to be something wrong with me. I’m so obsessed with this woman business. I’m so obsessed with women’s bodies and their posteriors and their faces when they look a certain way. It’s all I can think about, it’s the only thing that thrills me, It’s not about love, it’s an addiction, an obsession. I can’t break away, My head is in a strange place and all I can think about is that Asian girl on OkCupid who I STILL can’t get to talk to me. My friends kicked me out of our skype group, my psychotherapy place kicked me out for recording a girl’s butt and violating confidentiality. I have nothing I can do. I have nowhere I can turn. My life is just horrible. I don’t understand how the people of this world can tell me to keep living. Why can’t I just die, world? Why do I have to keep suffering through this? I just want women to give me what I. want from them... But I know, it’s not right to want women. I’m sorry. There’s nothing anyone can do. I cry for help over and over because there’s nothing else I can do. Nothing ever works. I’m too weird to be happy in life. I need, I NEED, to die. And this world... needs to give me persmission. "
college choices are getting me down but my friend keeps getting me back up,"i’m (17f) a senior in high school and so i’m applying to colleges. somehow, i got accepted to my dream school. the catch is i can’t really afford to go there - if i did, id end up $50,000+ in debt by the end of it. so what’s gonna happen is i’ll go to the state school 20 minutes from my house, where my mother works on campus. 
i really wanted to leave for college bc my parents presence has felt stifling to me for at least the past three years, but i don’t think i can afford to.

anyways. that’s just background. my good friend (16m, junior, i’ll call him A) and i are both in the high school jazz band, and we had performances two hours away this weekend.

it all starts before the performance, where we get lunch at this mall. i’m wandering with another friend, J, and eventually we all meet back up in the food court to get on the bus. turns out there’s an arcade at this mall, bc A shows up with two stuffed Shiba Inu dogs that i fall in love with instantly. at first i just ask to pet one. it’s soft and cuddly and so i ask to hold it. i carried it around for the rest of the day. 

we stop at the mall for dinner late that evening and i pay for A to win another Shiba bc i felt bad. we ate and got back on the bus for a 2 hr ride in the dark. A actually hadn’t sat with me before on the bus; he had played video games with his other friend in the seat behind me. but he wanted to watch a youtube series with me, so we were together. it was short; and after that i was tired so i rested my head on his shoulder and we watched the movie playing on the bus screens. 

i tend to space out, so i get to thinking about everything instead of the movie. i confide in A about my college predicament, and despite my best efforts, i started crying. i don’t say anything, but i think he must have seen, or at least noticed, because it was mere seconds before he put a comforting hand on my back. 

it was sweet, but i just kept crying, so he wrapped me into a one armed hug. even sweeter, but the tears kept coming. A drops whatever he’s holding, and wraps his other arm around me, and pulls me into a real tight hug and let me cry on his chest for what felt like half an hour (but was really like 1-5 minutes)

i sniffled and the tears slowed after that, but he kept his hand on my back until i was dry eyed. then he turned to me and said the most comforting thing in the moment: “you are amazing, and you deserve your dream school, but i know that you are talented enough to succeed anywhere. and i know that you can do this, you can make your future beautiful no matter where you end up. i like to have faith that everything will turn out the way it should, and this is no different. it takes all kinds of people, who need people” that last bit being a quote from Mean Girls the musical, which i finished with a smile

“so find people you can bear” :)

he is such a good friend and i’m so glad to have him in my life.

after that, i asked him what i should name my acquired Shiba. he said “something that is reminiscent of this weekend”

so i named her Amy, short for amicus, which is the latin word for friend (yes, we both take latin)

and i just wanted to share because it still makes me smile over a week later 

(and before y’all tell me to date him: he and i are both in separate loving relationships of over a year each.)

anywho. i love my friends."
My life feels like a mess,"My life feels like a total mess, and its time I confess how I'm feeling to the world. Here it goes.

\- I created a separate Reddit account because I'm embarrassed of who I am, even though nobody even knows who I am based on my other username. This makes me feel weak.

\- I'm withdrawing from a mood stabilizer, which is making me feel crazy and depressed. I feel like I'm in a pit that I will never dig myself out of.

\- My social life sucks. I have no energy to go out and make new friends. I barely even have energy to hangout with the few friends I already have.

\- I have ZERO sex life. I'm too trapped in my head and can't escape the idea that I'm socially awkward. Every interaction I have with a girl I'm remotely attracted to feels forced and uncomfortable.

\- I feel like a lonely, depressed piece of shit

\- Sometimes I want to kill myself

\- I have a college degree, and I don't even think I want to get a job with it. I don't want to sit in a cubicle doing work I don't enjoy.

\- I have a lot of creative ideas, but I'm never motivated enough or have enough energy to follow through with them. This makes me feel like a worthless pile of shit.

\- I feel inferior to many other men and feel small, even though I'm average height and weight.

\- I was bullied growing up, which left me feeling weak.

\- I was yet at / bullied by sports coaches as a really young kid which makes me feel like everybody is always judging me and mad at me.

\- My parents are always stressed and have extremely negative vibes. They rarely actually listen to me and usually don't respond or only have one word responses if they do. I can't stand being around them, but I also don't want to move out when I graduate this may because I'm scared shitless of living alone and being lonely for the rest of my life.

\- I have no willpower.

\- I'm terrified to die alone.

\- I'm so utterly lonely.

\- I practice mindfullness, but sometimes it all feels like a sham or at the very least pointless.

\- I feel like I want to fuck shit up to get energy out, but I'm too sick to even do that. I have a current medical problem that makes me feel sick whenever my heart rate goes up.

\- I'm addicted to porn because its the only girls I ever get aside from my ex girlfriend who I'm pretty sure only sees me because she's desperate.

\- I'm SO embarrassed at how self conscious and needy I am.

\- I don't know if I'll ever recover from my social trauma.

\- Everything feels like a big deal.

\- I started reading into horrible conspiracies and now I feel like my life is at risk after reading one. This terrifies me, but also I'm not sure if I believe it.

\- Everything feels so sad.

\- I just want to be normal. I just want to feel normal.

The end."
"I’m an 18(M), I struggle to talk to girls and strike up random conversations. I really need advice..","      I’m almost a high school graduate and I simply just struggle talking to girls. I grew up as an only child, never had friends over and generally didn’t talk to the opposite sex and that definitely shows deep down inside me. It’s just frustrating because “i” don’t have an issue with it but my body freezes up and stops. 

       A really severe example of this is back in middle school, 8th grade I believe, I met this girl on Facebook, got her number and started texting her..24/7 basically, but at school I strongly avoided her. It was to the point where we’ve been talking for almost 5 months and never said a word to each other face to face. At that point I just stopped talking to her but told her I liked her. Long story short we just stopped talking. The girl still goes to my school, we’re going to graduate this year and I do want to apologize or just say something to her. This isn’t the only case either. 

       It drives me crazy. I know this is some petty shiit but it’s a real issue that I face everyday but can not overcome for some reason. If anyone can give me advice, suggestions or even examples, I’ll gladly listen. Thank you for reading this ♥️"
I'm 17 and I feel like everything is falling apart,"First I am looking for support so comments are welcome. 

I am so tired of everything. I might sound whiny because lots of other people here are much older than I am and have problems that are much bigger or ""real"" but I still feel so shitty. 

First of all I hate how I look. So so much. Every time I look in the mirror I want to cry. I'm a girl and I'm not fat though I wish I were skinnier (I'm 5'6 and 134 lbs) but the weight on my body is spread out in a really weird way and everything I wear except for really loose t shirts looks horrible. My face doesn't make up for it because quite honestly it's even worse. I have lots of noticeable acne scars (very noticeable because I have dark skin), bushy eyebrows, a really big and misshapen nose, and my face shape is oblong and soft. I have never been asked out before and I'm pretty sure no one has ever had a crush on me. At a friend's reccomendation I asked a guy out a few weeks ago, and after that he stopped speaking to me. 

I remember one time I went to visit India and people are a lot less reserved about their comments there. One woman asked me what all the marks (acne scars) on my face were and my mom said ""she's just becoming a woman"". Another woman pointed at my frizzy, curly hair and laughed. Meanwhile people kept saying how beautiful my mom and my sister were. I just can't get over the fact that I'm ugly. I always want to starve myself to at least become skinny but I can't because I have no self control and I'm always tempted by food. I've had issues with binge eating in the past and I probably have some type of eating disorder (not anorexia or bulimia).

Yes I have tried makeup which makes me look marginally better but not that much. 

I just wonder how anyone will ever love me. I can't even bring myself to love myself. My parents don't think I'm beautiful. They are constantly pressuring me to lose weight. My mom wants to watch me step on the scale so she can see how much I weigh. My parents are obsessed with my weight. When we go to the store to buy clothes my mom always tells me ""if you dropped a few more pounds that would look amazing on you"" and now that's all I can think whenever I try anything on, that things would look good on me if I was just skinny. 

I used to quell my anger at myself by pinning a lot of the blame on my parents and saying that once I get to college I'll fix my life-- if no one is giving me 3 meals a day then I can finally starve myself and get the body I want, for example, I will finally be able to wear clothes that fit me and that I want to wear, I'll be in control of my own life, etc. So I focused all my energy on studying hard in school and dedicating myself to extracurriculars so that I would have a good shot at a top school. 

Flash forward to now. I've been accepted already to some schools (Duke is the best of them so far) but I've been waitlisted at Johns Hopkins, Washington University St. Louis, UChicago, rejected at MIT. Even my dream of attending a top school isn't panning out as I'd hoped, and I feel like all my hard work has been for naught. So now I'm ugly and stupid not only to myself, not only to my parents, but to colleges. 

IRL no one would even suspect me of making this post. People say I'm confident, funny, smart, and sweet, that I'm witty, nonjudgmental, and have a vivid and bright personality. But I feel like that's all just a front. On the inside I'm insecure and rotten and broken and I hate myself so so much.

Time I stripped for cows,"Throw away because this is whack and my main literally has my face on it.

   Alright so my grandfather has been metal detecting like my whole life, his basement is full of old relics from the civil war (belt buckles, bullets etc.). When I was about 8 or 9 maybe he offered to take me with him to a farm to hunt for relics. It was beautiful property from what I remember of it. Lots of land and some cows and fences and shit, typical farm stuff. So after a few hours of finding nothing (except the remains of a bull which has completely decomposed leaving nothing left but white bone which was actually pretty cool now that I think about it) I decided I was going to go sit in an empty field and wait for him to get done doing his little hunt. After like maybe 20 minutes I really had to go to the bathroom and I saw this cow doing it on the other side of the fence so I was like “why don’t I just do it” so basically I took my pants off and proceeded to defecate on the ground and left them off for another 5-10 minutes. I don’t remember wiping but I don’t remember feeling like I didn’t either so there’s kinda a gap in my knowledge there. I remembered doing this maybe 4 months ago and being significantly older I put together that they probably had some kind of monitoring equipment in place so I may have done this all for some weird farmer to watch. 


TL;DR 
saw a cow take a shit so I preceded to take my pants off and shit on the ground and then kinda sat there without pants for a bit. "
Disgraceful state of mental health services,"It seems in the UK there is no support for mental health. There is nothing but years of waiting lists and throwing meds at you left right and centre. I asked my mental health nurse if I could see a psychiatrist but she said that the psychiatrist would tell me the same thing she said.

I tried to explain to my GP today that I have never been diagnosed with anything and the GP said I have depression. So if you go to a GP and say you feel down you have a mental condition called depression that requires medication to get better. I never had any tests or anything in writing detailing my condition.

I said to the GP I don't feel right in my head and that I think I could have a serious mental illness or maybe autism but she insists depression. My brother is a paranoid schizophrenic and refuses his meds. He goes into town in his dressing gown and gets brought home by the police at least twice a week. On Saturday he went to Thornton's and helped himself to chocolate in his dressing gown. He won't get sectioned because he is not violent, he is considered an independent individual capable of looking after himself.

What the fuck? "
Do you feel like you have a romantic partner “type” that you are often more attracted to than others?,"I (31F) come from a stable, somewhat conservative family. My parents have been married for about 32 years, my paternal grandparents have been married for over 55 years. Yet, ever since I started dating I always felt myself drawn to guys from broken families and/or poor financial status (I’m now married to someone who fits my description exactly!). It’s almost like I was subconsciously trying to choose someone I could “fix”, even though I never purposely thought about it at the time. And whenever I found guys from “stable” families and with a healthy financial situation I’d end up doing something to sabotage the relationship. (I wonder if there is some sort of psychological explanation for that!)

Can anyone else relate to my situation in specific?

Tl;dr: Do you feel like you are often drawn to the same “type” of romantic partner?"
The Calm commercials that require you to do nothing for 30 seconds cause me anxiety.,"I don't know if that says something about me or about Calm.

Either way, I guess it gets the point across?"
I've been holding it in for too long...,"You joined my primary friend group of me and two others and I don't even know how. Everything was fine when I saw you for one class until you started asserting yourself into MY group. Now you're budding into conversations that I have with them and being a know it all, and now I don't even get a chance to speak. You're around them more than I am and you stole my individual fun with them. I don't know why you being around us annoys me so much, but every time I see you hanging with them without me there I get angry. I'm about to the point where I wanna scream in your face and tell you to fuck off. But I can't. I'm stuck with you now and now I have to just sit in silence as you yell over me talking and interrupt me."
I am so easily deterred it's sad.,"My happy moods are incredibly fragile. Or maybe I'm sensitive, idk. I can be having a great day, but then someone else can come up next to me and say something angry or even mildly hostile and it makes me feel like crap. It's a strange feeling: The sudden sharp pain, then the weird sad tingle that floods your body. And then ultimately the burning behind your eyes as you try not to cry. It kinda sucks, since I can sink into that terrible feeling so easily, and I hate being this way.

Usually I go quiet afterwards. Or I do this anxious thing where I kind of mumble out loud to myself cheerfully, maybe trying to make it better. But I know that it's not really helping.

So instead I'll just sit alone by myself for a while, try not to cry and browse some dank memes until the feeling goes away."
Quitting with no other prospects,"I've never quit a job without another option before. I don't have another job lined up for me yet, and I've been consistently rejected by every employer I interviewed for over the past 6 months (2-3 interviews per week). I've been on short-term disability through my current employer since November, and was hoping to find an alternative before I had to return. That never happened; I'm being forced to return tomorrow, and I just can't face the terrible people and the toxic environment. I don't know if tomorrow I'll feel more depressed or more relieved, but here goes nothing. "
I like this person but I’m young and don’t know if this is right,"So I like this girl she is my best friend for 2 years now but the thing is I don’t really know if what I feel is like ‘love’. I’ve liked guys for a majority of my life at least I think. What I felt for those guys is different from how I feel with her.

I don’t know how love should feel like. I can’t tell if what I feel for her platonic or romantic and it’s frustrating.I don’t want to tell her how I feel unless I know it’s right."
I feel like a terrible human being,"For roughly 2 years I had a weird friends with benefits situation with this girl where we'd only sext. We stopped talking a few months ago but out of nowhere she popped up again in my life saying she loved me. I currently have a girlfriend and so I didn't know what to do about this situation. I decided to give her closure by doing the sext thing again for closure, one last time  so we could move on and be done with eachother. It was mainly her, she did most of the talking and sent nudes while I did minimal talking and didn't send her a single photo, but I still feel terrible. I love my current girlfriend, she's the best thing that's ever happened to me. Nobody else in my life has ever made me as happy as she has, I genuinely love her with all my heart. It was only a text message and I barely even did anything but I still feel like I stabbed her in the back. All I wanted was to finally have this other woman out of my life for good and give her something she could use to move on but now I feel like I completely betrayed the one woman I've ever fallen in love with. Maybe I'm being overdramatic, maybe I'm not, I've just never pictured myself to be like this. My father cheated on my mother and it tore my family apart. My whole life I've been telling myself I'll never be like him but now I feel like I've taken the first step to turning into him. I hate it and I hate myself right now. I just feel like a terrible human being."
My manager sucks at making schedules,"I work at a fast food chain and let me tell you that in itself has been a challenge, but one of the things that is the most annoying is how many times I get calls and texts from the manager about coming in earlier or how she has changed the schedule multiple times. It's like every time I come into work, the schedule had been changed.

If you don't show up to just one of your shifts, you're written off the schedule for 2 weeks. Now if the schedule was on an app or available online, then it wouldn't be such a problem. You have to come into work to see the changes. Not only that, but because it's a paper schedule, anyone could literally write over it, change the times, etc. It's just a terrible system.

My sleeping schedule, if you can even call it that, is all over the place. I told her I prefer night shift or closing shifts because it's easier for me to wake up and get to work, and yet, I'm being given shifts that start at lunch time and have to work until closing, because people are either being written off the schedule or not showing up for work.

Or it can be 15 minutes before your shift and she will say I don't need you to come into work.

Since it's fast food, there is no one to call or talk to about the instability in our schedules. No one can make appointments or plans because you can just be told you have to come in at the last minute or say goodbye to your hours. It feels like our jobs are in constant jeopardy. I hate the feeling."
I can't stop thinking about suicide,"I've been thinking about committing suicide these past few months. There are days when the thoughts are dormant but eventually they keep coming back.

I've been feeling like my entire life doesn't really make any difference. I'm just living in a never-ending cycle of working hard so I can eat and eating so I can work hard. Everything is starting to feel pointless.

I mean what's the point of living a life that doesn't really have a purpose? I've been trying to dismiss these thoughts for quite a while now but I just can't. I tried talking to people but they can't seem to get what I'm going through.

One of these days, I feel like I'm finally gonna gather enough courage to get on with it. Although I haven't really done anything to end my life yet besides minor cuts on my wrist.

At this point, I really don't know what to look forward to anymore. I feel like there's no point in even trying."
I feel like my anxiety is pretty bad to the point where I give a shit if random people on Reddit don't like or agree with me.,"The amount of times I erase posts or end up not posting anything is insane. Something about this site makes me actually give a shit what people think about what I say, and I care about how they react to my posts. I don't even know why. Once I'm aware that I give a shit I normally can just tell myself that these people don't matter and then I stop giving a shit, but it's annoying."
I just got rejected from my top university choice,"I'm from a pretty privileged background and go to a private school in the UK so it's hard to feel much pity for me.

All my life I've been cushioned. I had pinned such high hopes on getting in to this university and now it's been smashed and I'm so disappointed in myself and can't bear to tell anyone but they're going to find out. I feel pathetic."
I'm Proud of Myself :),"This will be a looooong post so hang in there :')

I have had a hell of a few years. I'll be the first to admit that on the most part, it's been my fault! But at least I've managed to pull myself out of a lot of it!

When I was about 9 or 10 I was first diagnosed with anxiety. Since then, through the early teenage years I've been diagnosed with depression and anorexia among other physical health conditions. Those don't play roles so much in my life anymore and I'm really proud that I've learned to cope with these. I've built up my confidence to a point where I no longer think about how everyone sees me, and I'm fine with speaking in front of people and I'm now very extroverted! I have more good days than bad ones. I still have trouble eating in front of people, and I still feel uncomfortable when people make comments or acknowledge what I eat but I'll just have to get over that! However, I'm actually bulking up since I want to put on a bit more muscle and I might rejoin the rugby team! My depression has mostly gone, I still have some days where I get the feeling like no one wants me but instead of pitying myself I push the negativity into determination and go walk up the nearest hill (walking has done wonders for me. It's surprising what some fresh air and nature can do). 

I'm also transgender... Which is a lot to bear sometimes. It puts a bit of stress on my family as they wonder if I'll be safe, but I'll be starting testosterone in a few months! So, there's always something to work towards and look forward to! My dysphoria has gotten a lot better as in if I start feeling bad about my body, I try and remember that I'll be properly transitioning soon so there'll be quite a bit of sadness taken out my life. So I'm excited for that! 

Also, I've managed to get off all drugs! (This is one I'm super proud of). For a few years I was completely dependent on weed to get me to sleep and get me through the day, and different pills and powders I thought would help me. But, having been away from it all for a long time now, I realise that they didn't help at all, they made things a lot worse. What really kicked me to get off everything was I was caught with (luckily) only a bit of weed on me. It was a first time offense and I had been involved with a few initiatives before so I was not given a criminal record. I'm incredibly thankful for the officers to have let me off with a warning and let me get better. I wouldn't have coped otherwise. I'm having to deal with the repercussions now, I have a lot of my life to get back, a lot of mental stuff to work on, and a lot of general work to get stuck back into. I know that I will never go back to that life *ever* again. I regret it so much. So many people close to me got pushed away because of it and I'm now mending the bonds. 

I'm also proud of myself because although I have fucked up majorly in my life, I am still alive. The amount of times I've considered letting go... But I'm here. And there's some moments in life I am really excited about. When I finish my education completely, I think I'll move to Germany and reinvent myself. Start completely new, and get rid of the labels and rumors about me. I'm really excited to do that. 

So yeah. Thanks for bearing with me lmao sorry for writing a novel about my life: just felt I needed to vent that I'm actually quite proud of how far I've come from where I was!

TLDR: I was fucked up, I have fucked up, and I'm learning and slowly managing to unfuck my life! :)
"
My eye is getting worse...,"At first I just felt it. Went and got it checked. 
Was told it’s the nerve.
I had the surgery. Felt a lot better.... 


But it started again. It always feels tired. I started noticing it in pictures, drooping a bit. It’s so much worse if I drink, so I don’t. 

Then friends started talking about it, first behind my back and then with concern to me. 
I went back to the doctor. They said it isn’t the nerve, it’s just getting extremely lazy. Fixing it is “cosmetic” so nothing will be covered. 

Within a year is got so, so much worse. There’s no hiding it with angles anymore. 

I budgeted it out. Five years. I’ll have to live with this getting worse for five more years. I notice it rapidly deteriorating... It hurts. 
I want to feel pretty. I want to take cute pictures with my friends. 
They always delete the ones where it’s noticeable... I’ve noticed the ones with me are never posted anywhere. Whatever, I’m not big on social media. It just hurts my feelings. 

“It’s barely noticeable!” 
But my left eye is half shut and looks like it’s floating strange. And if it isn’t noticeable, why are you bringing it up? 

I noticed they stare at that eye a lot more now, or avoid it entirely. It’s super obvious when it’s acting up really bad, because no one will look directly at me.


I’m 24... I want to feel young and free in my 20’s, and instead I’m going to wake up and be nearly 30 and THEN I can start to feel like myself. 

My dating life is non existent... the last guy seemed so amazing. Then we drank together and I could feel my eye drooping a whole bunch. He seemed awkward. Would look at it and then away. Avoided even looking me in the face the rest of the night. We left shortly after and he had the cab drop me off instead of going back to his like we planned. Broke it off before we saw each other again. 


I have so many things I want to do, but don’t feel I can until this is fixed... maybe it’s insecurities, but it’s hard not to feel hideous when one of your eyes is constantly wonky and pulling down your face. 


I won’t take photos anymore. 
I don’t go out on the town anymore. 
I don’t drink anymore. 
I don’t socialize and meet new people anymore. 
I don’t live anymore. 


And I won’t for another 5 years. 
That just sucks. It just sucks. 
I needed to tell someone, because I’m so tired of being told “it’s fine! Hardly noticeable!” 
Or “it adds character!” 
“They should love you how you are!”
“Don’t let it hold you back!” 

Just let me be upset, ok? Let me cry about it. I’m heartbroken... "
MY CHILDS FATHER,"I went through a very emotional/very physically abused relationship with my daughters father for six years. Within that six years, I lost relationships with family due to me being naive enough to stick around in the drama. My family tried numerous times to help pull me away from the unhappiness but I refused. The SAME FAMILY who encouraged me to leave, who did not appreciate or respect my ex, are the same family who now stand by his side, go out and have drinks and love to be around him- of course now that we are split. I listened to my ex go on about how ridiculous a specific cousin of mine was, and now is with this cousin every other weekend he doesn’t have our daughter. Not only this cousin but others as well. Should I even let this bother me? Should I cut this family off who is fake in my face? I need HELP on how to keep myself in my positive/happy stage of life and how I do not let this get to me- even though it does- TREMENDOUSLY "
"Low key just got rejected by a guy in my grade. I know it shouldn’t ruin my entire day, but it has.","He literally has shown every sign that he might like me, but when I went for it. He said he didn’t. (This wasn’t direct. I had someone else ask and that’s what was said apparently) Guess that’s what happens when you’re ugly as shit lol. I don’t think I’m gonna have a date for prom which is more of why I’m upset. "
The weirdest month of my life,"Last night I got drunk with my co workers, but the feeling I felt around them was all too familiar, I felt alone and ignored. Like I only existed to them when they only wanted to acknowledge me. Trust me I had fun, but only when I didn’t feel ignored. I felt like the voice that gets lost in the crowd and never listened to, it hurt because this is the first job I’ve had that is outside of a beat up mall that I used to hate going to. I enjoy this job, I enjoy the people around me, but I don’t think they enjoy me. Everyone is very nice to me and all, but in group discussions I’m ignored and just forgotten. I’m just trying to catch myself from wanting their approval, because I’m not that type of person, but I just feel as if going out with my coworkers isn’t my thing. Feeling like this is troubling to me, because I don’t want to seem distant with my coworkers but now last night and my feelings were a lesson for me to realize that coworkers are just meant to be seen in work and not outside of it. 

Now for the tricky part of this month, towards the end of February to the start of this month, I found out I was pregnant. It was a shock, because I’m 18 and I know how much of a mistake this has been. Finding out I’m pregnant took me out of my state of mind of being a young adult that was carefree to and adult now who is now having to deal with adult situations. I’m getting an abortion tomorrow and my boyfriend is perfectly fine with it, but since this has happened my boyfriend and I have been arguing a lot more. At first the news brought us closer, but now we’re bickering a lot. The news of my pregnancy made me realize some feelings that I didn’t want to acknowledge, but I don’t think I want to be with my boyfriend anymore. He’s moving in with me and my parents this month and it’s hard, because I don’t know if I want to be with him anymore, because this isn’t the life I want. I don’t want to be so rushed into already having children, although it was a mistake and I’m getting an abortion, but in 2 years he wants to have children and I’m not ready for that. We’ve been together for a year now and I’m only 18 and he’s 21. His mind is more grown than mine and well, I still want to have fun and enjoy my youth while he wants to settle down quickly. Which I get that, because he loves me and I do love him a lot, but this pregnancy makes me want to just break away from everything and work on myself and what I want to do and focus on. Me wanting to leave him is not me being in love with him anymore, it’s just me realizing that maybe this is the wrong time for me to be with someone.  Idk like I said in the title, this has been the weirdest month of my life, I don’t know if these emotions are the result of my pregnancy, which would be understandable or me just realizing that I don’t enjoy being around older people anymore. I enjoy being around people my age and being my age. Everyone around me is older, my co workers, my boyfriend, etc. I just want to be around people my age who I can relate to, but now I’m facing the consequences of thinking I can handle adult decision, when I really cant.  I’m not sad or anything just confused, like I just need to be around new surroundings and new people. "
A unhelpful father,"This guy is married to my girlfriend’s sister and he refuses to take care of his kid. He repeatedly ask my girl to take care of his daughter so he can “go to gym” or “study” like dude you chose to have the kid so I don’t get why you don’t take care of her. 
It sucks because I can’t even say anything because then I’ll just cause problems and they make it seem like I’m the one in the wrong and I can’t stand it. 
Because if my girlfriend and me get married and have a kid together they wouldn’t help us. 
It’s just annoying how they expect us to drop everything while they wouldn’t take a step for us. "
A life that you don't hold by yourself,Do you ever feel just like everything you are as of now is out of your control? It's like I've been doing things just because I just need to please others and not for myself. 
I'm kinda sad and I think I need help?,"This is really weird to talk about but I'm kinda sad. And I didn't really notice until someone told me about it. My dad doesn't know, and he doesn't let me see Councillors, therapists or doctors for help. And honestly, it's not *just* sad.I feel extremely sad and I don't know why. It sounds stupid and it is but do you know anywhere else I could get help? Don't know if I should post this or not, it's weird."
Been holding this in my whole life,"I just need somewhere to put all of this because I’ve been holding it in for over a decade.

My parents like to drink, a lot. I’m saying bottles of wine each night. Usually they get along great with each other this is until they get drunk. 

For as long as I can remember my parents have argued with each other and things have gotten pretty heated. They will yell and scream at each other just acting like children. 

In the beginning I solely blamed my mum, she seemed to always instigate the fight but telling my dad how useless he is, that he’s the laziest c-word she has ever met (you will not believe how many times I have heard that phrase being used). My dad would try to put up with it it but would eventually snap and start yelling and screaming just saying that he wanted some peace and quiet.

In the early days if my dad saw that things were getting out of hand he would leave the house and sleep overnight in the business that he owned just to get out of the house.

This business also put stress on the family my mum constantly bringing it up in their fights. She says that my dad has ruined the family finances and put us into tons of debt. (I don’t know the extent of this as I am still in high school).

As the years progressed I have begun to blame my father more and more. I have seen him make a mountain out of molehill of little things that my mother has said.

When I was younger my mum constantly told my dad that he has Aspergers. He was later tested and shown not to have it but I still believe he is somewhere on the spectrum. He will now always bring it up that he has Aspergers seemingly to spite her.

As time progressed my dad sold his business and would now sleep at his dads place if things got bad. My grandpa passed away two years ago and now my dad has nowhere to go if things turn out bad. This has only made the arguments worse. After my grandpa died the fighting got way worse as he has now lost both his parents. On numerous occasions he has threatened to kill him self.

I learnt as I grew up that when things got incredibly bad my father would hit my mother. When my parents are drunk they don’t feel like themselves. It’s as if they’re different people.

The police have been around to my house dozens of times (they’re here as I’m writing this) and I’ve had to speak to my school councillor at my current and previous school. I constantly have a feeling of dread in my stomach and I’m constantly anxious. 

I don’t want to fully blame either of my parents as it feels like my mum pokes the hornet’s nest then wonders why she gets stung. Although they have threatened each other with divorce I don’t think they’ll ever go through with it as they get along with each other well during the day.

I have in the last tried to stop them from fighting but it never worked so I eventually just gave up and now leave them to it. The only people I have talked to about it are councillors and child protection officers. I know my friends would be understanding of me but I just feel unable to talk to them about it.

Sometimes I think to myself that all families go through things like this and that I’m just making a big deal out of it. I think that there are others who are worse off so I shouldn’t be complaining.

I really just needed to get this off my chest as I’ve been holding it in for what feels like my whole life. Sorry for the length I didn’t realise I had so much to say.

Being an atheist has actually made me a much happier and content person.,"Back when I was a believer, I always despaired about how awful people where.  We are supposed to be these spiritual beings and above being horrible! I didn't understand how misogyny and bigotry could even exist and was scared of even having any bad thoughts about anything because God would be judging me.   I
 used to  freak out about people like Richard Dawkins saying we are a selfish species, like all other animals because 
I didn't want to be just another animal.   Now, I actually appreciate humanity a lot more.   It is amazing we are fancy animals who gained sentience and can appreciate our surroundings.  Instead of crying about the evil in the world, I understand that there is still good people out there and no one is completely good or bad.   It is so freeing that I can be a moral person, because I am a moral person.  
I am not moral because some God told me to be.   Sometimes 
I do fear death though...it would be awesome to see my Sister in Law again. "

The Notebook is shit,How is this goals? 
Insecurity about frequency of hooking up,"TLDR: how do you emotionally/psychologically work through having dry spells of sex and intimacy?

I[21M] feel that everyone around me can always find someone and have enjoyable experiences with their partners. Like everyone else, male or female, always has an easy time finding someone whether it is one night stands, friends with benefits or a significant other.

However I do not have this ease. I know that there is nothing inherently wrong with me. In terms of appearance, I am of average height and look as good as any other man. My dick is fine and it’s not even how I make a person cum. I understand that I have a lot of good qualities and pursuits from reading to practicing music to really working to become emotionally intelligent. I try to be kind towards everyone and ambitious with all of my goals. Even though many men don’t have any of these pursuits, they are still capable of finding someone.

For a partner, I do not care how they look. I just want them to not be possessing, to be mentally stable and accepting of who I am. I know I’m not into men because kissing them doesn’t arouse me but I’m always open to trying. 

I guess, now that I’ve given a portrait of myself, I’m curious as to whether others feel the way that I do. How do you work past seeing other people hook up while you undergo a dry spell? How do you convince yourself that there is nothing wrong with you? 

I’d like to mention that I’ve bee having disappointing or terrible experiences with dates and sex so that’s also been bringing me down. "
I’m tired of loving you. I’m tired of waiting for you.,"I got pretty. I Shaved, because that’s how you like me. I Put my best new  underwear on, so I could impress you. I waited for hours for you to come. 

It was your birthday, so I made sure to get you a cake. I got you the prettiest one I could find. 

I couldn’t bake as I had promised, but I knew I could still make it up, I could still make it worth your while coming to see me on your birthday. 


I waited. I saw your posts. You were having fun, out with your friends, I was happy you were having a good time. You deserve it. 

But It’s so late right now, you’ve only texted to say you were still out, that you were still coming. 
But I have to wake up so early, I always make you a priority, while I’m stuck like this. Waiting for you, always second best. 

Didn’t you make a commitment? Didn’t you say we’d do lunch? It’s 11PM? When I texted you said you’d hang out with family then let me know. 

At what time do I say fuck you?
At what time should I forget you?
When should I tell you, I’m not here for you when you feel like having fun?

I’m a person too. 
Maybe I jumped ahead of myself. But you led me on. You made me believe we could be something.  

I’m tired of loving you. "
Bullies in my life have ruined me,"I used to be an outgoing person who made friends easily, loved to participate in social activities, told jokes and laughed a lot. That all has changed and I am now an adult who despises the outside world and prefers to spend the rest of their life in their room without dealing with people. This has been a result of the contious bullying I experienced in every stage of my life. I came across at least one bully everytime and with each encounter my outlook on life and human interactions decreased. I mean how else are you supposed to act after all this? Some examples:

-Following highschool, I got accepted into a very competitive tip top college. Naturally, I went in with the loving and friendly nature my highschool (luckily) raised me in. Nope. I was immediatly targeted. People began to pick on me and make fun of me for having outside hobbies. People would abuse me for my hobbies, would take their stress out on me, and would be passive aggressive with me (e.g. if I decided to dress up one day, I would get ""hah, you sure you got into this college without pulling some strings? You don't look like you study since you have enough time to worry about how you look"".) It pissed me off because we were all in the same boat, I just decided to be a better person so why should I be punished? The icing on the cake was how these bullies expressed dissapointment when I graduated with honors. They were hoping for SOME REASON I would fail or be below them. It really shook me up because I was with these bullies for 4 years but I decided I would not let it affect me.


-When I applied for a post-grad internship, I met another bully who hated how hard working I was. I was someone who came early and left late, kept up to date on my studies, and worked hard. Instead of stepping herself up, she decided to sabotage me by telling our higherups that I am a slacker. They obviously did not believe her, so when that did not work she turned some of my colleagues against me telling them I am making them look bad and making false rumors about me (e.g. that I was playing hooky when I was actually assigned to another department for a specific time by our supervisor upon his request so was out of their sight for a specified period of time). It was a horrible feeling being punished for something I was not even doing. My superiors continued to side with me because they saw the work. The bully got so pissed off she tried to get me fired. I retaliated by making an official complaint against her and that was all she needed to start telling people I have a temper and I am a trouble maker. In the end I completed the internship and I heard she got in trouble with the law (no surprise) but what bothered me was how the other girls who joined her never once apologized to me after I was proven right. They just pretended they never did anything and when I clearly wanted nothing to do with them, would act ""surprised"" and would tell people I am a difficult person.


-Another recent incident was with an ex. He was my first love and I was very loyal. I later learned he was a narcissit and that he ended up having multiple affairs during our time together? When I called him out and ended it, he got angry and told everyone that **I** was the one having the affairs and that I was crazy. I ignored it and the few people who initially believed him. When he noticed he wasn't getting a reaction, he had two girls that I had NEVER had issues with pick on me. It drove me crazy. The fact that they were not giving me time to heal (I was in love with him at one point and this was my first heartbreak) and the fact that they knew what really happened but preffered to still be on his side to bully me. Eventually I escaped and cut them ALL out of my life and the same fake cries would go about when people got suspicious of them ""Why is she acting this way? I never did anything!"" The sad thing? I heard these girls and literally everyone left my ex after the drama died. Disgusting.


I am not saying there are not good people. I have been lucky to find them and I hold them CLOSE but I am scared my handle on them is slipping with how badly damaged I have become. I struggle to trust new people because I am a favorite target for bullies. Is it because I mind my own business, work hard, and have some talent? Or because I am actually a doormat in their eyes for whatever reason? Or is it because I am the child of narc parents so I must naturally have a big fat label on my head? I don't know but what I do know is no contact with the outside world reduces my chances of dealing with bullies. Now anytime someone even *radiates* a familiar, toxic behavior I don't wait to cut them out. I am not having it. I used to be a normal healthy person and now I have become depressed, anxious, and suicidal. I cannot imagine what the next encounter might do to me. "
I’m dating my crush,"Growing up I’ve never really had luck with crushes. I was bullied all throughout elementary school and in middle school while I still had my fair share of stupid, short-lived crushes. High school came around and this boy immediately caught my attention. He made me feel giddy and dumb in a good way. Every time he walked into the room my heart would race. Every single interaction we had stayed with me and I would think about it all the time. He was perfect. From his smile, his jokes, the way his eyes looked like honey when the sun hit them, and the way he played his saxophone. He was like a dream.

At first I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know why I was so interested for some reason. He just caught my attention out of the blue for no reason. It was like magic. Talking to him made me feel so happy. I over-evaluated every single word I texted him because I was scared of him thinking I was weird. I sucked at flirting so I sent him weird memes and constantly joked around. I probably sounded dumb to him, which is fine. I gushed about him all the time to friends. I literally talked about how cute and funny he was 24/7.  It must have been annoying for them.

I was planning on just talking to him for a bit but never admitting my interest because I thought I never had the chance. I had thought it was only going to be another stupid crush that wasn’t worth spending time thinking about. My friend ruined it for me because he had told him without my consent. I was torn and angry at my friend when I found out. I thought my crush would never, ever talk to me again, but for some reason he still did. Yet, even after that obvious clue of his slight interest in me, I was still under the impression that I had no chance with him.

I tried to get over him by forming new friendships and trying to stay nonchalant about my potent feelings that were basically eating away at me. I was so ready to let go because I thought he never even looked my direction. That is until his best friend reached out to me one day and basically gave both of us a push to go on a date with each other.

I’m now in a relationship with that boy who stole my attention and never let go of it. I love him so much and I wish I could express that more so he can truly feel it. Sometimes I still can’t believe I’m dating my crush and I’m thankful for the people who helped me and looked past my stupid logic. "
I miss first dates and new relationships,"I really miss the excitement and anticipation of dating. It can be really difficult and heartbreaking but also thrilling and exciting. I miss the nervous butterflies and surprising discoveries. I miss being introduced to new ideas or passions and introducing them to mine. I miss discovering a new body and figuring out how to make it feel amazing. I miss the anticipation of meeting for the first time, doing something new for the first time, of kissing for the first time, or sex for the first time. 

I love really feeling comfortable in a long term relationship and having someone around who really knows me and accepts me and loves me, but still miss the adventure of casual dating."
All or Nothing,"I’m that person at school who tries. The person sitting on the hallways really finishing everything. I figured I really need to since I’m graduating soon and I’m desperate for a scholarship. But as the semester progresses, the more I don’t wanna do this anymore. On the outside, I appear to motivated because of my busyness but right now I’m at the brink of giving up. So what if I get to college? So what if I get the job I want? It’s all a cycle. I’ll never get satisfied.  I’ll always strive for the greater expecting to be satisfied by some reward but I never am. Cause I know there will always be a better accomplishment, a bigger goal. I just want the world or nothing at all. 

On top of that, I can’t control my eating. I went from eating 600 calories 3 months ago to eating about 3000 calories everyday, and starving myself in between. Which is a lot for a 5 foot woman. But the fact that it’s all my doing makes it worse. If I can control it, why can’t I just stop it? And the fact that eating is the only thing I’m looking forward to now makes this harder since I don’t wanna gain weight, and binging makes me physically and emotionally horrible. man."
I just don’t understand,"Just as a heads up this is going to be a rant

You know I just don’t understand things. I had to practically beg you 4 times for you to just try and talk to me. I know understand that you were with friends but you know a little message that would take no more than a few seconds letting me know you were with friends would of been great. You know I have anxiety and depression and are a bit of an over thinker and a bit of a worrier. So of course my mind just started racing and I was thinking things like “oh you don’t want to talk to me even though we haven’t talked in 2 weeks” I did get a bit down and that in turn made me not able to sleep well later that night. I always say good morning to you and that I hope you have a great day, I always try to find some memes that I believe you will enjoy and laugh/smile when you see them, I always text you throughout the day saying “hope work is going well”, “ hope you are enjoying your day” and so on but you can’t even bother to message me back when you are done with work or give me a quick phone call to say hi and see how I’m doing. ( for those that read this it’s not that I’m being overbearing towards her as she genuinely liked when I message her throughout the day because I’m the only person amongst her friends that bother to do that and she had said that she really appreciates it) I know you look at my messages that I send you because I guess you feel guilty? or something that I ask if we could talk and then the next day you call me up and we “catch up” and when we do it’s usually for less then 20 minutes. In the past 2 weeks you decide to talk to me for 20 minutes in total and I think that’s really messed up but you know I’m happy in those 20 minutes and I’ll take what I can get I guess. I get upset and disappointed at you when you can’t even bother to talk to me for a week to two weeks at a time and then when you do talk to me for this’s 20 minutes I’m happy and no longer upset until the cycle restarts and I hate myself for that. I know we have discussed this many times before and you always say you are sorry and you “suck and communicating” and you have gotten slightly and when I say slightly I mean slightly better at getting back to me but honestly it’s just not good enough. We have been friends for 10 years and I’ve always put up with this because I love and care about you deeply but you need to work on this “lack of communication”. I know you can and I know most days even if you are hanging out with your friends you are still on your phone, I’ve seen you do this in person even though you have said “when I’m hanging out with people I’m never near my phone” which is not true in the slightest. So when I send you a message you could at least reply to me saying something like “hey I’m hanging out with friends I’ll talk to you later” which I would understand but again you just barely communicate with me at all. I’m always the one to start a conversation with you and you rarely rarely do it with me and even when you do the way you text it seems like you are just not there at all. When you do start a conversation with me it usually starts like this “hey. How are you?” I don’t know if it’s just me but that seems very bland like you can use my name use an apostrophe or something. When you text me like this it feels like you see it as an obligation rather than you actually wanting to talk to me which feels like a lot. I’m just disappointed with you and myself."
"We’re out of synch, and I don’t know what to do","You’ve been my best friend for so long, and now we’re together and in love. We see eye to eye on mostly everything and do everything together. We even shower together (nonsexually) most of the time. 

But now, we’re out of synch. We fight about mundane issues nearly everyday. And now I refuse to back down when I think you’re wrong- which is different from how I used to be with you years ago. And I’m worried that’s making us squabble more, and that it means there will be trouble later on. 

I know i snowball things like this. I know that. But this is new, and this is my first relationship where I could see myself with the other person forever. Forgive me for worrying."
It’s been over a year and a half,"But I’m starting a new job today. Finally. I’m so glad to be getting this opportunity outside of my usual field. I get to help kids and I’m so happy about that. The last two years have been really hard, but today I feel that maybe my life is actually about to begin. A day job I like and hopes for the future. It’s been a while."
expressing my true self.,"I don't care about your opinion unless it's about something that involves me doing something that affects you. 

I dont want to say Hi to you. I just want to do me and it makes me happy and at peace. (Nothing wrong with you. Nothing against you. I just don't want to.)

I don't want to converse 98% of the time.

I don't care about what you did on your weekend.

If your not talking about how to improve quality of life. I don't want to talk.

If I'm quite, Im not mad or angry, I'm just being.

When you tell me how to live my life. It pushes me away.

When I accept your invite to go somewhere id rather stay home and do what makes me happy. So fuck it. Im doing that from now on.

If i don't answer your text its because Im in my own zone and I'll reply when i feel like it. I don't have anything against you.

If i give you a one word answer via text or in person, I'm not upset or anything bad. It's just that, that one word summarizes how i feel or the answer perfectly.

If you don't accept me for me. I honestly don't care but i do care about being all alone so i don't show that i don't care because as much as solitude comforts me Ive never had no friends before and i guess I'm just too comfortable to try out the latter. Maybe I should. 

I just want people to understand that when I'm being my true self. Im not upset or have anything against anything. Im just being me. 

Sooner or later I'm gonna come out as myself every second of everyday and for once I'll be truly happy and at peace. I cant wait.

Some recent life thoughts,"I’m currently a sophomore in college and I absolutely love what I’m studying (premed and an exercise science major) but have been stressing a lot about the future lately. I often feel pressured by myself to rush and find what I want to do in the future now, so that I can start being prepared. There are days I can only see myself as a physician, and others where I want to explore other interests in the healthcare field. I know I will find my path one day and for now I’m doing all that I can.

Above all, as cheesy as this will sound, I just want to make sure that I always prioritize my happiness and truly listen to my heart telling me if I want to do something or not. We spend so much time planning for the future (I know I do 24/7) but forget to enjoy where we are now and how far we’ve come to get here. Everyone wants to find love, be happy, and pursue their dream career, so why do we get so lost trying to do these things?"
Mom kicked me out of the house :),So my mom just dropped me off at a party city and I’m sitting on the side of the road with no clue what to do :) I’m a 20 y/o female and idk where to go. She has anger problems and is bipolar and I seriously don’t know what my life has come to. I need advice 
Fox News Sheeple are just as bad as CNN sheeple,All I wanted to say. Unpopular I know. 
I still love you and it’s killing me,"My ex broke up with me in December and we’ve still been in contact. I’m mostly the one messaging him, asking him about his day and how he’s doing. I do feel like an idiot, but I still love him. My heart is just broken and I don’t know how to heal. 
My parents didn’t approve of him, so they are quite happy that we are not together.
My friends tell me not to message him or have contact with him.
I just feel so lonely, I tried to hang out with friends but I can’t tell them how I feel and I’m keeping this all bottled up and often crying some days. 
I just wanted to get this off my chest. "
Jolene! Please don’t take my man,"Every guy I bring home look at her like she is an angel. They are so enchanted by her beauty and charm. I know she is way prettier than me, way better person than me.But how can I stop being intimidated by her beauty? How can I keep my guy as my guy? They say beauty fades but her character remains and any guy would die for her. But what about me? I do so much for those guys. I cook for them, buy gifts for them and take care of them. I try to connect with them and yet they won’t stay. I sing “Jolene! Please don’t take my man” at the top of my lungs in shower. I tried to be like her, copy her style, copy her habits but nothing can be compared to her. Is this a test by god? If so, how many times should I keep taking it? I want to give up but these feelings, urges and hormones won’t let me. Is there someone who will look at me like they look at her? I have everything money, beauty, character but nothing can be compared to her. Why? :("
My career will not be the same,"A couple of years ago i was a law student but i only did 4 semesters because i never liked the career, i wanted to study language from the begining but i had relatives who told me that I'm going to be a low-life if i decide to be a teacher, when i just graduated from school i had manu doubts about all what they told me, in the end i ended up choosing law that's what they wanted, during every single day in law it was pretty bad, some students had contacts in the university and they don't worry about learn and earn the grade for themselves, the professors who were high officials in the courthouse were not motivated to teach and came bitter to class, there was no one i could trust when i was in that career and the few people who i thought they understand me and were my friends turned out to be backstabbers, i was alone for a long time mostly thinking ""what i'm doing in this career losing my time and my parents money"" when i talk to them, they said that when i finish law i could study language but that would be almost 5 years that keep me away from what i wanted to study. I tried to finish that career but the atmosphere was so uncomfortable in class, when there was work in groups i had problems since i always end up alone i have no problems with that but there were people who made fun of me because of that and not only for that because of ideologies too and when i argued with them too they always talked about me after i open my mouth for anything and then one night after finish class at 11 p.m a group of 5 dudes from my classroom beat me, i tried to defend myself but i couldn't do much and there were no prople around who could do something when they finish and left me i don't get up sad but disappointed because they are student of law, they are the people who will defend our rights in the future however lacks values as necessary as respect, I come to my house hurt like never i told my parent about what happen but they insisted that i should stay in law, the next day i told to the director of the faculty about what happened and you what he told me ? ""You are already in a university, you are no longer a small child who can come to an adult expecting solutions, face things like an adult"" after that he told me to get out of his office, what the fuck ? Is the university this unfair ? I had to ignore everything what happened i got mo options

All this happened when i was in 2nd semester of law, time passed and i got a job at a barn i do not ear much but it keeps my mind occupied and one day i decided to visit my grandma i didn't see her since i started university and i told her everything, she told me in tears ""if your parents are not going to support you, i will, do it, cancel the semester and do whatever it takes to get out of there, i will pay the enrollment for language"" i hug her and thank her so much, after a lot of paperwork i could get of there, i do not told anyone, they don't have to know, i just dissappear from the map.

Now i'm finally in language and i can pay my university thanks to my grandma and the money i earn in the barn, finally after 2, years i have peace and somehow i'm happy with what i'm studyng, most of people in class are cool and i meet a dedicated workgroup and from the begining of the begining of this career i met a girl her name is Sam, it turns out that the group of people with who she joined they did not work at all and they left all the work to her then after presenting the work Sam told me that she hears her partners talking bs about them to other clasmates for no reason at all, then she left that group of people and from then on Sam did not have anyone else to trust than me and since that she has become one of my closest friend friends, time passed and she told me that she is not in language because she likes the career but because her parents don't support her to study what she really wants, Art, ""if it wasn't for you i would be alone in this career that i don't like, thank you"" told me one day while we had lunch, the first semester went pretty good, now we are going for the second semester and a while ago she received a good news, her parent accept her request to study art and she is happy because will be able to study what she wants, she told me if i could help her to do the procces to can cel the career and at the same time she not sure to do it ""Don't be like me and waste your time career that you do not like, you have my support"" i said, i'm happy because i'm studyng what i want and i meet awesome people but at the same time i got a similar feeling of loneliness when i was in law knowing that my best bud is not gonna be there, I'm going to miss her."
I found out my mother is not who I thought she was...,"My mom pulled me aside on Christmas day to tell me some very interesting news.

\- Preface: My mom told me when I was younger that I was a ""test-tube baby"" or an ""IVF"" baby, to which I understood and accepted.  She also told me that I had 3 brothers who had a different father, so they were half-brothers.  I was okay with that.  They did IVF because my mother was 44 when they did this and was 45 when I was born.  People always commented on how lucky I was to not have any mental issues due to her age.  I did consider myself to be very lucky..

\- So now, when she tells me this is true...but with one twist I get a little nervous.  Turns out, they had used donor eggs and my fathers...erm...baby batter.  So, biologically, my father was my real father, but my ""mother"" was essentially a surrogate; she carried me, but we share no DNA.  -  I was...blown way by this, not mad, just in shock.  I told my mom I needed to think about this and would let her know how I felt once I had time to take it all in.  AGAIN, she told me this on CHRISTMAS DAY.   After a day or two I had finally put together my feelings, which were these: 1-I'm glad you told me...this is, medically, quite significant; 2-I'm not mad, at all; 3-You are still my mom...and that will never change; 4-I don't know what I'm going to do with this information.  She asked me if I was going to tell my half-...now, not brothers.  I told her not right away, if ever.  It's not really relevant or any of their business, since my now half-unknown DNA history would have no impact on them.  

\- What's hardest for me about all of this is that my family is already very small...and now, biologically, it's been halved.  On my dad's side there's my 2 aunts and 1 uncle, my niece and nephew and a couple great-cousins/aunts twice removed.  On my ""mom's"" side there were only a couple distant relatives.  I have told 2 people about this...and I have no idea if I plan on telling anyone else (who knows me)...but I had to get it off my chest. "
My con of a father-in-law is dead,"My father-in-law died on Friday.
He was a horrible person.
He walked out on his kids forever ago. Only got in touch with my wife again when he wanted someone to help take care of him for free.
But he turned out to be a nightmare. He ignored his grandson because he wanted to teach his granddaughter to be a performer, in the hopes of making money off her stardom. When my wife wanted to live her own life, he tried to get her fired. 
He impersonated a friend of mine to trick my parents into giving up my information (beware your Facebook privacy settings). He tried to team up with my wife's  deadbeat baby-daddy to fight for custody - just to harass us. He sent vague threats of violence.
He sued her right before our wedding. He's the reason we couldn't even tell people when we were going to get married because we were afraid he would show up to ruin it.
He's conned his way through life. My wife is but one of his many victims of grift or emotional abuse.
Now we have to do the whole inheritance mess. Not looking forward to going through his junk and the earnings of his sketchy deals and swindles through the years. He attracted a few other greedy people around him.
You imagine when a bad person is gone that would allow you to feel free. I do slightly, but I know that it is still incredibly difficult for my wife and for my kids - we can't exactly explain to them how their relationship with him was built on his greed.
The only silver lining in this is that it was his lies that convinced my wife to move completely across the country, which led to her and I meeting in the first place.
So thanks, asshole. Bye.

I got yelled at by a doctor because I was scatterbrained,"Today was my first day (for a long time) as a substitute nurse at the gastroenterological ward, where I have seldom been working during my RN studies and during my summer holidays.  Last time when I was working there was a week in January and few weeks at October.

&#x200B;

In the morning when I was preparing for my morning shift at the locker rooms, I was nervous if I still remembered all the routines and other essential information regarding the patients with GI problems. About 2/1 of my shift went really well, as I felt that I was a great help to patients and co-workers. I did my job as best as I could and encountered people with a smile on my face, even that I had to ask guidance with several tasks. I like my job, I like to meet new people and I've got really good and positive feedback from all my clinical training periods. At this point I have a little bit of schoolwork left, before I graduate.

&#x200B;

As my day goes on, the doctor orders an urine sample from a certain diabetic patient with renal malfunction. She was a sweet old lady, not too old and was as smart as anyone. I did all the things that I had to do: educated her about the urine sample, emptied her catheter bag, disconnected the bag from catheter, put a plug in catheter and told the lady that after four hours a sample can be collected for lab testing. Then I was worried about if the plug will stay on the right place, so I went to get tape to secure it.

&#x200B;

As I journey towards the supply room, another patient calls for me and I do few favors for him. After helping him, I get the tape and go to see old lady and secure the plug. When I'm done, I'll go to nurses office and do some paperwork related to this old lady, before I forget what I need to do, and evening shift gets to read their written reports. Suddenly the doctor walks in our office, where I and several others fill papers.

&#x200B;

Doctor: *WHO IS THE NURSE FOR ROOM SEVEN, BED TWO??!*  ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽

Me: *Yes, I am. Can I help you?* (•ᴗ• )

Doctor: *HAS THE PATIENT SECRETED ONLY 400ML URINE TODAY?!!*  ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽

Me: *No I just emptied 1200ml off her bag as I--.*  (•ᴗ•')

Doctor: *NOO, YOU NEED ALWAYS PUT THE URINE QUANTITIES ON HER FLUIDS LIST\* RIGHT AWAY!!! WHY DO PEOPLE NEVER REMEMBER TO DO IT HERE, SHE IS DIABETIC, HAD KETOACIDOSIS AND RENAL PROBLEMS THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!! THIS COULD BE A MATTER OF A LIFE AND DEATH!!*   ヽ༼ ಠ益ಠ ༽  ﾉ

&#x200B;

All other nurses are silent as I smile and firmly agree to doctor who is screaming at me for few minutes with his german accent. At this point **it was 20 minutes ago when I emptied the bag**. I thought I do not need to be so minute and I admit that my order of working was not as it should have been. The doctor could have asked the old lady, if the bag attached to her was emptied. Still, you don't need to yell at me. Still, you other nurses should have supported me, even after the doctor left. If a patient ever misbehaves or screams at me, I can kind of understand it: that's how some people react to personal health crisis. It is not easy to be sick. But you should act professional and compassionate, always and for everyone. This was a sucker way to start my substitute period.

&#x200B;

*\*If a patient needs an goal or restriction for intake of fluids, this is the list that is used. The same list will keep the track of urine quantity.*

I'm Suffering I'm loneliness,"Why can't I have someone I can chat to. My ""friends"" don't chat they are to busy. I don't and never had a girlfriend. I don't talk to my family much. It would be nice to have at least one person who loves anime and learning and reading and that kinda stuff. 

I've suffered in silence for so years. This is killing me, I feel like I don't belong to this world. And I'm having fantasies of suicide again :( 

I try be myself and I try to be nice but. I always end up with 0 connections made with people. I feel like such a loser. "
I gave up on dating and trying to find love and have never been happier.,"I'm in my early thirties (male) and have always felt pressure to date and eventually try to find someone to start a family with. If you asked me why I wanted these things I couldn't really explain, it just felt like I should want to do them. Even though trying to date has always brought me nothing but stress, I always felt like I'd be some kind of weirdo for not trying to do it, because that's what everyone does. I would have nights where I'd be up late just staring at the ceiling thinking about how I was going to die alone and how terrifying it would be. How I'd never have kids, never have anyone to carry on my legacy etc.

Finally, I just decided it was enough. I deleted my Tinder, my Bumble, OKCupid etc. I just decided to focus only on my career, my hobbies, having fun and trying to enjoy time with myself. And man it has been a great decision so far. It's been about a year since this happened, and I can't ever remember a more productive year in my life.

I traveled, got a new higher paying job, made some new friends and picked up some new hobbies that I love. I'm not closing the door entirely on maybe trying to dip my toes into dating at some point, but as of right now, I can't ever see wanting to do it again. I feel like I'm at my happiest when I'm just by myself doing what I feel like doing, and I only ever even tried to find someone because that's what everyone tells me I should do. I may die alone...and that's fine with me."
"changed majors as a junior, in 18 hours, hard work paying off!!!!","this semester has been absolutely crazy. i changed majors from math to history last winter, and enrolled in 18 hours for this semester. I got the flu in February, and then my grandma died in early March. 

i had to miss a lot of class for being contagious, and then for taking care of the funeral and my family. having really great and understanding professors has helped me succeed, but I've also worked my ass off to make up for class missed.

i just got back my hardest midterm that i actually had to take the day after my grandma's funeral, and found out that I actually got a 103% on it. (thank you extra credit!!!!)

in my head i'm still overwhelmed with all of the things i still have to do with week as i just came back from spring break. but WOW. hard work and loving your major pays off.

really just wanted to extend my happiness somewhere. i really struggled for the past 2 years in college in school and with my mental health and it's so nice and relieving to see good things happening. i hope you all are having a good monday!!!"
I need a miracle to attend college,"I don't know what else to do.

I feel like I messed up this college application, but I don't even know. I did EVERYTHING right!

1510 in SAT with 99 percentile. 4.0 GPA Superb extracurriculars. Good essays. What else? Life. I even helped people with some of their applications and thgose people are in college, having a good life. Why is my case different?

I got into 7 universities. SEVEN. And I still can't afford anyone of them.  I am so lost because if I can't raise the funds, I will have to turn them down. I just want to be an animator. I just want to go to Drexel and study animation. I just need one miracle to help me with the 26K. But I am lost.

Please is there anyone who can help me? May 1 is getting closer. I swear, I'm not lying and can provide evidence to show that my test results and admission offers are real. I am desperate."
I honestly hate going to school.,"It's not because I'm bad at it, in fact I'm pretty good. It's not about the teachers or any subjects. It's about my ""friends"", classmates and other people like that. These issues have been bothering me for almost the last three years now and I've got no one to talk about them in person, so i will do it here.

I feel like i have no real friends.. Only fake ones.. 
I don't think of myself as a shitty person, so i don't understand why this is happening to me. I don't believe that I've ever done anything bad to the people.
Yet they all act like total assholes against me...

If it isn't someone calling me names or things like *autistic* or *gay* (either of which I'm not, and even if I were, the hell would it affect your life?), then it is pushing and other forms of violence (no hitting), or someone spraying shitty perfumes or aerosol deodorants at me, which then makes me smell like shit for the rest of the day, and if sprayed on to my hair, almost up to a week. If that doesn't satisfy those shitholes, they think they have the right to try and pull my phone out of my hand or pull the chair underneath me whilst I'm 

For instance, today i got called gay multiple times, i got pushed around, also i got made fun of, etc etc..

It really makes me feel like shit.

What helps me cope, is the fact that only 10 weeks left, and I'll never have to see 90% of my class again, because they are almost all going to a different schools than me."
Did i commit assault?,"About 10 years ago, I was about 20 years old and living at my parents. 
A neighbor called me and asked if I would sleep over. She was being very flirty. I did.
We watched a movie in bed and sort of spooned and we're being awkward and touching. Later in a sleepy state, we started making out and touching each other's private areas. I moved to have sex and deliberately asked, "" is this ok?"" She said ""yeah""

Not an enthusiastic delivery of consent. But consent. Being the young man I was, it lasted only a few minutes. I withdrew and probably fell asleep. Th next morning I tried kissing her and she deflected. I even asked if what we did was ok. She said ""it's what happens when 2 people are in a bed together."" I genuinely liked her. She ignored me completely from then on and it was always awkward to pass her and wave, etc. I think perhaps she was disappointed in my performance and didn't want to give me another chance. I am probably over thinking it

I know she verbally gave consent, but with metoo and everything, it feels like it wasn't a perfect evening. We're both married and moved on and happy.
I feel guilty even though she consented."
I Hate Being Back In America,"I just relocated from China to Chicago recently for a new job, and I just have to say this city makes it impossible for me to forget that I’m black. I didn’t realize how fortunate I was to be considered an “expat” while overseas. 

Living overseas I was never followed around a store, never avoided on a sidewalk, never patronized. It was almost like I was “normal”. Now I find it hard to even walk around the loop past dusk without feeling like a criminal. It just forces me further and further inside my head until I just stop trying. What’s the fucking point of putting on a friendly face when the expectation for people that look like me starts at -5 while everyone else starts at 0? Why can’t I just start building from 0 like everyone else? Why is your opinion of me weighed down by decades of sensationalized news stories and pop culture? Why do I have to “sound” articulate in order to be taken seriously? Why the fuck should I have to code-switch to make you comfortable? Why is everything about me so fundamentally wrong to these hoity toity types?

This country sucks"
I feel like I am always going to be this broken.,"I have been struggling with the fear of mortality ( Existential Crises ) for the past week. I get no sleep because the second me and my boyfriend are laid down and the room goes silent, my mind starts racing. It got so bad last night that I threw up. I don't know of I puked from something else but the anxiety is the only thing I can put together. 2 weeks ago I had that nasty flu that's been going around and I think thats what triggered my crises because I legit thought I was going to be one of those flu deaths. It was like my life flashed before my eyes and I can never go back to the normal way I lived my life. I am so jealous of anyone who is able to block out the thoughts of the inevitable. I am so so jealous. I wish my mind would stop thinking sometimes and that all this anxiety would go away. Every night since this has happened I have been waking up 3-4 times a night. I feel like I am getting no rest ( I have even been taking melatonin which I don't normally use but I've just been so restless I'm desperate for a full night of sleep ). I feel like no therapist or medication would really help me and Im open to the idea of going but I feel like they will just tell me I'm crazy or something and not to think about it. Idk what could a person like me even do. I just want to be able to have one full day without a panic attack or racing thoughts that make me feel like I'm just drowning.
I have a wonderful loving boyfriend who wants to help me so badly, he has been doing any small thing he can for me to try and ease my stress but I'd say it only works 30% of the time. 
Im so scared I'm adding so much more stress to his life that he doesn't need.. He says I don't but I am always crying now and having issues.
I just want to live my life 😭😭

Edit: I also want to add that when I started dealing with this crises I did a ton of research, which maybe wasn't the best idea for me.
I have been trying to work on having constant distractions, but the second everything gets quiet and I'm left with my thoughts, it all starts again.."
I have a low-key crush on someone I've never met personally.,"I've been playing an online game for about a year and a half now. A few months ago  I met someone to play with through reddit. We started playing and he introduced me to his other friends online. Among them is this guy whose voice sounds really nice and gives me butterflies in my stomach when I hear him on voice chat. He introduced me to a band I ended up loving to listen to, and I kind of get the sense that he's a nice person. Sometimes it's the highlight of the week when I hear him say my in-game name. I kind of feel bad though because sometimes I'm not so good at the game we both play and I get shy that I can't get the nerve to ask him if he wants to play with me. Now it's a mini goal for me to advance my level in the game so I can play more with him (possibly). It's not like I'm head over heels for him or something, nor am I certain that I'm ever going to meet him in person. Just having a low key crush though is really nice, and I found out that we most probably go to the same uni too. I kind of missed the feeling of having butterflies in my stomach."
Losing faith in humanity,"I really feel like nothing is going to change the world.  Terrible things continue to happen like clockwork and nothing really changes.  The same things keep happening over and over again. 
I feel so helpless, so powerless. I know that no matter how much effort I put in there is nothing I can do that will be significant enough to incite change. "
I don't have a problem with the redesign.,"Well, I know I am sort of a newbie in Reddit but tbh it is kinda tiring seeing people hating redesign so much when it's just fine.That is of course my opinion,feel free to disagree but I think redesign just made site look a lot more slicker (?). I hope I don't get too much hate for this"
My dad died two years ago today.,"I think people around me and online are tired of hearing about it. I can’t put this on Facebook where my family will read it. I don’t know where else to put this but I just need to get it out. 

My dad died two years ago today. He died from lung cancer and he was diagnosed the first week of January. He was reduced to *nothing* in just two and a half months. He went from my dad who did everything for me when I was in trouble, my dad who was one of the best in the world at Xbox NASCAR online, my dad who was the best stage hand in this whole town, my dad who always showed his back stage passes, guitar picks, and setlists to my friends when they came over and let them pick something out to keep, my dad who was kind, patient, and emotionally intelligent, to my dad who was dying in a hospital bed in the living room. Who couldn’t stand up. Who wasn’t lucid most of the time. Who I could see suffering and withering away.

I did have a “final talk” with him while he was still in his right mind, speaking in whispers to each other in a dark room. He apologized to me for being a bad father and that broke my heart. I didn’t let him die thinking he was even for a second, EVER a bad father to me. I also tried to joke with him, asking him to please not haunt me when he was gone. He told me that if he did do that, to just tell him to fuck off. We laughed. And that was our last conversation before his mind slipped away not long after.

The night before he died, I had just done 10h days three days in a row at work at my new job who were more than accommodating about my situation. I got really lucky there. My boyfriend had issues with his job but he finally got to spend some time with me and my father. My dad was asleep of course, the meds sedated him so he wouldn’t be in pain. It was too heavy to just sit quietly on the couch by his hospital bed so we decided to try to get our mind off things by going to a restaurant together for St. Patrick’s Day. 

A few hours later in the middle of the night I woke up to The Call from my mom and just felt emptiness. I couldn’t even cry because I spent so much time being completely inconsolable about it all. I remembered back to when I visited him in the ER the first time, I sat next to his bed and he was in good spirits and still able to show emotion and was all smiles. The last thing I heard before that is that they thought maybe he had TB. He had to break the news that it was stage 4 incurable lung cancer, and before I got upset, to know that he was *totally zen* about it, that he’s accepted it, and he’ll give me time but I need to be zen about it too. He always used the word *zen* to describe his feelings about this. So when I got The Call, I felt empty, and I felt zen. 

Watching him die is one thing in my life that has given me PTSD. Nothing is more horrifying than seeing the strongest person in your life be nothing but skin and bones, helpless, slipping in and out of lucidity. I don’t even know why the anniversary is a big deal. It’s just a day, but it’s just a reminder that it’s already been two years, 730 days, so many hours and moments lost, and that number will keep growing. The number of days I’ve been without him will just keep going up and up and up forever. 

This weekend I went to one of my very good friends weddings. It was beautiful, she looked gorgeous, everyone was so happy. I was on Cloud 9 myself until the father daughter dance. 

The father daughter dance is the most painful fucking thing I’ve had to experience THREE TIMES since he died. I didn’t even dream of my dance with him when I got married. It was never something I thought of. It just hurts to see that and know that I won’t ever have that chance and no one will replace him for it. I don’t even want a wedding because that’s the expectation you know, and then it’ll be so noticeable and so uncomfortable when people realize we skipped it. 

My boyfriend was able to ask for my hand before he died. This wasn’t an official engagement by any means, and never something he normally would have done because we think it’s such an outdated practice, but we wanted my dad to be apart of something somehow. 

I should have taken today off. I had the PTO but it was an internal struggle for me to think if I wanted to sit through work and try to focus on what I need to do, or if I wanted to be at home, sad, in the dark with my dog while my bf went to work. I lost friends because this event changed my personality so dramatically, I couldn’t take care of myself let alone let people use me as an emotional punching bag like I’d let them before. I wasn’t allowed to say “I can’t mentally handle this right now, sorry” when someone vented to me but everyone else was allowed to do that to me. This anniversary also just reminds me of the bitter loss of friendship and support I lost. 

I have to just get this out there. It’s eating me from the inside out and I have to just release this. I want relief from all of these thoughts that I probably sloppily and incoherently wrote (sorry, I have adhd and I’m just kinda sad right now) so thanks for taking the time to read this. Thanks for reading my super depressing mile long post in this moment over the millions of other posts on Reddit or doing something else productive in your life.

If you have a *good* relationship with your dad and he’s still around, give him a call or a text or a visit. Tell him you love him. (please obviously don’t if your father was abusive or something like that, take care of yourself 🖤)"
I am eating better.,"So i already said this here sometimes but i'm gonna say again. I am underweight and can't eat anything properly. I mean, i do eat some vegetables and healthy stuff but just a little bit, i can't eat too much stuff.

This is changing. Before, I couldn't stand eating beans. Here, we eat rice, beans, meat & vegetables almost every day, however, i never ate beans, just the sauce. Now, i am eating beans and also eating more in quantity. I repeat my meal, i am eating the whole lunch at school (i never did) and these days i ate a chesseburger. I was never able to eat a burger before (i know cheeseburgers are not healthy but yeah).

This is for people with the same problem as me:
I know you might feel like you're going to throw up, but hear me out. The food is not going to kill you, actually, the lack of food is what is going to kill you. Don't think you're not going to like it amd throw up. If you think about it, it will happen. I am saying this as someone that has the same problem. Don't think about it, don't take too long to put the food in your mouth, just go. 
Try to eat faster! But calm down, don't shove the fork into your soul, just don't get distracted while eating. The longer you take to eat, the less you will eat.

I'm hoping to get better soon. Hopefuly, i'll have a normal weight and finally stop being so short and grow up."
Never feeling good enough,My bad is an avid porn watcher and for the most part I don’t mind but as of late I feel like he’s looking for things that I don’t have. He likes the girls with big boobs and it kinda hurts because I’m self conscious about mine even though they’re not that small.  It still bugs me and I don’t know what to do about it.  
Off my chest to help me sleep?? ‘Trigger warning’,"Idek if this is the right place to write this but I can’t sleep and by the time I fall asleep it’ll be 3 or less hours until I have to wake up for work.  I can’t sleep bc I’m having a self sabotaging depression episode.  I ran out of antidepressants again bc the stupid packets only last a month so nearly every month I realise I ran out, but it’s too late.  And bc the antidepressants have made me so so SO lazy I spend a week off of them before getting more, which is probably why I’m so depressed I can’t sleep.  

My antidepressants change who I am, I’m more lazy, sometimes more depressed, my self harming is back.  And I just feel flat all the time.  The only thing they’ve done is stop me having panic attacks and hyperventilating until I pass out every few weeks.  I am so thankful they’ve helped work anxiety, but is it worth me feeling more depressed.

Maybe I only feel more depressed though, bc before anxiety was a distraction and now that it’s reduced I only feel depression left.  Why can’t I have a normal brain.  I also think it’s mad me lazier because it was supposed to help with my “obsessive tendencies”, but now I’m lazy...  so maybe I needed my obsessive tendencies to help me stay on top of things and be more organised.

All in all I can’t sleep bc I’m spiraling once again and the only person I have to blame is myself bc I stopped taking my antidepressants when you’re not supposed to...

Okay well idk if this helped but now I typed it out hopefully I stop thinking about it and I can fall asleep.  Goodnight everyone I hope you are well! "
"The ""friend"" who only talks to me when she wants to talk, and doesnt care about what I say.","I'm sure many of us have had this type of friend, the one who you dont hear from for awhile, and they only talk to you when they have really good news (and are gloating) or bad news (and want to vent).

I'm normally fine with these. I can be there to vent to if a friend needs it, and I'm also happy to hear about my friends good fortune as well. But it's a 2 way street. 

I've known this girl for a few years. I helped her leave a rough, abusive relationship, her recovery, and wat h as she started a new one with a better guy. I was around during her dark time where all she had to talk about was how hard of a time she was having. But it's been years and she has a new guy. I'm not claiming she has recovered, but ALL she ever messages me about is her fights with the new guy, her bad days, etc, or really good stuff that happens to her. Thing is, she doesnt care AT ALL about what I say. Conversations will start with ""hows it going?"" And it doesnt matter what i say, she replies with how awesome/bad her day is. 

Today was a tipping point for me. I work with a lot of addicts going through rehab programs, and my day today started with one patient attacking me because i wouldn't give him smokes, another starting a fire in the buildings only elevator, and the fire department basically destroying said elevator to get the guy out. This was all in my first 2 hours of the day. 

I set out to take a break and I get a text from said friend. ""Hey, hows it going?""

I respond with ""terrible"" and tell her about my day, expecting some kind of sympathy or at least someone yo vent too.

Her response: ""Wow that sounds crazy. Hey, check out the Shiny Machop I got in Pokemon Go.""

Fucking seriously? I couldnt care less about a mobile game right now. I usually just stop responding when she does this, but I'm furious she has no regard for me. Instead of typing out an angry reply to her I am typing this here to kinda clear my head. I'm not really expecting anything, I should probably tell her how I feel or just not respond to her shit anymore. I should be more upset on my shit work morning, but I am tired of someone I call a friend, someone who I am there for and help, so blatantly not care about my well being in return. "
Jealousy,"Whenever I see couples kissing and enjoying each other's company, feel happy and at peace, I feel jealous. I feel jealous, because my boyfriend is so far away. I feel jealous, because I have to tiptoe around him. I feel jealous, because I'll never have what they do. Instead I'm left stuck in a situation that I've become so used to, leaving sounds even worse. I'm jealous, because they found love and I never will.

Whenever I see the healthy relationship between father and daughter I feel jealous. I feel jealous, because I could never talk to my dad like that. I feel jealous, because they feel safe in their own homes. I feel jealous, because the love they feel for their dad comes naturally. I feel jealous, because their dad loves them no matter what. I'm jealous, because my dad wishes I wasn't me.

I'm so sick and tired of being jealous of other people's happiness. I'm so sick and tired of thinking they deserve it and I don't. I'm so sick and tired of always wishing for something I'll never have.

I'm tired of feeling helpless and unhappy.

I'm so, so tired..."
My family are racist and homophobic.," 

Where to start? The years of homophobic jokes while I was trying to discover myself? The time when my mum tried to frame my boyfriend as a paedophile? The fact my brother just tried to excuse the terrorist attack in New Zealand? I guess I will start from the beginning.

I was born in a small town in the UK. The town is nice but most of the people are awful. My family are some of the awful people among them.

First of all I was bullied every day for 10 years in school, with no support from my family through any of it. I would be bullied all day, then return home and my eldest brother would bully me as well. He poured hot water over me when I was 6, and psychologically tormented me throughout most of my childhood. He broke the glass of a neighbour's greenhouse and put it all on me. There is a lot more, but I don't want to make a huge wall of text, so let's just say that he is a cretin and I never want to speak to him again. My parents split up when I was just 1 year of age, so my dad brought up my brothers and I all by himself. This has never bothered me because it was just reality for me, something that was always there. My eldest brother didn't take it well though, he was 4 when it happened.

When I was 13 and coming into puberty, I discovered that I am gay. I have never had a problem with it, and have always been very comfortable with it. My problem was the people around me at the time. My family. Homophobic remarks like ""Poof"", ""Arse bandits"", ""Fudge packers"", ""Queers"" and such were thrown around like it was just a big joke. The people I went to school with were homophobic and racist, some of them even tied a girl with Downs syndrome to a post and left her there. I found her, she told me who did it and I told the head master. The bullying got worse for me from then but I couldn't just let them get away with torturing a helpless girl with disabilities. Shocking.

&#x200B;

I had to endure all of that while keeping my sexuality secret from everyone, until I finally worked up the courage to come out. It just got worse from there. They didn't want me to leave the house, they didn't want to be seen with me at all, but all of this was because they apparently loved me and they ""wanted the best for me"".

Dad told me that he had lost friends because I came out, and asked why I had to come out at all because of the harassment he was getting. So much love right there. He couldn't stick up for me, he couldn't tell them it was my choice, he could only think about himself and how he looked to other people. I had been chased down the street, had stones thrown at me, nails thrown at me, and some men tried to throw me in the river and drown me. My Dad just stayed silent when I told him, until he finally said ""Well what can I do about it""... What the?

My eldest brother is now a councillor for the Conservative party. I won't say where because I love him enough not to ruin his life in the way they tried to ruin mine. He is a racist, closeted homophobe and I wash my hands of him. He calls black people all sorts of racist slurs. If his local party knew of that he would be thrown out of the Conservative party faster than I can eat dinner.

The middle brother was really the only one I could count on during my childhood, and now even he is neo-nazi who seriously tried to excuse the actions of the gunman in the Christchurch shooting. He basically said that they had it coming, as do all Muslim people. This was the final straw for me and the reason why I am offloading all of this today.

Now onto my mother. She fraternised with a far-right group and tried to frame my boyfriend as a paedophile. She tried to ruin my life just after I had taken it into my own hands. I only started talking to her properly when I was 14, and it lasted an amazing two years before she showed her true colours and joined the rest of my awful blood spawn.

Anyway I have been bottling this up for years and I just needed to get it off my chest. This has been very cathartic and I wish the best for anyone else who might be going through something similar. If any gay teens read this and it resonates with them, just know that you can take your life into your own hands and make it something special. I now live happily with my boyfriend, and have done for nine years. We have a dog and she is my world."
This community isnt as empathizing and comforting as i was told,"A friend told me that if i ever felt like i needed to rant and wanted reassurance all i needed to do was log into Reddit and post on the subreddit ""rant"" or ""offmychest"" or ""confessions"" so i did(not specifying which post so i dont expose myself, this is a throwaway). i was feeling like absolute trash about myself and was bawling my eyes out. i felt like all i needed was reassurance. But instead i got Criticized,called dramatic and sensitive. Please, if you ever see a post on reddit that literally asks you for reassurance, dont post any hate comments. These people are ranting here for a reason, and you hating on them will only make them want to stop posting on here which might've been their only way of expressing themselves as they might be shy in real life.

"Broken Home, Broken Life","Those of you with children will understand what I mean when I say that my son will always be my little boy. When I look at him, even though he’s 3” taller than me now, and almost 14 years old, I will always see his baby face and feel him in my arms. He’s my first born. And I have to say good bye.

Family has always been the most important thing to me. I grew up with a very moral family, but there was no closeness or personal care, love, or support. I longed for it my whole life. So after 3 kids, when my husband turned out to be abusive and violent and an alcoholic, nearly destroying me and everything I wanted to build, I had to let go of my dream and watch it shatter in divorce. Several years later, although I swore off men, I still longed to build a family. A safe place to be loved and accepted and supported, no matter what. A few ears later, A beautiful brave man came into my life who saw the potential we had, and lovingly stepped into our lives, becoming a wonderful father to my 3 kids. In hopes of salvaging this dream of family, we married and one year later had a baby of our own - making a total of 4. The dream looked like it might become a reality! Until problems started popping up last spring.

My son (12-13 yo at the time) was good as gold when you were watching. But the minute you turned your back, he did whatever he wanted. He was failing every class in school because he wouldn’t do his work, homework, or listen in class. He began “losing” things and said people were stealing from him. He got in a couple fights, and told us he was defending himself to bullies. (I’m not sure if this is true now). He stole little things from his teachers desks and their private cabinets - chips, pens, little things. He would roll on the floor during class for attention, spit on his desk and draw in it just to gross out his teachers, pester girls picking on them to get their boyfriends mad, on and on, call after call from his teachers. Then finally the big call came. My son had pretended to masturbate IN CLASS making a big scene to gross everyone out. He did it to the point one kid said he saw his penis come out of his pants. So the school had him arrested and filed charges of sexual exposure to a minor, federal offense. He was sent 7 hrs away to a rehab facility where he would live and get sex-rehab therapy for one full year. That all happened in Sept 2018, 3 weeks before my baby was born. It was heart-breaking to say goodbye. Please understand, he is a good kid! I know all moms say that, but everyone else (outside of school!) loves him. Church thought he was wonderful, and when he wants to be good (like if you’re watching him) he is so good! He was scared, and just a boy when I said goodbye to him. I’m only allowed to talk to him once a week for FIVE MINUTES. And once a month we have a therapy session on the phone for 45 minutes. I can’t go see him. My heart has been breaking, but the real torment came today.

Today was family therapy day. Our 45 minute phone call. In this session, my son said he had something he had to tell me. Then he confessed that he had groped my 9 yr old daughter’s buttocks and forced her to sit in his lap, rubbing her against himself, and would then go to the other room to masturbate. He said it had been going on for a YEAR. The therapist (who already heard this confession) said it is highly unlikely that this is ALL he ever did, given the rest of his case history and patterns of lying in therapy. 

My head is spinning- I’m going to explode!! This is MY SON!! My own little child that I still see as innocent and good, trying to do right- am I so blind?? And my poor precious little girl!! WHY DIDN’T I KNOW?? What will become of her?? She’s never said a word! What if more HAS happened?? I can’t even stand it!! The RAGE that I feel right now!! My family will never be the same- my son, the way I saw him and knew him, is gone!! It’s like he died and this monster took his place! And my daughter- how do I help her?? What do I do for her? And then there’s my dear husband who has devoted his life to this broken little family- I have to tell him it’s worse than we realized, and he’s poured himself into this MESS! 

My son will never come home. And it’s not for honorable reasons, or a tragic accident, or even someone else taking him away. It’s for his own actions.

My daughter has been scarred for life. Before she’s even a teenager, she has been taken advantage of and will have it impact all future relationships for the rest of her life! 

I am so torn! Part of me is raging angry and wants to scream at my son for doing such a perverted and horrible thing! The other side wants to say “he’s just a kid and didn’t know better.” Then the raging lioness in me is ready to tear him apart for what he did to my daughter!! And tears aren’t adequate to express the pain for her. I don’t even know if I have the whole story yet!! WHAT IF THERES MORE?!? I can’t even think about that yet- it’s too overwhelming and I am unable to handle what I have right now. My heart is screaming out the most terrifying horrific shrieking pain— a deep impenetrable dark void has opened in the middle of it, and chaos has crumbled my world around me. Sounds like massive train wrecks are rushing in my ears, and flashes of memories blind me to the physical world around me. Even now my words fail to express this agony. "
"Kind words for anyone who needs them! Yoo-hoo, big summer blowout 💕","You’re so loved! Everything is going to be okay! You deserve to be happy, you deserve to let in light and to do things that are healthy for you! Take care of yourself like you would take care of a sick child. Give them good food, get them to bed on time, make them laugh when they’re upset, tell them it’s okay to make mistakes, tell them that they’re safe! You are on this earth for a reason. You get to decide who is in your life and who you need to cut ties with for your emotional health. There will always be a new job out there if you’ve lost it, there is always another way to get your degree if you’ve been placed on probation or have to take a break, there will always be people there for you if you’ve lost someone, love is everywhere and your friends want to be happy. You are not a burden, you are a gift. I love you so much. Take care of yourself and remember that you’re always okay!"
So today i got sectioned,"Today has probably been the worst and best day of my life (as strange as that sounds). 

It all started off this morning with waking up with abit of dred as i do most morning, knowing its going to be another shit day like most. I walk downstairs and striaght away im in a bad mood as my 5 year old son is sat on the sofa with his dummy (now i know some people might not think thats a big deal but for me i hate it. It effects his speech and his teeth. I just hate it).

So that set my mood off, get aggy with my wife (who i dont want to be with anyway) and storm off to have my morning piss. Come back into the front room after making my breakfast and sitdown as normal. Now i had calmed down after eating and helping my son play abit of lego batman. So everything was cool, then came the time that he had to ger in the shower. Off he goes stomping into the kitchen because his mum has asked him to, next thing i know he walks back in the front room and throws his megazord toy at me. Now saying this was the straw that broke the camels back is an undertstatement.

So i sit on the sofa waiting for them to get out of the shower, they get out and i jump straight in. Knowing for well that i have had enough and just want to end it all. I get out and get ready and tell both the wife and my son that im leaving early to get some headspace. Off i go walking along the cliff and end up sat on abit of the cliff thats juts out over the rocky beach and sea below. 

I mean at that point that was it, i was going to end it right then and there but something stopped me from just walking straight off.... not sure what but maybe my subconcious.

So after sitting there for a good hour i decide maybe i should talk to someone, actuwlly tell someone how im feeling. Ring my mum (shes lives in spain) no answer. So the only other person i have is my dad, so i ring him. This ends up being the best conversation i have had woth my dad, him talking me down from jumping. Weird i know but its the first time ive actually felt like i have a dad in my 26 years on this planet. Hes managed to get me to start heading home to make sure i dont do amything else stupid. I give in and start heading home.

Upon getting back into my road im stopped by a policeman who wants to talk to me, assures me im not in trouble but they are just worried aboit me ( wasnt aware at all that the police even do this thing). After sitting in the car with him amd numerous happenings with the wife getting upset and him contacting the crisis line, he gets back in the car and informs me that he is gping to sectipn me because he dpesnt believe that i wont do anything else stupid if i go home and get into another argument or something.

So i end up getting taken to a hospital where i have been sat since half 2 this afternoon, time now being half past midnight, talking to councillors and psychiatrists. Its been the first time in my life that i havent felt alone and that i have no one to talk to, its the first time in the past 8 odd years that i feel like i can be happy again. Im sat here thinking that there is help for me and finally come to realise that i am the only person that can help me and improve my happiness and that is what i damn well am going to do.

For my sake and to be the best damn dad i can possibly be :)

7/20/2011

How long has it been?

My first date, my first anything.

Two kids and countless fucking adventures.

&#x200B;

It's not enough and here you are choosing to sell drugs over being around us. I made the move happen, I helped us get the house with the expensive rent just last month. I had to deal with you moving your friends in and being told to stay in my apartment in the basement because what goes on upstairs isn't any of my business. So here I am just proud to finally live somewhere that is not subsidized by the state or full of cockroaches, let me invite my friends over so they can meet all of the tweakers or the mentally insane you have brought in...why so they can laugh about how I am still getting fucked by you years later?.

&#x200B;

Then the meth is put in front of my face not two weeks after we move. I drive across town with our daughter in the car and you holding whatever because its the last of it and I hope to god that me being there shows you my commitment to more then this. Why?. So you can tell me that slinging a bag is what really gets you off because it shows you your worth. Because you can turn dollars into a fresh hundred.

&#x200B;

Who the fuck are you?

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do and I don't have anyone else. I don't have my Dad and I don't have my mom and its just not fair. I have lost everyone and the ones I have left cannot make this shit go away. I am so embarrassed I cannot even say the fucking word METH to them.

&#x200B;

Why are you doing this?.

&#x200B;

I'm fucking breaking so goddamn hard right now and I am trying everything I can to not do it in front of the kids. I don't even understand how I am still standing with the idea of you out shooting, smoking, fucking and dealing with whoever. We were intimate once in weeks and you didn't look at me?.

&#x200B;

I literally have to hear about someone taking pictures outside of the windows to our house, pictures of them holding a gun. Was that even the truth?. Is the threat someone you have fucked over or is just you?.

&#x200B;

If your mom was not staying here to watch the kids while I work or if Jarrod did not come to hangout a few days then I don't know where I would be right now.

&#x200B;

I just wish I could hear what you are thinking. Not the bullshit you tell your lame ass tweaking fuck up friends and customers, not the lies your tell me or your mother. I would give anything to know what you are thinking. Even if its planning the exit strategy and deciding you must need more than I can give you. Please tell me its more than some fucking shit cooked up in a dank basement.

&#x200B;

I have never chosen you over a drink, I have given up on you before and that is simply truth. And I am out of anything else to give you at this point. But its not because I haven't tried or gone without to make this happen.

&#x200B;

I have told you every thing, I have set my limits and made it more than clear where I draw the line and why I drink when I do and when I don't. Its never been something I couldn't hold off but you have never lightened this load between us. At the end of the goddam day I have never even come close to reliving the drug induced child hood I was put through by my over intoxicated and fucked up parents. That is for a fucking reason you ass. If I wanted to do a line of coke or hit a pipe with god knows what was in it then I wouldn't be Houston. I will never ever be that guy and you ruined simply smoking a joint for me a long damn time ago. I certainly wouldn't be with someone who is okay with this shit and then pretending it doesn't happen behind closed foors...never signed the hell up for that.

&#x200B;

I mean come on your mother was this big bad alcoholic who made your life hell and is the reason for all of these issues but you have been 18 for a long time. You have been with me for a long damn time. And I have given us a way out over and over again. But you don't want that life do you?. You can't be the homemaker or part time bread winner.

&#x200B;

I won't be here forever and neither will our kids. I hope you truly realize just what you are giving up because I guarantee you that there will never be another motherfucker that could begin to replace me. And our babies are once in a fucking lifetime you fuck up piece of shit. You tell me one more time that I have ever given up on them or us or anything. I have never even tried to be the person that you are today. I don't know you, you are nothing like the beautiful girl that swept me off of my feet all of those years ago.

&#x200B;

And Jacklyn I would be fucking lying if I did not say that I hope it ends here. I would give anything to not have to watch you struggle to learn what its even like to be a mother to our kids. You are beyond pathetic and could make a murderer out to be a saint if I bent my ear to you long enough. I'm done with that shit and I will be damned if I let you control me any longer. Your sick, be it mentally or down to the very core of who you are.

&#x200B;

Sorry to everyone who'll never know.,I'm sorry I deceived you. I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry I was selfish enough to not care about your feelings. I'm sorry I'm not the person who you think I am. I'm sorry that I waste your time. I'm sorry that I give you hope for something that will never happen. I'm sorry that I can't seem to be able to be honest with you.
I don't like living with my husband,"We've only been married one month and I absolutely do not like living with my husband at his parents house. We didn't live together before marriage as his family is very religious and that was not ok. Saying this makes me sound like I'm very young, but I'm actually 37 and he's almost 41. He takes care of his dad full time and we cannot afford to live on our own right now. I'm in a ton of debt and so his he and we're trying to pay some of that off before moving out and he couldn't leave now even if we could afford it. 

I'm a very private person and I feel I have no privacy at their house. It's not my house and I don't think it would ever feel like that. His mom likes me enough but she's not super into me because I'm not her ideal version of a daughter in law. I'm not their religion, I am very opinionated and super left which is all the opposite of her. 

I didn't grow up like he did. We didn't have sit down dinners at a certain time everyday. I have such a chaotic schedule that I couldn't be there for dinner at the same time everyday. 

Beyond trying to adjust to living with my husband I'm also having to act like a different person. I know we all have to make adjustments when marrying someone, but having to live in a situation where I can't be myself is so hard and draining. I can't act like I would at my home because there are so many rules and ways of doing things at his house. Like I'm totally able to change how I do dishes or what day I do laundry or many things, but being made to feel like an idiot because I didn't rewrap a dish in paper towels for storage is too much. I'm not the most domestic woman and definitely am on the messier side so being there makes me feel like I'm in a museum and can't touch anythjng. Everything I do is wrong; where I hung my wet towel on a hanger (apparently this is not a hook for wet towels only dry towels, like wtf), how I cook things, the food I buy, where I buy my food, the fact it's been a month and I haven't finished the thank you cards, the list is endless. Like just give me a fucking manual so I know what I can and can't do. I can't imagine living there much longer without it taking a toll on my marriage. 

I hate feeling like a guest in a home that I'm supposed to call home. It's just never gunna feel like my home. "
The full relationship story about me and my abusive ex girlfriend.,"Already not suitable for r/confessions and too dark for r/relationships. But go check them out even though my posts were removed the mods recommended me here so shoutout to them 

Now to begin with the story (it’s long)

Hey Reddit, throwaway account here. I couldn’t think of a better place to tell this story so I’m telling it here. I recently just split up with a girl that made my life hell. I know it says this isn’t for “relationship advice” and that’s not what I’m looking for, I just feel like I can barely say this to anyone because she made the effort to only have mutual friends and distanced me from all my old ones, so I’m turning to here. It’s a long story...

so hold tight. 

(on mobile sorry for formatting issues)

It all started from a mutual friend, back in freshman year in high school . We met at a party and immediately hit if off. I say I’m probably a 3/10 and she’s about a 9 so I’m of course surprised. We laugh and had a lot of fun, and at the end of the night we exchanged phone numbers. Over the months we hung out more, and eventually started to hang out separately. We realized we had feelings for each other and started to date in mid 2017. Everything started out great. We were happy together, I had a lot of friends, and overall life was really good at that point and I had stopped self-harming as a promise to her. She was actively trying to make me a better person. This lasted until about February of 2018. I was friends with girls because sometimes I found them easier to talk to than guys most of the time. As I became closer to her she actively tried to push me away from these friends, and they seemed to be distancing themselves from me. What I didn’t know is that she was messaging them telling my friends that i was hers and that they better not even come near me. Yes didn’t know why all my female friends stated to slowly disappear, bu I wanna was so blinded hey love I didn’t even notice she was trying to push me away. As the relationship progressed, she started to be more hostile towards me. She’d say that I wasn’t masculine enough because I’m too skinny and didn’t play a lot of sports. She made me quit things I loved because they were too “nerdy” and would tell me I was a terrible boyfriend for leaving her and ignoring her for these events. She’d call me “ugly, stupid,waste of air, a terrible boyfriend, said that she’d be the reason she’d become a lesbian” etc. All I wanted was to make her happy, but that never happened. Eventually, she even tried to separate me from my guy friends, calling me a “f****t” and saying I loved them more than her. She made me feel obligated to leave them at lunch and to not study for tests and FaceTime her everyday at lunch or she would ridicule me. At one point she even said to me that she’s only with me for the sex anymore and if we weren’t doing it she would’ve left me a long time ago. She was always disappointed in me for something, and she always expected me to do something about it, even though I couldn’t. I lost sleep, my grades dropped, everything was going wrong. The first breakup came in October 2018 by my parents being worried for my health. Now when I look back, I’m so grateful for them doing that, but back then I was furious. We still talked through my old laptop and she told me to emancipate from my parents and leave them and that they were abusive and terrible and she wanted the best for me. I believed her and I was a dick to my parents until they took me to a therapist. This therapist helped guide me to break up with her again (even though I didn’t listen at first) but like shoutout to Kate she a real one. 

The breakup was hard, but I’m so thankful for my family and the few friends I (secretly) kept close. This happened about a month and a half ago, and she tries to track me through all of my accounts. Thankfully we don’t go to the same hs, but her friends still bother me. I’m even using a throwaway account here on a new phone because she found my Reddit. Thank you all for listening, if you come across this I’ll respond to any questions you have. 

Forever grateful for this community, thank you all.

Crossdressing Dilemma,"I'm a 40 yr old married man (with kids) who is having a crisis of conscience right now.

&#x200B;

From my teens onwards, i've been crossdressing on and off, and i'm struggling with the desire to dress versus the family life I have and adore.  When I was single, I was able to keep this facet of my life secret, and tried hard to stop once I married.  However, my urge to dress hasn't gone away, and if anything, is getting stronger the older I get.  I hate to feel that i'm lying to my wife, and the guilt I feel inside for dressing when I do get the chance.

&#x200B;

I'm really not sure this is something I can tell her, and it's killing me inside.  I've long accepted that this is part of me, but these feelings are something I can't suppress."
I think I’m depressed,"I’m a big black (fat) African guy studying in the Philippines. Today is the first time I’ve ever had suicidal thoughts. All my friends have left and the few left are leaving. My sister who is/ was also my roommate left to visit a friend in Manila and now stays there. The knowledge that I will be alone is slowly killing me. I’m an introvert but I try to be friendly and polite to everyone. My own ethnic community never really accepted me or at least that’s how I feel. As warm and welcoming as Filipinos are, they always seem repulsed by or afraid of me. I feel abandoned and I don’t know how to deal with it. This is the only place I can vent. Perhaps I’m the problem. All I know is what I’m feeling right now. I just wanted to vent, whether anyone sees it or not, I just needed an outlet. Please forgive my grammar and punctuation."
The person who I [30F] thought was the love of my life [29F] is losing interest in me.,I just realized that I posted this on wrong subreddit and I cant find the delete button.
I'm terrified of being sad,"I've always been a naturally carefree person. People know me as somebody who doesn't let anything get to me. I went to a decently difficult high school that was definitely future-oriented. Always had a lot of pressure on me to succeed and whatnot. I'm the child of two first generation amazing parents that always showed me love. They have incredible stories and they've overcome a lot, and they've always provided for me, and I feel like there's nothing in my life that should cause me as much strife as they have experienced. I've done pretty well for myself and my goals. I go to one of the best engineering universities that lets me explore my dreams with boundless opportunities.  But this place is hard as shit, and it reminds me of how stupid I am a lot of the time. I have to cheat sometimes just to get by because I just don't understand concepts in time for the assignments, and it tears me apart because my parents are such honest hardworking people.

All my life I've been compared to other people people and I really hated it. Always had a cousin that everybody thought was smarter than me, even though she really wasn't. I know it's terrible to think that, but her high school was far easier and it let her really excel, whereas I was struggling with material. And I feel terrible that I feel smug that she got rejected from every college that she wanted to go to, and I got into the top schools in the nation. I feel like I'm pulling out happiness or validation from unhealthy places, but I don't know how to not. Everybody thought my sister was harder working than I was. My father's legacy casts a shadow I doubt I'll ever step out of. I was never the smartest kid in my class, and eventually started comparing myself to the other better students all the time. Then I had a friend commit suicide in high school. We don't know why exactly, but we're pretty sure it was the pressure of our high school that got to him. He was somebody I always looked up to, somebody I aspired to be. Then he died, and I didn't know what to do. It should have been a wakeup call for me, to change my life, but instead what ended up happening was me giving myself an ultimatum that I would never let myself feel that sad, without actually changing anything. Honestly this is the biggest reason I'm so scared of being sad, because I'm afraid I'll make the same choice my friend did.

My lows are really fucking bad. When I'm back in my dorm, sometimes I'll just bawl my eyes out for no reason. I'll think really dark thoughts, and my feelings of weakness makes me feel even shittier. It's just a terrible positive feedback loop. 

I don't really know where I'm going with this. I just want to not feel as if I have to be carefree and strong all the time, because I'm not. I'm really not."
Too much on my mind lately..,"I've been really upset lately and I just need to let it all out somewhere. I dont have any friends and I live an hour away from my family, so I don't see them at much as I'd like. Feel free to read or ignore, my thoughts are everywhere and it's quite messy. 

I'm 25F, engaged (25M) and in the most stable relationship I've had, I work full time as a CNA (certified nursing assistant), I have a kitty who adores me (when he's not terrorizing the house or my skin), and my fiance and I finally have our own apartment.

Yet, I'm not happy. I struggle with depression, anxiety and PTSD. I take medication and it does help, or at least it was helping. But this unhappiness is more than depression induced. 

My fiance is a recovering drug addict. That in itself is a struggle. I've helped him see life without substance is meaningful and within reach. I've helped him find a job, where he's been for most a year! Previously his record employment was 3 months. He's about to be promoted to manager! He's really come a long way. Addiction behavior is still wired into his brain though. He'll be perfectly fine one minute, then something reminds him of the past and the cravings will hit hardcore. He acts different and becomes agitated. I am able to successfully redirect this thoughts and talk him out of meeting his dealer, 99% of the time. His friends certainly don't help, they're all addicts themselves, some recovering, some still actively using. Of course they offer what they have to him, since most of them don't have jobs and need money from someone other than their mom. 

Being a drug addict has mainly been his life for the last decade. He dated, but nothing too serious. He talks about two of his exes often, and sometimes I think there are unresolved feelings there, but he denies it. He isn't romantic at all and he uses his drug use as an excuse as to why he's never learned how to ""be a good boyfriend"" (his words). He doesn't plan our dates or time together. I have to remind him to do special things for holidays, I pretty much end up buying myself stuff- I could tell him exactly what i want or give him numerous ideas and he'll use the excuse of not knowing what to get me as the reason he didn't get anything (example- i told him I wanted an Open Heart necklace when he wanted gift ideas for Christmas. Even showed him a few I liked and bookmarked the website for him. It's three weeks til Christmas and he says he didn't get me anything because he didn't know what to get. REALLY. So I showed him the bookmarked website and he said for me to just pick what I like and order it. He had no idea what it looked like and he didn't personalize it. This happens every holiday..) His version of quality time together is putting something on Netflix, sitting next to me, and being on his phone. He doesn't pay attention when I talk half the time. The amount of times I'll tell him about something or have to repeat myself is ridiculous. He ""wants to be better""  it doesn't take the steps to improve. He's constantly on reddit. It's not hard to find the proper subreddit and explain ""I'm not great at being romantic, can someone give me tips to improve myself and my relationship?"".... 

We hardly have sex. I'm talking once a week, if I'm lucky. I never get the chance to orgasm and he ""forgets"" to finish me. I don't find pleasure in masturbation. We used to all the time when we first started dating. We would be driving and get in the mood so we'd find a spot to park and jump in the backseat! It was amazing. He even had a little foot fetish, which was weird at first but I kinda really enjoyed it after a bit, but that disappeared, too. I feel the only reason we end up having sex is because I get upset that it's been so long (we've gone 2+ months before) and he feels bad, so we do it. Same position all the time. No kinky stuff anymore. I bought toys and lingerie to spice things up, they never get used. There's hardly any foreplay anymore, either. Definitely no more oral on his part. I've tried to talk to him and tell him how I feel, what I want, and he says he'll try more but never does. I feel unattractive and undesirable, he tells me that's not it at all. I could be totally naked and he wouldn't notice or get turned on. 

My exes have all been abusive. They've all taken money from me. Used me for numerous things. Forced sex and sexual things on me. One was so manipulative that he started faking seizures to get attention. This was after his ""suicidal"" period, where he was actually committed to a mental hospital. I needed a break at that point so he decided to tell his therapist he had a plan to end his life (it was a lie. I struggle heavily with depression,  my uncle committed suicide and he was using this as a way to hurt me) and his therapist insisted on inpatient treatment. We were in the lobby waiting for his bed to be open and he told me the only way he'd go through with treatment is if I put my engagement ring back on and we were back together. I agreed just so he would get help. He had real seizures at first. They were how his body handled stress we came to find out. He used that to his advantage. I wanted to go our with friends? He'd have a seizure. I had to work, or he had to? Seizure. He was at work and not liking the shift? Seizure. I needed sleep and he wanted attention? You guessed it, seizure. He stopped working, didn't help with bills, wouldn't cook or clean. He played xbox all day or talked to other girls behind my back. I eventually wised up, saw the way I was being treated, found out he was cheating and dumped him. I let him use the spare bedroom until he could make arrangements to move. I moved on, so he decided to video himself slicing his wrist IN MY BED and send it to me while I was at work. I called 911 and they took him to the hospital. He was gone so I packed his things and told his parents he's never allowed on my property again. 

Another ex, before the previously talked about, destroyed my life for a period of time. I was 16, he was 21. Illegal for sure. We snuck around for a little. He broke up with me on new years eve so he could pursue a married woman he crushed on when he was 12. She used him to make her HUSBAND jealous. He was thinking of joining the army, she didn't want him to, so she started hanging around my ex to make the husband jealous.  It worked, she got her way and he came crawling back. Being so young and naive, I took him back. My parents hated him and threatened statutory rape charges, so until I was 18 we kept it quiet. Only time I'd see him was for a quick hookup in his car. How did I not see that was so wrong? I was his sex toy, nothing more. Day after my 18th birthday, he decides to call my dad. Tells him we've been together and that's how its staying. My dad asked how he would support me, as he worked under the table for $6 an hour. This started a giant fight, which led to me being kicked out. His mom let me stay at their house for 3 days, then decided I would be better suited in a women's shelter. Her son destroyed my life and this is what I got. I found a place to stay, thankfully. Eventually his parents wanted to move to their house 6 hours away, and he was coming with. I was offered to come along, but I was to work full time at a job his mother already applied to for me without my permission, cook, clean, and pay most of the bills. The weekend came to move and I asked for just one more week. I had finally made amends with my family and then my sister got leukemia at age 16. They wanted me to move so far away while my sister fought for her life. I didn't think one week was a big deal, I hasn't planned to move anyway. Of course it was a huge deal that ended in a screaming match. When asked if I was really the only one he could possible see spending his life with, he hesitated. Not a solid, no thought needed no. He said yes, but he thought about it. That told me all I needed to know. From there he contacted me late at night to hide from his parents. 23 and still letting his parents control every aspect of his life. He's 30 now and I'm pretty sure it's still that way. The contact was to talk about sex or ask me to get naked. I stopped replying. I was in a chair next to my sister, who was still in the hospital, and that's all he cared about. No thanks. 

March 10, 2017 was the worst day of my life. I received a message from a guy from Georgia. Be way nearby for gentlemens training (he is in the Navy) for three weeks and found me. We talked for a little. Never flirted or indicated he liked me or found me attractive. He only had the van for transportation from training to the hotel and he was hungry with no car. I, being a nice person who does too much for people, offered to take him to get something to eat. Biggest mistake. Never meet a person you've messaged for 48 hours. I came to the hotel and he literally was in bed yet. He ""had to get dressed"" but that never happened. I sat on the edge of the bed, since that was the only available option, and he took that as intuitive to start kissing me. Whatever, it's just kiss. Of course not.. kiss led to making out led to his hands wandering led to me being pinned down on the bed, struggling with all I had to get him off of me. I was no match for a muscular navy man. He raped me. A person he didn't know, who was struggling and crying. He didn't care. How heartless does one have to be to do that to someone? He was called back to training and I ran as fast as I could the second he went to the bathroom. My life was shattered. I'll never be the same ever again. What could I have possibly done to deserve this? 

My life is a mess. It always has been. Doesn't seem to get better for long.. "
My friend and I ran away last night. Now we’re on a train. We don’t know where it’s going and we haven’t paid for it.,"I have been planning my ‘escape’ since I was last admitted into a psychiatric hospital. I was going to run away during the night and finally end it. That was until my friend texted me. 

We then set up the plan on how we would do it. So she packed her bag (mine was already packed) and we waited. I left my house at 11:20am and started walking to her house. I arrived at about 12:15am. She came out and we ran. We ran until our chests burnt and our legs were giving up. 

We eventually arrived at the train station after getting lost a few times. It was way to early and the station was closed. So we sat at a bus stop for a while in the freezing Weather and not nearly enough layers. Until it reached 4:00am and then the station finally opens and we rushed to it for the warmth. 

My friend used the toilets whilst I checked what routes we could take. Whilst I was standing there an employee came over and asked if I’m getting on a train and that the next one leaves in a couple of minutes so I better hurry. So I got my friend out of the toilet and ran onto a train. We have no idea where it’s going. 

We also haven’t paid for tickets since the toll booths weren’t open? I’m kinda confused about that especially since the employees just told us to get on. So we may be doing something illegal here I’m not sure. If someone could shed some light on that it would be much appreciated. We’re in Essex. 

Edit: so they let us get away with not paying for the ticket. We’re just wandering the streets now trying to figure out what to do haha. 

Edit 2: my friend told her mum where we were. Her mum told the police. Now I’ve run away from her and have just overdosed. So I feel very heavy, sick and light headed. The police and my family are looking for me. I think they’re going to be to late. I hope they’re too late. If the police see me they’re going to have to raze me to get me to come with them. "
I didn't stay in touch with my first child who was raised by my mother,"My mother and I always had a strained relationship. I've heard stories about the way she was when I was a baby from other people in the family and I can remember how she treated me as a kid. She never hugged me, never told me she loved me.

I was an invisible child who couldn't do anything right. Neither one of them seemed interested, unless I was getting in trouble and I started getting in trouble a bunch when I was a teenager.

When I was 18 I married a guy that I really loved. We found out I was pregnant a week after we got married and he wanted me to have an abortion, then, when that was no longer an option he wanted me to put the baby up for adoption.

I loved that baby boy. Unfortunately, I was also pretty messed up in the head. I tried for awhile after my husband left but I had no clue what to do and no family that wanted to help me.

My mother eventually took my son when he was almost two. I tried to stay in touch. I would go visit, but the relationship with my mom remained horrible, even after I went to college and started turning my life around she wanted nothing to do with me. She left me out of her descendants list when her side of the family made a book about our ancestry.

Eventually, I moved to another state when he was about 10. I would call and try to talk to him and she would always tell me that he wasn't there. Eventually, I stopped calling.

I guess I thought there would be time. I feel like I'm a horrible person because I didn't raise him and that I don't deserve to be in his life. I'm so jealous that his biological father has a relationship with him and the father didn't even want him.

He's grown now. Almost 30, married. 

I still don't know why my mom hates me, other than being born I haven't done anything to her. I hate her. "
Probably just hormonal changes,"I hate all of my friends because I feel like they don't care about me. My only desire is to die in a mystery that way I would feel like people care about me, even though they most definitely do."
I have a strong sexual desire and the guy that I want to marry might not be able to fulfill it ...,"I love a guy who is diabetic and also have hypertension and it's known that both affect his sexual life. I have a strong sexual desire and I'm afraid it will be a big problem. I tell myself it doesn't matter as long as I love him, but I don't know if I can control my desire or not. I love him and I will feel guilty if I told him such a thing or if the marriage didn't work because of this. I don't know what to do. "
My teacher had a crush on me and I didn’t know.,"I was in high school, and I had this teacher for astronomy and he was especially kind to me and my friend. He loved our art, and he asked me to draw him pictures all the time. He asked me my favorite scent so he could use it for the oil diffuser in class. I always though he was just a nice guy. The second I left his class he added me on Facebook and Instagram and began messaging me. It was strange.. it was always after midnight and sometimes he would tell me he was drunk and “trying not to be flirty.” 
One day he asked for my Snapchat I was hesitant but I wanted to believe he wasn’t a pervert. (He’s probably in his late 20s early 30s and I had just graduated high school.) 
He sent me a Snapchat saying “thinking about you.❤️” and my stomach sank and I felt like crying
In that moment I realized that ever nice thing he did for my when I was in his class junior year wasn’t real. I felt disgusting. Every time he would watch me draw or beg him to draw him pictures or when he would like every selfie that my boyfriend wasn’t in and he gave him such a hard time in class, it all made sense. 
I still feel gross at the thought of him to this day. I later found out he did this to a lot of girls in his classes. 
He has a serious fiancée the whole time too.. 
I want to report him to the school but, I’m scared. 


Edit: thank you guys, i appreciate the feedback. I’ve heard from all you guys. I was thinking of asking some of the other girls to see if they are willing to come clean with me. "
A quick move out.,"So my mom works at a hospital and is having drama, me and my girlfriend just moved in and are in the process of getting jobs and she has informed us that drama at her work may require her to quit which means we cannot be here anymore, I’m confident we’ll have jobs soon but I know for a fact with this possibility looming over us, which apparently is a high possibility, I’m afraid that we may be homeless, both of our respective parents have informed us we can’t be there, we have no friends able to take us in, and I’m very nervous about our animals and our lives. Anyone have any advise to hold us over into the next day? We are really worried. Thank you! "
An animal stole one of my new expensive shoes.,"So for some background, I’ve been having feet problems for over a year. I’ve been struggling finding shoes that didn’t make my feet swell and go numb and it was driving me insane. I even went to a specialist to find out why my feet do this. My doctor sucks so I haven’t been able to get the info back for months. So I decided to go to a very nice shoe place and be fitted. Finally I found a shoe and pair of insoles that worked for me. They were both very expensive but it was worth it to find a solution. 

This is where the shit starts. My wife and I took a weekend off from our kid and responsibilities to relax. We’ve been working so hard lately so we needed to relax big time. We took a short trip and had a nice time. On the way back, I got a bit of motion sickness. Sometimes I get it really bad in the car. Must have been something I ate. Suddenly I tell my wife to pull over because I have to puke. She does and I get out and puke. I get it all over my new shoes. Big deal. I can clean them. So I bag the shoes and throw them in the trunk. 

We’re home once again and my wife sprays off my shoes, gives them a scrub, and leaves them out on the sunny porch to dry. Well we forgot to bring them in before night time and apparently an animal ( I’ve been having opossum trouble lately so I suspect them) smelled the puke and got interested. I go outside this morning and only one shoe is left. Looked everywhere in the yard to no avail. I’ll have to search again after work but I’m fairly certain I’ll never see that shoe again. 

The main takeaway from this for me was not just that it’s a bummer I have to buy new shoes so soon. Those shoes meant something to me. They were peace of mind. My foot problems were bothering me so much for the last year and I tried hard to stay quiet about it. My family needed me so I just worked through it. Now I had my solution and it’s gone just as fast. I can’t afford to buy them again right now, so I’ll just have to be patient and save. At least I still have one left. :P"
"First time posting, pls be nice heheh..","I dont know how to start but, a few months ago, my girlfriend of around 3 years broke up with me. It was mostly my fault cause i got pissed at her for ruining my birthday. She told me that it was at that moment that she lost all love for me. Harsh, but understandable. But the way she broke up with me was so fucking shitty. We both just started college, in different colleges. So here i was, keeping her updated with my first days in college. But she wouldnt even give me ANY updates on her part. I was getting pretty “not good”(couldnt find the right word hahahah) as my father was in the hospital, and ive been failing my major subjects for the first quarter of school. I would go to where she is for comfort but when i get to her dorm, she was at the lobby waiting for me. Here i thought that we would eat and i can release my feelings, but she fucking broke up with me. I really do understand her reasons, and I accept that i had fucked up. But that just made my situation worse. Like now, im at the lowest point in my life. Like it was hard to be my usual optimistic self. I hated myself then. Instead of studying, i would just waste time in internet cafes playing. Though i made friends in college, i was always by myself. Doesnt help with my situation at all. Hahahahaha. Thankfully, my dad recovered and my grades have recovered. 

Dont get me wrong, i dont harbour any ill feelings towards my ex. I just want her to be happy. The other day, she invited me for a get together with out high school friends. I said i will go, for i wanted to see my friends again. (We went to the same high school, but now in different colleges ☹️) 

Now this is the part where i decided to post on this subreddit. The get together involved alcohol, and most of my friends really love to drink, especially her. I dont drink at all. It was all very fun and nice to be with all of them again. Because I genuinely feel that i was over her. But when i saw her holding hands with this dude(a “friend” from her college) my mood just crashed. My night ruined. I mean, i know i have no right to feel this way. She’s happy. Who am i to get in the way of her happiness, right? I left early because the pain is coming back. Im sorry if this was a long story, i saw this subreddit  and thought of posting because i dont want to bother my friends with pointless shit like this. At least, im a little more free here. Thanks fam"
Wishing for bad things,Times like this I wish for something awful to happen to me physically so I can be distracted from my emotional struggles. 
I never loved you,"I don't think you understood that.


I liked our physical attraction, the way our kisses made me feel good, hanging with you, all of that was good, still something never worked with us, despite taking a lot it's like we always hid something from one another.


I wanted us to work but I think you got scared of the real intimacy.


I'm not perfect, I know that too, I'm a lot to work with, but aren't we all?


Almost 6 months have passed since our last goodbye and I don't think much about you, today is an exception, that being said I missed you by my side every night.I wonder if it's the same with you. 


I've dated some people after you, some of them were really nice, but here I am thinking about you and not one of them. The thing is I don't even know if I want to see you again or if I'm just craving for affection."
"Is it just me, or is it super annoying when people correct your grammar or spelling when you post anything. I mean, it’s reddit, not a college thesis.

i hate how people feel they can judge sex workers,"trigger warning for rape

i can't help but feel that in the mind of many people sex work is the worst sin on earth, the most disgusting thing anyone can do. there is some sort of disgust that you can hear in the voice of people talking about it, and it is not disgust directed towards the perpetrators but the sex workers. even if it was not a choice. even if they were forced to do sex work. the society has this perception that this woman (primarily, but people of other genders too) then becomes unclean, dirty, that it was their fault. 

i wanna vomit. the world is disgusting and i don't want to be a part of it. "
How an awkward dance raised my self esteem.,"I was over at my friends house for St. Patrick's Day today for a few quiet ones with my friends. My friend has 2 sisters, one of them having Down's syndrome. All of my friends and I were in the kitchen having drinks and listening to music. Now I must say I am very socially awkward. I can't dance to save my life and I'm also a tall lanky bastard, so it makes it difficult to not dance awkwardly.

I was the first to arrive at the house and my friend started joking with his sister (who has Down's syndrome) that I was her boyfriend here to collect her. We were all having a good laugh.

So cut to later in the kitchen. I'm just sitting down and chatting with my other friends and enjoying the atmosphere. His sister just comes over to me and gives me a big hug and says that I'm a lovely lad. I was actually surprised.

It was a pleasant surprise though. I don't know what possessed me, but I decided to grab her hand and waltz with the music. The whole room started watching us. She had a huge smile and was obviously enjoying herself. My dislike of dancing was still there, but it was being shunned by how happy I was for her.

After the song I said she was a great dancer and I went to sit back down. My friend said I was great for doing that, because he knows I'm very awkward.

I'm just thinking now that she must have few opportunities to meet new people and have fun. I'm also a little proud of myself for not just rejecting the offer to dance and sitting there like a knob. When we all went to the nightclub later I couldn't help feeling a bit lighter.

Anyways, that's my little feelgood moment of the day. Hope you all had a great st paddy's day.

My best friend killed herself 3 months ago and I don’t think I’ve been the same since.,"I was at work, polishing glasses when I received a call. I felt it in my gut, and I just knew. 

My best friend had always struggled with her mental health. She passes it off as memes, but we’ve always known. That’s the worst part. 

I couldn’t cry. I was at work, how could I cry. I was across the ocean, they were in Asia while I lived in Australia. I sent my best friend an email the previous night, but I found out she had already hung herself a few hours before.  

It’s been months, I still can’t get myself to think about it; to grief it. I knew she was suffering, but she’s never said why. She didn’t leave a single message. Deleted everything from her online accounts, as if she was never there. 

But I found a playlist, hidden away, in her Spotify. That was the only thing left behind. I hate the fact that her family seemed to brush it off. I hate how I wasn’t there to see her one last time.

My friend had noticed I haven’t been the same since, and I think he’s right. A part of me just died along with her. 

I still refuse to talk about it. I still don’t know what to do. But I know within myself that one day, I’d need to accept it, and talk about it, and grief it. 

I just don’t know how. "
I don't want to be gay,"I can't adequately explain why, I just don't want to be gay. I'm sure my family would accept who I am, but I can't. I've tried my hardest to fool myself into believing I'm straight, but I don't think I can lie to myself anymore. Women don't sexually or emotionally do anything for me. I honestly can't imagine spending the rest of my life with a woman.

However, I'm afraid of coming out and not being accepted by other gays. I don't know where to meet other gays - especially since I'm not a fan of using dating apps. I don't want to get used by random guys for hookups that don't mean anything. I don't know what to do, and I wish I could adequately explain in more (and better) words why I don't want to be the way I am. "

It’s killing me that he hasn’t asked me.,"We’ve been together nearly 6 years. We have two of the most beautiful children, you’re 30 and I’m 28. And you still haven’t asked me to marry you. 
You know I love you more than words can say. But you piss me off so much! I wouldn’t change it for the world. Except the part where you haven’t asked me. 

Your parents were together 36 year before your dad asked your mom to marry him. I’m sorry but I don’t want to be in my fifties calling you my boyfriend.
My parents will be celebrating their 40th wedding anniversary in October and they’re 60 & 58. 

I want to be one of those people that can say it’ll be our XX wedding anniversary this year for us. 

I want to be your Mrs. maybe I’m a little old fashioned that way. Our son doesn’t understand why we are not married and his friends parents are. I know this is stupid. I just want it so bad "
19 and burned out,"Hi everyone! Long time lurker, feeling a bit nervous making my first post, but here goes nothing. Obligatory sorry for bad English and formatting etc etc..
So to start off, I’m a 19 year old girl. And I’m burned out. 

Both my parents are unemployed, as we moved back from a country that we lived in as expats, two years ago. We are now living in our home country. To explain further, we lived in a very sheltered and religious country, meaning that i was extremely dependent on my parents for income, education, food, living, etc. I didn’t lift a finger throughout my whole life, and my dad was the sole provider. My social skills were so doomed that I would be too shy to order food by myself, my parents had to do everything for me.
Sooner or later, we had to move to our home country because the country that we lived in started making life for foreigners quite difficult, and I had to pursue upper education and enroll in university after graduating high school. And so we moved. Dad left his job, mom is a stay at home mother, sister is a stay at home mother as well, brother works in the medical field (in the country that we moved from). 
I enrolled in a university that I really liked for a while but then dropped out as there was no way for me to pay tuition fees. So now it was just me, mom and dad at home, all unemployed, wondering... what’s next? How will we eat? How will we pay bills? 

I made the decision that I HAVE to grow out of my shell, and get a job to provide for the family. I went through really bad anxiety, I didn’t even know how to talk to people! I was too nervous, how can I even hold a job? However, I managed to score down a job as a sales associate at a large retail store. Yeah, dumbass little me who gets too anxious to order food, is now a person whose job is to constantly talk to strangers. It was incredibly difficult at first. I stammered. Customers constantly told me to raise my voice because they couldn’t hear me when I spoke. I was unconfident about my abilities. But it paid the bills. It got food on the table, and that’s all I wanted. Does it pay $2 per hour? Yeah, the minimum wage here is incredibly low, but it’s livable. I went from not even doing household chores to working day and night to provide for my family along with my brother who sends us a little money monthly. 

Then, I enrolled into university again. I managed to fix my schedule at work so that I was able to be a full time employee and a full time student. My schedule is now as goes: 

6AM- wake up, get dressed
8AM till 12:15- classes at uni 
12:15-1pm- walk to grandpa’s house, have some lunch, get dressed and head to work.
2PM till 10PM- Work.
2AM- sleep after spending some time with family, eating, showering, etc. 
And repeat. 

My house is an hour away from uni and work, so I usually get home by 11PM something. Every. Single. Day. I even work on sundays. The one day off I get from work, I spend at my university attending classes and sleeping at home the whole day from exhaustion. I have no social life. I’m lucky my boyfriend is my coworker otherwise I wouldn’t be seeing him at all. I wake up with headaches as I’m barely getting enough sleep specially when I come home from work at 11PM or 12AM and I have an exam to study for, then head to university to do the exam at the ungodly hours of the morning with barely enough sleep. It has gotten to the point where I’m so tired that I’m neglecting my exams (I found out at 10AM that I had an exam at 8AM that I had forgotten all about) and I’m also neglecting customer requests at work, forgetting to follow up with orders and getting in trouble with my supervisor because of it. My only support system is my boyfriend who has been extremely wonderful to me on my bad days, I can’t even think of how to thank him. Yesterday I sent him a very long paragraph explaining how amazing he is and how much I appreciate everything he does for me and he was FLOORED. He’s amazing and I don’t know how my state would be without him. 

However, I’m still tired all the time and exhausted all the time and I snap at people and give attitude to customers because they make it their life goal to make my job harder. I’m proud of myself because of where I was and where I stand now. I pay bills, pay my tuition full (student loans aren’t really a thing here), groceries, clothes, and get my parents little gifts and treat them once in a while. But my mental state is in shambles. I currently have $100 in my bank account which I have to survive off for the next two weeks until I get paid. 

I’m so exhausted. I just want to sleep for a whole day. I don’t even want to go out and party and have fun like those kids I see at my university doing. I don’t want to sign up for extracurricular activities and trips that my uni keep organizing. I just want a full night’s sleep, and to see my boyfriend outside of work. Is that too much for a 19 year old girl to ask for? 
"
My husband slapped my butt in front of his friends,"My husband and I were at our friend's house one evening watching TV. I got up to show our female friend a picture and my husband decides it's okay to slap my butt at this time. I suddenly say ""hey, what the hell"" because I felt like it was inappropriate and out of place especially in front of people. 
My husband gets deffensive and says ""what? You have a nice butt."" But I don't care if I have a nice butt or not you just don't do that. 
Our female friend then says ""what's wrong with him touching you? You should let him touch you!"" Then her boyfriend says the same thing.

I got very annoyed and angry that anyone would say I should let someone touch me. If I don't feel comfortable with something I should be able to deny people from doing something I'm not okay with even if I'm married to them. 

It took my husband a whole two arguments to understand why that wasn't okay.. part of me is so annoyed that I had to explain that to an adult. I know he meant it as a form of admiration but there's more tasteful ways of showing that to people. I was very disappointed that he decided to go for a distasteful way. My husband later realized he was in the wrong and apologized.

It's been a couple days since and I'm still mad about that incident, I don't even want to continue my friendship with our friends because of that..am I being petty? "
Pulled a sickie from work for the first time and loving it,"My work is stressful, I’m only an assistant so get paid very little and have the workload of 4 people (not a joke, 3 people left so I am doing their workload) and this morning I just couldn’t face it. So I called in sick and have been watching telly, cleaning and housework and just relaxing. I should feel guilty but I don’t. "
My Gender Identity issues,"So I don’t use Reddit often, but I thought it might be a good place to find others who might be willingly to discuss this topic and help me get a better understanding.

For the past 12 months I’ve been feeling uncomfortable in my own identity, I don’t feel like I identify as a man, nor do I feel I identify as a female. For the record I am biologically a male. I’m just very unsure of what is causing these feelings or how to express and explore my gender identity in a safe way.

I have been diagnosed with anorexia nervosa for about 6 years now, and I can't discuss my gender issues with anybody in my physical life because they will all immediately try and make the link between my mental illness, and my gender issues, despite no matter how much I insist they are completely seperate things

Does anybody have any advice, thoughts or resources that they know of relating to this subject? "
The girl I'm dating got in a relationship with someone else.,"So I've been seeing this girl at my work place for a couple months now, we always hang out after work, watch movies in bed, go out on dates, have lazy Sunday's together and generally spend a lot of time with each other like partners would. This last week I've not seen her due to being on a small break from work where I've visited old family in another part of the country, when I got home Saturday night she called me to tell me she was with someone else. I can't lie, I'm pretty annoyed and upset. Even though we weren't what some people would call ""officially together"" as we weren't advertising it out to everyone, I still feel pissed off at the fact that she's been seeing or talking to someone in that way when we've spoken multiple times about being together openly with each other in work, to our friends and on social media. Am I right to be pissed off? Or is this one of them ""bite the bullet"" situations where I should just move on and not think about it? "
Who else hates cleaning dishes???,"As much as I hate cleaning the dished, I still do just cause it's my responsibility to clean what I dirty. But my older brother and his wife and their kids are the worstttttt when it comes to cleaning dishes. They literally do not clean shit so I'm thinking of a plan to some how force them to clean it without telling them of ND kicking them out. So I was thinking maybe I should dirty all the MF dishes on purpose so they have no choice to clean a dish before they use it OR just have them buy plastic plates and utensils when they come over. If anyone has any ideas of what I should do please let me know. "
Uncle has brain hemorrhage and i can't say goodbye.,"My mom called me last night to tell me that my dad's brother is in the hospital with a brain bleed and they aren't sure if he's going to make it. I haven't seen this uncle in years. He's my dad's younger brother. About 15 yesterday ago, my dad was imprisoned for sexual crimes against minors. I was the one who turned my dad in so my grandmother was furious with me and was very ugly, making her children choose sides. My uncle chose her. Whatever. I get it. I know I did the right thing so, though it hurt, I've done my best to move on from it. But, having the massively sensitive heart that I do, I still care deeply for this side of my family and I've never stopped loving them, I just accepted that we're not the same. Well, my mom asked if I thought I'd go to the hospital or funeral (if it comes to that). I told her no, that it would only lead to pain and possible drama. I can't help but feel a noticable heaviness now. I'm already mourning. It feels like the years lost and the unfairness, pain, and sadness are bubbling up and consuming my heart. I knew these days would come when these family members that used to be such a huge part of my life would start to pass but I never anticipated it feeling like this. I'm so fucking angry. All of the could have beens and should have beens are flooding my mind. I feel cheated that I can't mourn the way my soul needs, I can't say goodbye, I can't whisper to him that I'm not mad, I understand. I want to tell him that I still love him despite his choices. I'm terrified of the approaching time when my grandmother will too pass. Such a waste. I've dealt with the consequences of my father for over a decade. But this is a blow I wasn't expecting and I'm crushed. I hope I'm able to find a way to grow through this and come out with grace. I just can't help but feeling the impending dread that I know will follow in the years to come. If the potential loss of an uncle who didn't really care for me that I haven't seen in years shakes me this much, how will I not fall apart when the time comes for my grandmother and father?! This one is going to take time. 

If anyone can relate, please, hit me with it! I just want to feel not so alone. I hate going to my mom, brother, and Nanna with these feelings bc it's such a painful and sad subject for them. I can't stand the saddness in their eyes. So I need you, Reddit strangers. "
Feeling burnt out at 23,"Hey guys, long time lurker. I just wanted to know if anyone else feels as burnt out as I do in their early 20s. I don't go to collage. But I work 12 hours a day. I have 2 kids and one on the way. And my relationship is falling apart because I'm mentally and physically too tired to give any sort of enthusiasm. I can't even get excited about things anymore. Not even my kids reaching important milestones. It's come as far as me just being extremely depressed all the time. Even thinking as if it wasn't for the kids I'd take my life. How can I fix this? I'm already on medication for depression. When I talk to my so he doesn't want to hear it. I'm just tired and disgusted with myself. 
Thanks for letting me share. "
I think I found hope,"I wanted to kill myself so desperately a month ago. I still want to do that but I’m not desperate anymore.
The things that changed it for me is I started making money by training and watching dogs.
And My dog is finally a service dog. The only thing that’s bugging me is now I have the money. The one thing that I needed to kms. I have the money to do it, I want to do it, but I want to try and give life another chance.

This has never happened to me throughout the years of my depression, and now I have hope. I didn’t think it was possible for me

If you are struggling like I was, message me. I’ll listen to whatever you have to say.  I know what it’s like to feel hopeless"
i took a handful of pills.,"so last night i had a breakdown over my letting myself be swept and others use me for their benefits (people emotionally take advantage of me because i am the kind of person who listens and helps all the time without asking for anything or bothering them with my problems.) and i couldn't sleep till 4 am. then i fell asleep, woke up, i was feeling so sick that night, like i had fever or sth. i was so mad at someone who is very close to me because i felt like passing out that night and though he knew i was awful he called me and woke me up to talk. (mostly about him.) then in the morning i took a shower, had breakfast like nothing happened. went out for a smoke and then a song came on shuffle which hit me so hard. then i came back to my room, i have sinusitis, so i have a box of pills for that. i got them, like a tablet, cut them in halves (cause they are too big for me to swallow) and i had them one by one. don't know why i did that just suddenly felt the thing for it. it's been 4 hours and i have fever right now, so sleepy, can't move because my body feels so heavy. i don't think it is that serious, what serious is that i don't feel any regret for doing it and actually having thoughts of doing it again. this text makes no sense and sucks sorry. thank you for reading"
Rapist sent me a letter - here's my reply,"You are absolutely right. You, and **you alone**, are responsible for what you did to me.

&#x200B;

Fuck family curses. Fuck the devil. *You made choices.*

&#x200B;

And honestly, even outside of being a child rapist, you were still a terrible “dad”.

&#x200B;

Ya know what you taught me, “*dad*”?

&#x200B;

1. **Only speak when spoken to.** I would ask you questions about things like football games, or your work, or whatever other dumb stuff little kids ask about, and you would tell me to stop bothering you, you were busy. You never had time for me, or for my siblings. Except for times like, when you pulled out a college-level mathematics textbook to show me how stupid I was for not understanding algebra at age 11… because making a kid feel like an idiot is a great way to help them learn, right? Or scolding me for not detailing your car well enough. Or vacuuming wrong. Or whatever other things you wanted to make me feel worthless for. Yeah, you had plenty of time to demean, belittle and yell at all of us. But that was all we ever got from you.
2. **Always fear conflict, and never reach a resolution.** The best \*-and only-\*way to resolve anything is through anger, yelling, and forceful control/ intimidation. Oh yeah, and awkward tension with angry silence that lasts for days until everyone sweeps it under the rug and *avoids, avoids, avoids*.Do you remember the time I wanted roller blades? And how I had to “pay” for them? Even after you left, I would get drenched in sweat asking for things like school clothes or new shoes or really anything. Asking for stuff should not feel like I’m going to war. That’s not normal.
3. **Avoid intimacy.** I don’t hug my friends or family because I hate being touched. I used to shower 2-3 times a day because I always felt dirty. Sometimes when I kiss my husband, the memory of you shoving your vile tongue down my throat pops into my mind and it makes me want to vomit. I would get drenched in sweat if my friends tried to film me, because of that time you tied me up and ejaculated on my face, while filming the whole thing. Oh yeah, and let’s not forget about you threatening me that ***I*** would put my family on the streets if I ever told anyone about your abuse.
4. **You taught me that there’s no way God is real.** If God is all-knowing and all-powerful, then why would he let you use a screwdriver to unlock my door in the middle of the night, sneak into my room and shove your disgusting cock up my ass while I cried into a pillow, begging you to stop?

* Hearing people say, “everything happens for a reason” just makes me want to barf. What “greater purpose” does all of this pain serve? Seriously, I’m asking. I’m supposed to learn to overcome adversity, right? So, living in constant fear of violation is the only way to teach me to be… *what*? Kind, compassionate, empathetic, successful? What on earth is the lesson that I could ***ONLY*** learn from your dick being forcefully inserted into my ass? Or is it that God needed YOU to learn some lesson, that you could only learn from hurting me in that way? Either way, it’s cruel, and I’m calling bullshit.
* I would beg God to make you stop, to let you be a nice dad. And later in life, when I was finally able to address all of the turmoil rotting inside of me, I would ask God why my mom just let it happen. She absolutely knew. Her bedroom was right above mine, and you know I cried loud enough to be heard. I confronted her by pleading, “*Keep that asshole out of my bedroom*”. Later, she and \[redacted\] point-blank asked me if you ever touched me “where a swimsuit covers”. Oh, and the time she asked me to tell the court I was lying. Ha! You two are peas in a pod that way - just selfish. She loved your money, and she loved not having to work, and she was willing to make sacrifices to hold onto that lifestyle.
* God sent me no help, no protection. Just like he lets other **children** suffer and even die. If God is real, and he is all-powerful and all-knowing, then he just doesn’t give a shit. Plain and simple. And why would I respect a God like that?

&#x200B;

Do any of those seem like good things to teach a kid? These are the lessons I’ve had to un-teach myself, painstakingly, over \[redacted\] years. And I’ll never be done unlearning all of that, until the day I die.  But I’m working on it, because now that part is my responsibility. Doesn’t change the fact that I hope this letter makes you uncomfortable as hell. I hope you think about this letter, and it stays with you forever – seeing what you’ve done through my eyes.

&#x200B;

Here’s what I think about your letter. You needed to apologize so that ***you*** felt better. So you could rest a little easier, thinking maybe I’ll forgive you knowing that *you’re proud of me*. Gag. Guess what - I ***live*** in this letter, and these issues ripple through my entire life because of the choices you made. No one put a gun to your head and said, **“Fuck that kid!”** And even if they did, ya take the damn bullet. That’s what a parent does. Or even – that’s what someone who isn’t selfish does.

&#x200B;

You don’t deserve my handwriting.

You don’t get to address my husband by name.

You don’t get to tell me you’re “proud of me”.

You don’t know me, and you don’t deserve to.

We are not pen pals.

Do not ever write to me or contact me again.

So lonely that I'm sorting by new,"I'm fucking miserable... blah blah blah, right? 

Here's the thing. Despite being moderately successful with happy and healthy kids, as well as wonderful partner that has been nothing but supportive.. I managed to fuck it up pretty badly in the space of 10 days. 

The man is still loving and supportive; as well as super worried and super fucking enabling. The kids are ok, but they're starting to notice that Mom is not ok. 

I got into a fight with my stupid, toxic brother last week, and as a result I cut ties with him and my mother. I followed this up by a week of depression naps and binge drinking, and I'm pretty sure I've lost my job. I don't want to go back anyway, but I am worried about putting unnecessary financial strain on our little family. I haven't left the house at all in the past 10 days, and I gave up on my marathon training. I've been living in pajamas, sleeping, forcing myself up to at least cook and clean, and then drinking myself to sleep (the man works nights this week, so it's been worse). 

I know that I have a history of self-sabotage like this, and I've dug myself out of countless holes that I've put myself in over the years. I know that I'll be ok again, and that I just need to pull my head out of my ass and start putting shit back together. I'll get there. It's just that right now, I'm a little lost. "
Follow up,"Last week I made a post about someone who killed themselves who went to my school. It happened again this morning, this time to someone I would consider a friend. In fact I was in the middle of a conversation with him on friday during track, we didnt get to conclude our conversation and we were planning to finish talking today. I just thought I would follow up because its a second suicide in 1 week."
Alcoholic Parents Kicked Me Out,"Last night, my parents (both in their late 40’s) came home extremely intoxicated. My dad went to bed and i was left to deal with my mum who was too drunk to even move or speak. She was laid in her own vomit almost choking and I had to call an emergency ambulance to take her to hospital, in which she returned home in a taxi at 5am.

I’ve been concerned that my parents have had a drinking problem for a while. Im 18 and understand how it can be fun to drink sometimes, but they drink every-night and unfortunately it has now gone too far. Because of this, I approached my grandparents to see if they could help me get my parents to calm down with their drinking problem.  

As i have approached my grandparents regarding this problem, my parents have told me i’m no longer welcome home. I don’t know where to stay and I have little to no savings as i’m working on an apprenticeship and only paid £3.70 per hour. 

Im beyond frustrated with how my parents have reacted, and now i don’t know where to stay. I do not want to become a burden on my other family members by asking to stay with them. I do not know what to do. "
My best friend (and ex) found someone else...,"My best friend, who I dated for 6 months but broke up because of my mental instabilities, has found someone that he's interested. He's a junior, she's a freshman (and a furry with a $4000 fursuit). He's only known her for a month and a half and he said he's been hiding it for a month, meaning it only took two weeks to ""fall in love."" I'm scared. I was always intimate and affectionate with him even after we broke up because that is how I show my love for everyone. Nobody likes when I do it, but he allowed it and it made me so happy. Now that he has found someone, I may not be allowed to do those things and he'll stop hanging out with me as much. I only have 3 close friends and he's my closest, so I don't know what to do..

&#x200B;

Honestly, I hope it only lasts like a month since most high school freshman relationships are like that.

&#x200B;

But what does she have that I don't..? Or maybe he is sick of my depression and having to accommodate for my PTSD (I am very sensitive with my triggers). He found someone like me, but better. My self-esteem is fucked. I've been sick ever since; I already threw up. It's really messing with my health."
Fuck daily mail racist commentors,"It is just terrible. Aside from the racism shown by the daily mail and their asshole agenda, the comment section is full of racist people who comment with nothing but hate and bigotry. Fuck them. It is so toxic. Would they even dare to speak or say this out loud? Or as long as they are hiding behind the screen and the keyboard they are cool?

Fuck them"
Stuck in a cycle of avoiding homework by playing games which then creates even more overdue homework,"So i just need to get this off my chest and out there so i can figure out my feelings and hopefully fix it or get to a better place. 

&#x200B;

The first bit of background information that you need to know is that at the end of last year i had had enough of high school and wanted to move to another program that prepares you for entering the workforce (rather than preparing you for university). Near the start of this year i was convinced to keep going on the path to university but because i went through most of the holidays thinking that i wouldn't, i had ignored all of my holiday homework. 

&#x200B;

Right now im in a lot of trouble (i've caught up with my holiday homework) but im stuck in a really destructive cycle where i have a lot of overdue homework (because instead of doing current homework i had been catching up on holiday homework) which causes me to panic when i think about it which causes me to do things that make me stop thinking about homework and school (namely watching youtube and playing video games) which then in turn gets me to miss even more homework and its just spiraling out of control. 

&#x200B;

Tl;Dr im stuck in a cycle of having overdue homework and playing games to avoid it which in turn creates even more overdue homework. 

&#x200B;

I don't have the motivation to break out of this cycle. Like yeah, i chose to go down the path to university after some convincing but i still don't really value school that much. Like, the only reason i have for doing homework and breaking out of the cycle is so i don't fail school and get even more stressed as my parents and teachers yell at me. 

&#x200B;

Like i find nothing intrinsically good with doing well in school. I just really don't care about school. 

&#x200B;

Everythings fucked up. Like i don't have the motivation to do well in school and im getting stressed about it and my parents get really mad at me. 

&#x200B;

I know to solve this i have to change my mindset but its like, do i really want to?   "
I was upset and fucked up bad by calling a toy dead instead of broken,"My 4 year old son had one of those toys that they take everywhere with them, it was filthy, we played with it together, the thing had a soul (I'm not religious, there's just something about the life a toy takes on when someone gets attached enough to it), it had a personality, a life, and it was my son's little buddy. I had actually gotten attached to the damn thing myself with as much as we played with it. My son is also into hide and seek a lot lately and liked to hide his little friend and have me find him. Earlier today we went to my parents place, we walked into the front gate and off he runs with his little toy. It's a large yard with a fence and locks on the gate at the end of an old road, it's not uncommon for me to walk inside without him for short periods as he plays. A short time later, kid runs in wanting something but I'm making him some food and all, I keep stopping him to make him get ready to eat while he whines that he left the toy outside, wanted to go get him, so ok fine but come right back. 

My dad went out with him and brings back his little toy completely destroyed. My first thought was a dog got it but they have no dog. What I didn't know was that my dad had burned leaves earlier, I didn't know the small fire pit was out there, didn't see it. The toy was burned, it's face burned off, arms and legs melted (because apparently it was synthetic fiber and melted). My dad is pissed and tells me that my son put his toy in the fire pit. My son does have occasional moments of destruction, not often but he is fascinated by things being cut so with my limited information, I thought he literally threw him in fire. I was mad, he'd seemingly intentionally broke his toy without it occurring to him that it was permanent. Again, I'm oddly attached to the toy and I'm upset by this. I told him he broke his toy, he thought I could fix him, I told him again that he broke him, I couldn't fix him. It wasn't seeming to get through to him and that's where I fucked up, I said it was dead. That got through. The kid has absolutely no experience with death but that definitely got through. He immediately began wailing ""he's dead!"", I can't get that image out of my head. He cried uncontrollably for half an hour. Having the toy where he could see it only made him worse (he's one of those kids that gets upset enough to puke, he has no control over it, I have the same problem) so I put him in the trash. That helped but stuff kept needing to be thrown away and he was in the room. He'd begin to calm down but then someone would throw something away, he'd catch a glimpse of him, and begin wailing his name again. 

I eventually found out what really happened. Turns out the fire was out, it was just hot ashes. He knows fire is bad but no idea that the leftover ash can burn and since I didn't see it, he wasn't told to stay away from it. He hid the toy in the fire pit and had come inside to get me to find him like we do in hide and seek. He had never meant to burn the toy, it was a complete accident. If I had gone out to find it when he came in to get me, it probably would have been ok, a bit melty but ok. It was bad enough he lost his little buddy, what kept eating at me was he now thought his friend had died. Don't worry, you don't have to tell me, I know I'm a sub human piece of shit. This is seriously eating at me. I sat in the floor with him for a while hugging him. 

I felt so horrible that I did something I know was a bad idea that will cause problems down the road but I couldn't have him continue to believe his friend died. An hour or so later, I went out and hunted down a copy, dirtied him up a bit, made the toy in the trash disappear, and claimed he healed and wasn't dead after all. This will cause problems later if he ever expects it to happen again but I had to. He's fine now, he fully believed me, he was so shocked to see his friend recovered. I'm not fine though. I still feel sick about it, can't sleep, can't quit coming back to it, seeing it click and hearing him wail ""he's dead!"" keeps playing in my head."
I don’t need social media.,"After so many years of worrying about my image and how many followers/likes I get. I am sick of it. I hate how absorbed I was in Instagram/Twitter/Snapchat ect. I cared more about that than my own personal needs. 

This year I realized that I needed to step out of that bubble of  “this is normal”. 

It wasn’t normal *for me*.

 I was much more happier when I didn’t have social media and I completely forgot about that. 

I want to live in the moment. I don’t want those apps to take control of my life anymore. 

I realized I don’t need them to feel accepted anymore. I don’t need it to feel confident. I am happy with who I am and those apps don’t define me and what I should think. 

I may make a new Snapchat one day but for now, I feel relieved that I deleted it. I feel happy that I removed most of my followers/following on Instagram. 

Thank you for the memories but I am better off without you.

Talked to a cute girl,Made a spit bubble..
How can I get over someone I want to have sex with so bad,"I love my girlfriend so much and I want to spend the rest of my life with her, no doubt about that. I feel guilty for feeling the way I do but I cant help it.

This girl I met a couple of years ago, she was my ex's ex (we are both girls) and I only ever saw a picture of her and she looks absolutely gorgeous like she could totally be a model. Cheekbones, perfect bone structure, nice long hair, beautiful eyes, you get it, she's really hot, like as hot as a photoshopped celebrity with full on makeup expect she doesn't even need makeup. My ex told me bad things about her like how she manipulates people using her looks blah blah, so I didnt have a good opinion of her. 

One day I met her irl and MAN she was fucking stunning. Her ass looked amazing, i was in awe. I met her again a couple of months after, she looked at me like you would look at someone and think ""oh damn this girl is hot"" before she realised who I was. She said hi and she told me she thought I was beautiful as soon as she saw me.

One day we texted each other over something that happened with my ex and my current gf know I find her hot, I told her I was talking to her because I didnt want to hide anything from her. We got along so well, talked everyday and every night for two weeks then this girl started flirting with me and I've never been so turned on in my life. She told me the things she would do to me in bed, I told her I wanted to fuck the shit out of her so bad when I first saw her, pound her with a strap on, eat her out and swallow her juices, I wanted to do everything to her and hear her moan and say my name. 

Then we realised it was wrong to say these things while I was with someone and we stopped talking. 

And now I just cant get her out of my head, I don't want to date her, i don't want to be with her, I dont want love, I just want to fuck her brains out for an entire week. Just book a hotel and all we would do is fuck and eat and drink... but I can't do that and I cant do that to my girlfriend so I just need to get over it. I just don't know how to. "
are you fucking kidding me,"I cried while masturbating because I thought about my ex, what the fuck is this level of heartbreak?"
I want to find out whar i am,"Before i start this i want to apologize for my English 
So im 18 male and have a male friend thats turning 18 in a few months
The thing is i just want to know am i gay ? Am I straight? What am i ? Whats wrong with me?? Ive been thinking about this for months and i feel im exploding, i feel im not normal because of this feeling that i have.
Ive been with this friend of mine for about 5 years. We met in school and we started studying math in our high school ( my country's system is a little bit wierd ) but then this year, he changed from math to humanistic, i was really shocked when i found this out. Well he isnt in the same class that im in anymore, it was a little bit hard at the beginning but kind aok the more it went on.
In this 5 years i never felt this thing i felt in this last year. I feel something weird, awkward, idk maybe stupid
I feel so connected to him
I started feeling the need of him so much that it started hurting me.
I see him way different from my other friends, its like i..... love him, IDK 
I have this feeling that i need to talk to him every day, i skip my stuff to see him sometimes or even play with him online.
It feels so good when im spending time with him, i just love the time we spend.
 in school we usually see each other after every class or in the lunch time, we talk at those times and online on social media apps and stuff. The thing i feel is wierd, is that i do awkward stuff to be with him or to do something for him, as i said i skip my important stuff that i have to do for the day or i cut my studying to do something he asked for help in and even if it takes alot of my time, i always help him no matter what. These few days i felt even more awkward, when he smiles, i just look at him and he is so goddamn cute, idont know why i love his smiles, its so awkward i never felt somthing like this, my other friends started calling me gay because of the attention im giving to him, and i dont know what i am, am i gay just because i like his smiles and like to talk to him and help him no matter what ??? But i dont see the interest of homosexuality in myself, i dont like to have sex or anything like that with the same gender as myself, i cant think or imagine that kind of stuff.
One of my friends doenst call me gay but told me to stop, he said youre caring for him likes He is your girlfriend or something.
Idk nothing, i just like spending my tike with him, and the thing is he doesnt kinda feel the same about me, i mean i dont see alot of interest from his side to me as a friend, he once told me i have too much feelings and he isnt like me he said he has cold feelings and cant be the same i am to him, im just confused
My brain hurts everytime i think about this stuff
Im sorry if the text was long and badly wrote, im not good at writing either. Would be great if anyone could help me"
Would I be stupid for even considering going to college after 3 separate failed attempts?,"So I’m stuck right now. I’m 28 years old am just about to start working a new job. It’s got good hours, and it’s close to the local community college in my town. Of course getting off at 3pm, the idea of going to college is tempting me a lot. 

The only reason I would even want a college degree is to be a teacher, which is somewhat weird because I was a horrible student. And I mean horrible. I failed ALL my freshman and sophomore classes of high school. So I had to go to an alternative school. I don’t know what it was, but that year and a half of independent studies was great for me! I made up all my failed classes, and was able to return to my high school for the 2nd half of my senior year. I was able to graduate and best of all I actually got accepted to a 4 year university. I went to said school and I failed, hard! I got so damn lazy and unmotivated that I failed each of my 5 classes. I left after one semester and moved back home, got a shitty retail job. Went to the community college, got an A in 2 classes and for whatever reason I decided to quit my job and attended full time the following semester. Failed hard, another 5 F’s on my transcript. 

Rinse and repeat for a 3rd failed attempt. thus far my transcript is like 2 A’s and like 13 F’s and 3 W’s.

So am I stupid to even consider going to school? I want to succeed so bad. I’m 28 and I’m not going to get any younger! Should I give up all hope and accept my fate in retail? "
I can't live in my own skin,"I hate social anxiety, I can't even talk to my family anymore without wondering what if I look like a fool. What to do with my hands, am I making too much eye contact. And to top it off I finally met a girl but all of the judgement from people almost makes me not even wanna talk to her. I wish I could just be normal "
Im afraid,"Im on my fifith year of med school and i have my last 3 subjects ive already failed on both medicine 2 and ginecology, im tired and afraid that im gonna turn into a shitty doctor, im afraid that im failli g my mother wich gave me the opportunity im feeling sad and bad and due to frustration i cant focus and study for my test tomorrow, im honestly tired and sad due to the fact that i shot my gpa on the foot because of 2018 being the shittiest year for me."
I hold a deep anger for the man at my apartment complex that saw and heard me screaming and kicking to try to get out my abusive boyfriend’s cars he was threatening to kill me.,"One night me and my ex-boyfriend were fighting in the parking lot of our apartment complex and a tall man in a red shirt approached the car parked next to us. My ex had just threatened to drive off a mountain with me and him in the car and I was trying to get out of the car. I had opened the door and I was kicking and screaming for help but my ex was holding me by the hair and neck so I could not move. I saw the man out of the corner of my eye and I knew this was my escape. I had tried so many times to escape the relationship but the abuse was so hidden and private it was hard. I thought the man would call the cops. He would finally be arrested. The man walked up to his parked car. He looked like he was avoiding looking but he did a small glance and I caught him. I know not doing something in the moment exact moment could have been out of fear for his own life, which I understand. He could have called the cops after he drove away, he could have been anonymous. I suffered abuse for long after that I could not escape and still am being harassed. He could have been arrested and I would not have this constant fear everyday. I hold a deep anger for him because my life could have changed in that moment. . I do not blame him but I do think about him everyday. I wonder if he feels bad. I wonder if he thinks about it. "
Better?,"We are now challenging each other to leave nature better than we find it. I have another challenge: leave people better than how you found them. Stop ghosting, treating each other horribly, and creating additional baggage. "
I'm getting older,"I'm on break from university and have been catching up with old friends from my hometown and I can't believe how fast we are all growing up. Soon we will all have jobs and adult lives, everyone is changing, and I know it'll never be the same as it used to be. I miss all the fun times I had with them in high school, the times we played sports together, stayed up on ps4 all night, got food, and the parties. I wish I could go back and relive the past few years of my life, and I'm so sad its changing so fast. I know people grow apart naturally if you don't see each other as often, but its hard for me to accept that it'll never be the same again. Now I'm home by myself and I feel nostalgic and lonely. Not sure what to do feeling like this, it never hit me this hard"
I recognize every new person I get introduced to,"Lately(2019) every single time I'm introduced to a stranger, and I get a chance to look at them clearly, it always feels like I've seen them before.

Usually strangers are just strangers but I can't shake off this gut feeling.

What could be happening, my mind playing tricks on me? Or have I at age 27 started tapping into frequencies of some sort?

This only happens when they are introduced to me, not a random stranger walking down the street. "
Lost and Advice MUCH needed please.,"I’m a 18 year old, I’m currently at a loss right now and I need advice I’ve been struggling to figure out what’s the point in life I’ve been suicidal for about 6 years now. It’s just getting worse. Currently I haven’t graduated school due to being pulled out because in my parents words “i won’t amount up to anything and won’t do anything useful in life.” After I got pulled out of Highschool I was forced to work where they worked at. At the job I worked at I got sexually harassed multiple times. And almost sexually assaulted. But thankfully I didn’t . I tried to tell my parents but I couldn’t. Since the time I told them I was raped by my moms brother they called me a liar so since then I’ve been keeping everything inside until now. It’s too overbearing for me to keep everything inside. I just want to graduate but i don’t know how to get back into Highschool I’m scared of going back and being told I can’t anymore I don’t know what to do I’m just tired and feel like i want to just end it all I really feel like i have no purpose or will to live it’s so hard. I’m just very scared and lost. Please if anyone can guide me to links where I can actually start going to school or at least give me some advice I would really much appreciate it. "
Dad,"My dad and I got in argument the other day. It was mostly my fault, and I know I shouldn't have pushed the issue. Things got heated fast. He started calling me names, I called him names back. After that, he grabbed me by the neck, pushed me down, and kicked me. He hadn't done anything like that in years. In that moment, I was so scared. I didn't do anything, just screamed. A couple hours later, he was crying and told me he was sorry and how he was just stressed out and didn't need that on top of everything else. I forgave him, but it's been bringing up memories of the past. I feel as if I don't have the right to be upset though, considering that he's always tried his best to raise me. I just wish everything felt better."
I just want to be happy.,Just once. I’m tired of being miserable all the time.
"For once in my life, I'm happy","I don't know where else I could possibly put this, but I'm so fucking stoked! I proposed to my girlfriend last night (singing my last name from deirks Bentley at a karaoke night of all things) and she said yes! 
I've had moments of happiness in my life, but I've never felt this good before!

Sorry about the gushyness, I just had to scream it from the rooftops! "
I miss my ex girlfriend so much,"3 years ago I moved into the apartment I’m in now. I was looking for rooms for rent near our town’s college. One of my new roommates was another girl who I quickly befriended and we began doing everything together. Groceries, walking my dog, going to the school to work on stuff. Etc. Eventually a year later our feelings came out and we both admitted to having crushes for the entire year we lived together. We began dating. It was great. She’s literally perfect for me mentally and physically. But by the end of a year and a bit she thought she wasn’t enough for me and I deserved better. This broke me since it was my first serious relationship. 

After a few months I started seeing a guy. This guy was perfect but after a couple months he became too clingy and smothering. So I let him go. All while still living with my ex and remaining best friends. She began seeing someone else and this started to hurt me. I felt like I wasn’t allowed to be upset or hurt because I too saw someone else since dating each other. But I’m done with my guy and she’s not done with hers. 

Although she says she has no plans of seeing him in a romantic way, it still hurts when they walk in the door together unannounced. One of the rules of our apartment is that we warn each other when someone is going to come over. But he often comes over without warning.. 

We still do things together like grocery shopping and hanging out in the living room and watch movies until 5 am. It’s like we’ve gone back to the year before we dated. But like that year, I feel like I have a crush again. I feel like I’ve gotten over it and rebuilt the same old feelings I had before. And it hurts me to look at her and know I had my shot and it didn’t work out. Because I still love her with my entire heart... "
I don’t have anybody to talk to so,"My backstory
Me and my gf were had been dating about 2 years before we broke up a little bit ago. We had a good relationship and had gone through a lot with each other but the last few months of being together I had wave of depression that made it hard to do things. Leaving bed, eating, showering, my overall health in general wasn’t too good and it had pretty big impact on us.  She would get upset at not being able to fix how I was feeling and would stay up crying night after night for it.  After a while i realized how much happier she’d be if the thought of helping me wasn’t a thought so I found an excuse to break up with her.   She had been showing my friend explicit pics, which by itself was fine in our relationship but circumstances made this time different. 

fast forward a little while and she has a new bf and she’s living her best life, and I’m so happy she is, all while I’m struggling to breathe lol.   Last night she made a post about how she’s glad she got past her “toxic” relationship and had moved on and was happier for it.    Her tweet went semi viral, and has been floating around town. The wording of her tweet made it seem like she had gotten out of a very abusive relationship, which has now earned me the title of abuser.  And I’ve started getting emails sent to my manager about me being grossly abusive.  Idk I’m used to not being liked and insults being thrown around me but an abuser? It’s just not me 

Idk, I think I’m just waiting on some magical force to make this come and give me hope again"
An irrarional fear of being stolen from again.,"I've been having this feeling ever since the girl I was courting fell for my best friend. 

Technically, nothing is stolen in the first place but I felt cheated. All the effort to get her and then boom, it went to a really bad ending of me not even handling looking at my then best friend in the eyes and be alright with it. I know I tried. 

And now that we sorta made up after half a year, and I can't get this feeling off my chest everytime he sends me a screenshot of some random thing we could be talking about, but it shows that he's been talking with a mutual friend of ours (chat head for Facebook Messenger, for example).

I know it's a pointless thought but I can't seem to shake off the feeling. Feels like I'm one step away to getting another friend of mine cheated from me. I'm aware that my paranoia will only get the last laugh here, cuz what I could do to win that friend over to my side could probably serve the opposite of what I want.

I developed a kind of inferiority complex to this as well. This sucks."
"My own mom ditching me at the bank and claimed that I stole her money, the same money she gave me","This happened back when I was about 15/16 and I dont have the best memory, so the details are a little muddy or just arent there at all.

But basically, my mom took me to the bank cus there was an account she had opened up for me years ago and it was time to hand it over to me, with money in it as well. Again, I cant remember exact stuff, but the guy helping us told us that the policies the bank had would mean that I would be charged fines unless I did 1 of 3 things with that account.

1. Have at least 1500 in the account.  
I had no job at the time and the account only had about 500 in it at the time.
2. Use it at least 10 times a month. Didn't need to be big purchases, just needed to use it.  
Couldn't do that either as I wanted to save the money and I also am not a big spender or someone who spends money a lot, just when I need to.
3. Or Spend at least (insert large amount cus I cant remember) a month.  
Again, not a big spender and I wanted to save the money.

So the guy told us that the best bet would be for me to just pull all of the money out of the account and close the account before I could get fined for it. Now, my mom had signed the account over to me, even knowing all of this info, even after I had told her what I planned on doing (closing the account and taking the money). So now the account is mine, legally, its in my name and the money that was put into it, is also mine, and this was explained and reminded to her before she signed, and she signed it over. But, for some reason, she got pissed when I agreed to close the account and take the money.

And oh boy, she starts screaming and yelling at me, yelling about how I'm stealing her money and throwing insults at me and the guy, and bla bla bla. All of this in the fucking bank. Everyone is looking at us. I dont care, tuned her out, the guy finished up and handed me the check for the money, and I got in line.

The entire time I'm in line, my mom is screaming at me and trying to pull the check out of my hands, saying how its her check, her money, and no one told her that this would happen. I did try talking to her a few times, but stopped after the 3rd or 4th try when she continued to just scream. I just apologized to everyone around me though.

Finally, when I was next in line, she just left. At first, I thought she had left to go simmer or boil in the car, but nope. Once I cashed the check and went outside, her car was gone. She ditched me. Me, a 16 year old girl, at the bank. Yes, I could have just walked home, but um... yeah no, I aint walking home alone at the age of 16 and being a girl. I've seen the news and heard the stories. I might joke about craving death but I refuse to let it happen on any terms that arent my own.

So I call my dad, told him what happened, and he was pissed (not at me, at her) and came over and picked me up. When we got home, my mom was waiting there and was even more mad.

Mom: ""You told your father on me?!""  
Me: ""You ditched me at the bank.""  
Mom: ""I was gonna come pick you up later, I just needed to calm down.""  
Me: ""And how long were you gonna leave me there huh?"" It had been at least 30 minutes from the time I went outside, called my dad, waited for him, and got home.  
Mom: ""Oh so now you're saying that I'm a terrible mother?!""  
Me: ""Yeah, you are. You ditched me!""  
Mom: ""And you stole my money!""  
Me: ""It was my money! You signed it off to me!""  
Mom: ""I didn't know that you were just gonna steal it!""  


this went on for a while, a long while. Now I'm 20, turning 21, and she still claims that I was the one who stole money from her... despite the fact that she had stolen money from me before. Back when I was like 10, she stole 60 dollars from me. I saved up change and kept it in this crayon coin bank, that I still have, and while I was gone at school, she stole 60 dollars. And then claimed it was for groceries, but then I asked her why the kitchen was still empty if she had just bought groceries (long story short, my parents divorced and I went back and forth at the time, but stayed with her mostly cus... I dont know? BS reasons? whatever). She then yelled at me for talking back and admitted that she back cigarettes instead. When I asked for the money back, she just used the whole ""I'm the parent, you're the child"" bs that I hate so much.

I am never seeing that 60 dollars... and honestly its less about the money now, and more about the principle. I mean, she stole from her own child, AND from a 10 year old, for cigarettes. So fucking low. She also claimed that she didn't have a smoking problem and could stop anytime. Yeah, no. Even as a child, I knew that was bs."
I GOT ACCEPTED INTO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL!!!!,"I am so shocked. I’m finally accepted into Cornell University. I never thought I’d make it to an Ivy. Since freshman year of high school I have worked my ass off in and out of the classroom, even going to Cornell during the summers of the past to meet with professors and admissions counselors so often to where they know me on a first name basis. Everyone told me to aim lower but I really reached for this and I made it. Considering that I am from a really small town in Upstate New York where no one moves farther than an hour away and almost always goes to a Community College I am astounded. This feels great especially as a half Native American boy off of the reservation I can proudly say I made it out of the little dead end town that consumes everyone in it. This is truly a miracle. God Bless. "
I HATE TALKING TO MY BEST FRIEND,"Initially I hate casual texting, I only text ppl to tell them smthn. But my best friend doesn't get that and I think I used to be more chill about it but recently I've been through things that made me more mature and this made me absolutely despise casual texting and therefore I hate texting her and I would rather talk to other ppl.
What bothers me more is that she gets super mad when I don't reply to her but I just don't want to text her anymore."
I expect so much from people,"I’m a girl and I play video games. My friend list is very short with dudes I met in middle and high school but I wouldn’t consider them close friends, just people that I once knew and they cared enough to ask me and add me there. 

I’m also a very lonely person. I rarely go out of my house (I dropped out from university and I’m now waiting on a response from an application) and it’s been like this for more than a year. Also, I’m very bad at socialising and I have struggled with depression for years.

ANYWAY, I always play alone, mostly because I always play single player games, but I have been playing this online game for some time and I have seen people from my friend list playing it but never played together. Online games are a lot more fun with friends but I manage to have fun by myself.

So one day this person from my friend list joins my game and I was super surprised because we haven’t talked in years but I was excited because I was going to play with someone. He’s a really sweet person and I always loved his company. I was very happy to have talked to him and catch up with the years. After some games we said our goodbyes and he said “let’s play tomorrow” and I was sooo happy because I enjoyed playing with him so much.

Next day, he didn’t join my game. He always appears offline because he told me he was avoiding playing with some friends so I never know when exactly to log in, therefore I was online for most of the day but he never appeared. 
I did the same the rest of the week but nothing. I went to his profile and saw some activity from previous days so he has been there but never said anything. 

I know it’s stupid, he has friends he plays with and I understand that someone like me is not as important as them but I just can’t stop feeling so sad about it. Maybe I annoyed him and doesn’t want to play with me and avoids me like his other friends. 

It’s something so small but I cried a lot one day thinking I have no one that cares about me and I’m never going to be important to someone. I tend to expect greetings from a person I talked to the previous day thinking a friendship could start but if they don’t do it I just stay away because maybe the conversation didn’t mean anything to them and don’t want the same as I do. So I avoid them to not bother them and I knooooow it’s rude from anyone else’s point of view but to me it would be rude to talk to someone that doesn’t show interest in it.

It’s so messed up I push people away and it just makes me feel so down. I expect so much from people when I don’t even know what to do myself and it always ends up hurting only me."
I feel so detached from those around me.,"I look around and cant identify with anyone I meet. 

I can't truly feel like I fit in. 

I look at my conversations with everyone from outside my own body. 

I am not like them 

I think differently, I analyze and I observe. 

I am different. I am not like them. "
Ever had an emotional attachment to a place you frequent?,"There's this cheap buffet restaurant near my place. Every time they'd advertise their restaurant on Facebook, many people would comment complaining about the food or how it sucks compared to expensive restaurants. While customers have the right to complain about terrible food, I think their complaint is harsh and unreasonable.

They are spot on that it's not quality food, but if you take into consideration the price and location of the restaurant - ...well, there's not much to expect, duh? It's like buying a $2 spaghetti and expecting it to taste like fine-dining quality spaghetti. Stupid, right? That's exactly 90% of the comments, ""BUT IT DOESN'T TASTE LIKE [insert well known buffet restaurant here]."" It's fucking stupid.

You get what you pay for. It's decent food *for its price*.

Business was booming during their early days. As I frequented the restaurant through the months that passed by, I saw lesser and lesser customers. I frequented the place too much the staff and the owner knew me by face. Instead of the usual ""thank you for coming"", I get an ""oh, you're back again! Welcome back!""

Observing this business from its diapers and up to its present status is... sad. The owner and his staff who used to be cheery and accommodating people gradually grew sadder. I can see the utter frustration on the owner's face and demeanor worsening every time I return - he knows his business is failing. They try all strategies, try new dishes and drinks, basically do fuck all to save the business but nothing fucking works.

Last time I dined there, I was the only customer within three hours. I didn't get a ""welcome back!"" Instead, the owner looked at me with a depressing face and said, ""Bring some friends, yeah?"" Almost as if begging me, the desperation in his voice holy shit. The second floor of the restaurant that used to accommodate customers had been very much unused for too long they turned it into a stock room. 

Sometimes I want to approach the owner, offer him some advice on how he can better his business but I'm too socially anxious to do so. *Their food is decent for its price.* It's a decent fucking restaurant. The owner was just very unlucky with his choice of location and the type of crowd the restaurant attracted. I am willing to bet if he relocates the business somewhere else - its second life would be much more brighter.

I keep thinking one of these days I'll pass by that restaurant and see it finally closed. Then, I'd pass by again for the next couple days and I'll never see it ever open again. I miss their food already, as well as the staff. Never socialized much with the staff, but as an observer, it's like I saw their entire story play out right before my eyes it's fucking sad."
"Am I egocentric about this ""friendship"" or there's something wrong with my friend?","It's a little weird because it seems like a movie, but lets go...

I have (or maybe ""had""?) a friend, she have 23 and was really naive and child-like, but it was her charm, she was really fun to have around

She had alot of toxic friends who allways depreciated her work (she is a artist (draw)), she always talked to me about how she hated them and couldn't cut laces with their friendship (I always listened her problems, I am this kind of friend)

I know who are those friends and they are really toxic, I had a friendship with some of them and with time I cut laces because they were really toxic (They had this kind of ""I gonna put you down so I can stay on top"" attitute)

Then, one they out of nowhere she talked to me how she hated them and how she will ""Leave the internet for 6 months to train and don't talk to anyone"" (Like an anime(???)) to ""Show them how she is better""

I'm an artist, and for me, this is BS, you don't train like that (with art), I even asked some other friends (artists too) that said that was weird. But ok

Some weeks/months passes and she kind of stop talking to me, the only ""contact"" I have to her is when she send me a wallof text about some stuff and leave (without letting me talk to her)

One of her last wall of texts said that she is still talking (in a group chat) with her ""friends"" and how she always try to put them down and kick them when they fail in something

Today she sent a message saying ""Next week I have time for you, want to play 'Game I don't play anymore'? "", and when I said that I don't play this game anymore she simply said ""Then I will sleep""

I feel like a kicked dog and I don't even know why, I feel like she choose her ""Toxic and horrible friends"" (her words) over me. Not only that, I noticed she started to turn like one of them (She trying to make people feel bad wasn't part of her personality) and that make me don't want to talk to her (even she don't letting me do it)

Now we have this strange relationship where I don't talk to her and she  occasionally  send me walls of text about things I really don't care (Like how she's playing this ""new incredible game"") and I can't even talk like a normal person to her anymore

I don't feel like blocking her but I'm starting to not respond... I don't now... I feel like ""Die like a hero or live long enough to become the vilain"" works here"
How do I know if a have depression or I’m just being a dumb edgy teen looking for attention,I have no idea please help. I’ve been asking myself for like 4 years
My partners uncle cooked our vegetarian christmas food in duck fat last year.,"My partner and I are both now vegan but at the time of this, had been vegetarian for a long time.



It finally happened to me. My boyfriend kept telling me about people who spike vegan food with animal products purely out of spite, I didn't believe him at first because I couldn't see how someone would feel the need to violate another person's rights in that way. We had another family get together with his side of the family recently. His uncle is one of the most stubborn, egostistical, close minded people I have ever encountered. We are frequently putting up with comments mocking our diets. Just this last time he showed up with grade 9 Wagyu beef and told us ""it's vegan because it was grass fed"". I left the room to talk to his sister about it because I had no idea how to approach the situation. It's like, how do you get someone to see how rude they're being when they literally can't accept anyone else making changes to their lives that differ to theirs. This guy would never show any respect to your point of view.

As it turns out, my bfs sister's partner was informed by the very same uncle that, the secret to his vegetarian dishes last christmas, was duck fat. He could've cooked it in butter, maybe added an egg, nah, pure duck fat. I'm disgusted obviously but what I'm more appalled at, is that he sees that as an appropriate way to treat his family and potential in-laws. The only time I've had any conversation with the man, is when he's ""making jokes"" about my diet. And I've been around this family for at least 2 years already. 

Don't agree with my way of life, have an opinion on it, whatever. But DO NOT shove the very thing I've ever so kindly communicated my unease for, down my throat. I don't treat him that way, I'd expect the same treatment back.

TLDR: Partners pain in the butt uncle gave us duck fat last christmas by cooking our food in it. Feel appalled that this is what people are doing to each other."
He’s going to move on get married and have children with someone that isn’t me. That actually makes me feel so physically sick,I thought I was doing alright 
All my friends are depressed,"So I have a group of about 5 friends, we all consider eachother as close as family and call eachother brothers. The thing is though, they're all depressed, anxious and self conscious. So am I. But I hold it all in, I pretend to be strong and act like everything's fine. I do it all for them, they all need someone who isnt fucked to help them out and I try my absolute best to do that while dealing with my own issues, but this past week has taken its toll on me. I feel like the most useless person ever. This week 2 of them attempted suicide. Last Wednesday one of them tried cutting real deep and overdosing, it was too late for the cuts but I managed to talk them out of overdosing. The other friend tried to attempt suicide earlier today, I got a call telling to go check on them and I hauled ass over there to convince them not to. I try so hard to be strong for them, to support them and to be the best possible friend I can. I feel so useless and worthless cause obviously my best is not enough. I feel like it's my job as their friend to make them happy and not even have those thoughts at all. "
How I've been lately.,"I've been on the verge of suicide lately. Just casually thinking of ways I could die in a moment.

I've been depressed since I was 8. Been suicidal since I was 13. I'm going to be 26 in a little under 2 weeks.

I have medication and I've been taking them. But lately the stress of it all has been really getting to me.

I signed up to help my best friend get his shit together after his GF of 10 years broke up with him. He's a mess. Moved in to a new place. He's unemployed. I don't earn enough to pay rent by myself.

We've already had a threat for eviction. I'm scared for my well being. It's been 7 months and he's still unemployed. He's had 2 jobs but watch lasted about 2 weeks each.

I don't know how to deal with everything. I feel so overwhelmed. I just want everything to stop so I can breathe.

I just want it all to end."
I seriously don't see a point in living anymore.,"As the title says, I rly don't want to live anymore.
I've been struggling with depression and anxiety for like 7 months. I just feel like worthless trash and even every good and positive memory I have,  seems more worth to forget it and just end my miserable life. I hate everything about me and the only reason I didn't kill myself yet, is that people around me would be traumatized and scarred for life I guess. I guess you could call this a cry for help. I don't know where to go to, my friends can't be here for me, same as my parents. I don't even know what to write anymore but I just have to at least have some contact with a person who has time for my bs. "
My girlfriend is resorting to alcohol.,"My girlfriend is resorting to alcohol so she can forget about her grandmothers passing, what should I do? She's 16 and I'm also 16."
My best friend and I stopped being friends. I don’t believe my current friends love me. I feel depressed when alone.,"I am not diagnosed with depression. I am constantly seeking validation, I am not insecure. I am always sad when I’m alone. I get so sad when I’m not at school even tho I hate school but social interactions keep me happy. 

I lost my best friends as we had a fallout. Both of us agree on the fact that we WERE like soulmates. However I’ve been depressed about the fact that we broke up platonically since 2018 Feb, and I’ve been sinking into being depressed and crying to sleep, having mental breakdowns on not being enough for her every month. We agreed on skyping every weekend in Feb 2019c but I realised it’s me who initiates the calll everytime. She seems like she’s not at all interested anymore. She’s just trying to pacify me and I think she’s sick of me. I tried not initiating the call this weekend, it’s now Monday. She has not texted me. She has not initiated a call. She claims that she misses being my friend but I don’t think she does and it’s hurting me more than before, because she gave me hope and now she stuffed it into the fucking bin like I’m nothing.

My current friends, they distract me. I’m like Robin Williams. I’ll like to call myself funny. I make jokes and I smile so much in school to make everyone happy even though there’s a voice telling me everyone hates me and I’m not wanted. I try to be funny and happy and when people laugh I really feel good inside.

However I found out mt current friends have their own group chat, without me. Not surprising, since they were friends last 3 years before meeting me last year. However, for some reason this has struck a deep chord inside of me. I cannot seem to believe that I am a friend of theirs. Because I am excluded. It is not a right thought, I hate myself for it. I believe they do love me. I will not say I love them as much as I love my ex best friend. But without them I will lose any social interactions. I am tired. I am toxic because I know I will give them up, if I can get my ex bff back.

I also daydream so many things, of me dying and so my ex bff will know. Of my ex bff being hurt so she will understand when I say I feel like hurting everyone who hurt me, and that she didn’t fight back for me. I feel like screaming at her until she cries. I imagine her hugging me. I imagine her loving me.

I really, don’t know what to do anymore. I’m tempted to just chop my hair off as a symbolism of getting rid of this emotional baggage. I suspect myself having depression and OCD. My parents will not allow me to see a therapist. I am 16 this year.  I hurt all over. I just want her to care. I just want someone to care. Someone to ask me if I’m okay when I say goodbye instead of goodnight. I’m sorry i’m not good enough. "
"I just listened to a stranger dump their anti-climate change views on me, and I hate that I didn't call them out on it.","I always let these things happen, and don't say anything about it. I'm hitting golf balls with my dad, and the owner was walking around, and starts talking about the weather to us. Within about 60 seconds he equates weather to climate, and then starts talking about Hawaiian volcanoes and that they are the reason weather gets warmer, not man made climate change.  

I literally did not say a single thing because I just can't handle stupid. I really wish I would have just told that guy he is dumb. I didn't ask to talk to him. I didn't ask him about his views. I wish I had just told him that all of his ideas are proven false, and could be easily shown if he actually researched them, instead of watching TV.  

He also told me that Beto O'Rourke thinks that the world is going to end in 12 years. I googled it, and found the op-ed that he read, which contains no facts of any kind, just shit some guy made up. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!"
I don't want to do drugs anymore.,"I don't know why. I'm just writing this. A little bit hungover. Hey, this sub is called off my chest so I might as well get something off my chest. 

&#x200B;

I'm beginning to realise the extent of my problems with alcohol and drugs; since coming to university my use has vastly increased and I'm starting to get concerned. I think it might be time to get off this strange merry-go-round and pursue sobriety. However, every time I tell myself this, after every pointless night out, after every mildly enjoyable but costly cocaine high, after smoking any weed if it's available, after every silly psychedelic experience and after every last bit of my savings spent on alcohol, I can't stop.  


Cocaine happens at least once a week: half a gram each time.   
Alcohol, I mean it's gotta be at least £30-50 a week.   


It took me a lot of effort to get into this university. It's a really good university. I'm in my early 20s and I took this step to eventually get into a legal profession some day. I find it so hard to stop any of this because:  
a) I have the savings from a few years of work to afford this lifestyle.   
b) I'm on track to pass this year with flying colours. 

&#x200B;

I think a major problem is the company I keep; one of my 'friends' is definitely an addict. He owes me 100 quid for coke (like he's gonna pay me back) and I'm always buying him drinks because he can't afford it after buying more cocaine/junk food. Got fired from his job for turning up fucked up after drinking all day and using the excuse that he's a catholic and its Paddy's day. Then got a fine from the police? I feel like this has solidified to me the fact that he is an absolute moron.  I think I'm being used. How do I stop? How do I get out? I have a family history of mental illness, my dad suffers from schizophrenia and I spent a lot of last year looking after him, I should not be doing any of this. I've seen first hand what mental illness can do to people's lives and it makes me so sad to see such a proud, confident man completely destroyed by delusions. I don't wanna put any more of a burden on my family if I'm potentially susceptible to something similar.   


I was tripping last night and I've never felt more alone: watching romantic interests that I fucked up move on, being separated from anyone who truly knows me back home and wasting my savings on coke an booze. 

&#x200B;

Recently I've become better friends with someone who's been encouraging me to go the gym and I've been studying with them; they've really helped me out and I genuinely appreciate them. I forgot how much I enjoyed the gym and I love the natural high from the endorphins, I'd love to get back into it. A bit cliche but I think it would be a good replacement for all the other shit. I've tried to be light-hearted about things: 'you're just having a good time', 'it's the university experience', 'yolo etc...' but nah man, this doesn't vibe with me. I have a bit of a reputation as being high all the time and it doesn't feel great.  


I want to stop, I want to get off the ride. How do I do that? Am I just being a drama queen? Should I be concerned?"

Extremely long as this has been bugging me for a year 

You know when we first met I always thought that I’d never be friends with you. You were extremely outgoing and talkative while I was more shy and reserved. I didn’t want to to talk to you actually. I hated you because of how talented you were. You could easily just pick up a random instrument and learn it that day and be as a good as a person whose been playing for at least three years. You played piano better than I could ever dream of and I’ve had played for three years. I hated how easily you got along with upperclassmen. I hated everything about you until one day when second semester started. You switched instruments again just because you could and that instrument you played forced you to end up right next to me. I tried forcing you to sit with you friends far away from me as possible but the instructor had not allowed that to happen so the next day you were next to me. I tried to avoid talking to you putting up my walls like I’ve done to everyone else but somehow your energy and aura that you gave off just hit me and soon we were talking everyday. We talked about the most random things, mostly you showing me your meme account or just you showing me memes in general to my cats. There was one time after marching practice, you were walking with your friend and you said something stupid like wanting to hug everyone because you were in such a good mood, you turned and looked at me as I was walking with my friends behind you. We stared at each other for a small bit before I sighed and said “Fuck it, come here.” Your beautiful blue and green eyes lit up and you face showed so much happiness as you ran to me and squished me into a hug. It was at that point that I fell for you. I didn’t know you but I did at the same time. From that day on you were always touching me. Whether it was just you poking my arm to you straight out holding my hands, I started to become addicted to your touch. I’d always compare my hand size to your just so I can have an excuse to touch or and tell you my anxiety was bad so I can just squish you hand to see your slightly pink hands change to white then back to it’s normal pink hue. Then after a couple of months I got my first hamster. My full intentions were to name my hamster, Ron, as it was a joke I’ve made to my friend because Ron is such a dumb name for a hamster, but you messaged me on Snapchat saying to name it Gravy as it was around thanksgiving. I said no and told you that was stupid but you just got offended and said that you were calling my hamster Gravy no matter what I tell you. So I just gave up and you proceeded to send me a picture of your Bitmoji dabbing over a turkey for like 10 minutes straight until you told me goodnight. That was the first time we actually texted each other. From that point on, I would send you pictures of my hamster so we had another thing to talk about. We’d see each other everyday and my feelings grew but not as much as I wished they had in the beginning. I feel now that I would’ve had a better chance with you then then I would ever have now but that’s besides the point. Around this time I was extremely insecure and sad so I would take any attention that I could get from anyone no matter how disgusting that person was. There was a senior who I had now learned only got with freshmen bc nobody else would get with him as he was extremely cringey as he was really into music and because of how judgmental he was. He was one of the few upperclassmen I could talk to during summer and I was really close to him as I met him before you. Like I had mention before about how I would want attention from anyone, I would always stay near him. He distracted me from you and I thought I actually had feelings for him until he started dating this one other freshmen girl I had disliked. I honestly cannot believe that I had cried over him. I could’ve done so much better than him and I know that. He was such a toxic person as he wouldn’t let me hangout with people who are now my closest friends. I moved on from him and went for someone else but you were always in the back of my mind. You on the other hand was dating this really weird crackhead. It’s weird to think that such an amazing person like you could go out with someone like that. So you guys dated for a while  until she started to become weird and obsessive over you. I thought that was the reason you broke up with her but it turns out she cheated on you with that nasty senior. That was the first time your trust was broken wasn’t it? I’m so sorry you had to go through that but I feel like that wasn’t what broke you. My friends were making something for their section leader and I was invited to go to the library and help because everyone else was inviting people and my best friend was unsure about the other people that were going so of course I went. I got dressed up, I don’t know why I wanted to look nice but I subconsciously knew it was because of you. So I ended up arriving at the library and turns out all the other invited people didn’t make it so it was kinda awkward to why I was there. So it was me my best friend and two other people. She was there, I knew her from middle school and she used to date my closest friend from middle school. She asked while it was quiet if it was normal to like you and my first response was to say no. And I looked straight at my best friend because she knew I had feelings for you. Fast forwarding a couple days later I hear from my best friend that you had asked that girl out. It hurt. It hurt a lot more than I thought it would. I tired to move on as it was only fair because she had gotten close to you and knew more about you. Plus she was ten times prettier than I’d ever be so I just let it happen. I would see you and her hugging and it would just hurt over and over. This continued for a while until mid spring a couple weeks before graduation, you broke up with her. I never knew why you did that. You were happy weren’t you? Wasn’t it also this time that you started to smoke? Or was it earlier? Summer comes around and once again I don’t know how but we started to text each other. We went from talking everyday to texting each other for once in while to texting each other day almost every hour. That’s when it started to get bad. I fell for you hard. Harder than I have ever felt and talking to you made it worse. You made me feel something that I had never felt before and that was jealousy. You were doing summer school just because and you hung out with this one girl that I didn’t know who it was. And I had asked you how your day was and you had responded with something that had hurt. It was picture of that random girl with the caption saying “pretty good because I’m with this cute girl here”. I remember crying while watching big time rush. I tried to ignore your messages but curiosity and need had become suffocating st that point and I had asked about that girl. I asked who it was and you said you didn’t even know her like that and that she wasn’t even your type in the first place. I was really suspicious as you had no reason to try and relieve me of this jealousy. I had told my best friend about this and she had said maybe he was doing it to make  me feel better but what reason was there. “What if he likes you back?” Yeah right. This summer was amazing but it had many dark moments that only few know about. I had a falling out with my dad to the point where it got physical and he put his hands around my throat because I had told him how sad I’ve been and how I wanted to die. He put his hand around me and said “ You don’t really want to die. You just want attention.” I had my stuff taken away so I could talk to you. And I felt so vulnerable that that day I tried taking my life. I thought about you and my friends and when I put the blade to my wrist I could do it. The blade wasn’t sharp enough either way no matter how hard I tried to put pressure on it. So that day I went back to my normal thing of self harming. People hardly know this put it is obvious if you look and see the scars on my wrist and thighs. I had begun self harming at the end up sixth grade and couldn’t get out of the habit. So I went through with it for three to four years suffering until that summer when we texted each other. I told you about my dad and about my cutting. You told me about your smoking but that was already obvious. So later we made a deal over summer. That you wouldn’t smoke and I wouldn’t cut. I love you for that. Summer continued on and I remember you always talking about my hair and how you would touch it saying you liked how curly it was. You made me love my hair and like not feel like straightening it all the time. I would tell you repeatedly about how cute you were but you would always tell me to stop. One day though I felt really off. I could help but shake that feeling away and so once I got home from summer camp I came home to see my hamster dead under my bed. That hamster meant a lot to me as it was the reason we started talking and because I actually loved that hamster. It was one of the few things that made me happy so when I saw the body I straight out sobbed more than I ever have in my life. More than when my dad put his hands on me and more than when I tried taking my life. I texted you and you answered right away and had felt just as much as I did and I told you about how it was my fault for not being more careful with my cat and hamster as I saw the cat bugging the hamster that morning and you got mad at me. You got more mad at me when I had said that I slipped up and cut my thighs. I didn’t try talking to you after that as I was upset and you were too. Prior to me slipping up, you had too. You slipped up more than I had but got more mad at me for when I had slipped up. But didn’t I have the right to be equally as upset as you when you smoked compared to me cutting. We had a deal and you broke it. This happened a few weeks (?) days after my slip up at the end of summer and we were just talking about summer in general and I had mentioned our deal because you had mention how you were smoking again. You said why did it matter if you broke the deal more than once. I responded by saying that hurt a lot more than it should have and you apologized but it was already too late. We didn’t talk after that for a bit until we started texting again. At the time we were texting I found out you were texting her again. You wanted to try and fix your relationship with her. She ,for some reason one I’ll never know why, agreed and went out with you. I was shocked. Why would you hurt yourself like that? You had known she was hooking up with your friend and yet you still went out with her. I remember you texting me saying about how you were in love one day and then the next day you saying fuck love. That was the second time wasn’t it? She cheated on you with your friend. Did that break you? But the thing was that she tried justifying it by saying oh we weren’t even together yet so why does it matter but then once you guys did get together she cheated on you with him again. That was the third and final time. She broke you. I will always hate her for doing that but is it even my place? There was a time that I told you how I love you (but I didn’t say in what way) and how I appreciated you and I had hope you would stay with me for a while and you said that was cute and how you weren’t going anywhere but I had asked why you didn’t say you love me back and you had said love was too much of a strong word. Anyways we are semi caught up to this place and time. We talk everyday but we wouldn’t text. You broke your phone like an idiot but that gave us the chance to get close as I would let you use my phone. We’d play random games I had on my phone and you would always try to beat my high scores for some reason. I would always giggle and laugh every time you would get frustrated because you would always say random things. Things were semi back to normal. We would talk but not text and you stopped hangout with that friend group and started hanging out with some random people I didn’t know but just looking at them you could tell they were bad news. I didn’t judge but I was sad. You weren’t the same. I wasn’t the same either though so I can’t blame you. It got to the point where we would hardly talk unless it was during first and it hurt but I got distracted and didn’t think of you. I don’t know how we started to talk again but it was only after when I had mention to my friend about a guy making suggestive comments at me. I don’t know if you actually heard that but I’d like to assume so. We started talking and getting close until you got a new phone. I told you to text me but you never did. I’m pretty sure I was the one that texted first but I had forgotten why. You wouldn’t respond and it took forever for when you did. It frustrated me to no end until I started to focus more so on myself than you. I start to get happier and became more social. I made friends in my classes and had guys actually start to flirt with me for some reason. Maybe it was because I was more happy and more confident who knows but other guys were giving me attention and I started to sorta forget about you. That was until you came back into my life. Could you have tell that I got into an argument with my parents that day when I asked for a hug from you? Was it that obvious I was sad? I thought it was a one time thing until you showed up for parent night or something and I removed you being stupid by making gang jokes and about threatening to fight me until you forcefully grabbed my shoulders and hugged me. That made me all kinds of flustered and I couldn’t react really. I just said it was nice that you had hugged me first for once and left but then came back and stayed by your side for a bit and left once again. I think it was that point that it became normal for us to hug. We would hug each other every morning before and/or after zero period. You now complain and throw shade when I don’t hug you by saying “wow so no hug” and that would make me nervous and feel bad so I would hug you. Normal it would be when ever I faced you and put my arms out but sometimes you hug me from behind and wouldn’t expect a hug back. I would always get mad when you do that though because I want to hug you back. You started to get bolder and bolder until you started to complain in front of people about me not hugging you and they would feel awkward and leave as I go to hug you or you just hug me in front of people and it would get embarrassed. Not because I’m ashamed but more so because I didn’t want people to assume anything but they always did. Yesterday was my birthday and I was really excited. I thought more people were gonna come but I was okay with only a little people showing up as long as you showed up. You were one of the first people I had told anyways and you said that you’d go just because it was me. My friend even asked you and you said of course. So please tell me why did you get my hopes up for nothing. You told me happy birthday and actually answered quickly for once but then stopped immediately. You didn’t answer but I was okay. I was used it. But then came the time for the party. I would always check my phone to see if you answered back just so I can ask if you were coming and if you needed my address. The last few people I knew for sure were coming came but you still hadn’t answered so I worked my courage up and texted you and asked if you were coming and if you needed my address but of course you didn’t answer. I sat in front of the tv by myself watching the bee movie while everyone else was separated by couples or friend group. I wrapped my head and body with my blanket and put my head down up my friend came and sat by me and put her head on my shoulder. I checked my phone one last time to see if you texted me and me and my friend talked about that movie until my voice got shaky and I covered my face and head with the blanket and my eyes started to water. I answered one last question until it was obvious i was crying. That’s when my friend said that she hated how everyone was in their own groups instead of hanging out together by me or something along those lines and I just started to cry a lot. I don’t know if it was because I felt like nobody was actually there for me and would rather hangout with their significant other or because you weren’t there. I’m not gonna lie. I was disappointed but can I really blame you? It’s not your fault I felt that way but I’m not gonna lie, I was really disappointed with how my birthday went. I didn’t feel special. I didn’t feel anything but loneliness and like depression and I tried hiding it but it was obvious I had been crying hadn’t it? You answered later at night but you completely avoid the question and just asked about the sleepover asking about who stayed and how we were actually sleeping over. I hate that I answered immediately but like I said before curiosity and need filled me and I opened those messages. You didn’t answer after I said who was there until the next day trying to change the subject say how bright it was and I mentioned how it was hot and I felt nasty and you agreed with me and I tried mentioning my birthday thing and you hadn’t answered. You still haven’t and I don’t know why I’m still waiting knowing you won’t answer. The whole reason I’m writing this though is that when I checked to see if you answered I noticed we had the golden heart that Snapchat has for number one best friend and I have it with you. I just can’t keep doing this anymore. My feelings have been hurt enough  and I’m just making it worse hoping. I know guys want me but I don’t want them because I’m really scared they just want to do nasty stuff and that they’ll dip. I just want to love you and I want you to love me but I doubt that would ever happen. I told you recently that if you ever need someone to talk to, that you could talk to me because I could tell something was wrong and you said how much that that meant to you and about how much you appreciated me. I said that aw and that you had done so much for me and I want to do equally the same for him. Why weren’t you there for me? That was the one and only thing I had asked from you and that was to go to my party but you didn’t. How am I supposed to pretend that everything is okay if I don’t feel okay? You said that you’d stay by my side but you lied didn’t you? I can’t just erase you from my life and drop you because you mean so much and I’d be only hurting myself but what are my choices? I don’t want to hug you but I don’t want to hurt you. Do you even care?
"
I've seen more Japanese dicks than any other kind,"This was kind of a weird revelation I had while sitting in an onsen (温泉 hot spring/public bath) while I was at an airport in Japan - yes they actually have them in airports surprisingly. I've lived in Japan for nearly a year, and I've frequently gone to these types of places all over Japan, but I never really see many other foreigners. Inside an onsen being full naked is the complete norm, and wearing anything at all is seen as weird. A side effect of this is you unintentionally get to see a lot of dicks, and I mean a lot. I'm originally from Australia, where you don't get to see many dicks irl, if you're lucky. 

Not sure why, but just felt like I had to get this out there, thankfully this subreddit exists.

Before anyone asks, yes this does exclude porn."
"I feel lost, unhappy, and most of all guilty for feeling that way.","*Sorry for the rambling in advance.**

I have the job I wanted in college, I make great money, I’m in a good relationship, and I feel completely hopeless about my life from here on out. Most of my unhappiness stems from my job but I like there are no real options I can take that will make me happy and that’s when the guilt snaps me out of trying. Usually thoughts of “Everyone has to work. You should be thankful you have the job you do. What if it’s just that you’re lazy and you just hate working.”

In college I was confident and ambitious. I joined tons of extracurriculars and took on leadership positions bit because I felt I had to but because I wanted to. I had a plan to get to the job I wanted and then the life I wanted. I got the job and it was nothing I imagined. The hours are constant, the stress is high, and the people are just as miserable as me. I thought I knew what I wanted before but now my confidence is shaken. 

Maybe I can save the money and buy my way out someday? Or maybe I’ll just die some random way delaying my happiness for a day that never comes. 

Tl;Dr: I worked hard towards my dream job, I enjoyed the work towards it, but once I got the job it sucked happiness from my life. I feel there are no good options out that won’t potentially make me even more unhappy. Now I just feel trapped, hopeless, and ungrateful."
It’s really sad that I can’t use Reddit as a platform to help with my mental health and find people to chat with at the same time.,"I’ve tried talking to dozens of people here only to be ghosted after a couple texts. I’m not the best conversationalist, but I’m nowhere near the worst either, and I’m nowhere near awkward over text, that I know for sure. But because of my post history, where you can see I’ve been a victim of sever abuse, traumatic experiences, been beat up a million times, and I have multiple mental illnesses all stemming from PTSD, no one wants to talk to me. I thought this would be a place where I could at least talk to people and be able to put all of that behind me, and typing the first part of this sentence just made me ball my eyes out. Why would anyone want to talk to “that kid” that’s been through his worst and hasn’t been through his best. All I wanted was to be able to talk to you guys on here but people assume I’m crazy, which, as you could imagine, only hurts my depression. 

Should I just make an alternate account? But I’m assuming people wouldn’t want to chat with someone who has no comment or post history because of how I’m assuming people want to dig into people’s info. 

I’m not looking into talking to anyone because that would just make me feel like a guilt tripper, I just don’t know what to do anymore.

It’s funny. “I don’t know what to do anymore”. I say that to myself almost every day, and it always comes up in a different type of situation. That’s how you know life really, really, fucked you up.

You, reading this. Make sure you take advantage of everything you’ve been blessed with. You have no idea what it could mean to someone else.

Edit 1: yay a downvote :-)
Fuck I look bored"
Gonna quit my job tomorrow,"EDIT: today's the day folks, wish me luck. 

So I'm a farm hand in Australia, I absolutely love the work I do, I never want to do anything else with my life. But. Finding a job in this career with a good boss seems to be a rare thing. I've been at this particular job for over a year now and my boss (manager) has become progressively harder to deal with, due to his mood swings and basically just the way his brain works. It's been pretty bad for the last few months, people close to be have definitely noticed a decline in my mental health and after today I really just don't think it's worth staying. 
The final straw came this after noon in two pieces. The first part has been coming for a while but basically my boss has it in his head that I need to buy another working dog that is more progressed than the two I have currently. The two I have now are still in training, still relatively young and I'm only new to this training game (sue me for being young and new to this career). My boss has 9 dogs all up yet he only uses 3 max. The rest sit in kennels all day and do nothing. He's ruined the confidence in just about all of them. The 3 dogs that he uses are either old, too shy/scared or just don't listen which means everytime something goes wrong, he cracks the shits and aims it at (usually) me. 
Now, just a little side note, no where in my contract (that I don't even have a copy of) does it say that I need to supply my own dog. Nothing specified that to work here I must have a fully trained dog. Yes, they are extremely helpful but I've got along fine in most cases without having a dog to help me.
So he gave me an ultimatum today on whether I was going to buy a $1300 dog that he had picked out (but wasn't even suited to what I needed)  or, to send my oldest dog away to be trained by someone else ($$$). I don't need another dog, I don't want another dog, I have no room for another dog, I can't afford another dog. He doesn't understand this. 
The second straw: 4 weeks ago I asked for time off to go to a family reunion in another state. This means I needed the Friday (22nd) and the Monday (25th) off (we don't work weekends) . I gave him fair warning, I watched him write the dates down in the book, however he told me there was a chance I might not be able to go due to my other workmates wife going into surgery on the Thursday (21st) and she would need him there to look after her for at least a week. I understood that there was a chance I would not be able to go, unless he took into consideration that I'd asked for time off. 
One week ago, the boss decided that we needed to start crutching early (for really no reason other than that he is a control freak) this would stuff everybody around and it's really not necessary. We had everything lined up for two weeks from now, but he's gone and organised it for this week and the next. I was under the impression that he was going to organise it so that we would crutch from Monday to Wednesday and resume on the Tuesday. 
NOPE. During our conversation I checked to see if everything was still fine for me to leave on Thursday night. Did not go to plan. 
Boss: wait you wanted time off this week? 
Me: Yes.
B: no you told me you wanted the 28th off. 
M: No, every time we've spoken about this, I've said I needed the 22nd and 25th off. 
B: well no that can't be right. 
After this conversation went down I became too angry to try and fight it (big believer in not burning bridges) 
The main thing I don't understand is why he lied about it. I don't understand how you can mix up the 22nd and 25th with just the 28th. Either way it's too late to change anything now and I'm incredibly pissed off. I only get the chance to see this side of my family every two years and I didn't get to go the last time due to school. 4 years without seeing my family due to the fact that my boss is a selfish prick. 
So I got home, called my dad, he agreed that it was time to go so I am. I'm handing in my resignation as soon as I get to work and in two weeks I'll be gone. I can't wait for this weight to be lifted off my shoulders. I hope my mental health goes back to normal soon. 
Sorry for the long read, I just needed to out it in words. 

TLDR: My boss is a selfish prick who is obsessed with controlling other people's lives so I'm quitting. "
She said she needs more time because her ex,"I don't know what to think.

Currently, I'm in high school, last year student. 
Short story: I always had my closest classmate-friend Claudia, and we were fine with it. The reason why, we were only friends was her boyfriend.
But, like week before last year started, he broke with her. She got something like depression, and what she really needed, were her friends - like me.
And here the story begins: I started to feel something, like you know, some kind of warm in heart to her.
We were talking about everything, and she said that she doesn't want any kind of relationship right now.
So I waited.
6 months
A few weeks after new year cellebration everyone already know that we will be together, so I asked her if she wants to be my gf, and she agreed. I was so happy
We were happy couple, I started to fall in love with her.
But, 2 months later (like right now) she DM that she has something to tell me.
I started to worry.
And yup. She told me that she still didn't fully recovered from her previous relationship, and she  still need more time. So she decided to take a break.
That's weird, because we were talking about it, and we agreed that we won't start anything serious until she finally feel fine. 
I felt broken. In her words, I'm kind of sweetheart and that's not my fault, AND she cannot fall in love with someone if she still feels something to her EX. And that's like LOL.
He broke with her, she hates him, he hates her, they don't speak with each other, and yet, she still loves him

I don't know what to think"
they found me,"I've been venting on this sub since October-ish of last year. and my people who I thought were friends went looking for literal days because they knew I was on reddit. they eventually found my stuff and searched through all my art posts and replies and dug out my vents and sent screenshots to me. 

I mentioned them, not their names in about 60% of my vent posts. Those guys were rude and mean, but I had nobody else to hangout with so I kinda had to deal with them. they used the posts and said stuff like ""wow, I can't believe you hate us,"" and, ""wow, I thought you trusted me"". 

so him and another guy went off and told everybody I know that i hated them. Some of them are people I don't even know. I don't hate anybody, but these guys annoy me a lot of the time and find any little reason to hate me. thats why I vent a lot about them. They can be total assholes.

So now as usual, they won't answer me. even though they've been online all day. and I asked the main 4 guys if something was wrong with the posts and they said yes. and now they're making me wait till the end of the day to even discuss. 

They're really trying their best to piss me off, and it's working. Them making me wait the whole day is building up so much anxiety. I just want this to end. 

and then I'll have to listen to them later tonight argue about how there's something wrong with me expressing my feelings and getting advice on the internet

I dont know what to do. i'm planning on trying to relax and be with family for the day. I also got a club to go to later tonight, so hopefully those will get me away from their negative side. 

i'm secretly hoping they'll apologize. but they aren't those type of people.

have a great day,
hold on to your friends/family while you have them."
"My life is so uneventful, sometimes i wish even negative things to happen so i could at least feel like something is going on","throwaway because I know some people on here. 

TLDR: my life is boring

I'm only 20, but it just feels like my whole life has been completely uneventful, with nothing interesting ever happening to me, or me not doing anything interesting. I just live, go to school, browse social media, and go to sleep. I don't have many friends, and mostly only socialize with those in my class or my family. 

I finally switched my major so I'm actually having some fun in my classes (making movies, photography, design) so that's something, but besides that I haven't done much, and don't have many interesting stories to tell. 

last year I went through panic attacks and anxiety, and even though they were horrible and the scariest moments of my life, I'm glad it happened because 1) I learned a bit about myself (great) and 2) I had at least SOMETHING happen to me (not so great). 

I grew up with strict parents who set rules for me, and I followed them because I was afraid of the consequences. but I feel this has bled into my adulthood and I'm still doing nothing because I'm set on those rules (which I'm trying to break out of). this has also resulted in mostly boring teen years.

I just feel like everyone around me is doing all these fun things and having amazing nights with their friends, and I'm here in my room, watching TV. I'm not a fan of going out during the night too much, but I don't do much during the day either. my life just feels mundane and repetitive. 

I'm also a procrastinator, even for projects/hobbies that I want to do for fun, so I never get to those either and instead sit around and browse social media or YouTube. all these obstacles I'm trying to get over, but I just wanted to rant about my life a little."
I just flashed my high beams at the sun,Awkward ... extremely. I was driving and flashed my high beams at the sun... needless to say it didn’t get dimmer 
Nothing helps,"I’m 18 and depressed, I was once very intelligent, top of all my classes with ease, main player on my football and basketball teams, quite popular and not ugly. I’m nice to everyone and nearly everyone likes me. Although I’m very private and don’t give much away and as a result don’t have any very close friends that I can tell stuff and trust. I’ve been depressed for probably a few years now and have gotten so good at hiding it, I’m always laughing and making jokes and am in my eyes generally ok to be around. No one knows that I’m dying inside, that I’m sad all the time, that I sit up all night telling myself what an awful disappointment I am. No one ever asks if I’m ok, because why the fuck would they? how could they know?
I’ve tried so many things to feel better, I’m an avid sports player and practice and workout several nights a week and I’m physically in great shape I’m on antidepressants and they aren’t working for shit, I’ve tried alcohol, marijuana and cocaine and still just feel baron. Last night I was got with a beautiful girl who I’ve liked for so long and even still just felt so alone afterwards. This, I think is why I always like to just stay at home and do nothing, when you try nothing and don’t fail and just feel the same there’s a strange comfort. But when you go and do something that should make you feel good and it doesn’t work it just reinforces the utter hopelessness you are always feeling. 
My siblings (all older) are over achievers with fantastic jobs. All my life I’ve had people telling me I’m very clever and charismatic and that I’ll do big things but it’s a battle for me to even get out of bed everyday. I’m so sick of pretending, I’m just waiting for the day I finally breakdown so people just know. I don’t really know how to finish this I just wanted to vent I guess, thanks "
I don’t think I’m gonna live past 25,"I’ve struggled with depression my entire life I only recently started getting help but now the medication doesn’t feel like it’s working anymore and therapy... idk what to say to my psychiatrist anymore about anything and that’s even if I feel awful because it likes to hide when I go there. But everything started to turn up when I met my girlfriend... well ex now. I believed in a future with her, it gave me hope that I could actually have a future that hope was alive. For the first time in my entire life I knew what I wanted and had the drive to get it... but she’s gone now and I’m back to having no motivation no desire she was my light and she left. I don’t see a future anymore I don’t see any hope. I’m back to square one and I’m tired... so so so tired."
I used to be a bully and I regret it every day of my life.,"Apologies for the formatting, I’m on mobile.
I made a throwaway just for this.

This is something I’ve not really been able to tell anyone the full story of. I’ve told parts of it to close friends, but I’m still so ashamed of myself for my actions and the effect they had.

Growing up, I was always an outcast. Saying I had a hard time making friends would be the understatement of the century. Even in the “special needs” unit, nobody really wanted to be my friend. I had a hard time understanding why I was even there in the first place, which I didn’t find out until I was 14. 
When I was 9 years old, my dad had to call up the vice principle of the school I was at to ask if I could get help making friends. Yes, it was truly that pathetic. Surprise, surprise, it didn’t work.

I was around 12 years old when my dad told me he was moving abroad for work to a country called Malaysia. My aunt and my grandma (both on my dad’s side) told me it was a beautiful tropical place and I should go. They made it sound like a holiday. I was hesitant to leave my mum (I had been dragged away at age 7 and I didn’t get to see her regularly again until I was 9) but I wanted to get away from where I was being bullied, so I went.

I had moved around May time, which was weird timing because it was almost the end of the term for schools. I was placed into the year of my age, which was a year ahead of my old schooling system, so I was incredibly behind on my education and quickly fell behind. Being brought up to strive to achieve academic genius status made me hate myself and started to cultivate my anger. The smart kids didn’t want to associate with me, so when the kid who was assigned to show me around was a smart kid, I was ignored and given up to one of the “loser” kids, N. N quickly became my best friend and was the only friend that stayed with me throughout. N is the real MVP.

After the summer holidays, we got new classes and a new girl came to class. Her name was K. K had ADHD and wasn’t popular, so I decided to befriend her. She was a lovely girl and had so much going for her. 

I now had two friends, two more than I had ever truly had. It all turned sour though.

I also became friends with a girl called P. P was incredibly manipulative, but I didn’t see the signs at first. I was just happy that I had someone else who wanted to be my friend. She, for some reason, hated K and wanted to make her life hell, and decided the best way to do it was through me. She started telling me things about K and how if I dropped K, I would be her best friend forever. I regret it now, but I was so desperate for friends I decided to do it.

I started being mean to K, posting stuff about her online and even going as far as to screenshot things from our FaceTime convos on Facebook to mock her. She started self harming with a box cutter in front of me. I hated doing it, it hurt, but P was still telling me to keep going.

Eventually, K told the teachers and I had to go to a meeting. When asked why I did what I did,  I was going to rat P out, but I felt as if P would hate me if I did, so I said it was a joke. Fucking lame excuse for how horrible I was, but I didn’t know what else to say. I apologised and we started hanging out again. 

But P wasn’t having any of it and told me to go harder. So I did. I told her crush about her crush. I continued being horrible online. I spread rumours. I did it all and I don’t forgive myself. 

P turned against me and started pretending to be friends with K. I was so betrayed, but frankly I deserved it. I tried to warn K, but obviously she didn’t believe me.

Also, K (rightly so) told my crush I had a crush on him. He had a girlfriend at the time. I guess she did get a little revenge which I definitely deserved.

I moved away after summer 2013. I was broken, my grades were shit, I had truly hurt someone. I’m so surprised N stood by me, obviously she didn’t accept what I had done but I think she maybe saw something was going on behind the scenes.

Apparently K became extremely suicidal and moved back to her old country. I feel horrible for what I did. It’s not acceptable and I’ve never been able to forgive myself. 

My mental heath spiralled down dramatically when I moved home. I developed anxiety, depression and PTSD. I found out at age 14 that I had autism and my dad had his it from me all this time. December last year I was diagnosed with dyslexia, which is why I was struggling a lot of the time grade wise. 

Since the events, I feel as if I don’t deserve happiness. I’ve almost committed suicide several times in the past. Although I have a good life now, I feel as if I don’t deserve any of it because I don’t even know if K is dead. She could be dead and it could be my fault. I never went as far as to tell her to kill herself, but I made her life miserable and I regret it.


I think the only good things that came out of moving to Malaysia were having N there and realising that I was experiencing gender dysphoria, so I changed my name and began living as male.


I hope I’m not truly a horrible person as I have changed myself, but I do feel like I am because of what I did.

I flipped off the Planned Parenthood protestors,"Yesterday I was walking around enjoying my Sunday when I saw a bunch of anti-abortion folks praying outside of the Planned Parenthood. I've seen people outside of it before, but usually it's only two dudes quietly holding signs so I just give them a quick glare and move on. Yesterday, at least 10 people were standing there. One woman was leading the prayer and speaking into a microphone, while the rest had their heads bowed and clearly found what she was saying deeply meaningful. I live in a very liberal city, so I recognize that they represent only a small portion of the population here, but in the moment they filled with the most intense rage I've ever felt. I can't explain why exactly. I guess to me, praying outside of a Planned Parenthood/all the implications of that action including preventing women from getting abortions is one of the least godly things you can do, so the illusion of piety they projected just pissed me off.

Anyway, I glared at all of them as I walked by and what surprised me was that each of them met my gaze. One younger guy looked down afterwards, somewhat ashamed, but the rest of them, all quite geriatric, smiled at me. In particular this one woman grinned at me maniacally, knowing just how much she was pissing me off. I hated and will forever hate that woman. She wasn't there for God. She was there for her own selfish reasons. She was there because she wanted to make me, a young woman ripe for childbearing, feel ashamed of myself for ever considering an abortion, for ever thinking a child would hold me back. 

I wish I had just stopped and talked to her and the rest of them like human beings. I could have at least attempted to explain to them that birth control and the option of abortion are the only things that make me feel like a real person and not a baby gestation pod. That way, I could have been better than them. But, as the title of this post may have revealed, I did not initiate a productive conversation. I just flipped them off and yelled ""Go f*** yourself"" before storming down the street. It felt satisfying for like .2 seconds but now I'm so embarrassed. I've never done anything like that before. And ultimately it was pointless! Did it change their minds? No! If anything, it only confirmed what they thought of me. I feel like a kid post-tantrum. "
PLEASE blow your nose.,"I’m on a trip with eleven others. We were told we would all get our own rooms- nope. All 11 of us are in bunk beds. In one room. And one girl has a cold, and she snorts her snot every thirty seconds and I’m SO ANNOYED. BLOW YOUR GODDAMN NOSE. It’s my least favorite sound in the world, that snnnrrkkkkkkk. Every thirty seconds from sun up through the middle of the night."
I scared myself,"Hey, 

&#x200B;

I'm trying to follow through with an impulse to communicate what happened last night to someone but I'm really embarrassed. 

&#x200B;

I recently purchased my first firearm, and last night it ended up in my mouth. I don't have any ammunition in the house, and I feel fine now, but when I got home, I was upset, I ran to get my gun, pressed it into my temple, and kept pulling the trigger and re-cocking it. Over and over. in my temple, In my mouth, on my forehead.  I even kept it in my bed last night, because I fucking hate myself so much.

&#x200B;

That isn't appropriate or normal behavior, right? Loaded or not, its terrible fire-arm safety and not something normal people do or worry about, right?

&#x200B;

I don't think I should own a gun."
I completely destroyed my relationship with my best friend.,"Ok so...bit of a backstory. The year after high school in 2017 all my friends kinda went off in their own directions. We were seeing each other less and less with everyday that passed. But it was manageable because one of my friends from high school and I kept in contact regularly. In fact, we saw each other every Friday night. So we were best friends.

Fast forward to the end of 2017 and I had screwed up big time. I confronted my friend over TEXT 😕😕 saying that he was getting too close for my liking. So, I’m a heterosexual male, my friend on the other hand is bi. Now, there’s nothing wrong with that, I’m not a hater of LGBT but there were definitely signs that he had feelings for me. Flirting, constant touching, me catching his gaze, my name as his phone password etc etc. He also admitted he had feelings for me in the past, but that’s another story. So, I told him about how I felt uncomfortable when he acted this way. He denied having feelings for me. But then I went on to say that maybe we should just spend some time apart and only hang out with others around.

Yeahhhhh...I f#@ked up big time. As you could imagine initially he didn’t take this too well. But with time we eventually made peace with our demons and moved on. But I lost a friend. Well no, he’s still my friend, but things aren’t the same. It makes me sad.

Fast forward again till 2019...well...I don’t know. About this time last month I straight out messaged him asking if he wanted to hang out for a couple of beers. He said “Yes” but there definitely was a sense of uneasiness about the conversation. Keeping in mind I hadn’t seen the guy in like 8 months before that. Nevertheless, he showed up and we had a great time. I even remember him saying (even though I was pretty tipsy) that that night was just like the old times back in 2017. It was a good night, we got on really well. At the end of it all we shook hands and he told me to message him when I had a free Saturday, so we could catch up again sometime. So, I did...

That was 10 days ago. Wasn’t available last Sat and this upcoming Sat he said he would get back to me. Like he’s a busy dude I get it. But this suspense is killing me. Things aren’t the same anymore and it sucks. He’s caught up in his own life and that’s fair enough. But I wish we were able to hang out a bit more regularly. But, in reality he’s got other friends to hang out with now. So, what’s the point of having me there? I’m a 20 year old guy and don’t go out anywhere anymore. Mostly because I don’t have anyone to hang out with. I feel like I’m wasting away the social aspect of my life. What do I do?

What are your guy’s thoughts, feelings? To continue to hang out with this guy, or move on?"
i have no friends,"so, a few months ago i (f18) cut off some really shitty friends that i had. the 5 of us had all been best friends for the past 5 years or so and we were really close. last year though they started acting distant and made me feel like i didn’t belong. they would suddenly hang out with other people and leave me out of it, have all of these inside jokes and group chats that i wasn’t a part of, among other things. i told them several times about how i was feeling because of them, but they didn’t do shit about it other than semi comfort me at that moment. after months of feeling like there was something wrong with me, i decided i deserved better and was sick of feeling sad and left out. so i told them just that, and stopped being friends with them. they seemed kind of sad about it, but moved on pretty fast.

now, i’m proud of myself for cutting them off, but i feel so incredibly lonely now, even after 4 months. they were pretty much the only friends that i had, so now i have no one to hang out/talk with other than my boyfriend. i absolutely suck at making friends and don’t really like most of the people at my school, so that’s that. i just really miss being a part of something you know?feeling like there are people who i can always count on or even just laugh about stupid things with.

so yeah, i’m really sad because of this. i don’t know how long this is going to suck for, but i’m getting tired of feeling like this. everyone tells me to be a little more open and make new friends, but it’s really not that simple to me. i guess i’m just mad because i feel like my friends were suddenly taken away from me, and there’s nothing i could do about it (even though i now know that they weren’t real friends). i’m also mad at them for treating me like that out of nowhere, i even asked then several times if i’d done anything wrong but nothing came up. i just don’t get it, i hate this."
My Wonderful Girlfriend and The Issues In Her Home,"First of all, I marked this story NSFW for some of the things in this story that some people may find disturbing may trigger bad memories, or what have you. Second, now that I think about it, that title wasn't very good but I can't think of any other. Third, thank you to whoever made this SubReddit. I'm gonna be using it from time to time, sometimes often :)

&#x200B;

On to the story.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In August of 2017 while playing some games on my PlayStation 4 with a friend. That friend joined their friend, and my kind-of-soon-to-be girlfriend (I'll just call her Angel, because she feels like she is one) was in the lobby, as well as her friend (I'll just call Rain, because it's his username). We played a few games, we friended each-other.

&#x200B;

And, in November, Grace and I proclaimed our love for each-other and decided to be together. We promised each-other that we'd never cheat on each-other, leave each-other or do anything like that.

About a month later, we decided that when we're both 18 (I was 12 then and I'm 14 now. 4 years feels so damn long) we'll move in with each-other in the town that she lives. She also got me to get Facebook, which I have contact with her on while we're not on our PlayStation 4s

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Grace, 16, lives in a house with her 11 year old sister (I'll call E), 12 year old brother, Liam (frankly I don't give a fuck about his privacy after the shit he's done to Grace.) , Mom and Dad. Grace's Dad works a steady job from 8 am to 6 pm, her Mom is unemployed because of her limited movement in her left side (she had a stroke, she survived and is doing well).

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Now onto the NSFW part.

&#x200B;

\----------------------------------------

&#x200B;

Now making the third time in 2 1/2 years, Grace's brother, Liam, has anally raped her. On top of that, Grace's Dad hits her over some pretty bullshit reasons that I won't get into because I get too pissed to remember. Her Dad has recently taken a step upward that he shouldn't have, which is taking off his belt and slapping her with it (I can't say the other word for it.).

&#x200B;

The worst part is, Grace's brother and Dad only hit and abuse her when her Mom isn't around, making it impossible for anyone besides me, Rain, and my Grace's old boyfriend (I'll call M) believe her.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In November 2018, Grace's Dad found her texting me, and told both her brother and her to cancel any relationships because they're too young. Grace told me, said she was afraid on how I would react, and apologized, and I told her I was okay with it because technically it wasn't her choice. I said that since she's 16, she can move out at 18, and if she wants we can be together again once she moves out.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

In about 2016, Grace talked with her Mom about going to M's house. Her Mom agreed, and Grace & M had been studying and hanging out there since. After I met Grace, she was still in the relationship with M, and I had feelings for her that I didn't want to express. M broke up with her, I comforted her, and we got together. Grace and M are still good friends, and she still goes to M's house. She told me that they do some sexual activities together, and I told Grace to be very careful.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

(with both Grace and Rain, I can tell when something's wrong by their voice. I also can sometimes feel when something is wrong even through texts on Facebook which is weeeeiiird)

&#x200B;

(December 2018, we're still not together again) Grace goes to M's house, I tell her to be careful. She comes home, gets on the PlayStation 4, so do I. She sounds depressed, troubled and shaky, and I ask her what's wrong.

&#x200B;

Grace and M got to heated, and they lost their virginities. First I was sad, then I wanted to cry, but my body and mind have a fucked up way of turning most of my emotions into anger. My sadness turned to anger, and I went on a rant about how I wanted to kill his ass, which I still do to some extent. I've gotten more mature, I want to kill him less, and I'll be fine if I ever go around him, but if he ever brings that day up I won't be able to stop myself.

&#x200B;

(Also, don't worry. I'm not gonna be one of those people on the news who killed 5 people. As long as Grace is here, I have no reason to act on what I want to do to her Dad, brother, M or anyone else.)

&#x200B;

Anyways, that's my story, thank you to whoever reads this and thank you to whoever made this SubReddit.

Have a good day, guys :)"
Birthday Wishes for family,"It's a family members birthday today, so naturally Facebook is full of birthday wishes for him and sharing pictures and cute inspirational messages.

""Little did I know he would be what saved me from a domestic violence relationship""
""Your actually turning into the bravest most kindest young man""

Hell, he's even posted for people to support mental health charities for his birthday urging people to donate.

My family loves him and fully supports him, they love telling everyone how he lives in his own house and fully supports himself. 

Even from this, sounds like a great kid with a bright future? 

He got (permanently) kicked out of his house (living with parents) at 14/15 because he had been sexually assaulting his younger sister (8 year age gap).

Now reread and see how you feel about this. 

I'm the only one who thinks he is disgusting and is scum. After being kicked out of his house and living with my grandparents, constantly stealing and threatening them, having drug dealers shop up at their house with a gun threatening them. Now he's living on his own in a crappy area on benefits and is suicidal, I'm meant to feel bad for him and reach out to support him?  

Fuck you."
going to a good friends funeral tomorrow :(,"going to a old friends funeral tomorrow :( he died of a heroin overdose... there have been so many in my hometown. its really hitting me hard cuz the last time i saw him, he was crying and saying how he missed the old times we had hanging out in my grandmas basement watching tv all weekend :( i just cant believe hes gone "
Thanks for the memories.,"I hope you'll never see this, because the last thing I want is for you to know my last words to you, and ultimately to myself as I move forward from you this point onwards. 

放下一个人原来可以这么的无声无息。安静的，我把你从幻想中解放了。对你再也没有任何期待。无论你过得好与不好，都不在关注也不再关心。安安心心的过好自己的每一天。就算你的微信，你的照片还保留着，可是它们也就静静的在那里而已，静静的存在，却再也没有存在的意义。梦中醒来，原来真的只是一场梦。

我还天真的以为若干年后，当我们都成熟了，还单身的时候，你才会发现原来只有我最好。到那个时候我们才能真正的在一起。分离了那么多年，因为有缘最后还是走到了一起。兜了那么一大圈，最后我们还是在一起了。多浪漫的故事啊。多天真，多愚蠢的故事啊。在我身上花20欧都不愿意，原来我在你心里是这么的廉价。我们之间的关系是这么的一文不值。

所以我可以说，我们这一段真的结束了。经历过你带给我的各种情绪，我不后悔，因为它们塑造了今天的我，一个更好的我。

真正的放弃永远是悄无声息的。"
Im grateful,"As a child, I was abused by my parents. Physically and emotional. I sometimes also experienced moments, where I thought I would never see my parent again.

These things left their marks in me, which I work on in therapy. One of them is that sometimes, I don't have a access to certain emotions for a certain time, which is very unsettling.

Theres this lovely person, my boyfriend. He is always understanding. I love him more than anything. 
I can talk to him about EVERYTHING.
This weekend, I didn't have access to my emotions again. I felt flat, and I feared that I didn't love my boyfriend and never loved him and misinterpreted my feelings as love. Even though i know that I love him to pieces. 

I told him i felt so- that I lack of access sometimes to my feelings, that I kind of fear these things although I know I love him. And he told me ""even if, then I had a beautiful time with you"" 
and all my feelings for him hit me like a bomb and i started crying, hugging him tight. Holding each other, we told us that we loved each other. I told him I would protect him and want to make him happy. 

He also told me he feels the same way sometimes- he handles it through having faith in his feelings for me and mine in him, and that he knows he will feel them again and that theyre still there. (he also had a difficult past) I want to reach that handling level too. 

I am so grateful that i can talk to him about everything. He is everything i wished for.

"hello everyone,welcome to my life story🙃 ~extra info: i’m 13 f","hello everyone, based on the title you know what i’m going to be talking about. it’s pretty long with no tl;dr so 🤷‍♀️. (btw it is very jumbled and everything is mixed together so sorry for that)

ok so it started in first grade. i became friends with one of the girls in class and then she made another friend who was jealous of me and took her away from me and all the way until 5th grade the girl that took my best friend away from me bullied me. and i know i sounds petty but she was honestly my only friend cause when i was younger i was very shy and anti-social. but wait there’s more to cause who i am today😂, around 4th or 5th grade i had to live with my cousins and uncle and aunt for awhile because of financial problems (around 8 people in a 3 bed/1 bath house) and my 30 year old cousin who i trusted touched me in places he shouldn’t have and i believe it started happening when i was even younger but i didn’t realize what was going on but anyways i told my mom and she talked to him about it. about two or three months later he starts touching me again and i tell my mom she doesn’t do anything about it. and then on top of that I was still getting bullied and being pressured by my mom about my grades and doing good in school. and on top of that my parents fight and have been separated my whole life. 

when i was born my dad was there but after that he didn’t come see me or my mom or call her for almost a year and three months and he always threatens my mom and i never understood when i was younger and now i see how he threatens her and calls her bad words for black people (he’s a white male)  and i never really see him because when i do go to his house there isn’t anything to do he just sits there on the couch not doing anything so i just stopped going i call him sometimes but im always busy with school work and stuff. and i’ve always had problems with my older sister, we either physically fight or we just argue..all the time. so our relationship isn’t that good and i hate being home. 

but now to something else... i always feel so pressured and overwhelmed and i’m falling apart and no one even notices. its actually really hard to be happy or to show that im happy or be positive bc in the back of my head there’s this thing that just reminds me i don’t deserve to be here and i shouldn’t have been born.and at my school at lunch, i’m usually at the end of the table by myself usually not talking to anyone. it’s because no one really wants to hear me talk at that table and i can tell bc just the way they look at me when i say something it’s like their annoyed i’m even there and what i’m talking about is irrelevant. i’ve been alone for the longest time and i always be. people say to look toward the so called “bright future”  i have because i’m so “smart” but what i think of my future is me going to school for 13 years just to get a job that ill hate and work for the rest of my life. even if i get a good job i will still hate bc it’s not the job i want. honestly i can barely imagine a future for myself and by future i mean 5+ years from now. like i really expect to be dead soon and i’m not even joking and i know it’s gonna hurt a lot of people but tbh it hurts more just to stay here suffering. and people also say to look towards god or god has a plan...god doesn’t like ugly, god doesn’t like gay people... i am gay so either way i’m going to hell no matter what. and i even try connecting with him but it doesn’t work i pray sometimes asking for forgiveness or for help or guidance cause i’m really struggling and no one sees it and he never answers and then instead of him answering it’s the devil knocking at the door telling me things and after everything i just let the thoughts come in cause they are stuck and they won’t go away. and sometimes i do feel happy and confident but always and i mean always someone has to say something and i automatically shut down and i can’t stop it. 

EDITT:forgot to add i’m still getting bullied in middle school but by different people so life still sucks🤷‍♀️ 
so there you go to whoever actually uses their time to read this, i just wanted to tell someone so goodnight✌️"
"I've never done anything in my life, I steal everything from other people","I don't even know how I'm going to write this but.

&#x200B;

My life is a lie. I don't know anything.

&#x200B;

Most of you have probably also done this but in school every test I did, I cheated on. Every paper or work I had to do, I just plagiarized everything, for example, I had to do a book review and Dave Chappelle talked about a book in one of his stand ups and I just did that.

&#x200B;

I don't have any opinions, I just read them online and them present them to my family and friends as my opinions, just paraphrasing everything I heard or read. I don't even know If I agree with these opinions. I take them mostly from YouTube, channels like Vox, 17776, ""Let's just jump into it."" guy and other channels and sites too. I don't even enjoy it. The worst of all is that people actually think I'm a smart and opinionated person but I literally have no idea what the fuck is going on.

&#x200B;

All my social media is a lie. I steal comments and posts from Reddit, things youtubers say and stuff I find on 4chan and other random websites and adapt them to tweets (because I basically only use Twitter to post stuff) like a comment I found on Reddit that was like ""no homo but i just ran over a kid at 80 mph"". I just tweeted that and got a shit ton of likes. I haven't tweet a thing I thought or a joke I made in months. My Instagram posts are just copies of other pictures I enjoyed too.

&#x200B;

And this year, I got into film school. Right now we're writing a movie and my movie is 90% just things from other movies, themes and scenes and dialogues and stuff. I presented it to my class and it was really well received. But like... It isn't my movie.

&#x200B;

I feel like I'm not living. I feel like a soul swimming in a fish bowl. I have no thoughts or desires. I feel like I don't even know human connection. I have friends but they're not really friends. I just talk to them sometimes. I get drunk every Friday and hate every second of it except that I don't. Except that I have no idea if I do. I've never had a best friend. I can't talk with my parents about anything. I'm 19 years old and I think about losing my virginity a lot. Fuck. This is turning into an incoherent mess but might as well finish it off with I wish I was a girl."
Terrorist attacks freak me out,"I know. The title is true for everyone. But I just need to get it off my chest.

When I was 14 I went to a school in New Jersey for commuter families. There was literally a direct train to NYC within walking distance from the school. I remember on the day that 9/11 happened, so many kids' parents had gone missing. People were just huddled in the hallways crying. My parents were working in the city and were still missing throughout the day, but my friend's mom came and took us out of school. We went to the top of the highest hill in the area to watch the towers burn and fall. (My parents were found safe and sound, btw).

So now I'm 32. I don't go too high in buildings. I froze in fear on the Eiffel Tower during my honeymoon and my husband had to carry me down. I cry whenever I'm on an airplane. I don't like movie theaters, restaurants, or tourist attractions. I always try to find the most sketchy-looking person in the room and I think about how to get the farthest away from them.

I lived in the Southern US for awhile and we had a mass shooter come to the movie theater across from my house to scout for the best place to shoot people. He decided to go one town over where he entered a movie theater, killed 2 people and injured 9.

Now I live in the Netherlands and we just had a terrorist attack this morning about an hour drive from my house. It's just kind of made me go into 9/11 mode. I think I'll take the day off and stay in my pj's all day and read happy books. I'll probably avoid big cities for awhile.

It seems to be getting worse as I get older. As a teenager, I was barely affected by these things. Now, it's just paralyzing. I'm flying from Amsterdam to Hawaii in a few weeks, though. I can't even hold that idea in my head right now, it's so scary to me. Honestly, if I can physically walk onto the plane I'll be surprised."
What should I? do please help!,"So this weekend I went this conference and won the award I've always dreamed of winning, but it didn't feel the way I wanted to feel. I was really great but I got home and was exhausted. No one was home and no one seemed to care. It was also my best friends surprise birthday party that night but I had only slept three hours combined in two nights, and was feeling sick so I didn't go. She got angry. And then my ex, who I broke up with a week a ago, was also at the conference and wanted to talk. We end up fighting but I think I realized I still might like her. My other best friend was also caught with weed and was arrested. I am really worried about him. And I just feel really alone. I suffer from depression and I just feel like I have no point in this world. I have my friends around me but it just feels empty. Sorry if this is a lot to unpack. "
"Its been a full year and a half, and i just realized that a certain asshole professor sabotaged my grad school chances","After graduating its been a year of taking care of my sick mother, and helping my father out with his business.

So when things finally look to be slowing down, I finally trying to apply to the graduate program that ive had my eye on for a while, and i find out that they require a 4.0 GPA on my Bachelor career.


Well my small problem is, is that i graduated with a 3.69... Not bad at all, seeing how i only failed a single class in my 4 years of undergrad.

Well guess what. That single class wouldve given me .3 on my GPA if i had gotten a mere C instead of my 59.99% D. 

Thinking back to it, this class was a total shitshow because i took it on my Senior year, when most people who take it are Freshman. So the dickhead professor on day one announced to the entire class that he would make an example of me since i was the oldest, and how ""i would have to give 100% of my attention that semester on his class if i wanted to pass"".... on a fucking drawing 101 course.

No matter what i did in that class, it would never be enough for him. During a group project he gave everyone A's except for me, giving me a D because ""I must have not done as much as the others"", even though i singlehandedly did an entire half section of the assignment.

When i originally got hit with the 59.99%, my advisor told me not to worry, as it was only required I take the course, not pass it.

But lo and behold, a year later, when i can finally focus on myself, i realize that commander dickhead ruined my chances at this grad program, and it took me a full year and a half to realize it.

Fuck you, Kip."
Going against the advice of the majority,"I've talked to everyone that would listen. I've listened to everyone I've talked to.  I do feel better about things now that a little time has passed.  So here I sit. One day after making a move that goes against the advice of the majority.  It's my life, my sanity, my want, my need.  So I raise a glass of water to the minority that said.. Do what you gotta do, If you are wrong whats the worse that can happen, fuck'm I wouldn't let this go...  A drink to those who risk comfort and stability for a chance to take on hardship and pain.  I will be hated by those who don't care for me anyway.  I will be upsetting some who care for me, but that's what forgiveness is for.  To anyone who has a tough decision to make.  here's my advice.  Make the choice without fear of the consequences and pick what you want.  "
my ex boyfriend wasnt as amazing as i originally thought he was,"trigger warning; r*pe, sexual assualt, abuse 

when we were dating i thought he was so sweet and amazing, and to be honest i dont know why. originally he broke up with me because his best friend sexually assualted me at a party, he then left me.

after his friend admitted it, he started dating my best friend to fuck with me (which he also admitted), and after she cheated on him he crawled back to me and begged me to take him back which i so stupidly did. 

during the relationship, he would grab my boobs & ass in public, and even choke me when i told him to stop. he would then choke me when i tried to get away from him or told him to stop. then he would pressure me into fucking him which i cried all the way through. he broke up with me because i wasn't enough (his words), and i cried for days. 

while dating i thought he was so amazing for wanting to date someone like me, i was so happy when he asked for me back, and he told me to be grateful that he would have sex with me. i dont know why i was grateful for him or felt special. "
I’m a loser,"I’m 24 years old living in Los Angeles, CA. I never had a friend in my life. I have little family but I’m not really close to them. I’m dirt poor, my parents are immigrants and separated when I was young. I never had a job because of my mental health issues. I’ll be graduating with two majors this upcoming Spring which I’ve unfortunately lost all my passion for and it’s unlikely I’ll make a living off of. It took me 6 years to graduate (3 from a CC and 3 at a Uni.) from college. Besides the 3 years I lived on campus, I always slept in a car, couch surfed, slept on the floor throughout my childhood and adolescence due to homelessness and other financial circumstances. I’ve never been in a relationship and any sex I’ve had was through prostitution. I’ve been depressed since I was 5 years old and suicidal since I was 10. I’m a high school drop out. I’m an atheist and I have no meaning in my life or whatever happens after I die. I feel like the ugliest person alive, both because of genetics and because I’m transitioning from male to female. I had a stuttering problem as a kid so that was a big reason I developed severe social anxiety to a point where I never had a friend to talk to. It’s awful to be alone when you have no one to talk to but your own thoughts for 20+ years. Any music I’ve created sounds awful to me despite the hundreds of hours I’ve spent on them throughout the decade. Medication and therapy has been a major failure the last 5 years, it just doesn’t work on me. I tried killing myself this past Christmas Eve by driving my car really fast off a cliff but my car died on me once I passed 110mph. That’s my 3rd failed suicide attempt and I can’t even do something as simple as that. And as punishment now I don’t even have a car since I busted the engine. I feel like my body and head has taken a toll after all these years. I can’t feel any pleasure anymore and don’t have the energy nor motivation to do something as simple as taking a shower, eating, walking, etc. I’m the most unlikable person. I’m a loser."
There’s this guy at my school who really likes me and thinks I’m his best friend but I really don’t like him. I keep chickening out of telling him and the situation is just getting worse and worse. What should I do??,"This has been going on for three years and it has got so bad that my other friends don’t want to hang out with me because they think he will tagalong.
This whole situation makes me feel guilty and confused.


Edit:I‘m also a guy and he isn’t gay he just thinks that we’re really good friends"
Stressing out over cringe actions the past,"It’s currently 4 am, and I can’t sleep becuase of some things that happened over 6 months ago. 

It’s so cringe, I had no idea what I was doing!!! It’s hard to go into detail. It’s really bad though.

It’s super bad for my anxiety. How do I stop this cycle? I feel like I have to alwardly get forgiveness from the people involved with my actions, but idk. 

I JUST WANT IT TO STOP."
I am so sick of nutrition in America.,"I am so SO tired of how nutrition/health is viewed in my country. I’m not sure if it’s like this anywhere else but it’s this weird mix of people wanting to be health nuts and arguing with each other about the latest fad diet and people who are obese either because they don’t have access to healthy food/information or because they just don’t care. Every day you read an article about “Keto is life, cures cancer” or “plant based will save your heart forever”...”eggs are great” ...”eggs will put you in an early grave” and so on and so forth.

The worst part is people arguing with each other who have only gotten their information from biased sources or Yahoo articles. Can we all just agree that one diet isn’t going to work for everyone? There is no magic answer or secret to losing weight and adversely,  being thin doesn’t necessarily mean healthy! I get that people get excited about this stuff and I always encourage healthy lifestyle changes. But there is so much more to it than just weight loss or eating a specific way.

I’m going a little off track but that’s basically it. I’m tired of the way nutrition is viewed and I truly believe it contributes to extremely unhealthy behaviors in our society.

"It’s not easy for two people to work 35 tables at once. On a Saturday, during busy hours, after payday.","Me and my colleague worked our asses off for four straight hours trying to serve our customers as fast and as best as possible. It was on peak hours on Saturday, and instead of sending more servers to help out, the manager only sent food staff so we could make more profit. I’ve seen a bunch of tables walk out, people not even asking for the bill and straight up left the restaurant because they knew how busy we were. People cancelled orders because the head chef was supervising a new cook, and one other server was two hours late. It’s fun working there, but I hope our manager(s) understand that when something goes wrong in a restaurant, it’s always the waiters and servers who get blamed on at the moment. It sucks. 



"
a letter to my (former) long-distance best friend (long),"dear k,

i hope you're well. i know i've been distant lately and i figure i owe you an explanation. for a long time i've felt like there's been a growing imbalance in our relationship. i put in a lot of effort to maintain our friendship, with calls and texts and packages/gifts among other things, and i just feel like it's not being reciprocated.

when you texted me before christmas - about not hearing from me for a while - it was the first time in over two months you contacted me without me initiating it. i'll call, or text before i call, and i won't get a response for hours most of the time, not even a 'sorry, i'm busy, i'll text when i can' message. when i asked you about it, referencing the time you took almost 12 hours to return a text, you blamed your toddler son for having your phone and told me i should just call if i don't get a response so that way you'll definitely hear it. when i tried your solution, you didn't answer the phone and you still didn't even text me back.

i told you that it hurts to always be the one to initiate contact. that i feel sad when i don't hear from you for weeks on end. you got upset and told me it was unfair to expect you to make the first call or text every once in a while because 'this is how it's always been'. you're right, it has always been this way - but it doesn't have to continue being this way, especially if it's hurting me. you were mad at me for feeling sad, and you blamed me for being sad when all i wanted was a blue moon text - 'hey, thought about you today, hope you're good'. why is that so hard for you? why is that too much to ask?

at your family's party, you all-but-ignored me, and when i said so during our last call you blamed me because i was 'acting shy'. i felt awkward and out of place and unwanted by your family, not to mention my anxiety disorder, and i didn't want to bother you because you seemed to be having such a good time with everyone else. i felt really, really, really alone - especially since my best friend didn't appear to want to spend any time with me. 

last month, i found out you were here, in my town, for over 24 hours and you didn't contact me once - even though i asked you to (and you said you would) try to make time for me. i know i'm not your only friend. hell, i'm not even your only best friend. and i know you have responsibilities and priorities i don't. but it really, really hurts to feel like i'm not a priority to you at all. 

i'll give you credit - you reached out after not hearing from me and messaged me when you thought something was wrong. but i can only recall one other time you've done this, and i was really struggling then, as well. this just feels like i'm the only one invested in our friendship. and honestly, it shouldn't be this hard. yes, friendships are work but they should also be inspiring and fun and uplifting and i haven't felt that for a while now, because i always feel like i'm putting in all the work for the both of us.

i realized that when you reached out, you were mad. you were mad at me for not reaching out to you and that made you worry about me. you were literally mad that you were worried about me. i've always thought that friends who care about each other should worry about each other from time to time, that's just part of the ups and downs of life. i told you i was upset and had to take a step back from our relationship, and you made me apologize for that. i wish i could rescind that apology, because it was completely unnecessary. you didn't ask me why i felt like i needed to take a step back or were concerned at all that i was unhappy - you were just mad that i didn't give you a heads up that i might not actually be the one to text first.

i asked you to come spend a weekend with me and you said 'sure', but i think we both knew it wasn't going to happen. but then, to find out that you'll be spending a week here in town with your other best friend... and to not even find out from you? did you think i wouldn't want to know? did you hope i wouldn't find out? when i asked if you were coming for a different event you finally told me. your thought: ""oh, yeah, i guess you'll want to know about that"". of course, i would want to know that my best friend is coming into town. of course, i would want to find time to see you. because i think about you, and care about you, and worry about you. why don't you want to feel those things for me?

i don't want to be your back-up best friend. i don't want to be the one who always slips your mind. and even if that's not true, even if you tell me i'm exaggerating, that's how i feel. i try really hard to make you feel cared for and special and important and loved, and i haven't felt any of those things from you in a long time. i'm sorry if i let you down, but you let me down, too.

i don't know what else to say, except i can't keep doing this. i can't keep trying to carry our friendship all on my own. if you want to talk about this and try to work on making things easier and lighter for the both of us, i'm open to trying. but i can't keep going the way things have been. i feel used up, thrown away, and so incredibly disrespected - as if my friendship has not just been unreciprocated but unappreciated and unwelcome. 

i really loved being your best friend, and i really loved you. but this is just too much and too damn hard anymore. and it's just not fair. i don't know if the right thing to do is to try and fix this or just call the whole thing off. all i know is that i'm not willing to continue our friendship in the same way anymore. i love you, but i have to start taking care of myself. i hope you can understand."
I lost my virginity to a hooker at the age of 25.,I have anxiety and have suffered from depression in the past. I can't have a single meaningful conversation with someone unless I talk to them on a daily basis. So I decided I will pay for sex rather than not knowing what it feels like. It was not great the first time and I came way too early. But I go to a hooker almost once a month and it is getting better.
"Friends didn't invite me to their get-together/reunion, saw it on social media.","At first I was bummed out, but I realized I had a great time without them playing video games with my brother. I don't usually spend time with him because I have an extreme distaste in his persona but it was fun spending time with him. I think I hate him a lot less now that I can swear at him (jokingly.) Plus with my social anxiety it would've caused more bad feelings than good. "
Why it went wrong,"We planned it already. How we prioritize owning a house first before the marriage. Everything is okay for  four years. Lots of challenges but still managed to survive our relationship. I'm planning to propose to her this year.  Our weekends revolves around  watching Netflix, play with our dogs, sleep and go to malls if we have the extra budget. We're tight because we're saving for the house and the wedding. Everything is fine. However, we broke up. I destroyed our relationship. I cheated. I'm still hoping that we can be still together, I really don't know what to do or feel. I'm lost."
I litter....a lot,"I throw stuff out of my car window all the time. Soda bottles, candy wrappers, gum wrappers, french fry containers. If no one is around to see it, I just toss it out my window. It's just easier than driving to a garbage can. Why should I have to keep that in my car. 

&#x200B;

I do not tell anyone this because it seems uncool with all the nature people now-a-days but I think everyone does it and hides it. "
"I CAN’T STOP THINKING ABOUT HER! I have a gay female friend and I don’t know if she wants FWB, something else (maybe a relationship) or is this all just in my head?","I’m a 21-year-old guy studying at uni. When I started in October 2017 I slowly got to know everyone in my class and very quickly became friends with them all. One of my new friends is a girl that is a few months younger than me. Soon after I started uni I was 20 and she was 19.

As the months went on I became quite close with her and learned that she’s gay. She didn’t keep it a secret but on the other hand never made it headline news. Me and her got on very well from the start as we learned that we both were spiritual people and even though we didn’t have much in common, we liked hanging out during class.

As uni went on, we worked together in class most of the time and as I was also good friends with the other members of my class we all used to hangout afterwards. Including my female friend. Who I will refer to as V. 

Because me and V were close, one day I told her that I had a crush on another girl in our class. I’ll refer to her as Y. When I told V, she then told me that she thought that Y was hot too, in a jokey way but I new that she did mean it because she told me that she was gay. 

Every guy wanted to either sleep with Y or be in a relationship with her and even though I was a fairly confident guy and was kind of friends with her, I never pursued her. During my process of getting over Y, I would confide in V and a couple of my other classmates. Those few class mates listened to me and gave me advice but even though V listened she didn’t stay on the topic for too long. It was like she wasn’t acknowledging it. (In a polite way)

My friendship with V has always been good, she’s told me a lot about her family and has also told me about a old guy friend that she once fell in love with. This was kind of confusing because as I said she told me she was gay.

One day after school, a few of us were hanging out at the local dorms in the common room downstairs. V was also there. And because me and her were close, she would mainly sit with me. This is when V told a few of us that she had slept with a guy from another class. This didn’t affect me in any way because I only saw her as a friend but I couldn’t deny that she was really attractive. The guy that she slept with and continued to sleep with was a typical nice guy. I got on with him very well whenever I saw him around. When V told us that she had slept with him she explained why. She said that he would treat her really well and his quiet and somewhat less confident demeanour was cute. She told us that this guy was a virgin and that she new that before sleeping with him and that this is one reason she pursued him over a few months until he got the hints.

Whilst we were working on a project, The topic of relationships came up. This was because of some news that was going around about Y. Throughout mine and V’s conversation she asked me if I have ever been in relationship before. I replied honestly and said “no”. She then replied by saying that she couldn’t work it out because she thought that I was good looking guy, tall, funny, dressed well, etc. My response to that was that I just haven’t met the right girl. (I did mean this because I realised that I just lusted Y and liked the idea of being in a relationship with her). V had also mentioned that she had never been in a relationship (this was well before this conversation)

Throughout our time of getting to know each other, V knew that I was not the type of guy that would just sleep around with any girl. She referred to this in our conversation and before she even said anything, I knew what question she was going to ask next.

Without her even asking the the question I said to her “I know what your gonna ask....... and the answer’s yes”. When I told V, I didn’t feel nervous or ashamed. Because I wasn’t. But it felt weird because I had never told a female friend before.

As we carried on our conversation, V asked if i was the type of guy to only sleep with a girl that I was in a relationship with or...... if I would sleep with a girl that I was close with. My response was instant. “I feel like for my first time it would have to be with a girl that I am in a relationship with, because I’m a intimate type of guy”. But this wasn’t the truth. The truth was that I would want my first time to be with a girl that I am close with and who was close with me. It didn’t really matter if I was in a relationship or if I was just friends but I didn’t tell her this because I didn’t want her to think that I was telling her so that she would sleep with me because I respected her and only saw her as a friend. From this point we just talked about other things for the rest of the day.

Fast forward eight months and the entire cohort has just finished their final project of the year. So we’re all at the pub hanging out. During the night I’m sitting with two friends having a decent conversation and V comes and sits next to me. At this point the two guys I am sitting with have a conversation between themselves. So me and V start talking. 

The conversation started of light, as we didn’t work on the same team this time (the groups were set by the uni) we were catching up. Throughout our conversation V randomly brings up the topic of a TV series that we both watched. And said that she couldn’t believe that I watched that particular show. The conversation was not leading in that direction to be honest. But I responded by saying that it’s one of the best TV series. You might be thinking that she was drunk out of her mind but in all honesty she wasn’t, she only had one drink. I thought to myself in my mind that this is a bit strange, because when anyone is having a conversation with someone there is somewhat of a flow and in this case, at this time there wasn’t.

And this is where the conversation completely turned. Moments later V said these exact words to me. “I flirt with you all the time but you seem to just keep it friendly...........”. 

At this point I awkwardly laughed and then just didn’t know what to do or say. I hesitated and looked away but I could see out the corner of my eye that she was still looking at me. This is where one of my other classmates (from my new class) had saw me and came over to say hi. So I got up told V that I’ll be back in a sec and went over to say hi to my other friend.

But the thing is I never went back to V...... I just stayed with those friends the rest of the night. 

A couple of days later, we were all back in class as normal and during lunch we were all at the cafe. This is where I saw V again. She came over to sit with us and we were all having a casual conversation. V dropped into the conversation that she was talking to this guy at the pub and thought that he was hot and told us that he had asked for her number.

It’s now been two months since that night at the pub and from this point my friendship with V is still good..... I guess. I mean she still is how she was with me before but, I don’t know, I feel that she has become a bit distant. 

The guy that’s she is sleeping with always comes to her class during lunch to hang out, pretty much all the time. I see them leave together after uni, but she doesn’t say that he is her boyfriend and doesn’t want people to think that.

I feel like I’m getting mixed signals from her. 

I’ll give you an example, it had been a few days since I had seen V, I didn’t spend to much time with her but for the time that I did she was being really affectionate towards me. But a couple of days ago when I went into her class to hang out with a few other friends (I didn’t expect her to be there, she hardly comes into class) she was with the guy and she was being really affectionate with him. And to be honest, she didn’t acknowledge that I was even there, she came over at the last minute to just say hi.

But today during lunch I was in her class and when she came in she hugged me from behind for a really long time. And she had her arms round me with her hands on my chest. I was joking around when this happened to guess who was behind me. One of my guesses was a guy friend (I knew it was her all along) and she said “I have my tits pushed up against the back of your head and you guess (the guy friend). And then she continued to keep pressing up against the back of my head whilst she was standing behind me, which was the whole of lunch.

Honestly I have no idea what to think of this! What’s your thought to whoever reads this. Do you think she’s just really flirty could she be hinting towards FWB or could there be some hidden signs for something (link a relationship) or do you think it’s just all in my head. 

I want to thank you for reading to the end and look forward to hearing from you. 

Thanks

I was bullied by a group of racist Nazis today.,"I encountered a terrible group of evil Nazis. I try to spread love and peace but even I have my limits. They were racist, then cursed at me, then called me a troll because I cared for immigrant families being held in camps. Sorry I just needed to vent."
I’m afraid of being alone on my 21st,"My 21 birthday is coming up and I honestly have no friends... I have a boyfriend and family but they all work. 

I asked my boyfriend if he could ask off so we could spend the day together because I love celebrating special occasions.. but his reaction to it just showed me he didn’t plan on asking off and I told him it wasn’t a big deal since I knew it wasn’t an important day for him. 

I know this isn’t something terrible but I really didn’t want to bring this up with him because I don’t want to seem like I’m guilting him. I just wish I had at least one person that I could celebrate my birthday with.."
Miss you like crazy,"It's been a couple years without you, but there still isn't a day that goes by that you don't cross my mind. Every day, you are still there, and every day I still miss you. We were not the healthiest couple by any means, and being split apart is no doubt the best thing for us. We were toxic to each other, but we still loved each other very much. Unfortunately the relationship took it's toll on the both of us, shattering us and leaving it in pieces. I wish I would have been a better man to you, afterall, you were the woman of my dreams. I hurt you too many times and I deserved to have you walk away from me. I take responsibility for it all, I know I screwed up big time. My personality disroder is not to blame, but it indeed made it more difficult to hold a healthy relationship. If only I could've gotten my anger and temper under control sooner, and maybe none of the lashing out would've happened. I still think about the shit I did every day, and I will forever live with the regret of my actions and words towards you. You never deserved the abuse. I was a terrible person to you when I should have been the best thing to ever happen to you. I should've treated you better and loved you the correct way. 

I'm still a loner and not much has changed in my life. I'd like to think I've gotten my issues more under control, but sometimes those issues can slip through the cracks. I'm so sorry for all the negative things I did to you, and I wish I could take it all back. I just wish I could press rewind and somehow fix myself to where we would still be the cute couple we were today. If by any chance you are reading this (removed).; just know I am so sorry, for everything, from the bottom of my heart. I miss you, and I love you very much. You'll always be my honey bunches of sunshine. 

I hope you are doing well for yourself, and I hope you've been okay. Last time we talked you seem to have been going through a rough patch in your life, and I truly hope you made it out for the better. You're always welcome to reach out to me, I know there will never be anything romantic between us again, but I will not break my promise to you when I said I'll never abandon you. I am always here for you and always willing to listen. I will always be your shoulder if you don't have one. I promised that to you then, and I promise that to you now.  Sorry for my rambling. 

To the strangers reading this who have made it this far, thank you.

Love and miss you (removed).

Catching feelings for my fwb.. *LONG POST*,"Backstory: let’s name him “Jay”. Me and Jay were in high school together. I was the manager of the wrestling team and at the time I was dating the varsity wrestling captain. I remember the first time I saw Jay. Immediately caught my attention; he was wrestling with the captain (my x) and I was like wow who is this dude. He’s cute af. So fast forward few months later. My x was emotionally abusive. I was easily manipulated. So we broke it off but we were still talking to each other. And I was becoming really good friends with Jay. I confided in him. I trusted him. He was amazing. I ended up catching feelings for him, and I had sex with him. I was his first. I felt kind of guilty because they were friends, but I honestly fell in love with this kid while I still had feelings for my ex. It was weird. I know people don’t believe you can have feelings for two different people and I thought the same until that happened to me. Because I genuinely cared about the both of them deeply. Anyways, x came back around.. and I pretty much had to make a choice between the two of them.. but I was so strung up on my x still... I knew in my heart that if I chose Jay, it would be the best choice for me. But it was hard to let go of the history I had with my x... then I realized, I loved jay so much that I didn’t feel I deserved him. I told him I didn’t want him to be an option.. because he was more than that. Much more. He deserved better than me. And of course he didn’t care but I couldn’t do that to him.. he needs to be someone’s only choice because they know he’s the most amazing guy.. I made him hate me so he could get over me and move on to someone better.. me and my x ended up breaking up after another 6 months bc the abuse was too much for me... I eventually confronted Jay and told him what I did and apologized and we have kept in contact since. We’ve been good friends.


FASTFORWARD 4-5 YRS LATER: 

So I have gotten engaged with someone and also got pregnant. Gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and my x fiancé and I weren’t in good terms, he was very mean to me towards the end of our relationship... So now I’m a single mother. Throughout the whole time, me and Jay would still talk and ask each other how we were. That type of stuff. We would hang out together occasionally and smoke. Just as friends. And everything was nice but I still had that love for him.. I remember telling my best friends about how I still had feelings for Jay, even though I told him I didn’t because he said he didn’t when we were casually talking about our past.. well I hit him up the other day to smoke with me out of nowhere.. I just wanted some company. And things got heated between the two of us, I felt the sexual tension. So we ended up having sex. And I was on top of the world. Kissing him for the first time again in years felt like fireworks went off in my brain and a garden of butterflies danced in my stomach. 
I felt high on the feeling of kissing him and him holding me.. when I was engaged I never felt anything like that.. (I was engaged to a narcissist) jay caressed my face and held my hands and kissed me with so much passion I literally felt like I was drowning in love. He wanted to give me pleasure and I’ve never had sex with someone who solely just wanted me to have pleasure.. so I offered to be FWB and he agreed.. 
I should’ve known better though tbh, because I know I have never gotten over Jay. I’m literally in love with him but I know he deserves more than me.. but I can’t help but feel this way. He makes me feel like I’m the only girl in the world.. he makes me feel loved. And I know he cares about me which makes the feeling so much more genuine.. But at the same time I know it will never be anything more than this... I’m going to end up having to stop our FWB.. not now though. I still want him around just a little bit longer, even though it’s probably unhealthy for me.. I love him and always have and this fucking sucks..
"
Why do I care SO MUCH about what people think?,"As a flipping grown ass man, I know I should t care but when I’m at work and no one wants to have a casual conversation.... It feels like a kick in the balls... "
I’ve been feeling stressed and irritable,"It was a really long day for me, and now I can’t sleep. I woke up in a bad mood this morning, I was very irritable. I know I’m feeling a-bit stressed with midterms and writing papers for school. But this morning I was in such a bad mood, I decided to do a very selfish thing and wake my fiancé up from his sleep and in hopes that a kiss good morning and cuddles would cheer me up. I was wrong, maybe I should’ve tried to go back to sleep a little longer. As my day went on anything that he said or did would tick me off, at one point he was fed with it and we got into an argument. Which I went from feeling irritable to depressed. I knew he had done his best to cheer me up, but I soon realized I can’t depend on someone to make me feel better about myself. I know, it’s selfish. He took me out to dinner and a movie, before then I was already feeling better I joked around with him things were looking better and I just couldn’t wait home to study and snuggle up with him. But on our way back home he told a crude joke that I didn’t appreciate so I told him I how felt towards it and  it upset him. It was a quiet ride home and I went directly to my text book. After about an hour or so I wanted to apologize to him but It wasn’t working. I tried talking but nothing really changed. Now I lie here at 5am not irritable but now depressed. I know, I was selfish and if I could back and change things I would. I’m just very sorry I know I’m a big idiot. I don’t know what got into me, I don’t know why I was so irritable. "
Family troubles,"I have always been told that I’d take over the family business that my grandfather started in 79, but I’m far from that. I have anticipated do this my whole life, which caused me to slide by schooling by the skin of my teeth, not worried about what I need to do for a living because I had it figured out I wasn’t interested in other careers or lines of work because of it. Well when I turned 16 I was told to finish school which is reasonable no questions asked. Once I graduated I moved in with my dad (the current owner) and asked to work for him then, while I went to college. He replied with “get some work experience first” so I did no problem got whatever job I could. Worked 4 jobs in a span of 2 years, 3 of them at the same time. After settling down I asked him then and he said to be 21 to be a delivery driver so when I turned 21, you guessed it he still didn’t hire me. But this time was different he then said he didn’t think I should work for him at all. I’m now 22 with a very good union job making more than I would there at the time being. Well I found out today that he hired his new girlfriends daughters boyfriend (I know long connection) who is only 18 for the delivery driver. My dad does this thing where he puts his kids on the back burner when it comes to his SO children and in this case their SO’s. Maybe I don’t have a reason to be as irritated as I am, it’s just so frustrating knowing I can’t say anything because I know he’ll have this all flipped back on me as if I was over reacting."
My moms back in prison,"My moms been in and out of prison my whole life, mainly for selling and doing meth. she was arrested in my county at the beginning of the year and was sent to a state prison last month, i found out about this the other week and im still fucked up about it. i haven’t seen her in over ten years (im 18 now). i dont really know what to do to be honest, or how to feel. i love her but its hard to love a stranger. im thinking about going to see her over the summer. "
"Why did you choose her to love, and me to crush?","The more I think about it, the more I feel like I don't know you any more.  The more I think about it, the dumber I feel. 

You always said you were insecure, you were not used to this and that, you had family problems and drama... all of that I believed were true.  I believed in all of your excuses, even the ones that were not convincing.  When you did not even bother to make an excuse, I would make one up for you before you even talk to me.  

So many things you claimed to not be able to do.  So many things you said to make me feel sorry for you... even to the very last second of our relationship you still chose to lie to me - giving me all that ""I'm not ready to date.  I don't have the capacity to. I need to deal with the problems in my family first."" BS...If only I knew you were talking about that girl literally 2 hours before you broke up with me.  Little did I know.  

Thinking back, I realized you lied to me over and over again, and I always found excuses for you and I always forgave you for whatever you did, assuming you were not very well emotionally and you didn't know any other way. I tried my very best to fucking support you in every way I could... but things like accompanying me to the doctor's clinic, to text back every few hours, or to make plans for special dates were too much to ask for.  You were never available to support me.  How did I not see that? 

You cheated on me, and told me you held it in for 2 years.  I fucking forgave you just the next day, cos I thought you've already punished yourself enough shouldering all that grief and shame for so long.  I promised you the incident would not be mentioned again from then on.  And I kept my promise... until I realized how much of an idiot I was. 

I came to your place and cooked for your sister when your mother and you went travelling.  I bought your mother gifts and presents multiple times, just because I knew she liked those things.  I loved you, and I tried to contribute to your family as well... what I didn't know was that, after we took a break and got back together, you hid me from all of them for 7 months.  You then lied about your family not wanting any visitors (while on the other hand telling me about this person visiting and that person coming over for dinner all the time.) So I guess you were that ashamed of me... I didn't have any fucking clue.  I continued to buy your mom presents - even after the break up when I thought we were on good terms.  Before alllllll these lies unveiled.  

I gave you everything - money, body, mind, soul.  I handed all I had over with two hands and you crushed it like a dried leaf in your hand.  Any chance I could get you something you like I would, often spending more money than I would ever spend on myself.  

You used your depression as your excuse to treat me like shit.  I had depression because of you.  AND somehow I still found the way to convince myself to forgive you.  

And there you were, enthusiastically talking about your new love interest just 2 feet behind me 1 month after we broke up.  You knew I was in the room. You didn't care.  You took a fucking family trip to visit her in another country, when you failed to even make plans 1 month in advance with me.  

And yet you said you loved me.  And I fucking believed in you.

I often have this thought - and tbh I hate this about myself - I sort of wish you have a partner you _ABSOLUTELY LOVE with all your heart and mind and soul_ cheat on you and lie to you. And even so you couldn't stop loving them.  I wish you that.  Then I would wish you good luck with the rest of your life.  

p.s. I was hesitant about typing all this, as I was actually almost totally over you and all of this... didn't want to remind myself what I was trying to forget.  But I guess I needed to be heard.  Given you ignored me then blocked me on basically everything. my feelings need to be expressed. so here I am, reddit. Thanks for reading. "
Feeling weird in my age group because of not being of social media (been ill for a few years)- tips on how to get back into it?,"18F, throwaway, I need advice on making a social media account. I never usually talk about my life so far so I went off on one for a while, hope you all don’t mind. I’ll leave a TLDR at the bottom anyway☺️

I was fairly popular for the first couple years of high school (age 11-16 is high school in England). I had lots of friends in and out of my year and a close knit group of friends, everyone I knew was on social media. I was on Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat etc. from about 10 to 14 years old and had a good following of friends on all of them. 

After deciding what subjects I was going to choose for GCSE’s I got ill. Just before my 14th birthday I got a fever which led to chronic fatigue syndrome (aka CFS, it’s pretty common to get it when you’re a teenager) which was so bad I wasn’t able to get out of bed for ages. This changed everything in my life, I didn’t speak to different people every day, I didn’t see my friends everyday and I drifted off of social media. It was hard to keep up with people and watch them doing different things when I didn’t have anything to share. I came off and eventually deleted my Instagram, Twitter and Snapchat (I still have my old Facebook account to talk with friends but I don’t post on it). My friend group shrunk a lot due to being off social media and not being in school until I only had 3 or 4 close mates. All this was okay for the most part, it was hard to adjust from having a lot of friends to only a couple close ones but my illness was getting better and I ended up passing all my GCSE’s even with less than 40% attendance. 
I didn’t realise how hard college was going to be and how much it would change my friendship group. A couple of my friends fought and drifted apart and some went off to do apprenticeships so I was left with not many friends in college to talk with. Not having a social media page meant it was hard to make new friends or keep in contact with old ones, the pressure of A-level tests and a full time schedule with being ill meant I dropped out after a few months. I worked for a while and unsuccessfully tried to go back to college the next year even though I kept getting ill. 

I’m 18 now and all except one of my old mates have gone to uni so these past couple of months have been the most lonely. I’m a lot better health-wise, despite being at home a lot of the time I do text people pretty regularly and go clubbing with my friend and some of her mates. I’m planning on taking an access course to get into uni once I turn 19, it’s getting to the point where I feel a lot better so I’m meeting more people and starting a new job next week. I’d love to hear any advice you guys have on social media, compared to my mates I don’t know anything tbh. I’d mostly want to start on Snap or Insta again but I don’t feel like I have enough people to add or follow on either. Any technical advice would also be appreciated, like I said I know literally fuck all 😂

TL:DR- I used to have lots of social media accounts when I was 14, I got ill and couldn’t keep it up so I stopped using them. Now I feel better a lot has changed and I want to figure out how to get back into it. Any advice?"
Alone next to someone.,"I'm so alone when I'm with you. I want to go down on you and tonight you rejected me again. I'm sexually frustrated and horny but my needs and wants don't actually matter unless I remind you I have them. You ignore my texts about us being intimate every time I try to bring it up so I'm tired of texting what I want you to do to me. I know you're stoic but for fuck's sake, show that you love me more. There are people in my life constantly trying to court me; why the fuck are you spacing out on me? I just want to be with you."
I'm not doing this anymore. Neither should a lot of people.,"> Self-righteous anger also can be *very enjoyable*.  In a perverse way we can actually *take satisfaction from the fact that many people annoy us*, for it brings a comfortable feeling of superiority.  Gossip barbed with our anger, a polite form  of murder by character assassination, has its satisfactions for us, too. Here we are not trying to help those we criticize; we are trying to proclaim our own righteousness.

I'm thinking about quitting my study and I think I feel at peace with it,"I haven't told most people yet and I haven't made the final decision yet because I want to discuss it with my parents first.

&#x200B;

When I was 15, I already knew I wanted to study Philosophy and despite some setback due to my mental health, I made it and started in 2017. Then in the beginning of 2018, I started suffering from depression, it caused me to miss classes and eventually to fail. I sought help and decided to try and start over the year (which isn't normally allowed except when certain problems caused you to fail which was the case).

(One of the things that fueled my depression was that I didn't know how to answer exam questions. I knew anything from the curriculum and could write perfect essays on it, but I didn't know how to word my answer in the way the professors wanted me to write it down. It caused me to either get low sufficient grades or high insufficient grades (think a 5.7 or a 5.3). I asked professors for help and followed a course specifically to learn this as well. To no avail.)

For some reason, the exam committee didn't want me to study there again. They never gave me a valid reason to deny me so with the help of my partner, I went higher up. After a battle that lasted a few months, I was accepted as a student again. I still suffered from depression, but I thought I would manage. 

Again, my grades were shit, even though I now know that I am smart enough to study, I just can't answer those damn questions. My depression flared up again and my therapist was no help so I switched to an angel of a therapist. I studied my ass off with witnesses to confirm but still got insufficient grades and it messed with me, badly. 

&#x200B;

Right now I don't think I'll make this year grade-wise. I'm thinking about quitting before the end of the academic year, work for a year or two, work on my mental health and to grow more maturely. Then, I'll try it again or maybe I'll choose a different subject to study, who knows. I used to get stressed out thinking of quitting. I worked so hard for this and then I would throw it away? But I won't. I have learned a lot, and maybe it's just not the right time for me. I have all the time in the world, so why not use it to get better instead of stressing/studying myself to death?

&#x200B;

Before I actually quit, I want to discuss it with my parents since they have supported me a lot and they should know my reasoning. I hope this is the right decision. "
I just want to be myself more than anything.,I  wanna be myself so badly. Im tired of wearing this mask. acting like i care about things that i don't. I just want to be myself but I'm scared the people I've known for so long will think I've changed and that I'm an asshole. I literally don't care about the things people talk to me about at all. it doesn't interest me in the slightest. All i care about is my passion and doing what i love to do and literally nothing else and i just want to be free and indulge in it fully but I'm scared to be boring or looked at as a selfish asshole. I just want to express myself and speak from the heart and the pit of my stomach but i feel like people will misunderstand me. I wanna tell people when i don't care without seeming rude so bad. I wanna tell people how i truly feel without seeming like an asshole so bad but Im scared they'll dislike me and I'll upset them but i don't want to do that to people but at the same time I'm tried of keeping everything inside. It's driving me insane. 
I feel fucking stuck,"I actually don't know what to do. I'm scared that this will be the third week I'll be spending in bed, and my last chances everywhere are being spent. Even though I'm consciously watching everything fall apart and get worse, I just can't seem to pull it together long enough to get through any commitment. My family and friends see me as unreliable, but I don't blame them. Sometimes I'll see friends on the weekends, but I don't think I've done anything more extreme than a flat terrain hike in the last year. I'm always tired and I barely have enough energy to do my job. I haven't had sex in three years, and very few dates seem to drift my way. I've tried to put myself 'out there' on dating apps and such, but every date has been a fucking disaster. 

It shouldn't be this hard to get up in the morning and go to a few classes. I need to graduate. I just can't find the motivation to do anything, no matter what. Therapy, medication, moral support; they're all there. Honestly I just feel so fucking lonely I don't know what to do.

"Three years worth of gas lighting, self-depreciation, and numbness...","Throwaway because I'll be pouring all my emotions into this while trying to not be specific.

Ever since young I have this weird thing where I recall certain events and repeat it in my head thousands of times. It's as if my brain is stuck in a loop until another event take over. It wasn't until highschool that I learned its called ruminating or intrustive thoughts.

This wasn't a problem, as I was extremly self-centered and anti-social so there will only be a few days out of a few months where it happened, given the lack of interaction I have with people. As I grew up, I knew as a fact I will need a social group for the future. I would also need to do so to find ""love"". Logically, I try to become more social, more ""human"". I opened myself up to people, trying to gain a few friends. What I didn't realize is that people are strange. They say the randomest hurtful things at unexpected times. They tell you to do thing one way but you see them doing it in another way without explaining why. They people expect you to know things immediately because it's ""intuitive"". How can I achieve any of this if no one tells me how to? Especially if I'm isolated as hell from birth. Where do I aquire these ""natural"" human traits. Don't get me wrong, I dont hate people. I know extremely well that I may have aspergers, or high functioning autism. But none of my doctors said shit. I looked into the fucking mirror every day trying to see if my looks match those google pics of people with autism, down syndrome, whatever mental disability I can find. BUT I LOOK FUCKING NORMAL.

I know the title says ""three years"" but as I type more and more about this, I realized it's the entire way that I've been different. The latest chapter in my life does say these three years are more impactful than the rest. Everything around me changed in these three years. I can't catch up. People dont lend me a hand. When I worked faster than everyone, I couldn't explain to them how I did it. That's because I was inebt in speaking. When I worked slower than everyone, I can't hear their voice speaking to me. That's because my hearing is nearly gone.  I'm frustrated. There's no way out. I'm sick in the head and there's no way out. I wan't help. I don't want to hurt myself. There's this voice that counters everything I say. I realize exactly what's wrong, but my body does it the wrong way anyway. I ask questions for answers that I already know. These three years its as if my body is not mine, as if my mind has been taken to a place far, far away.

I know the clicks and clinks of how to speak to people, but when words come out of my mouth they become jumbled. Why am I making my words fancy... Why am I doing this? I talk to myself all day because I'm afraid to waste people time with my non-sensenable speech.

I realized that I might have a stroke that changed my personality, or fucked with my neural circuits. Something has happened in these three years. Something has taken over this world. I feel like I'm being watched. It's like the trueman show but with no exit. There's has to be another person watching from high above. There's no way all these people I meet in life are so perfectly fucked up and perfect at the same time. No stars can align themselves so perfectly like this. The bees are dying, the planet is dying, I'm fucking dying. I hate myself. I hate my powerlessness. I want to strangle this frustation and I dont know where to fucking go.

Use me as a case for your master thesis. Its okay. Tell your professor that who the hell will want to waste 40 minutes of their life typing away nonsense. ""Well you see, Charles, this is a classic case of   ████  where the patient is obviously seeking attention."" No, just no. Fuck off. Tell your professor to fuck off. I'm sick damn it. The earth is fucking round and not flat. I'm privileged to be having this computer to type. I'm privileged to be able to know this much. I'm privileged to know there are other people out there like me. But I don't want to tell the world I'm different. Trace the IP. Fuck it.

I want to add more to this but my mind is going blank. I feel numb again. The passion is fading. Every damn time I want to start something big. Something that would go as far as improving my life, I just quit. That one time I told myself I would exercise, I did it for two months and got an ab. Then never again did I try exercise. That one time I told myself I would become a great coder, I searched until my eyes were tired only to stop when faced with the false realization of ""I dont really like this anyway."" So I stopped and switched over. ""Maybe animation will be my schtick and.... Gone."" As soon as the passion strikes, it ends.

I never asked for much. I never robbed, stoled, raped, killed, as a normal person should. Never betrayed unless I had to. Never in a thousand years would I want to feel pleasure out of others displeasure. Yet I sought that tear from the others cheek. A thousand persona and one container is how I feel on a good day. One million persona and no container is how I feel when the fucking trains are delayed, when I step on dog shit, when I fall for a girl only for her to move away the next week, when I try to talk to people and realized my teeth are unclean, when I make a correction only to be corrected and turned out I'm correct all along. Why must I go through all the menial shit when there's more important things I have to do. Why must you walk so slowly and be in the middle. Why must you wear a fucking headset yet I can hear your shitty music 6 seats away. Why do you hurt yourself if you know that cigarette will kill you. Why can't I just have a small dream and have it come true. Why must I use repetition and meta to express my pain. How do you write in a interesting and catching manner when there have been millions of fucking books written in millions of fucking ways. Whats the fucking point of a research paper informing you of something you already know damn well and have hundreds of copies from previous years! Can I get a fucking Ph.D for screaming on top of my lungs about people falling for the simpilist things that I fall too.

Tl;Dr: It's all about me damn it. Don't waste your time reading this unless you're in the medical fields. I frustrate myself trying to be in the middle of everything. Trying to bring Ying to the Yang and Yang to the Ying. Balance is so delicate. Much more delicate than my mind. So, my solution to everything is numbness.

I'm not a literature graduate so I can't format at all and my attention span is very short, please ignore the typos and run-on sentences. I'm in distress so my thoughts are sporadic and all over the place so I jump from topic to topic. Please forgive me. I want to write these down first.  I haven't slept at all during these three years. I feel like I'm being choked every damn night I sleep.

&#x200B;"
I Resent My Girlfriend,"I resent my girlfriend for the person she has turned me into.

&#x200B;

Before meeting her, I was a generally outgoing individual. I often traveled, met people sporadically at bars, social events, and made great connections with others this way. My girlfriend at the time was very encouraging of this, and never questioned it. We broke up for other reasons, but this aspect of my self was something that was very real for me. I met my current girlfriend several months after breaking up with my ex, and she seemed great at the start. I think back to when we first met, and there was never any expectation of me as a partner. I felt like she found someone she enjoyed spending time with, and I found the same as well. Three years later, I feel like I'm constantly trying to placate her, my actions are consistently under scrutiny, I can never do enough for her. This has killed my self esteem.

&#x200B;

Several months in, and I encounter my first point of resentment. My girlfriend ended up being a belligerent drinker. She would get so wasted, that she'd go and start flirting with other people, talk smack to me in front of friends and acquaintances, and toy with my newfound emotions for her. I feel stupid for staying with her though all of this, and accepting that her apologies were sincere, and that such things would never happen again. Unfortunately, this happened occasionally throughout the relationship, and every time, I never did anything, I just accepted that this was the mood she was in. My anxiety would kick in, and I would go into a defensive mode. I would try to appease her, and make her feel calmer, even though I was dying inside, and I was hurting greatly. When I would bring it up the following morning, I would get not much more of an apology. She has reduced the amount of times this has happened, but the fact that this has already happened again in the past month means things have not changed.

&#x200B;

My second point of resentment is her consistent criticisms about anything I do. It can be that my dishes aren't done, my clothes clash, I forgot to buy her favorite flower when I purchased the bouquet, or my that my car broke down making me late for dinner. All of these things stem from something **I did** and never how the situation panned out. If I show up wearing the wrong thing, the date is ruined. If I didn't follow up on something that she briefly mentioned 5 weeks ago, I am not attentive. If my body is physically tired from working all day, and I ask for a break from cooking dinner, I am lazy. Complements are rare, but criticisms are plenty. I have internalized this, and I scrutinize myself every day. I always try to think of the things that I am doing wrong out of fear of angering my girlfriend when I see her, and have her be in a bad mood.

&#x200B;

My third point of resentment is how she lashes out her bad moods on me. I often follow up and ask, ""what's wrong?"", she tells me, and I try to be supportive and understand. However, if the feeling doesn't go away, she begins to lash out the anger on me. She tells me how I don't understand her, and how I am an unsupportive partner, and how she thinks we are better apart. When I try to move away and accept this, she stops me, and tells me to not leave. When these moods take over, they affect everything. She won't want me to cook, she will forget to do her share of the chores, or she will want me to not go and do work that I have piling up at the computer because she needs me to sit next to her silently. If I so much as have my own anxious moment, she is quick to wash her hands of any sense of responsibility to help me out. I have been left to deal with my anxiety on my own, but god forbid I do the same to her. It feels like I am suffering from Stockholm syndrome. No matter how much I want to leave this, I can't.

&#x200B;

Today, I felt guilty because I went out of my way to meet a friend I haven't seen in a while. I had feelings for this person, and I still do to a certain extent (no history between us, and no one knows I feel this way). In the past, I would have been much more confident and secure while talking to someone who I kind of liked, but today, it felt like a disaster. I was anxious about how I looked, how I dressed, if my breath smelled bad, if I looked like I was trying too hard, if my girlfriend would be mad that I'm spending time alone with a friend. This fed into itself, and I could feel my anxiety caving in on my social anxiety.

&#x200B;

This person has shattered my confidence. I don't feel proud to be who I am, and I constantly feel like I need to watch my step, less I trigger something wrong from my girlfriend. I am sad that I am unable to form emotional connections with others as well as I used to, and I resent my girlfriend for changing me into someone who is anxious and scared that their partner that they care about could flip on them at any second."
I go to therapy to get out of the house,"I’ve come to realize that I’m now only going to see a therapist because I’d pretty much have nothing to do otherwise. My therapist was great when I was going to see them when I was stressed and anxious, and I do still enjoy going now. But now it’s purely for something to do on the weekend. I’m paying them to be my friend and that makes me really sad. Totally pathetic."
I'm 18 and don't want to live a life of success.,"I know deep in my heart that, even if I was given everything I wanted, or successfully worked toward a desired career goal, I'll always feel discontent with my life.  Even if I raised a child successfully, loved a woman properly, had enough money to stay fulfilled, I'd always feel like it just wasn't right.

&#x200B;

What can I do to contribute to society as somebody who has no desire for worldly success?

&#x200B;"
I don't know how to have a crush,"Genuine care is so valuable to me that I can not have a healthy and balanced outlook on interpersonal relationships. 

I put a good person who cares about me on a pedestal. So much so that even though they are extremely depressed, they bragged and gave an off-putting reaction upon me respectfully exiting the casual liaison due to my feelings. 

Here is how I felt:
I came over to give them the proper closure everyone deserves. I could not wrap my head around why they reacted the way they did. I don't understand whether they were mocking me, being defensive, or just not knowing what to do themselves. 

I wanted to tell them:

1. what a great time I had 

2. how I desired to devote some of my time to help them with their depression because I cared about them, but I had to leave due to being hurt because of their incessant reminding of things being casual.

I couldn't say these things, so I'm saying them here. Their reaction was so incomprehensible to me that I panicked and left, which made me feel horrible considering that they are in emotional trouble. Autism sucks.

I hope they stay safe."
To those of you who feel like you’re not enough for someone,"They might not feel like they’re enough for you. You guys might be waiting for each other and nothing will happen that way. Go for it! You’re more than enough. And if someone doesn’t think you’re enough, they aren’t meant to be in your life. There are so many other people out there that will love you for you and help you grow, accepting you for your flaws. We all have flaws that we try to hide. I’m really loud sometimes and I try to hold it  in, but at the end of the day, I can’t hide my true self forever. BE YOURSELF. "
Sad about a death,"Someone in my family close to me died today . I knew it was coming. We all knew it was coming. but I can’t stop crying. I’ve cried so much this week and I’ve tried to hide it. I don’t know where to post this but I had to get it out somehow. I don’t care if anybody finds this. 

I had a dream last night that you got better and I got to hug you again, but now I know what will never happen. I’m sorry I didn’t say bye. I didn’t know what to do. I knew that was going to be the last time I saw you. I’m sorry. I don’t believe in life after death but now that I’ve experienced death so first hand I understand why people want to believe it. I’m so sad. I miss you so much already. I know that I won’t feel this way forever but right now it feels like I’ll always be this sad. 

I wish I could hug you one more time. I can picture you smiling at me so vividly in my head. I’m making myself cry again. I hadn’t gotten to see you in weeks before you passed and I felt bad. It’s not fair that the last time I got to see you you were in the state. That’s not how I want to remember you. I don’t know why I feel guilty. I know you wouldn’t want me to. I know you’d want me to be happier that you’re no longer in pain. And I know you’ll want me to continue living my life. 

I hope the mountains are prettier and the music is sweeter wherever you are. "
I think I need to let him go and it upsets me because I'm lonely,"My ""ex fuck buddy"" has been coming in and out of my life for the past few months. He wants to continue hooking up again and I say I'm down, but I know on the inside..I want to be in a relationship. I've always thought he was pretty cute and thought about asking him out for a split second, but I know he's untrustworthy and he sees me as someone just to have sex with. 

I talk to a lot of guys online and they all want to hook up, I don't care because I enjoy the attention but I care because they don't see me as girlfriend potential I guess. 

Anyways, I feel like I should come clean with him and tell him that although I am highly interested in hooking up with him, I want to be in a relationship. I know he won't care, he'll just find some other girl to hook up with. But if I do that and he leaves for good, I know I'm going to regret it. 

I could just keep him in my back pocket for later though. "
I feel like a horrible person,"I just need to share some of the horrible things I've done that I can't stop thinking about. 

* In 4th grade, I invited everyone in my class to my birthday party (handed out the invitations during school as well) except for one girl. I didn't invite her because my best friend hated her (i still can't figure out why) and I didn't want to upset my best friend. I'm sure the girl didn't mind because she was very popular, but regardless, I'm ashamed of what I did.
* When I was really little, I would open candy that was being sold on the side of the checkout lane. It only happened like once or twice, but it was stealing and I can't believe I did it.
* One time I went on a walk with two people. One, a guy, spoke only English and the other, a girl, spoke English and Chinese, but was more comfortable speaking Chinese. I'm bilingual and decided to converse only with the girl in Chinese because I wanted to be friends with her. I basically was in a position where I had the power to be inclusive and kind, but chose to exclude someone. The guy just awkwardly hung around and didn't say anything. 
* The other day someone I sometimes talk to showed me an airplane she drew and was like ""Hey, who drew the better plane?"" and pointed to someone elses plane picture. I was terribly rude and said in a harsh voice ""I can't even see your plane"" To the other person.  
* Also, I'm socially awkward and I feel like I make people uncomfortable
* Telling lies leaves the worst taste in my mouth, but I still do it. I can't remember when I lied last, but I know I've done it and just that makes me feel terrible

(sorry these aren't that bad, but I can't stop thinking about them)

&#x200B;"
Humanity's constant use of smartphones and the degradation of social interaction that stems from it have made me into an introvert with no interest in social life and very few friends and I hate myself for being so emotionally affected by it.,"I have to vent somewhere.

It all started about eight years ago when smartphones' popularity rised to the sky in my country and everyone HAD to have one; people started to care more about them than talking to others in real life. 

I was a student and had few friends at the time -only four-, we used to talk with no issue before this ""smartphone boom"" happened and at the beginning it seemed pretty harmless, but happiness didn't last and two of them started to distance themselves whenever we talked, looking at their phones mindlessly and barely paying any attention to what the rest of us were discussing.

It was then that it hit me, this was going to be the world going forward and I had no way to make a change, I wished at this point that the world just stopped advancing. I left that group and started jumping from one to another in what would be my last school year, attempting to find a seed of social development growing in there, but it was in vain.

Fast forward to where I'm currently in life: University; I spent my first year not talking much at all mostly spending time by myself and just occasionally talking to a few people to entertain myself in breaks, I honestly had stopped worrying about the whole smartphone thing at this point because there was no one I wholeheartedly wished to engage socially with... until my second year.

I had found a group of people that seemed to care about me -they ARE very nice people- but they eyes were swayed by their screens just like everyone else's, I had a bit more fun in this group, for their maturity allowed them to have a bit more respect for the rest, but I can't deny that I was still bothered whenever their phones grabbed their attention because they had to, or they would DIE, because that's just how important it is to answer a message these days, isn't it?

I eventually distanced myself from them too, not for their phone manners of course, but rather for more personal issues, now I'm back to not talking to anyone yet again, but I haven't felt any interest in anyone since because... the bus, the streets, concerts, everywhere you look in here, there's a phone and the user is glued to it and it hurts me so much, because I think back to my original group and how happy we were just talking our breaks aways, now I just put on my headphones and look outside in an attempt to forget about it all.

But, you know, you kinda can't.

Why exactly do you feel the need to grab your phone in the middle of a conversation?  
Why do you look at your phone for no reason when you go to a restaurant?  
Why do you feel it to be essential that you record that concert on your phone?

And why do I even give a shit anymore?"
I roped a load on a dying bird.,"Felt it was respectful to let it go out with a bang.
I know it's a bit nutty, but it's a popular ritual where I am from."
I feel like I need mental help,"I've been feeling really down on myself for a long time now- almost 4 or 5 years now.  Sometimes it's easier, but other times, it's almost unbearable.  Like the weight of the world is on my shoulders, and I'm about to crack.  My parents always write it off as ""hormones"", but it's becoming a real problem.  

It's been worse, recently.  My dad was diagnosed with kidney cancer, and he had to take a leave from his work.  I had gotten a part time job for the summer, which I was planning to quit when the school semester started back up, but I feel trapped there- like I can't now in case they need me.  He's on disability, and they've never asked money from me, but I can't help but feeling like I need to pitch in.  Along with that, my great grandmother passed away a month or so ago.  I took it hard bc we were very close, but I bottled my grief and pain up- they didn't need me like that.  I know it's unhealthy, and it's okay, but I still feel like I can't stop.

I want to tell my parents, but I feel like this is the last thing they need right now.  At the same time, I feel like if I don't, I'm going to do something I'd seriously regret."
I love my best friend so much,"I love her so much, probably as much as you can love another human being without wanting to have sex with them. I’m a gay male and I love my best friend from the bottom of my heart I wish there was a socially acceptable way where we could have all the perks of a loving marriage type relationship minus the sex part I honestly get confused about my sexuality at times because I’m jealous when she’s with boys but then I realize I’m not jealous they’re having sex I’m jealous that I want to be staying up till 4am with her just talking and sharing our time. I love her so much and when she’s happy I’m happy I’m just dreading the day she gets married and isn’t around as much for me but I know I’ll be able to cope because what matters at the end of the day is that she’s the happiest she can be."
Rejecting others,I've done this here and there but it's never easy after a date or two and when they're pretty damn invested (or at least it seems that way). Ugh. Hope they don't take it too hard..
A brief description of my past few weeks,"I dont quite know how to start this

Im losing my appetite. my sleep schedule is starting to go out of whack again. The days are just a blur of classes, wandering the campus late at night, and standing behind a cash register. 

I need an actual job, but I'm so scared of being rejected, or being in a job that I hate that I didnt even apply to anything yet. I know thats stupid, and irrational, but thats just how my mind works.

i feel so busy all the time, but when I look back, I feel like I barely get things done. I feel so distracted, so uninterested, and at the same time terrified under the surface.

I barely talk to anyone, I dont look forward to anything, I live away from my family, most of my friends are hours away. 

When I'm stressed, I take long walks with nothing but myself and my music. 

I'm a better man than who I was, and Im proud of what I become but sometimes I wonder how similar or different my life is to people around me, and whether or not Im justified to complain about it at all"
"For the first time in 17 years, my dad actually apologized for his actions.","My dad has never been the nicest to me, we often argue, he screams and throws things, calls me names, and has even kicked me out of the house on my birthday. We had an argument the other day over my future plans, but today he apologized. Normally he just moves on and we never speak of the issue again, but it was nice to finally hear him own up to his actions and have some remorse for it. I feel like this is a step in the right direction for once."
Tomorrow I am breaking up with my first boyfriend,"I've been dating an awesome guy for about 10 months now, but it just can't work out and I think I always knew this end was inevitable. We try but we have serous incompatibilities when it comes to communication, and it has gotten to the point that I know we don't have a future together, even though I wish we could. I've spent the entire day crying and feeling awful. This morning I wrote him a letter to formulate me thoughts. I think this might be one of the most emotionally taxing things I have done in my life. I'll be breaking his heart. :( "
i wish i was somebody’s favourite person.,"being raised in what seems like a dysfunctional family, i never got much attention from home. i grew up fatherless with my mum alone and we have been living this way up to this day. she’s married now, and wants to have another child, start a new family away from me in a different country. i feel like a burden, due to the way she treats me on a daily basis with minimal contact, only ordering me around and being very hostile. this is alright though, it’s the way things are with her. due to the cold relationship we have, i know that i don’t stand a chance at being my mother’s number one or even her favourite person. 

i have friends, many, but i still feel like most of the friendships i have built over the years stop at a certain level. my friends listen and support me, helping me when they can, but sometimes, it’s impossible for me to tell them what’s going on, how i feel, it’s hard for them to understand or process, therefore their advice or “help” isn’t so valuable anymore. either way, i don’t feel like i have a single friend who i could honestly go to and talk about everything and anything. i definitely am not a favourite to any of my friends. i know this for a fact. 

i have a boyfriend too, who i have really grown close to and whom i whole-heartedly love. he is definitely my favourite person without a doubt and i have never felt so close to a person in my whole life. he is the the love of my life and my best friend. he has a beautiful and huge family, lots of really close and amazing friends and a bright future set before him. so many people love him and value his opinion and friendship, it amazes me. it also makes me feel nervous and even worthless when i’m around him because of the lack of these elements in my own life. i’m not as valued as he is, i don’t have all of that, in fact i have nothing apart from him and myself. he is very supportive and loving, he cares about me a great deal and i can feel that. he is a literal blessing, and even told me that when he finishes his military training, he would put a ring on my finger. i wish i could say with confidence that i am most definitely his favourite person, but i feel selfish placing myself on top that way. if it wasn’t for him, my life would be a nightmare at this rate, nothing but strife and anger within each day. i love him and thank him everyday for helping me always. 

i just wish i was valued as much as other people. i wish people went out of their way to make plans with me or even prioritise me a little bit. it gets tiring being the second or even last choice, just because everyone has their own lives to deal with and it appears as though i have a great life of my own. i wish i was somebody’s favourite person. a family member perhaps, friends, anyone. i wish i knew how it feels to be blissfully wanted and loved by everybody. 

just wanted to get this off my chest, i’ve been feeling worthless and under appreciated for a long time now. thank you for listening, i appreciate your time and attention so much. i need to buckle up and build my own legacy now. i only have myself in this world.

I miss sleeping and food,"WARNING: Sleep deprived rambling. There is no point to this post. I’m just bored.


I started a bunch of new medications because as it turns out, years of abuse takes a toll on your mind. Who knew? 

I think I’m slowly getting better (yay!) but the thing is, I rarely sleep or eat anymore. I take Concerta for ADHD, Xanax for panic attacks, a heart medication due to the side effect of heart palpitations from the Concerta, omeprazol for a hernia (apparently not a lot of 20 year olds get those. But then again, years of abuse takes a toll), and Celexa for depression/PTSD/anxiety. 

Only problem is, most of those meds that are helping can also cause insomnia. It’s been about two weeks since I’ve stopped sleeping. I don’t ever really feel tired so I just keep going until I can’t stay awake, sleep for three hours and then I’m back at it. I’ve been super productive though. The other side effect is loss of appetite and nausea which means I don’t really eat. Plus to that is I’m down two dress sizes in a little over a month (very happy about that).

I’m low key worried I’m going to end up losing my marbles because I don’t sleep, and also sleep is my favourite part of the day and it makes me sad that I can’t have it as often. But at least I’m getting better right? 
"
I've been talking to someone I met thru omegle.,"I met someone through Omegle. It's not the best site to visit, because there is a lot of ""sexual behavior"" going on. I continued to go on for a while. I felt like I was missing something in my life. Later I found it was because I was craving human interactions. I was home a lot during this time and just wanted to talk to people. I didn't have the courage to call any friends for some reason. I crave the interactions but was too afraid to speak up as I knew they were always busy. 

After meeting this person, A, we exchanged our social medias. Now we have been talking for 2 months. I really like A and A has also told me their interest in me. I want to be able to tell people about us, but worry about people asking where we have met (which we still haven't, we live in 2 different countries). We have spoke about this topic and decided on a few things and will move on fro m there if we actually do met.

I have recently told a few close friends and my sister. In some ways I am ashamed and almost disgusted by what I did. I know it wasn't anything too bad but through the eyes of society, it seems like it is. But whenever A and I message/talk, I am happy and excited. I struggle with insecurities and A makes me feel better about myself. A has a way of speaking that makes me understand and enjoy life in a different way that I am learning to love and appreciate. I really want to met A and maybe start an actual relationship, but I worry about the distance and the thought of the possibility of never meeting upsets me. I understand, that these are things that I cannot control, but I still feel helpless in these situations. Whenever I think of these topics, I become anxious and my heart rate increases. "
I accidentally bought 2 pairs of AirPods and a 135 dollar BB gun,Ok I bought a shit tone of stuff by accident because I clicked proceed to checkout on my amazon wishlist that had at least 20 things and some of the items had like 1 day shipping and stuff and I didn’t know I bought them until now I canceled most of them besides the BB gun cause it wouldn’t let me and my mom gets home tomorrow and she’s going to be pissed I spent at least 200 dollars what should I do should I just not go home after school tomorrow 
numb lol,"ive never felt this numb from pain and like a used rag before in my life. I had no idea a person could be capable of making someone feel this way. I’m afraid I won’t be able to get out of bed tomorrow. I’m afraid I won’t be able to talk to people or finish or even start the things I need to get done. “goodnight n goodbye. i love you forever. I hope u find happiness soon.” I feel so numb. so stupid. and used. 2 years. 2 years in 11 days. 2 years of my life and all of my nerves and my plans for the future. 2 years and every ounce of emotion I had in my body. I am so tired and so numb and empty now. So completely drained and so alone. I don’t even have the strength to tell myself that I’ll be okay. I hope it was worth it what you traded me for. I hope the screen gives you all the comfort I tried to give you and all the happiness you let me go for. It was only 2 days ago that you were telling me how your closet is going to be “our” closet one day when you marry me. How could you say goodbye all over again, after crying on my couch, after everything you told me, after everything we went through. I’m writing this because it’s the only thing I can do. I’m writing this instead of talking to you. 


Sorry guys Reddit is currently my only outlet. No one else I could talk to about this besides some nice strangers or the void haha. Thank you for listening"
"They came to me for help, I feel like I didn't.","Now I'm not the most caring of people, but I was an ear to listen when others would come to me with their problems. This was with pretty much everyone I knew and usually would just be relatable family problems to talk about or some school drama though I tried not to be too involved with that. I guess it's my own fault for being the cliché ""Not like other guys person"" and just talking to my homegirls without slipping in a compliment every 2 sentences. This ended up with me getting a nickname from most of them and even getting called ""bestfriend""(was not my intention) by a couple of them. Within a year 6of my female friends had been raped and I was their go-to for help. Each time it was like a punch to the chest and each time I didn't know how to respond. It always ended with the usual "" Are you alright, did you go to the police?""(only 2 did, only one got justice) And me feeling like shit. I know I could've been more thoughtful and caring, but I was shook. I don't know where I'm going with this I just feel ashamed"
OBSESSING BAD,So long story short I looked through my ex’s phone not too long ago and some texts with his friends I didn’t want to see. I shouldn’t have everrrrrr done it cause now I’m hurt and very mad at him butttt I can’t say anything cause yeah :/ I really just needed to say something and simply get it off my chest. anyone who has advice for not obsessing like I am or anything I can relate to would be greatly appreciated.
I am feeling crushed by my own expectations,"I am really bad at letting myself spend my time the way I want to. What this means is: I *want* to live a balanced life (that I know is very feasible) where I work my full-time job, stream for 2 hours on Twitch in the evenings, get some physical exercise in, and get an appropriate level of sleep. However, I *actually* spend most of my time fretting about things that have not happened yet. These things include:

* Fear that the investment of my time and money towards streaming (which is sizable at this point) will be an absolute waste of time. This fear persists even when I achieve small, personal wins that should help prove this fear to be silly.
* Fear that I don't have it in me to accomplish the goals I set for myself. This mostly has to do with actually *doing* the things I want to do, like streaming. I will, more often than not, simply waste time online rather than do the things I want to do... to the point where I'm certain that I have spent more time *actively avoiding* engaging in my favorite things *more than I've actually spent time doing those things*. This is horrifically embarrassing, and it's something that I feel helpless to change.
* Fear that even if I *do* stream consistently, nobody will watch--or, if they do watch, they will leave once I feel like I'm gaining traction. Conversely, this fear also culminates in: that even if I *do* work out consistently, and *do* continue to be consistent at my job, I'll be punished for it in some way, or it won't be enough.

This fear is paralyzing, and at this point, I don't know what to do. I *cannot* lower the expectations I put on myself, because I *know* that I can meet them if I just try hard enough. It drives me to tears that I cannot seem to get my shit together and either break this horrible cycle or just find something else to do, because my life feels wrapped up in this perpetual feeling of disappointment in myself.

Things worth noting:

* I am 20 years old and still live at home. My family is, all things considered, a terrible influence on my personal health, and an active obstacle in my personal journey towards a healthier lifestyle. They prefer to eat and live unhealthily, and it is so much easier to just go along with it than it is to challenge the status quo. I could probably pull off moving out, but the prospect of doing so is equally paralyzing, and I don't know that I could handle it on top of everything else.
* I have a barebones social life, even though I feel like I have many people that would consider themselves good friends of mine. The few people I have opened up to about how I'm feeling are either wholly uninterested or think that it's some fairytale opportunity to form a romantic relationship so that they can help me. That feels cruel to type, but I'm not looking for a relationship to support when I can't support myself.
* I am, all things considered, pretty successful, at least professionally. I am the youngest person in the company I work for, and I have proven multiple times that I can be extremely quick and efficient, moreso than any of my team members. Thing is, I am inconsistent and prone to falling into random, almost depressive(?) periods of time where I just can't get things done the way I know I can. I can be crushing my work goals for the first half of the week, and the second half of the week just feels impossible. My performance numbers fluctuate wildly.
* I sabotage my own efforts a lot, and it's difficult to stop. My internal monologue seems to go *""Fuck this, it isn't working, and you're the one holding yourself back.""* And it feels absolutely true.

I am absolutely the only thing holding myself back, and I didn't know that I could feel this tortured by my own psyche and my own actions. I don't know what to do, and I feel totally helpless."
I drove drunk last night,"Got pulled over, kept my cool, officer gave me a warning and kept asking if I had been drinking, in which I told him no. I’m so fucking pissed at myself, I’m an idiot, and I’m sorry that I put other people’s lives in jeapordy. 

I’ve never been so disappointed in myself. To those of you who have lost people to this bullshit, I’m really sorry. Driving drunk is one of the most selfish and moronic things you can do. "
I’m not sure what is the real me and it’s affect me ( not really in a negative way though ),"Why is it that I ( personally ) look in the mirror, I look really good and I’ll look at my self on my iPhone cameras and i’ll look the same; the way I like myself. Other days, I’ll look in the mirror and then my phone and look drastically different, my skin colour is a way lighter shade then normal or my hair looks different are two examples. Which way, or how/why is it like this..? ( I’m also in the same room with the lighting ) "
People keep telling me to follow my passion but I think that’s useless advice,"Originally when I came to college I wanted to study journalism. I’m a freshman right now. I like journalism, but I think a journalism degree is pretty worthless. All I hear about are the layoffs, the poor salaries, and how competitive the industry is. I’m not the type of person who’s going to stress themselves out doing 5 unpaid internships and extracurriculars at a time to maybe land an interview somewhere after I graduate. I don’t want to follow my passion to struggle my whole life. 

I’m also taking an intro computer programming class designed for people with no experience. It’s not bad, and I kind of like it, but obviously real CS classes are way harder and math intensive. I’m not bad at math but it’s always my weakest subject (last semester I had all As and a B in math). Obviously there’s no point in majoring in CS if I’m going to fail everything. I’m just not a math or science person. On every standardized test it’s always my weakest point. At my school the CS major is filled with the really serious computer geeks who’ve been programming since they were kids which intimidates me. And I just can’t see myself as one of them, doing that my whole life. But I know I would find a job much more easily with that degree if I succeeded. And it might be better suited for an introvert like me than journalism. I have to decide next year. Idk what to do. "
Should there be a treatment to change races?,"If there is hrt treatment to become the opposite sex, then should there be a treatment to become a different race? For example becoming black from white, and  becoming white from black. This is just a thought I was thinking about."
"I'm a man in a non monogamous relationship with a couple girls, and a boy. I also sleep around. They don't seem bothered by my habits, and I'd never say this to them, but I get really bothered and deeply disturbed when they sleep with other guys.","I know I'm meant to be respectful and that fair is fair, which is why I never talk to them about this, but it's something that really affects me and I don't like to even think about it. I feel like the frustration is just something primal and I don't know how to deal with it. I'm pretty financially stable and I'm considering literally paying them to be exclusive."
Everything is so confusing,So I'm 15 and I know this is gunna seem very stupid to some people because of my age. I live with my mom mostly (dad on the weekends) and my family is great. I have a brother who's 18 and he's the best brother I could ask for. There are a few people I'm interested in and I'm good friends with them but none of them are like me. (I'm a guy btw) I think I have some mental health disorder but I have no way to know because I am a teenager who could just be having mood swings or some bs. But throughout the last 3 years I've been really fucking depressed and almost killed myself but didn't have the balls to. And people always ask me if I'm alright when I say shit that I like. Like 3 weeks ago I said to my friend I just want to get fucked up and forget and they worried. I have no one to talk to who knows how I feel. No one with the same interests as me. But then again I'm just a complaining dumb fucking teen who is just angsty as fuck so let's just disregard his emotions.
Texting,"Am the only person that gets annoyed when someone texts asking a question only to just not look at your answer for hours, sometimes days let alone to even respond. Mother fucker why!?!?!?"
I'm anxious and use alcohol to cope. Just started therapy and I truly feel worse now than when I ignored my problems.,"I just started (intro session last week). Please, anyone with experience, just tell me what I can get out of it and how it will change my life for the better, because I'm pretty sure all I've got is painful memories of trauma brought back up and nothing good to go on. Thanks. "
I don't have any motivation,"Everything I start I eventually lose motivation and never finish. I've started a few hobbies in  the past 6ish months and they're things I really really enjoy but I just lose all my motivation for them and put them down. I've started several video games too and I just never finish them. I'm also in my first year of community college and I've hated it so far, I thought I wanted to go into music and I started last fall in the music program and not even halfway through the semester I withdrew all my classes because I didn't want to perform in front of people and it was stressing me out every day. My parents were paying for the classes and i agreed to pay them back and it was just short of $4,000. I only make $10.50 an hour at my part-time job and I'm only getting about 3 days a week 4.5 hours every day I work because our sales aren't good and the company can't afford to pay us or some BS like that. I'm also terrible with my money, I'm super impulsive and I usually go through my paychecks every 2 weeks. I took online classes the next semester which turned out to be one of the worst financial decisions I've made other than dropping last semesters  classes because I don't do my online classes, I haven't checked them in a month, the classes have probably kicked me out because I don't do the material and that's going to add to the $4000 I have to pay my parents back because I don't think its fair for me to have them pay and not do the classes. I push them aside and try not to think of them and my parents still thinking I'm somewhat caught up and they're both big on school and they're going to be pissed once I tell them or they find out I've been lying this whole time, probably going to be put on probation too which is fun. In highschool I skipped class to the point where my dean almost suspended me. I was depressed for half of my senior year, but when summer came around and I was finally free of that prison I wasn't really depressed anymore. I don't know why I just give up on everything, I feel like a failure, I couldn't really care less of what my parents think of me at the moment, I just feel like a miserable POS to myself. All i do is watch youtube and play videogames all day. I have no idea what I want to do besides the one thing I'd want to do which I'm way to anxious and scared to get into. I have no ambitions whatsoever. I don't want to go to college anymore because I think its a big waste of time and money and I have no clue what I want to spend my miserable life doing."
I can’t stop crying,"I messaged you today and our conversation wasn’t too terrible. I can’t stop crying knowing that you decided to be selfish and cheat on me, I feel bad for you and I don’t even know why I’m feeling like everything is my fault. 

I’d give my life a million times over just to hold you in my arms again and maybe make you Mac n cheese. I love you. "
Feel exhausted with living,"I’m not suicidal, just expressing feelings. 
I’m 23, but living a long life seems even more exhausting at this point. I feel like I got the gig of it all already, and that there’s nothing more to do. I’ve also lost a lot of important people to me, my personality has changed rapidly and I’ve lost interest in all my future plans in life, since I don’t really see the meaning behind any of it anymore. I’m not interested in kids or finding a partner either. 
Which makes it all feel rather pointless. 
Has anyone else felt like this? 
"
Nobody knows I (22m) have had sex with another man.,Including my gf
I married someone with less than zero sexual drive.,"We were both devout Christians when we got married, I had sex with two long term girlfriends before we got married, but she had never had a sexual experience. So when she made it apparent that she wanted to wait until marriage, I respected that for the most part. When she cried when I dry humped her when we were engaged, I was still a Christian and I placed the blame on myself for being sinful.  A few weeks before the wedding she suggested we wait a week or so after the wedding before we tried to have sex. For those out there that didn't grow up Christian, this is an insane concept inside Christian culture.  Unfortunately we weren't able to have sex on our wedding night or for the next 3 years. It's weird because during that time if I was thinking about divorce/annulment during that time, most people would have understood. But now I understand the angle in her body that wont occur unless I direct her to make it. She has only dilated her business because I spent hours and hours learning and teaching her with toys. 2 years ago I rejoiced when we had sex for the first time! She did as well, and believed she beat the final boss. I have tried to tell her that it was only level one, that I have sexual desires as well, but she kind of looks at sex like it's something that I burdened her with. And I broke down a few months ago. What if I want to be sexually desired? What if I'm looking to try something new sexually? It's totally wrong that I feel like I'm owed something, that's not a good way to live life. but back when I was a Christian, I thought that a 3 year sacrifice of sex would earn me a wonderful marriage/sex life. That's just not how things work, and now I'm trying to figure out how to divorce my best friend knowing that it gets way worse if it even gets better at all."
My father disowned my brother and I.,"Like the title says, he disowned us.

You wanna know why? 

He is giving it all to his new wife.

I spoke to him tonight about it. He said that it's his estate (I get that) and that he is doing what is best for his family.

I just hate that. 

He isn't even living in the same country anymore, he left for his job and wife. He doesn't even pay enough child support money (the amount he must pay, legally).

Sorry if this sounds mild to some people and I offended some people by this. I just hate that we are his sons, born from him, and he isn't giving us even a hat (he has plenty) when he dies. "
"I love my SO, but it still hurts though.","Because of my SO I'm starting to alienate my family and friends. My family(very supportive) hasn't done anything bad. My friends on the other hand, just show how human they are. Every time I try to bring them up to my SO, it hurts my SO because they didn't ""care"" about us and are ""inconsiderate"". 

It all started when my older brother got engaged last October 2018 and got married last month. SO kept saying they were inconsiderate because we got engaged a year prior to my brother's and we were supposed to get married first. For me, I just feel upset that things got quick for my older brother, but hey, it's his life. I'm happy when he's happy. My SO on the other hand, didn't take it lightly, and started to hate my brother and his wife. SO kept saying they're toxic and inconsiderate etc etc. For the family, SO still thinks of them as leeches because I still help out with some of the expenses back home. She doesn't see that I want to do it because I appreciate my parent's hard work and would like to return a little something for them. I mean most of the budget still goes to us, and whenever I have extra, I give it to my parents or sibling.

As for my friends, SO kept nitpicking their past mistakes, when I totally have forgiven them already. I'm kinda sad SO doesn't look at the human but rather judge them on the mistakes or the benefits that we get from them. It hurts me when SO can't see that I'm friends with my friends because they're human. SO can't see that my friends and family helped me define who I am today. 

It hurts me that I can't congratulate my brother, or in any achievements he has anymore.
It hurts me that I should consider my friends as toxic, and bad.
It hurts me that I shouldn't forgive people who are willing to change for the good.
It hurts me that I can't be who I am anymore.

To my SO, I know you came from a broken family, but isolation isn't the answer. Time and time again I wanted to show you the love i got from my friends and family, but every time you tell me they're inconsiderate and nothing but leeches. I just want you to give them a chance; give ourselves a chance. Let's base everything because we ""feel"" that they are bad, and they had past mistakes. They're human, just like us. One thing I can tell you is that they can change for the good, but only if we communicate and not shut them out.  I am giving you my all, but please take a look who I really am :(

attraction and socializing,"hi! i (15F) am a sophomore in highschool and i go to a typical public HS. i have friends and sometimes i feel like my social life is difficult to explain. i’ll talk to people but i’m introverted and i mostly have girl friends because i’m an only child and as friends i’ve connected with girls better and i only have a few guy friends that i’ve been with since elementary school.

all my girl friends LOVE to talk about guys and thinking that guys r cute and whatnot. i’ll listen to those conversations and input here and there but personally i’m not into guys right now or thinking about relationships. (I HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE LGBTQ+ COMMUNITY. but how i was raised, i’m not i to girls. i am not bi, pan, or whatever the other terms are & i know i’m attracted to guys i just don’t like to think about it now.) i feel out of touch with girls my age because i sort of see other girls from a third Person POV and these girls, i tell u, they crave for drama and want things to happen. i know all of this can be good high school memories for the future but i have passions that i dream of achieving like making music and doing something in the music industry but i feel like every girl i’ve talked to in my school or anywhere else, i haven’t found any substance in their personalities.

i don’t know if this whole thing made sense but overall, i do my best to fit in with teenagers and the typical things. do you think it’s okay that i don’t feel the need to be in relationships, have crushes on guys all the time and have so many friends?

I honestly am near my breaking point,"Hi, thanks for taking the time to read this

My great grandmother is very advanced in her age (90+ years old) and recently she took a fall that has given her chronic pain. Every day she is in agony. I hear her screams, I hear her cries. I can't help her.

My family is being less than understanding about the situation. To make a long story short, I'm pretty sure my great-grandma has some form of dementia. She's been getting forgetful and aggressive within the past few months, and my family has been meeting her aggressiveness in kind. They scream at her, and get angry at her. I can't say I don't understand why, sometimes it is a little grating because often her behavior is similar to that of a very young child. Non-understanding, but confident regardless of the situation, frustratingly so.

This is all to say that with her screams and cries of pain, my family did not meet any of this with understanding or care. They are angry with her on a daily basis. They think she's a nuisance. My grandmother (Her own daughter) told her to just die already...

I'm tired of hearing the screams, I'm tired of hearing the arguments. I'm tired of hearing the hatred in my grandparents' voice every day. I just want calm."
"I really CANT drive no matter how hard I try, and nobody seems to understand.","This may seem like a little thing to some but I’ve been so so excited about being able to drive since I was so young. I’m in the UK and once you turn 17 you can start driving. My dad has always been car mad so I’ve grown up round classic cars (ones he has owned and classic car shows etc) and flashy new cars and my dad takes huge pride in his cars. He also has a valeting business which he’s had for over 30 years and some of my fondest young memories are helping him with this. 

So all my life I’ve been round cars so as I said, it’s safe to say as soon as I could drive I was super excited!

My dad is a wealthy gent and fully paid for my mum, sisters, brothers and his ex-wife’s (when they were together of course) driving lessons, first car and first year of insurance. He’s also already bought my a personalised registration plate (please know I’m not bragging I’m just using this to emphasise how excited I was to drive).  And of course he was going to do the same for me, and all my friends are around the same age so have been passing their tests. 

BUT I REALLY CANT DRIVE AT ALL ITS SO HARD. I’ve had 4 different instructors (25 hours in total), 3 of which literally got rid of my me because I’m unteachable and a hazard on the road. I can’t grasp the simplest of things - how the change gears properly, parking, roundabouts and simple things like turning left and right (literally). It’s seriously knocked my confidence, I come back from all my driving lessons sobbing because I’m trying so hard and getting nowhere. 

This is embarrassing as it is, and believe me it really really is embarrassing especially when I literally struggle with turning. However my family have all took it upon themselves to mock me, my dad included. We can be having a nice chat and he’ll just randomly blurt out “I just don’t get why you can’t do it!” And whenever he talks about it with me he gets short and snappy with me - it’s as if me struggling to drive pisses him off. It really upsets me, as I said my brother and sister are both excellent drivers and I always have felt like the underachiever of my siblings so this is just the icing on top of the cake. I’ve spoken to him about going automatic instead of manual with my driving and he just scoffs at me, as it offends him that I’d even consider it. 

I’m sorry for such a long post which probably seems pretty dumb for me to be so upset about, but I just wanted to get it off my chest. 

TL;DR: I really can’t drive and I’m embarrassed by it, my dad who’s a car fanatic seems to be pretty pissed that I’m struggling so much. "
Men don’t respect women,"What I mean by this is that I believe our culture encourages men to not care about how women will feel about certain things and only relates women value in regards to their sexuality. Despite advancements in women’s rights and liberties, women are still viewed by men as secondary. Let me tell y’all a story to give you all some context.

On Friday night, some coworkers and I went out to get drinks at a bar. A female coworker also brings one of her friends from outside of work to the bar. Later in the evening, someone has the idea of going to the clubs downtown. This is when my boss starts flirting with the friend of the coworker. Now mind you, my boss has a long term gf whom he lives with and has children with. I have personally met both his gf and his children.We head downtown and my boss and the two women go to a club and me and some other coworkers go to another club. When we decide to go to the other club, I am appalled at what I see. My boss is making out with the other girl, and he’s all over her. He talks to us guy coworkers about how he’s trying to “smash” and trying to find ways to do this without bringing her to his place. Even on the way back, he has his arm around her, he’s calling her sexy, kissing her cheek and all this other stuff. 

The worst part about it, is that we basically just have to keep quiet about it. I even watched it and told myself that it wasn’t my problem. I’m honestly probably still not going to do anything about it either. As a child of a single mom, it was crazy to watch men disrespect women in real time. I would have never thought he’d do something like this either, I was truly shocked. I think I just needed to get this off my chest, because to me it’s crazy. That this is really the world we’re living in. 

Do you all have thoughts and comments? Let me know cause I don’t know how to feel. "
"Money doesn't make you a good person, your character does.",'Nuff said.
I’m huge fuck up and I’m always saying the wrong things,"I don’t know why I do this. Everyone else can be funny and smart and kind but I keep making an ass of myself, people like me better when I keep my mouth shut

I just really detest myself. I hate that I’m either a weirdo or the quiet kid. Why can’t I be a normal human being? Why does everyone else seems to know exactly what to say and I keep being an a fuck?

I just really hate myself."
Dealing with a death,"I just learned that my ex boyfriend died. His parents called me to let me know. It's been a few years, but we ended on good terms and I was still in communication with him past our breakup. My heart is so heavy but I haven't cried at all yet. I am looking through old photos of us and feel so so bad. We were so young then, he looked so happy and had his whole life ahead of him. It's been so long, but he was my first love, first boyfriend, first I love you, and the person I lost my virginity to. We used to be so close and it's so strange looking at how happy he was back then. We didn't talk often when we broke up, but it's so scary knowing that if I tried to call him right now, no one would answer. I wish I reached out to him more before he died. He wanted to meet up one day a few years ago and I told him I wasn't comfortable doing that yet. I wish I had though. But most of all I feel so sad for his parents and his little sisters. I wish I could reach out to them somehow but I wouldn't know what to tell them if I did. I know I said I wasn't crying earlier, but I'm crying now. This is the first time someone very close to me has passed away and I don't really know how to handle it"
We’re all mistakes but I feel like I’m the biggest one...,"Not too detailed back story.. I was always the one who really didn’t have friends.. not until high school. I don’t have many social skills to begin with, my family made sure I didn’t talk to certain people and didn’t hang out with anyone they didn’t see as acceptable. 
I was never a “girly girl” either and that affected my relationship with my family. They wanted my hair and nails done. I didn’t, I wanted to be outside or play video games. 

The adults claimed they liked how I carried myself but I would overhear them criticizing everything about me or comparing me to my other siblings. 
Especially my mother would do this a lot.
The constant judgement was something I could never deal with. 

I was bullied every since 2nd or 3rd grade. Now I’m 19f and I barely talk.

Everything has been worse since I was diagnosed with anxiety.. my mom has said things to me that let me know I’ve never been the daughter she’s wanted.. the first time I went to the hospital she threatened to leave me there and said things that hurt me still. Everyone outs my business and makes up lies. My entire family stopped talking to me when someone told them I wanted to kill myself. I never once attempted or said I wanted too. My mom tells everyone I have outbursts or episodes when that’s complete lies. That’s not even an appropriate description of anxiety. 

The thoughts I’ve been having and my feelings over the passed month or two. I wish I was either given up for adoption or just not born at all. 
She and so many others make me feel at fault for my emotions. Make me feel like it’s not normal to have anxiety, depression, and a border line eating disorder. 

No one really knows I lost weight again, I think of myself dying in any way possible to escape my feelings, that I’d rather not talk but I do want help. 
I feel as if I’m stuck.."
i want this all to end,"i hate that you talk to my friends. i hate thinking that they ask about how we used to be so close and how you'll probably tell them your version of the story, of how i'm crazy and psycho for freaking out of your pot usage--ignoring the fact that you called our roommate an alcoholic because she hung out late with us one night, ignoring the fact you didn't care that i was still living with my alcoholic mother, IGNORING the fact that you didn't care when your pot smoking triggered me. 

you didn't care that you excusing your smoking re-traumatized me. you didn't care that i got into smoking cigarettes because i couldn't cut myself or they'd fucking baker-act my ass. you didn't care that i was suicidal because of the way you had treated me in the past. you didn't give a SHIT and had the audacity to suggest I'D HURT YOU. you wish you were actually hurt in this situation, didn't you? 

i hate you. i hate how close we were. i hate how you acted like you didn't know my mom was an alcoholic even though i told you all my most personal shit for TWO WHOLE YEARS. you had seen me come home crying because i, with only my learner's permit, had to drive my drunk mother an hour and a half home on the highway for the first time. 

i've lost two good friendships over the course of a year--i broke off a friendship with a good friend just before we ended it two years ago. all these people i spent so much time with and everything fricking HURTS. 

nobody takes it seriously that you abused me because you didn't hit me and never screamed at me. i feel so fucking pathetic and i wish i could scrape the memories of you out of my fucking skull. i hate how you act when i express something i love in class, or how i'm into a topic and i want others to participate. 

i've never genuinely hated anyone more than i hate you. it's so exhausting and i wish you'd just leave and never come back. i wish i hadn't even seen you when i was a freshman. 

none of this is coherent, and that's probably because i just want to cry. i have nightmares about you and my other ex-friends. i wonder if y'all ever say the same stuff about me. "
I just broke up with a really good guy and it’s killing me,"So a little history about my past relationships. I am a 29 (F). I’ve had 2 long term serious relationships and a handful of 3-6 month-ers. My 1st one was with my child’s father. He was a heroin addict (clean now, but does not see our young son because he’s a real piece of work). I supported him for 5 years while I was working and going to school. He lied and cheated on me numerous times. Didn’t have a car and would party with his friends while I stayed home with the baby. 

My second relationship, the guy did not own a car.. kept promising me that he would get his license so I wouldn’t be driving all the time, did not graduate HS or have plans on bettering his future, his teeth... I swear I only saw him brush them once (and we lived together!) and finally.. gave me bed bugs (and didn’t want to spend the money on an exterminator bc only my son and I were getting bit up.. not him). I put up with that for two years.. until he got addicted to Xanax and strip clubs. Then I was out. 

My friend recently set me up with her bfs best friend. He graduated college, has an amazing well-paying job, A CAR, his own place, and even a dog whom he adored! Which was super cute to watch...but as the months went by and the more we talked.. I just didn’t feel like I was falling in love. I was comfortable. But he seemed very nervous around me and out of place most of the time. We didn’t fight the whole 4 months. There was absolutely zero passion. 

And just breaking up with him now, he decided to tell me that he was in love with me. It breaks my heart. I had no idea he felt that strongly. Especially since my feeling became so stagnated. I swear.. I am NOT one o those girls who feels she needs to “fix people” I don’t want that. I don’t have time for that. I have a child who needs me. I don’t need a second child. 

I just don’t know what is wrong with me. I don’t understand why this great guy and I just cannot have chemistry. I was so in love with the other two and even though they wronged me.. it was so hard for me to give up on them and our relationship. 

I’m 29 and i wish my child could have that sibling he’s always asking for, or that house he always asks about. The older I get, the harder it is to find. 

"
Im sick of all the crap going on right now,WHY CAN PEOPLE JUST BE NICE AND ACCEPTING OF OTHER CULTURES AND RELIGIONS. JUST MIND YOUR OWN BUSINESS AND STOP CARING ABOUT WHAT OTHER PEOPLE PRACTICE. sorry i just feel super sad about the lives lost and the people who died in new zealand didnt deserve this at all. in the end of the day we are all human and people need to start understanding this.
Here's what happened to me.,"So there was this girl. She was pretty cool and the moment I saw her I was definitely attracted to her. The day we met we were just talking and play around with each other and some of my friends. Later that night it was me her and two of my other friends. One friend left to do something and the other friend started playing I guess you could call it sexual music. She started dancing on me and feeling up on me and all kinds of things. I started thinking to myself that this isn't something a person would do to someone unless they liked that person. So in my head while she's dancing on me and feeling up on me I'm thinking maybe she likes me. When I say she was feeling up on me I mean she was kissing me on the neck, sucking my neck and trying to feel my manly hood. Anyways after like 30 minutes of her doing that my other friend came back and then she started dancing up on him and twerking on him.... she wasn't kissing up on him and everything like she was doing to me though. While she was doing this it got me thinking, she might be a hoe. Cause like you don't just do stuff like that right? Anyways after she's done with him she comes back to me and does the same thing and after a while my friends and I left, she also left too. One of my friends got her snapchat and asked her what she thinks of me and she said I was cute. So that also got me thinking that hey she might like me. Couple days later she came back to were me and my friends were and she acted kinda flirty with one of my friends, lets call him Ricky cause he's slick as fuck and you'll find out why later. He supposedly wasn't attracted to her in anyway shape or form and the reason I know this is because Ricky told me, we were kind close, like ALMOST brothers. Anyways the girl would flirt with him and she even came up with a nickname for him that he didn't like but still wouldn't tell her not to call him that. While this as going on I just thought to myself 'Yea I should probably just forget about her'. One day I could just tell something was gonna happen between them, and when I get a feeling like this it's always 100% correct. The night my friends and I left, Ricky and the girl stayed back. When we left, she sucked Ricky's dick. Ricky told me because as I said before, we're almost like brothers. The thing is he never knew that I liked her so there's no reason for me to get upset or anything and plus nothing happened between me and the girl. But I did tell him about the night she was kissing up on me and stuff so with knowing that you should know to kind of back off right? Anyways I found out that she sucked his dick and I pretended to be happy for the many, I was like ""congratulations"", ""you go boy"" even though deep inside I was kinda disappointed. So it was only me and a couple other people that knew about this because the girl didn't want ANYBODY to know. Someone overheard Ricky telling us this and then the person who overheard it ending up telling the girl this. She was upset at Ricky and she was upset with me too. The reason she was upset with me was because I didn't tell her, she expected me to tell her because we were messaging each other over instagram a little so I guess she thought we were close like that. So she's upset with Ricky and I kinda talked my way out of her being upset with me. After that happened, her and I got closer, we were messaging each other everyday, every second. So we decided to exclusively talk, meaning we wouldn't be trying to mess with anyone else. We were making out, feeling up on each other and many more. We were basically boyfriend and girlfriend but without the title(her words). Oh yea I forgot to mention something, there were rumors going around that this girl was a hoe, like she would just be fucking people left and right, but I didn't really care about that because what's in the past is in the past, I genuinely cared for her... a lot, more than I have about anyone else. We were talking for months so don't think I just fell for her quick as fuck. Anyways one day Ricky genuinely apologized to her for what he did. Later that night she told me about how he apologized to her even though I already knew since he told me. Couple days to come she messages me saying she want's to take a break since we're moving too ""fast"". I kinda new something was up especially since she said it a couple days after he apologized to her. Literally a couple days. Basically she said she want's to see how it would be for her if we weren't together. We agreed to give her some days for her to see what it's like. Day after we decided that it was a little awkward because everyone knew we were together, like I told people we were together and she did too, I didn't care at all of what people were saying about her or talked about her. Oh yea I forgot to mention NONE of my friends wanted me to be with her because of the rumors that were going around, but I didn't care at all because as I said before, it was in the past and I care for her. Sorry I'm forgetting to mention some things, the memory's just coming as it goes. Anyways it was awkward, she went to hang with her friends and I went to play a game with two of my female friends that didn't like her either. Later that day we got in a fight because she was upset that I wasn't talking to her and I was hanging out with other female friends, in essences she was jealous. I let her know that if we aren't together that I'm not gonna be putting everyone aside to hang out with her especially since that day she just wanted to hangout with her friends. We came to an agreement that she wanted to be with me so we decided to get back together. Fast forward a few weeks later she said she wants to take a break because she doesn't know what she wan'ts anymore. I honestly didn't know what to say, I was just looking at her stunned. She asked me why I wanted to be with her and I told her so many reasons why I wanted to be with her and that I didn't care what people said and she asked me what I meant by that and I told her the rumors that were going around and she just broke up into tears. Asking why a person so nice like me would want a person like her and I told her why(deep down I think it's because I was starting to love her, just know at this moment we were months into being with each other) I didn't tell her I loved her because I thought maybe that was just moving too fast but I told her some things about herself that I liked. In the end we still agreed to take a break but even though we agreed to take a break, that following night we proceeded to make out with each other and feel up on each other over and over that night. The following day I walk in my friends tell me how she was texting a guy she was suppose to have sex with that following day... I was so hurt. I just started to think to myself that nothing she said or felt towards me was real. If she really cared about me then how could you plan to have sex with someone else the day after we stop talking. I just didn't get it. We talked about it and she realized that she was wrong for doing that even though she kept on blaming my friends for putting her business out there when she's the one going around telling MY friends that she's gonna have sex with someone else when they knew we literally just stopped talking. Anyways a couple weeks pasted and we haven't talked to each other at all, no text no nothing. I caved in and texted her and she didn't want to talk at all because something happened to her, I can't say what because it's a personal thing that she only told me and someone else.  I rushed to see her and she even knew I was coming to see her but I don't think she cared at all. She went to her friends room and apparently she fell asleep. She texted me hours after she said she wanted to talk and told me she fell asleep. I knew that was a lie because when I was leaving the place she was at, I heard her laughing with this guy and her other friends. After that all I did was message her asking if she's okay and things like that then I didn't message her again. Couple days later me ricky and some friends were going to the gym to workout. Ricky had his hoodie on so she decided to take ricky's hoodie since she was cold when she could've just asked for mine since we were closer but I tried not to overthink it. But I still had that feeling again that something was gonna happen that night. After that I went home and Ricky started texting me asking me where the girl was because she still had his hoodie, I text her telling her that ricky needed his hoodie back and she drove to give it to him and that's all ricky told me that happened. The next day ricky pulled me to the side and said that when he went to get his hoodie, she called him into the car and she was feeling up on him and trying to suck his dick again but he stopped her from doing so and I was kinda happy that he told me that because that was kind of helping me get over her even though I still had feelings for her. Then one night a couple weeks later me and the girl ended up talking on the phone. She messaged me saying that we should talk about something in person but I knew if that happened then we would've just ending up making out and doing stuff again so I said no and we ended up talking on the phone. So we started talking and I felt that she wanted to tell me something, so I mention that Ricky told me something(I didn't tell her what) and she asked what he told me. I didn't tell her because my then Ricky and I were brothers, we considered each other brothers. So she end up telling me that she sucked his dick... again...Not gonna lie, hearing that almost had me in tears. The reason for that is because during our relationship I would ask her if anything would happen between her and ricky again and she said no and that she didn't have feelings at all for ricky. I asked her why and the first thing that came out her mouth was ""I was upset at you""... So she sucked my best friend, someone who I considered a brother, she sucked his dick. Again. I felt so stupid. The amount of people that told me, she's just gonna hurt you, you can't turn a hoe into a housewife and many more. I felt so dumb so stupid to fall for someone like her. Don't get me wrong I was upset and Ricky too but can I really get upset with them even though me and the girl weren't together at the time. I hung up and a couple minutes later she messages me saying how she's sorry and she told me she loved me... I've never heard that from someone before except family members so that kinda hit me hard too. It just messed up my head, I kept wondering if you love someone then why would you do something like this to them. Later that night I called Ricky and he was acting surprised and tongue tied. Saying WHEN did she say this happened and like he was saying anything to prolong the truth. Eventually he said she's lying and that it didn't happen, but I didn't believe him at all, I just said okay and hung up the phone. Why would she come to me telling me that and it all being a lie? It made no sense for it to be a lie so I knew he was lying. Since he also said ""when did she say this happened"" it just got me to wonder more if it happened more times than that and some other things happened too that made me wonder that. I want to say more but I just can't bring myself to saying more. Anyways thanks for listening, I really needed to get that off my chest. I honestly don't know what to do because I do still have feelings for the girl but I just can't bring myself to trust her again. Sorry for the long write by the way, it's just a lot that happened. Also I've never done any of the things with the girl to anyone else, she was the first and that's why it hurts  a lot more I guess. She's the first person I've loved and also done things with."
I’m so confused and worried,"So last night me and my friend decided to spend the night at her boyfriends house. (I’m 19, she’s 18, and he’s 22) 
We had all been drinking and smoking so they were both drunk and high, although I wasn’t really affected by it and still felt normal, just a little buzzed sense it was my first time drinking. Originally, I was going to sleep on the couch and my friend and her bf would sleep in his bed, but he fell asleep on the couch so me and my friend went into his room and started watching tv. She fell asleep before me bc she was really tired, but when I finally laid down to go to sleep, her boyfriend came in and got in the bed with us. They were laying the same way and I was over by the side. I fell asleep in my clothes (and bra) bc I didn’t bring anything with me. Anyway, the next morning when I woke up, I realized my bra was undone. It opens from the back and it had been unhooked. It couldn’t have just undid itself because when I sleep, I’m like a brick and don’t move, also I was squished in the corner of the bed. I even took a nap later today and my bra didn’t come undone. So... I think my friends bf might have undid my bra and touched my boobs while I was sleeping. I honestly don’t know. But something that’s also worrying is that my friend said her bf was so drunk he took of his pants and underwear, so him being drunk and horny is not impossible. I don’t want to tell her this because I don’t know how to say it, and I don’t want to accuse her boyfriend of something so serious. But I trust her so if I can get some second opinions on this, I might tell her. "
I have out grown my once best friend,"I don't even know where to start. I've known this person for a really long time and we were best friends in college. But ever since college graduation, I've just lost any and all interest in being friends with him. 

The problem is that our friend group is so intertwined, so I still see him all the time, we even live in the same apartment building. The fact of the matter is that I don't want anything to do with him. The worst part is, he has done nothing wrong to deserve this.

This person is an incredibly nice, smart person with a great sense of humor. We have a lot of interests in common. That being said, I want nothing to do with him. This is what I don't like:

He has no ambition, has no big plans or goals for the future. He has no hobbies - he spends weekends indoors  watching YouTube videos all day. But the WORST thing... he is a complete and total wimp. Remember I said they were super nice? That's all well and good, except this person is a full on doormat. I hate how he hasn't made any strides at developing as a person. I can see in other friends how they have grown over the years, become wiser and better versions of themselves. This person is the same wimpy, weak person.

I really can't stand weak people. You know, the type of people who give you limp, dead handshakes. I think the core reason is because I'm projecting my own insecurities on them, like maybe if my best friend is a weak, wimpy, pathetic person, what does that say about ME. I don't know, but I can't stand it, and I can't be friends with wimpy, unambitious, not-going-anywhere, simple, basic people like this once friend. 

Maybe I'm an asshole, but I feel the way I feel. "
I’m in love w a girl that I haven’t talked to much and probably won’t see again,"Honestly f*ck me

I insanely like this one girl who I’ve talked to for an hour or two beforehand like a month or more ago.  Every time I see name on Insta or smth, it not only high-key triggers me to the point where I’m emotionally unstable, but also makes me insanely sad.  I can like feel it in my stomach.  It’s superseded almost everything else that I’ve put my emotion into previously and my work ethic is now kinda shot in part because of it.

I know this is weird.  Like it makes me seem like a perverted creep and I really don’t like that.  Some of my friends know of me and her and also mutually know her as a person, so I try to limit any conversation about what I think and play it cool.  But all of this stuff I’ve said is 100 percent true and on my mind a ton.

After talking to her last month, I got the impression that she likes me (we are pretty sure she likes me even tho she probably isn’t obsessing over me like a weirdo), but she realizes that this probably wouldn’t work.  If she thought it would, she’d likely put more time into it or at least text once as a last chance effort.  The pragmatism is probably true considering we live pretty far from each other and will be even further next year.  I’m scared to text her because there’s not really any reason to; it might seem weird.  Even if I do, there’s a slim chance that I commit to something this summer to see her.  

Anyway, I’m posting this after seeing something she was tagged in on Insta.  I looked at it for a little bit and then shut down my work and brushed my teeth and am sitting in bed now.  Kind of all I want to do is spend time w her and have fun.  The goal’s not to smash her like a couple people think it is but I’d also be down for that :p.  I really hate most people in my everyday school environment, and she is someone who seems like she genuinely cares about people and is extremely nice (even tho I had this kid text me the other day and tell me that “she’s not nice bc she s- talked someone” lol). She’s also smart and insanely attractive.  I really really like her


But srsly how do I get out of this?  I’m actually insane and if I don’t get my grades up I can kiss HYPSM goodbye 😔. Thank you in advance :) 

PS- this sends me into a cycle at night where I masturbate to intense porn that I don’t even like at all.  It’s fucking disgusting lol."
My dads business,My dad owns a little business and he’s been working his ass off since he got out of college and because of being born with a poor background he wasn’t able to do much. I’m a high schooler and I want to help him to expand his company but how will I start that? Any suggestions? I wanna do it without needing like a degree or something. I know that sounded naive
I'm a sadist,"So I'm a serious sadist... The idea of people getting hurt and suffering turns me on. Hell, writing this and thinking of people suffering is turning me on. It's a serious problem because whenever I talk to people, I just imagine them all bloodied up and broken mentally and physically. When I walk into a crowd of people, I just imagine all of them on the verge of death pleading me to stop torturing them. Mental torture is my favorite because the scars that mental torture will always be carved into the minds of people. But back to it being a big problem in my everyday life, I'm currently learning about slavery in history and the world wars in english. It's so hard keep a serious face on, it's hard to keep the smile and blush off my face while the teacher talks about people suffering. I almost showed my ""real self"" once when I snapped at a couple of classmates, the shock on their face was amazing and I wanted more! It's a good thing I'm able to keep myself in check or else a few people would go missing.. Hahah. I just stick to looking through stories and webtoons/mangas online with people being killed/tortured or raped. Anyway, I'm scared that people wil turn away from me and abandon me if I show them this side of me so I'm currently holding myself back. But I'm running out of sadistic material to keep me in check and I'm scared of knowing what'll happen if I finally ""snap""."
"I hate depressed people,","I know this is shitty but i just hate when people talk about how they want to kill themselves and how their life is horrible and that no one loves them and they should off themselves and no one will care. I HATE IT! It just sounds so selfish to me! I know some of its not, but damn. Everywhere I go someone wants to kill themself. Like shut up life is hard get over it. My life isnt easy either. No ones life is. Everyone has trouble and some people have really bad trauma and really bad stuff that happened to them. Eat your generic brand cereal and be fucking happy with your life that you have something to eat, somewhere to sleep and if no one fucking loves you then love your fucking self.

Sorry i just needed to get that out. I fully understand that i DONT understand how these people feel because i have never thought the way they do. I also fully understand its not as easy as it sounds, but I wish it was. i wish people didnt feel that way because everyone is worth sooo much more than they think and i wish that i could show everyone that. "
I don't know what I want from my future,"I'm 17. I'm in my last year of school, good grades in every class, no problems with family, no problems with money, no problems with friends and I *know* I should be happy. I know that I have no right to complain because right everything seems to be going perfectly. And yet, I'm at a complete loss. This one big thing right in front of my nose that won't go away, this one big thing I have no idea how to deal with and it's only coming closer, it's eating me up from the inside.

I have no idea what I want to do with my life. And it's not because of a lack of options. It's moreso an abundance of options. I'm torn between arts and science, torn between teaching and learning, torn between creation and analysis. I've looked at the options. I've looked into music, English, German, math, physics, psychology and philosophy and I've always heard the same thing: You need to be sure that this is the thing you want to do later in your life. But I'm *not*. I'm good at music, but am I good enough to *study and work* in the sector of music? I consider myself fairly good at math but is it enough to *study and work* in the sector of math?

I'd love to do it all, but I know I can't, so I'm forced to make a choice that simultaneously closes dozens of other paths. And in the back of my head, a voice keeps screaming, louder and louder: *""What if you make the wrong choice?""*"
Regrets and clarity - how to lose a family 101,"Sitting alone on the patio of an overpriced shoebox rental. Thinking about what was my (31M) family (30F + 4M) and all the things I did wrong.
The house, car, career. The opportunities I would still be missing if I had of stayed, and the things I would change if only that were possible.
Not having seen them in over 3 months. Not having been there for them for over 3 years, despite being present. Knowing what I have done and how I handled that which was done to me. Becoming who I did and stonewalling who I should have been. Drowned in a broth of depression, guilt and substance, all of which I know realise was my subconscious’ way of avoiding the inevitably of confirming that you were out of love with me.
6 months and not 10mins passes where I don’t miss the two of you. Not 10 mins that I don’t dream that there is a minuscule possibility that I can write the wrongdoings, only to have to beat myself again to drum in that there is no hope. You have found what you wanted, now I’m just having to face a life as a bystander as you both have the life which we should have shared in together.
Having to face that I now have to fight for access to be a part-time secondary dad at best.
I am sorry for the behaviour that has hurt you both. I wish I could find the hope to promise I won’t hurt you again but as written above, the continued pain and remorse I am sentenced to from here in, I can’t promise anything.
I wish you both the happiness you more than deserve.
With all of my heart. Xo "
I'm losing weight but I can't tell my family. [NAW],"As the title states, I'm managing to lose weight and am looking forward to being in shape again, which doesn't seem too far away. However, my family is the ""clean your plate"" type and as a result we are not obese, but my family is pudgy and heading towards overweight. Since I'm getting pretty tall (6'2 going on 3) my body has started to appear slimmed down, and I've had compliments from friends stating that I've had a ""major glow-up"", which makes me all the more determined to get in shape.  I've curbed the amount of calories I've consumed per day by halving what I would usually eat (not starving myself, but eating when I'm actually hungry and not the traditional times) and drinking a metric crapton of water all day, which also reduces my headaches. As well as this, I've started working out and using the treadmill to exercise.

I'd love to be able to tell my family that I'm finally making progress on eating healthier, but because they're old-fashioned they'd think I was starving myself. They're not intentionally fattening us up however, but fast food restaurants are more convenient for us when we are out and about. 

Overall, I'm elated to be losing pounds before summer starts but I can't tell my family, so I'm telling you guys.

I met my all time favorite film director last week and need to get off my chest how excited I am.,"I've been a fan of this guy's work since I was in highschool and found my own passion in filmmaking from studying his films. I never thought I would ever have a chance to meet him as he's a kind of recluse director and I never thought I would ever be talented enough or know the right people to ever get in a room to talk to him. However, it was announced that he was premiering a new show on netflix at  South by Southwest and I had saved up enough money from gigs that I could get a pass to go. I was the very first in line at the premiere and made sure to sport a jacket from one of his old production companies that I found on ebay a few years ago. However, while in line I over heard the theater manager next to me say that the director might not be able to make it anymore due to some travel complications. I was disheartened but hey at least I would be one of the first in the world to see this awesome new project he was working on. WELL turns out the theater manager was talking about him not being able to make some press interview they had set up and he in fact showed up right as we were walking in. Not only that, but when I sat down I was given a pass to an after party netflix was putting on across the street following the screening. So after the brilliant screening of this show, I went to the after party and as soon as I walked in I see him standing near the bar talking to some other fans. I was so fucking nervous that I ordered a couple drinks waiting for him to finish his conversation. It took about 3 drinks and 4 other sets of people that he talked to for me to finally build up the courage to go up to him . As soon as I approached him he shook my hand and complimented the jacket I was wearing and we talked for a while about the new production company he's heading now and how he loved seeing someone support the old one. I asked him some filmmaking advice and he gave me some brilliant words of wisdom and our conversation ended with him saying he can't wait to see my reel some day. Holy Fuck. I've never felt so inspired and motivated in my life and for one of the first times in my filmmaking life, I feel confirmation that I can one day do something great. This probably sounds so stalker-ish and over the top but I needed a place to kind of let it all out bc everytime I try to bring it up with one of my friends I feel like I'm being super self indulgent and annoying. I tried talking to my girlfriend about it a few days ago but we've been on a rough patch and she told me she didn't care. So This was kind of to get all this weird pent up excited energy out of my system so I can go back to focusing on my films so I can hopefully one day get his attention through my work instead of dumb luck. "
I wasted my entire day.,"I (15 F) had little homework this weekend and was planning on relaxing and playing video games all day Sunday. Free weekends are rare for me since I get so much hw. But obviously it had to be ruined.
I got into an argument with my mom because I said I would do my chores later cuz I was doing hw and she told me some really mean stuff like she wishes I would die and how I'm so fat and all. My mom is so sweet and I love her but she has this angry side that comes out sometimes it's sad. So she took away my Playstation and hid it. I was crying from the argument we had and had a massive headache the entire day. I played on my phone and did random shit the entire day which added to my headache. I barely got any hw done and tried to study for the math test tomorrow, but I couldn't.
I'm super pissed that my entire day was wasted. I rarely get free days and was really looking forward to gaming. I'm also screwed for that math test tomorrow; I need to have a good grade. I feel so shitty rn I hate my life sometimes."
I was wrong and it was my insecurities that permanently damaged a relationship,"My low self esteem absolutely ruined what I perceived to be a significant relationship with someone I cared about.

Looked through messages from years ago between an ex and me and the conversations were different than I remembered. My immature attitude and extremely attached personality weakened opportunities to genuinely bond. We started dating after I sent her a picture cutting myself to appeal to her own issues she was going through. 

She never cheated on me yet I always felt threatened by other guys she’d talk to. She was my high school crush and a voice always told me “how did I get to date this girl” as if I wasn’t enough despite us already being together for months.

The support I gave her throughout suicidal and depressive episodes didn’t continue throughout her good days where it arguably mattered more to create an even stronger bond.

I over analyzed everything about her knowing the exact amount of time it took for her to walk to her house from the bus stop, the micro facial expressions she’d make according to various types of smiles which gave a clue as to what she was smiling about, researching new subjects she’d bring up in texts to always have something to reply with even if I had no clue what she was on about at first. It’s scary and unhealthy. 

The day before breaking up I logged onto her Facebook without her knowledge and saw her talking to guys I told her not to talk with which explained why she wasn’t as responsive that day. I went off on her but deleted everything on her end before she noticed and only saw one sentence I left which was enough to end the relationship. My insecurities led to this yet I always blamed her for ruining the relationship.

She said that she was afraid to break up with me out of fear of killing myself or someone else and I didn’t understand what she meant until now. Going through old pictures it’s clear that she isn’t as happy as she is now. She said I made her feel vulnerable and I was unsure what to make of it but it makes sense that your partner should feel confident and secure around you. I took her vulnerability to be emotional as in letting her guard down around me out of trust but I’m not sure about that. 

It’s been years and I’m ashamed but glad to notice this now."
I was raped.. I think,"I was only 12 years old. Im now 25. I had a best friend named jimmy who was 14 at the time. He had an older brother named Jamie who was about 18-19 at the time. He was always around. I used to play manhunt and “tackle each other off the snow hill” with all the kids on the block. I spent my afternoons playing Nintendogs and watching the family channel. I was still a little girl. I didn’t even know what losing your virginity meant morally. I hardly knew what sex meant. I knew what drinking was (this is important later) because that’s all my parents lives consisted of, so I saw a lot of that. No one ever had “the talk” with me. Anyway, I went for a sleepover at my friend Jimmys (Yeah my parents didn’t give a shit about my well being). In my mind, we were just kids right? No big deal. His brother happened to be there that night and he was drunk. Jimmy wasn’t around but his brother came into the room with beer. He told me to have one. I thought in a way it was “cool” I guess because I saw the grown ups doing it and it was “bad”, but was scared to drink it because of the taste because it was my first time even holding a beer.  So he grabbed my face and held it at my mouth to drink it. Gagging and all, I kept drinking it. After that is when he started to put his hands in my pants and honestly, I didn’t understand what was going on. It all happened so fast. He took my pants off and was inside of me. He had his gross sweaty face on my face. Breathing on me so I started to cry because I didn’t like what was happening to me. He then says “I like it when you moan”. I don’t remember a lot of the rest because I blocked it out of my mind for years. I just remember standing in the bathroom after and looking at myself in the mirror disgusted with no emotions. I never told anyone this because I thought it was my fault it happened, because I “let” it happen. I thought because he wasn’t physically holding me down that it wasn’t rape. I still feel like I have to explain myself. This was wrong right? An 18 year old should have known he was taking advantage of a 12 year old girl right? From that day on, I was never a little girl again. Years later I found out I had chlamydia when I realized what STD’s were.  I spent my whole life feeling worthless and dirty because of him. I hated myself that day on, and I am just finding my worth again.. but I KNOW this wasn’t right deep down. He knew I was a little girl. I know I was. "
Being a nice guy sucks,"I've always been a caring and nice guy. I've always put others before me. It's just in my nature and part of my character. But it's gotten me no where! Fast forward to me meeting a girl and at first the chemistry is off the charts! We share music, likes, dislikes, and we talk for hours upon hours. I planned out a really nice first date and I brought her a rose. She seemed so into it. Complimenting me left and right. Telling others about it. Telling me how she's never been treated this way and it only made me feel good and happy to see her smiling. We planned several more dates from me getting invited to dinner with her and her kids that lead to an amazing night of bowling and video game arcade. We did a picnic and really it was just a very nice experience I was having. I thought for sure that she would be someone who I would continue to get to know. Everything was wonderful. 

Not for long. We waited to have sex and when we did it was really an amazing moment we both shared but that turned out to be the beginning of the end. Even after she told me she had never felt the way she did with me and that I was the best she ever had(I don't put much weight into that as sometimes it's a big emotional event and can blur reality). She began to text less. She started telling me things like she didn't like to plan too far ahead because she didn't want to have to break plans because she felt bad about that. She really did a 180 and eventually I had enough. I came out and asked her if ""we were good"".... Incoming the I like you but I'm not ready for a relationship but. Just what?! 

Im tired of being the nice guy. This is the second time I've been crushed by someone who I invested myself into because I saw a future. It's absurd. All she ever talked about was how guy x,y, or z sucked and whatever. She went on to say that she still felt in love with her ex husband who took her kids from her (what the fuck?!) And that she said it really sucks because I'm such a great guy. Spare me... Jesus I'm so over being used."
What is the point of living when i’m just suffering,"All my fucking life ive had health problems that got dismissed by my mom and made fun of. Now i’m 18 and i need to deal with them by myself alone. Ive been suspecting that i have throat cancer, now i’m 100% sure that i have it. And it sucks. I think that i get complications from it, like my nose feels fucking full all the time and its hard to breathe. I have oxygen deficiency. I show all signs yet people think that i have anxiety and i cant fucking stand it. I CANT FUCKING BREATHE. I DONT HAVE ANXIETY. Im gonna die slowly and people arent even gonna know what killed me. Why do i have to suffer? Why me? I cant get no rest, mental of physical. I cant do it no more. I DONT WANNA DO THIS ANYMORE. What is the point of living when there is no fun?? “Wait, its gonna be better” HOWW?? Im gonna die if i wait. My whole life ive been just waiting, just waiting for something. Meanwhile people had fun. Fuck me, my life and everyone around me"
"My ""Boyfriend"" is actually a cross dressing pansexual and I'm mostly here to protect them.","So I started dating *** in highschool, they were popular, sporty, jock , charming type of person. I didnt think it would work as *** was just a rebound for me and we had nothing in common. After a while I began to realize *** was different than I had first assumed (never judge a book by its cover) *** slowly started to open up to me over the course of a year. Their parents were super strict and had high expectations of *** because to them they were their ""first born son"" *** struggled with these expectations as they clashed with *** being themself. After a while of dating *** they told me all about their cross dressing and gender fluidity and fear of being treated as ""different""

I did my best to comfort *** and we eventually fell in love (I am a Bisexual Cis Female)

Me and *** live together now but im very afraid that my expectations for a relationship are hindering *** from fully embracing who they really are.

I do my best to keep ***'s secret but I feel as though I have a hard time fully understanding them. I would love *** no matter what gender they choose and I would always keep ***'s secret but I'm starting to feel like just kind of a cover up or just a ""Normal route"" for *** I cant help but feel like I'm hindering them from being themself (Something I would truly like to be a part of and help with!)

I love *** no matter what they choose but I cant help but feel like a comfort blockade between *** and who they truly want to be. I feel like me and *** could REALLY get along and love each other if they would just be themself and if I werent so afraid but theres a lot of pressure from every angle. I guess I'm just venting now though. "
My girlfriend’s daughter gets manipulated by her ex-husband and his girlfriend.,"I just want to say, my girlfriend has two amazing kids. A boy and a girl. They’re the most, kind, innocent and loving kids I’ve ever met. So whenever something bad happens to them, I get upset. I love those kids as if they were my own and they love me the same. They think of me as a father and call me dad despite their real father being in their lives. 

Her ex-husband is a real piece of work. He is abusive physically, mentally, emotionally and narcissistic as fuck. He’s also extremely manipulative and controlling. He’s not only that way to my girlfriend but to her kids too. He manipulates and controls them. The oldest child (which is the boy) doesn’t fall for his dads tactics as much as his sister does. It’s not because she isn’t intelligent to catch it, she’s just very young and a daddy’s girl. She trusts her dad to protect her, be there for her and to never lie to her about anything. He knows that and chooses to control or manipulate that in anyway possible. She’s came up to me and cried about her dad lying to her multiple times. I told this to my girlfriend and I’ll say it now, the first man to ever break her heart is her own father. 

I want to lay down a few examples of what this piece of shit did. 

Christmas of 2017, both kids finished opening up their presents and start playing with their new stuff all day. Later that evening, she is with her dad alone upstairs while my girlfriend and her son were downstairs play games with each other. My girlfriend then decides to make her way to the stairs to go upstairs to do something but then she hears her daughter and her dad talking so she stops and listens. My girlfriend hears him tell her that all these Christmas gifts made a big dent in his funds (my girlfriend got locked out of the martial account so she didn’t have access to his money only child tax) and continues to stress to her about it. My girlfriend was livid that he was talking to their daughter about funds, making her worried that they might lose their home and such. In reality, he was fine financially. Her daughter then later cried to her mom and asked if they were gonna be okay. My girlfriend’s was PISSED. 

Another example, last summer, my girlfriend’s kids were with their dad... or were supposed to be. He dumped his son off at his parents and gave his daughter to his sister. He did this so he could go hangout with his girlfriend. Just for a little context here, his sister has 2 kids of her own. But she doesn’t have any custody towards her kids at all because she was too busy doing drugs and sleeping around with men. So the father of one of the kids took his kid and the other kid in with him and she legally lost custody. So whenever her kids go to their grand parents for night, that’s when she goes and sees them but doesn’t care to fight for custody at all. Yet she brags on social media how she is a proud mom and loves her kids. Yeah... okay...

Anyway, so he gives his daughter to his sister so she can go to the beach with her and her daughter. While there, she never once gave her water or sunscreen. They were there for like 12 hours. The next day, he gives the kids back to my girlfriend and her daughter is extremely sunburnt, head to toe and shaking. He goes, “Yeah she went to the beach and got a little crispy. She’s been sitting in the bathtub all morning.” He then laughs as it seems funny to him? 

My girlfriend, as any worried parent, went into panic mode when her ex left because her daughter was showing symptoms of heat exhaustion, breathing funny, saying she felt cold but was burning up. My girlfriend immediately takes her to the hospital and yep, severe heat exhaustion. Me and my girlfriend were LIVID. I spent all night with her, playing games or watching movies to try to get her to forget about the pain. 

He also lost her in a hotel once and didn’t give a shit. He, my girlfriend and their kids went on a trip years ago. In the hotel room, he said he was going to the front desk for something and his son said he wanted to go with him. His daughter shoots up and says, “I want to come too!” He then opens and holds the door for her and she goes out and him and his son follow behind. 

Few minutes later, he and his son come back to the room but their daughter wasn’t with him. My girlfriend asks, “Where’s [insert her daughters name here]?” 

He says, “I thought she was with you.”

My girlfriend says, “You knew she was with you, you opened the door for her.”

He just stands there. My girlfriend shoots out of the hotel room and runs around the hotel looking for her. But did he follow behind her and start looking as well? Nope. He stayed in the hotel room. Thankfully, my girlfriend found her in an arcade place and brought her back to the room. He didn’t say a word. 


Now this one is a little fucked up. 2018 is when they slowly started a divorce but separated years before that. They slept on different floors in the house they had together. The kids knew it wasn’t normal but didn’t ask. What no one knew at the time is that, he was dating someone... and he brought his daughter with him any chance he could when he went to his girlfriend’s house. He manipulated her and told her not to tell her mom where they’re going or what they’re doing because she has depression. He also told her, at the time to call his girlfriend Aunty because he wanted to fool her into thinking she was just a friend. The divorce stage was very early at that time so she thought they were still together. Eventually, she couldn’t hold it in anymore and wanted to tell her mom. So she did. My girlfriend was super pissed and brought it up at the meeting with her lawyer and his, after his lawyer praised him for being honest during this whole thing. Literally, her lawyer and his lawyer yelled at him for lying and controlling their daughter. His face turned bright red. 

Here’s the most recent one that happened literally 2-3 days ago. 

My girlfriend’s daughter has long hair and she loves it. She even takes vitamins for her hair regularly so it stays healthy. Her mom usually helps with maintaining her hair. She’s doing a concert in May and was so excited to make her hair look fancy. 

A week before that, her ex-husband’s girlfriend texts my girlfriend and asks if arraignments can be made regrading her daughter’s hair because she didn’t like when she tried helping her or braiding it. She wanted her mom to do it. So basically, my girlfriend would take her a few times a week (they have 50/50 custody)  to help with her hair after a shower or something. 

Now, his girlfriend took his daughter and got her hair cut and dyed. Now there wouldn’t be a problem with this if she actually wanted to do that but she didn’t. Her dad didn’t want my girlfriend seeing her during his time with them and he didn’t feel like helping with her hair and neither did his girlfriend. Also, when she took her to get her hair changed, she booked her under her LAST NAME. People working there thought she was her mom and she played along with it. My girlfriend once again was livid because she is HER MOM. My girlfriend started feeling a lot of anxiety and started crying, all weekend. I was and still am, very pissed. Me and my girlfriend are contacting her lawyer tomorrow and fixing that bullshit. I’m pretty sure with the name thing, that’s illegal and she’s not getting away with it. 

I could sit here and list a bunch of things he and his girlfriend have done to my girlfriend and her kids. He should be rotting in jail right now for some of the shit he’s done but my girlfriend keeps him around for the kids, yet they idolize me more than him and call me dad. Her son calls his dad out on some of his shit and when his dad notices, he punishes him by grounding him or something. They don’t have a very good father-son relationship at all, mostly because his dad doesn’t care to have one. When he wants me to listen to him talk about something he’s really into, I listen and chat with him about it. He has an incredible mind. His dad doesn’t do that at all. He prefers to hangout with his girlfriend. Both kids have told me that I feel a lot more like a dad to them than their actually father and honestly, it means a lot to me. I’m there for them whenever they need to talk or even just to play a game with. My girlfriend and her kids are my everything. I don’t like seeing them being manipulated by their dad and his girlfriend. They don’t deserve that. I know when they’re older, they’re gonna know what he is and then they’re gonna leave him to die. I’m so mad right now. The kids come back to my girlfriend tomorrow after school and I’m gonna spend time with them. I’m gonna bring them out for coffee or something and show them they’re important to me. It’s easy to call anyone a dad but it’s hard to call them a father. He’s not a father at all. "
I hate loyalty programs at stores,"I am a cashier. 
I hate asking you to sign up or sign in way more than you hate being asked. 
I only ask because my job literally depends on it. I have had many panic attacks before and during work over this shit. We are told we need a certain percentage of our transactions to signing in(65% or more) or else they cut our hours. On a good week I might work 25 hours at minimum wage. On a bad week I've been scheduled 8 or less.
And all of it's based off shit I cannot control. I do my job well, customers somehow like me, I can ring people up in a very timely manner, but it doesn't matter. The only thing that matters is customers decision to join or sign up on a whim. Fine, I know you're in a hurry (why are you at a store then?) So I'll ""not worry"" about it. Actually I'm gonna panic about it and likely cry once you leave and I'm alone, but I won't tell you that. 
It wouldn't be so hard either if the loyalty program was any fucking good. Give me something actually good to work with and people will want it, goddamn. It's not fucking rocket science. People want points that build up to something, shit, give the a little store credit and they'll spend more. Whoop de fucking doo about a barely better coupon every once in a while. 

But that's besides the point. The real problem is corporate and the push towards impossible goals. I'd love to see any of them try to make their goals. Especially at minimum wage. Fuck all of them. And I don't care that they're the reason I have a fucking job, I'm looking for a new job and they can suck my dick. I don't get paid enough for this shit.
Never. Enough. For. This. Shit.

"Thank you Dad, I Still Love You","(Firstly apologize if this breaks the rules or it’s the wrong sub)

Even though I was having a great week despite passing out in my professors office, being harassed by Jehovah Witnesses at the hospital for an hour straight, I passed two biology midterms and I was so proud of myself. I kept a smile on my face because it’s one step closer to my goal of becoming someone that can help someone. 

Until you texted me how I was neglecting you by not coming to see you, and so I did. I wish you would have taken your medicine. I don’t blame you for your mental illness. But your medicine helps and I wish you’d take it because I know you’d be okay if you did. It sucks to hear you call me derogatory names. It sucks you wish you would have made mom get an abortion with me. It sucks when you just seem to find complete pleasure and happiness in knowing you made me feel completely horrible and I have to take anxiety medication just to keep from having a panic attack. 

Having to sit in your car and cry in a desolate parking lot for over 2 hours only to keep crying when you crawl into your dorm bedroom and wonder why you don’t love me: that’s the super sucky part. I hope you find happiness. I found mine and though your words may hurt for a little while I’ll still put a smile on my face the next day. And though you may have never shown love to me. I still love you. "
i just broke the lid to my moms tank and i feel horrible,"my mom let me use her tank because i got a hamster! it’s a big one and im very happy she let me use it and this was supposed to be my moment to prove i’m able to have things without supervision... but i really messed up.

i dropped it. its not completely shattered but theres stil a big piece missing... and im devastated that i fucked up so badly

my mom has had this tank for YEARS. its been around since i was a baby and im seventeen. i just cant belive i cant keep one nice thing without accidentally breaking it. i dont know. i feel horrible. gonna sleep it off."
Just me venting,"I work at a shop which has only 2 cashiers and I am one. We both work full time. My coworker has missed two days of work, one for hospital visits which I understood and second because he had to go to immigration to make a passport (which doesn’t take a lot of time also tbh) but I also understood that he didn’t want to come after that. But also note that I am struggling with my health. I have chronic migraines and body aches and dizziness that comes out of nowhere. I made it to work this 2 days even when I was feeling down and today when I woke up I just didn’t feel good and didn’t want the extra stress of work so I messaged him and let him know that I am not feeling good and can’t make it to work. Which he didn’t respond to. Then after the opening time of the shop my phone started ringing with calls from sales assistants that also work there. I didn’t answer cause I honestly thought that the other cashier opened the shop. After a few minutes I received a call from him and he told me to open the shop because apparently he is at the immigration again today ( note that if he went to immigration yesterday to make the passport he has to wait three days till he receive it) so either he lied yesterday or he is lying today. Also if either one of us is not coming we have to let each other know but he didn’t tell me. So I had to come to work today too while still being tired, dizzy and in pain. "
I want to run away from my life.,"It’s bad luck after bad luck. Nothing feels like it’s going to get any better. Since the first day of January it’s been such a shitty way of living. 
My Postpartum depression is really affecting me more and more and no one knows. I want to tell my husband and my mom but I’m afraid. 
My car got stolen in January, my bank account was on very low to the point where I was surviving from my husband, my newborn is having sleep regression, I’m sleep deprived as well, my income tax isn’t coming in and my husbands pissed because we filed jointly so his isn’t coming as well... and I got my very first speeding ticket Wednesday and payed for it fully on Friday not knowing that I was supposed to pay it on the defensive driving site and now it’s going to stay on my record for years. Everyone I’ve talked to about it didn’t even mention  that you’re supp to pay it on the driving site. Why don’t they even have that option on the city site to choose the driving thing. Now my husband is even more pissed and everything just sucks. Now I can’t get on his policy with him because he doesn’t want me to raise up his insurance. He leaves for basic in 2 weeks. 

My life is slowly deteriorating. 

Now I’m stuck with a ticket on my record, depression, and raising our child alone for a few months. 

Thanks for reading this. "
I’m just being petty,"I get discouraged when I’m in a group of people. Even when some of them are people I consider my closest friends, but after a while I just feel like a burden. That I shouldn’t be there. I do know I’m introverted af. But I just can’t communicate, I can’t make that push to include myself and I just end up not saying anything then it just gets worse. Afterwards I should feel happy or satisfied but I just wanna end up dying. I do like being alone but idk I hate myself man. I look at my friends and all their social circles and social lives and I got nothing cuz my brain is all fucked and I just can’t bring myself at this point.  I’m lucky at all to be invited to some stuff but I can’t do it because I know I’m gonna end up wanting to die in the middle of it. I’m just being petty I’m sorry."
On being alone,"How are some people just so lucky? How do some people just find love in the corner of the street? How can some people just marry their childhood friends, their coworkers, even a stranger they met from the Internet? 

Why do I have to try so hard to find love? Why do I have to go on Tinder and OKCupid? Why does my mom, my sister, my coworkers have to find random guys for me to ""be friends"" with? Why do I have to go out more, to find hobbies in a group so that I can find someone new that I will probably like?

I don't want to. I just want him to come to me, perfect and ready.

I don't want to put out an effort... cause I'm scared.

What if I get rejected again? What if they grow tired of me? What if, after all, romantic love is not what I need in life, it's just society making me so convinced that it is?

I can live well without anyone sleeping beside me, I can take care of myself, I can be independent, can't I?

Why do I crave affection this badly even when I know I can fucking live without it? If I'm gonna be alone my whole life, at least let me be fully content with it!

God I fucking hate being like this. "
I've been sexually abused and I have also sexaully abuse someone else during my tween years,"I've been sexually abused by some guy 5-6 years older than me when I was 8, and he abused lots of boys during that age it became kind of a secret norm among us and we kept doing the same to eachother for a while and the worst of all, i did abuse my cousin when I was 11-12 or something because  I thought it was just natural, normal thing to do, since it was happening to me. It was not rape, there was no penetration, also into 1-2 minutes I kinda feel that it was wrong so stopped there but we were both naked and stuff. he tought we were just having fun & playing. 

&#x200B;

I love my cousin and we are like best buddies especially since he got into a university. 

&#x200B;

I feel guilty for what I did. I know I should not blame young me because I did not know better and had the same experience several times caused by another person. It is just awkward. 

&#x200B;

If one day he remembers that event and balmes me/stop seeing me I would be devastated."
Im scared of the dentist,"My parents never took me when I was growing up, because we were so poor. I have crooked teeth that I’m already so ashamed of, and I felt like why bother taking care of them they’re ugly anyway. 

So now I’m a full blown adult who has never been to a dentist. I’m scared. My teeth are horrible. I’m so ashamed. I’m still scared but I have to go. If I could ever fix my teeth my life would be complete, I’ve been so self conscious for over 30 years, scared to meet new people or smile or laugh. I feel disgusting. 

My new boss has no filter and made a pretty mean joke about my teeth and I really just want to die. I have to go to the dentist I don’t want to feel like this anymore. "
My missing PS4 made my family realise our house had been burgled.,"Not really any point to this thread, I guess I just need some kind of catharsis because I don't know how to deal with the emotion I'm feeling. And tbh, idek what that emotion is.

I'm not angry or pissed off. A little upset because it cost so much when I bought it, and I was working in retail for minimum wage so it took almost a month's wages to pay for it. (I always save and rarely spend money on myself so I wasn't being careless when buying it.) But tbh, that's not what's affecting me most.

Mostly I'm just sad that I live a life dedicated to serving others and this one thing I had for myself has been taken. I don't spend money on myself, don't have a social life, no relationship, etc. Even my few friends I see a couple of times year because they're all busy with their jobs. When I'm not with my family, I'm completely alone. 

I was unemployed for most of last year because of mental illness (I've been diagnosed with complex PTSD, bipolar and bulimia) and still am. Now I've recovered I should hopefully be starting my new job in 2 months. My unemployed life is spent taking care of my niece and nephew (6 and 3 years old) because their parents work full time, and caring for my unwell mum, and soon to be unwell dad. I've been at everyone's service for the last 6 years and haven't lived life for myself as a result.

My PS4 was my escape. It was what I did for myself the rare times I had time to myself. Some people go on long drives, on holidays, spa weekends, restaurants, travelling, things that cost money and sometimes require friends. I don't usually get enjoyment from much. I'm not necessarily ""living life to the fullest"" or whatever because I currently don't have the means or will to. I just want to be comfortable and at peace.

I hate the cliché ""me time"" because it's so damn cheesy, but that's exactly what the PS4 gave me. It was my time to myself not doing school runs, changing nappies, toilet training, cooking, cleaning, trying and failing to gain employment, trying and failing to be a normal functioning 24 year old in London.

When playing my games I could simply just zone out and think about nothing for hours. I'm an overly anxious thinking machine so not thinking is the biggest luxury I could ask for. 

It's a piss take that the one of the few materialistic things I have for myself was taken because I'm not at all demanding or high maintenance. My piss poor selection of games showed that lol. Even on the PS4 I only played GTA V Online and Dead Rising 2. My niece and nephew played Trove which was incredible because it taught two very self sufficient and stubbornly independent kids to play together and learn about team work. Teaching them to play has been the best thing in the world because my favourite memories of when I was a kid was my brother teaching me how to play games on SNES/Genesis emulators. I loved giving the kids those memories.

Over the weekend I went on a road trip and stayed near a beach with my sisters and mum. We came back today afternoon. A few hours ago, the kids went home, everyone went to bed, I finally got my much needed moment of silence so I made myself a cup of tea and grabbed my controller as I usually do and turned on the PS4. I waited to hear the PS4 sound but there was nothing. I looked over to where I keep the PS4 but there was nothing. It was neatly taken out and all the wires left behind. Nothing else was taken in the house (that I knew of at the moment) so I went to my room to see if I put it there without thinking on Friday. It wasn't there.

My brother and sister in law mentioned they felt weird over the weekend like there may have been someone in the house because they noticed our kitchen window open. That alone showed something was up because British weather at the moment is so apeshit that the winds have been breaking people's open windows. They were paranoid but nothing was missing (that they knew of) and they checked every room to make sure no one was in the house. 

When searching for my PS4 I noticed a couple of laptops and my nephew's iPad were missing too. That's when we realised that the house was burgled. Nothing big was taken and they seemed to only take what they found in that room.

Our theory is they were in the house when my brother pulled up outside and ran as soon as they heard his car/saw the lights. He drives a huge car so it's really difficult to miss.

I attract bad luck so I should be used to it but still feels shit."
Does it end?,"This isn't a cry for help or a suicide note, don't worry. I just want to know if there are people who have fought through this and come out the other side and everything really is alright. 

I had a drinking problem for a long time. I guess I shouldn’t say had, I have an on again/off again drinking problem to this day. I go through cycles where I’ll start drinking at 9 AM and keep going until bed, or I’ll be able to be a functioning human and go to a bar with people and have a beer or two without going overboard. The problem is when I do go overboard I go entirely too far. I don’t drink for fun, I drink to get drunk. I won’t try to pace myself or take it easy. I’ll drink the whiskey straight from the bottle until my face feels a little numb then take one more sip for good measure. 

That’s when the fun starts for everyone around me. Who’s it going to be this time? The fun drunk who buys everyone drinks and sings too loud and chats with every girl in the bar? The extremely depressed drunk who sits alone and puts on some music? The angry drunk who is going to start a fight with very little provocation? The truth is they’re all the same. 

The fun drunk has given up on having any future. He stopped saving money or making any plans more than a few months out. He doesn’t care what happens, just live in the moment so everyone will remember him as fun. He spends so much money on everyone around him because he is incapable of actually being happy so that smile for buying a drink or that hug for the small gift that made someone’s night actually feels good for a minute.

The depressed drunk can’t get out of his head. He just wants to drink until there isn’t any real thoughts left then go do something reckless. He doesn’t look when he walks into traffic. He’ll get in his car and drive around on empty roads with music playing. He’ll go walk off into the woods. He’ll walk out back and just get in the lake alone at 3 AM and start swimming until he’s tired then see if he can get back to shore.

The angry drunk just wants to feel some pain.. He’s the one that goes to break up a fight and ends up in the middle of it. He’s the one who will fight over a moral high ground, like someone driving up a breakdown lane to avoid traffic. He’ll usually let someone hit him once or twice then give them a chance to stop, knowing full well they never do.

No matter what happens all that I want is to be feel something for a little while that isn’t just that gut wrenching feeling of despair. That feeling like nothing is ever going to be enough to make life go even remotely right. Crippling debt, constant loneliness, and an inability to make myself do literally anything productive.

I have a good job. Hell, I’d venture to say I have a *great* job. I make really good money for a company that honestly cares about me. I work with some of the best people in the fucking world. The problem is decisions from years ago are still haunting me. I was married to an awesome person, but I wasn’t happy. At the time I thought it was because of the relationship, now as time goes on I’m realizing maybe it was just me all along. After we split up I agreed to keep giving her money for as long as it took to get our mutual debts paid off, but I didn’t even think about the fact that it could take five years to do this and I’m still giving her about 15% of my take home to pay for things like credit cards. I have student loan debt that I can’t see any possible way to actually ever pay off. Why someone thought it was a good idea to offer me $10k a semester to go to school at a time when I was making $9/hr is beyond me. Of course I’m going to say yes to that. My standard of living actually went to passable for a little while. Now they want me to pay them $700 a month, like that’s actually something that’ll happen. Then on top of that I spend every dime I have left on the people around. Literally anything to not have to be alone for a while. “Oh, you don’t have any money? That’s fine I don’t want to sit at home alone with my thoughts tonight so I’ll pay just to have someone else there with me.”

I can feel like I’m all alone in the middle of five of my best friends. I don’t understand why, but everyone can be sitting there laughing and having a good time and I’ll get lost in my own head wondering what it’s like to be that happy all the time? What is it like to sit with someone and not think about what it’ll be like when you leave them behind? Why can’t I be happy in my relationship with a girl who is madly in love with me? I sit and make jokes about being depressed and wanting to die, but do you think they know I keep a bullet on my desk with the other important things I have?  I make myself stare at that damn bullet and a bottle of whiskey the entire time I’m at home just to remind myself of the two things that I can’t give in to. Right next to those is a picture of my best friend and me. She will never know how many times she's saved me when I give in to the whiskey and start to look at the bullet. Sometimes I think I’m doing well, and I’ll put them away. The whiskey sat in a cabinet for a couple months before today. They always come back out though.

I can not find the motivation to do anything anymore. There is no real way to describe the feeling of sitting there screaming inside of your head ""GET THE FUCK UP AND DO SOMETHING, ANYTHING."" and not being able to actually make yourself do it. I used to be the guy who had a spotless house with a neatly made bed every morning. Now my sheet hangs half off my bed and my room looks like an actual natural disaster hit. I can’t motivate myself enough to cook anymore so now I just eat frozen meals or go out every day. The shitty part about it is I am an amazing cook, I used to love getting in the kitchen and cooking a meal with some music on. Now I eat cold pizza because I don’t even want to microwave it because of the amount of effort it takes. God I used to love going to the gym. I would go six times a week with my brother and it would be a competition from end to end. Then I started going four times a week. Then two. Then I’ll just go for a run today. Then maybe I will do a couple push ups. Now, I can’t bring myself to do it. I have got myself dressed to go for a run so many times over the last few months and never left the house or made it a half mile and just turned around.

By now you are probably thinking “So this guy is basically just bad with money, lazy and gets drunk, suck it up. Start cooking and try to not be sad anymore. You have friends that love you. You have a girlfriend that absolutely adores you. You have family. You have a good job. What the fuck is wrong with you, man?”. The simple answer is, I don’t know. I hope I figure it out soon though because I feel like I hear a clock ticking in my head lately, and it feels like it’s counting down."
"I’m ugly, stupid and clueless",Title says it all
"For the past few months, any amount of stress makes me go off the deep end",To the point where i frequently take days off work and spend hours just totally lost in my head. The mounting pressure makes me feel backed into a corner. It didn't used to be like this. I used to feel competent and inspired. Now Everything I do is because it's necessary or escapism and I just feel so lost.
What is wrong with me..,"I can't stop being over emotional. I have terrible mood swings and the slightest disagreement can set off a time bomb in my head. I can get so mad to the point where I cry for hours. I get so sad that I relapse because it feels so good. I hate looking in the mirror when I shower. I always keep the water hot and wait for the mirror to get foggy before I undress. The only time I've ever seen myself in the mirror is when I relapse. Seeing all the red cuts... The dripping blood... My irritated skin.. 

I always think there is something wrong with me but if I tell my parents to go to the doctor for some check up or exam that they will say no. That I am over exaggerating. I am 19, a kid. But I have been like this for years.

I am tired of getting so mad to the point of tears. I have done everything I can try to not be mad. To vent. I try to draw but I can't.. I try to write but I can't.. I listen to music but my head is so loud I can't hear it. I want to punch the wall but I can't because they would hear it. I try not to cut but I end up doing it. I sit in the bathroom. Cry. And cut. Or scratch.. Anything to feel pain rather than emotion. 

I don't know what is wrong with me. This isn't a cry for attention. This is a cry for help. A heated cry for help. I get so mad over the smallest thing. I shut down and don't talk to any one for hours. I have started to not eat again.. For the last few months I've only eaten once or twice a day. And not a full meal. Always a snack. I always want to say I'm anorexic but I always have this thought in my head. ""You're doing it for the attention"" But I'm not. I swear I'm not... I don't want the attention.. I just want the help... I can't go to a therapist... I know they are there to help but all I did to my last one was lie... I lied... Faked a smile.. Faked my reports... Faked the homeworks.. Faked it all. I just wanted to be alone.. I want to be alone.. But I am afraid of isolation... I just... I want to sleep.. 

I want to just sleep the rest of my life away.. I always see ways to die.. But I'm not suicidal because I can't do it.. I look at something and imagine a way to die. But I can't bring myself to do it. I guess I'm scared of the consequences.. I don't know. 

Please. someone just help me.. I don't want to be alone.. I don't want to hurt.. 

What is wrong with me.. 
This is killing me. 
I'm going insane. 
But I don't want to die. I can't bring myself to do it I'm not suicidal but I just. Want to rot.. 
Please.. I just need a hand to hold.. 
I need a friend.. All of mine forgot about me.. They are all younger than me... Still in school... I am all alone. I don't want to be alone.. "
Falling apart at night,The title basically says it all. During the day I act like everything is fine. I socialize with the few people who are in my life.  However when it’s deep into the night/early morning I can always be found quietly crying in bed. I’m in such deep emotional pain. I have no one to turn to. My loneliness and depression are killing me. I’m thinking about suicide. I just can’t bring myself to reach out for help because I don’t wanna be a burden.
Special,"Special    

I miss that physical connection with someone    

I miss cuddling   
Being hugged    

Being able to breathe someone's scent in   
Getting wrapped up in it and feeling at home   

Cuddling up to their chest, tucked under their chin with their chest hair tickling my nose   

Having loving sex and being able to enjoy the glow after    
Feeling that connection that I've never had with anyone else    

Hearing their deep breaths next to me as they slept    

Knowing someone cared for me as much as I cared for them    

I just want to feel special again    
And to make someone else feel that too    

I miss doing things for my partner to see them smile    
Making their favourite meal and watching them enjoy it    

I just miss being close to someone in that way   

I miss having a special someone    
And being that special someone   

I just want to be special again to you    
"
I feel alone in this pregnancy.,"You acted like you wanted to start a family with me and then as soon as I get pregnant you have second doubts. You completely stressed me out and made me doubt what I thought was a rock solid relationship. I know you started talking to other people and you stopped touching me...It felt like you stopped caring at all once it was too late for me to turn back.

I have two of our children in my stomach and it's a hard pregnancy, my very first. You robbed me of the special moments we had planned together and you couldn't even handle going to my ultrasound appointment due to the waiting times. Are you a child yourself? You can not wait an hour with me without a phone to play with (there was no cell service)? Now I go to my appointments alone and every fucking time they ask, ""Are you here by yourself...?"" I lie and say you're working because I'm ashamed of your behavior. I'm high risk and need appointments every 2 weeks and soon I'm going to be making doctor trips weekly. I do everything alone.

I do absolutely everything alone. You don't clean. You haven't cooked a single meal for me, yet you won't eat the healthy food I have to eat so I end up cooking two separate dishes for us both when I'm dog ass tired. I can't lift heavy laundry baskets or trash but you drag ass and wait more than a week to do either simple task. It was a chore enough to get you to stop smoking around me and even now you've just switched to vaping and still vape around me...all well knowing I will have premature babies already. I fucking hate how selfish you are. You accuse me of not letting you have hobbies but literally all you do is play the same game for hours and hours every day. You wake up, boot the game up and play it until bed time...What hobbies? I wish you had actual hobbies or that I could use my fucking computer anymore but you commander it. Maybe I would enjoy playing a game or even some company, but I've asked you for about 2 months now to watch a movie with me and you can't even do that. Why is it now that I am pregnant you all of the sudden check out?

I can't even get emotional support from you. Every time I say I'm sick you say ""Yeah, me too."" and brush me off. Every time I bring up a concern about all of the terrifying things that could go wrong you just say, ""Stop."" and get angry with me. Just once could you say that you understood or hold me instead of being a mean fucking asshole? 

I got so fed up with you I started considering adoption and that actually got a response from you. I'm sure our neighbors heard you screaming me at 3 doors down about how you just don't give a shit anymore. I don't know how I'm going to take care of THREE children because you are not the adult you pretend to be. I don't want to listen to you whine as a passive passenger in all of this about how hard it is for you when you won't even help me with actual physical symptoms. You can't even bring me a water bottle so why should I expect any help from you when these children are born? I  wonder how long you'll stay at the hospital while I'm hospitalized because I know you'll be sooo booored, you fucking baby. 

Also thanks for spending our spare cash on games because I can't afford to buy the weight gain shakes my doctor is requesting that I drink. I wonder if all the stress you put me through on a daily basis is the reason I can't keep a pound on. We also have car seats and a stroller to buy, a 300$ purchase, but sure, play your fucking game and let me suffer in the corner and mourn the loss of the decent person you used to be. Have fun talking to whoever you're talking too I won't snoop on  your disgusting conversations anymore you cheating prick."
When am I going to feel okay again?,"I've been trying to get over this man. I've cut all physical ties with him. I've blocked him everywhere. I even changed my daily schedule so I'm always preoccupied.

&#x200B;

But some days are just so, so hard. Today I felt really down. I don't understand why I can't just have him, why we're not meant to be. Some days I can't stop thinking about him, and it's so hard for me to let go. I just need one more chance, one more for closure. 

&#x200B;

When am I going to feel right again? What else do I have to do? How do I let go?

Cried on a first date,"My ex was abusive and I’ve had bad experience with guys ever since then. All the dates I’ve been on so far have been awful. I went on a date with a mutual friend that I’ve never actually met before. This guy  treated me like I’ve never been treated before. He was beyond nice, and was so considerate of me the whole date. Embarrassingly enough, I started to cry in his car because of how happy I was :( He just held me and told me it was alright. I don’t think he wants to see me again because he just got out of a relationship and isn’t ready to jump into one, but I’m perfectly fine with that. Now I know how I deserve to be treated :) I’m thankful for that. "
How do you work with a lack of empathy?,"I'm sure I have some empathy, but I haven't had the opportunity to exercise that recently. My ex wasn't the best to me which showed me how cold I can be, her crying didn't affect me at all after how much she drained me. Haven't really felt much for negative things happening to people since, more of a ""that sucks"" sort of thing. I just recently have really disliked putting myself out there to help people at all. Maybe it stemmed from being that guy who always wanted to be there 100% of the time for anyone he cared about and having it never reciprocated, I'm not sure but I don't like not caring and honestly for a long time I felt my lack of genuine emotions, lack of wanting to see, speak, meet people or do anything in general, I thought all that was normal behavior because I'm not sad or anything, I just feel very neutral all the time, and I laugh a lot, but turns out maybe it's something more that I should learn about? "
I wish it was socially acceptable to wear a mask.,I feel I'm crystal clear. People can tell exactly how I'm feeling. I'm very facially expressive so I'll grin when things will go my way. I'll roll my eyes out when things start to get lame. I'll squint my eyes at disbelief or make a very bored face when I just want to go away. I don't smile a lot so it won't be a big loss to the world. And as I get older it gets harder and harder for me to either hide or care to hide what I'm feeling. And I'll come out as a total prick. And maybe I am but I know that I hate conflict and I don't like making others feel animosity towards me. I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but damn it if it isn't hard to bottle up every cringe or every time I almost start to cry when hearing my lovely music.
My stepdad's ex-wife and my step-mom's ex-husband are engaged...,So I just found out that my stepdad's ex-wife and my stepmom's ex-husband are engaged. That means both sets of my step siblings are now going to be step siblings to each other. This is weird. Also my stepmom's ex-husband is really hot. Goodbye.
Man screamed at my pastor in the middle of church today- it was terrifying.,"I go to a non-denominational Christian church in Michigan. Today, my pastor was making a lighthearted comment on the music (hymns) in Catholic Church, because our church is well known for our musical talent- it’s like every Sunday is a concert. My pastor knows his shortcomings, today’s talk was actually about personal limitations and he was discussing how God is the reason our church is what it is, not because of himself. This is to say that he is a humble and kindhearted man, he meant no harm by his comment. This is a large church, picture a theatre, and I was sitting middle section in the center. A man, late twenties, stood up and screamed “THAT IS BLASPHEMY! I’m going back to the Catholic Church and so should all of you!” I was terrified. My pastor told us all to pray for him, and he kept screaming as he left. I couldn’t focus the rest of the service. My pastor just tries to make his talks accessible and keep people engaged, so he was just commenting on the slowness of the catholic hymn because everyone can understand it- but this man did not take it lightheartedly. I’m not saying that man isn’t entitled to that opinion- but his anger made me sob in church in reaction.
In today’s climate, especially after this past week in New Zealand, hearing someone scream at my pastor and express such extreme anger just because we believed something different, just because we were not practicing the Old Testament and Catholicism made me fearful. What if he comes back next Sunday with a gun? Today I cried because I felt like I just escaped a possible attack. And I was sitting right behind him, in this huge auditorium. Perhaps I’m being oversensitive, but I don’t think I am. I am being sadly and horrifyingly realistic. I am so scared. I’m having a hard time sleeping or thinking of going back to church. People all over this country and around the world are fearful of going to their place of worship because people are becoming so comfortable with hate and ignorance. 
I don’t know what to do. I hate sitting in this anger and I want to do something. But I’m scared to use my voice too loudly and become a target. This is no way to live. "
I am a Bad Person Because I Love You,"I love you, but I am not gonna to say anything. I just wanna be your best friend, but I have these strong feelings for you. 

You broke up with your girlfriend 36 hours ago and I feel both sad and elated. It makes me feel bad because it gives me a chance to be closer ti you. 

I really don't want these feelings, but it's creeping on me. I want to support you in your time of need and I don't want you to cry anymore. 

I don't want to love you anymore because it would never work out in the long run. But I can't wonder the ""what ifs"". 

I just feel conflicted with myself and I want to do the right thing. I don't want to lose him."
My best friend told two different people a secret of mine and I don't know how to trust her again,"A couple of months ago, my best friend of ten years told two different people something that I really didn't want getting out. The first time it happened, I confronted her and told her that I didn't appreciate it and that it wasn't her secret to tell. She promised me that she wouldn't do it again, but just a couple of weeks ago, she did it again. Both of the people that she told were the worst possible people she could tell in relation to what the secret was. I don't know how I'm ever going to be able to trust her again, although I want to. The current situation aside, she's the best friend I could ever have and I want things to go back to the way they were. I want to trust her with my secrets again. I've forgiven her for what she did, but I can't seem to trust her again."
Shut the hell up about dead Christians.,"Obviously, nobody but sociopaths are actually happy about the numerous amounts of Christians being killed for their religion. However, if you want to mourn them, find your own article or comment section that is actually relevant. Don't spam articles about the Christchurch shooting with it. Not only is it irrelevant, but how would those victims feel knowing that you don't give a shit about their deaths except to use them to further your anti-Muslim agenda?"

So, much to do, to worry about and work on as I dive into my mid-20s! This decade is going to get even more difficult. Do any of you guys have similar concerns as above?"
I had a panic attack.,"The last time I had a panic attack this badly, I was a freshman in high school, newly 14 and having a complete dissociative episode while watching Hunchback of Norte Dame with my parents after getting released from the psych ward after a suicide attempt. I remember crawling across the carpet, screaming that I was going to die, feeling like everything was falling apart while my mom hauled me outside so I could get air and breathe. And she held me for so long, cradling me like I was brand new while I cried and shook and heaved. And my dad called my aunt, who’s a doctor, and she talked them through it, and we didn’t ever talk about it.

I still get anxiety attacks. I had one last week on the subway. I had one a year ago when I found out about my biological dad’s affairs.

Tonight, I had a panic attack. The world has felt fake and impossible- probably because I’ve been awake since 3am. But I had a panic attack. I couldn’t breathe, I just wanted to go to the ER and get sedated, but I’m scared of sedation. So, I stayed home. And I sat with my mom on her bed and the world felt like it was unreal. I cried so much. I’m still crying. I still feel unsteady and scared. But I am okay. I am going to get a snack, and then I’m coming back home. 

I’m okay. "
i’m incredibly depressed and i’m afraid it’s not getting better.,"like everyone, i have good and bad days. but i don’t think my depression is getting any better. i’m lonely all the time, have a deep hatred for myself, and i feel like it’s hurting my relationship. i don’t know what else to do other than fight the bad thoughts but it’s still not working. i hope i can eventually find a way out of this dark rut i’ve been in for years "
Why do I have to be in a relationship?,"I've never wanted to be in a romantic relationship with anyone when I was younger and I still don't. I've always seen them as restricting, not because I'm some free soul with commitment issues that only seeks pleasure, but because I simply love to experience the world in my own way. I love sitting and experiencing the world internally, not having to share my thoughts all the time with another person. I love experiencing things that you can only have when you're single, such as travelling (I know you can travel w/ a SO, but, cmon), going out, eating out alone, walking alone, meeting completely new people alone, etc. **I thrive in solitude.** I want these experiences forever. I want to keep moving and not stay in one place. Sure, a family would be nice and all but I've never been one to stay in one place without getting bored. In fact, I think I'd unintentionally ruin my family due to my personality. I've also never had such strong emotions to feel committed to one person.

**Just because I thrive in solitude, that doesn't mean I'm a lonely guy**. I'm actually a great conversationalist. There's a social dynamic that exists b/w 2+ people: whenever you're with someone long enough, you begin to emulate their behaviour. I've always been told I have a strong personality. I love to make quick-witted jokes, I have sharp humour and I give good advice (or so I'm told). If I'm in a relationship, I feel like I have to lower myself. Maybe I haven't found someone who can accept me for who I am yet. And I don't care if I will."
Your negativity is toxic,"It has taken me a long time to realize and understand that not everyone around you has manners and good intentions. Of course, I expect some common decency but my damn, these people are toxic. I work in a stressful environment and keeping the conversations light with humor make the nights go by much faster. What I don’t appreciate are the negative comments about other staff and the nasty gossip. We’re not kids learning how to act, we are grown ass adults who should have learned that if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all. You are literally talking crap about your colleagues who you just conversed with a few minutes ago to other employees. You walking ten feet away from the person doesn’t give you the right to talk poorly about them. You have no right to talk poorly about anyone. If you don’t like them, let it be. You will not like everyone you encounter. In case you weren’t taught this simply golden little rule, let me teach you what you clearly were not taught and that if you have nothing nice to say, don’t say it at all! You are a toxic person. Keep your nasty comments to yourself and walk away since clearly think you run the show. "
I do not know what to do anymore,"I will tell you my story. And maybe you can help me somehow.   
I lived with a family, which wasn't my own, since I can remember. They always told me that I'm not related to them and that I better be usefull. So I cared for the elder people, the home. They refused to let me go outside and won't let me go to school. The elder woman "" grandmother"" teached me how to read. She was a nice person. But she passed away a few month ago. My english is bad. As is my German. I never talked much, but as they started to treat me worse I stopped speaking at all.   
They started to hit me, let the oldest boy tattoo me. In the end they were allowed to have me anyway they wanted.   
A few weeks ago I run away.   
I took the two cats of the family ( I loved that animals a lot and they give me hope and at leat a bit of love) and run.   
I got shelter in a basement. But I can not do anything. No one will hire me. The police in Germany won't help me. The German NGOs won't help me. No one will.   
I have no passport, no birth certificate, no education and no hope. I'm afraid of dying but it seems I have no other way.   
I don't know my family, my birthday... nothing. And I'm treated from the person who are supposed to help me like it's my own fault. I never asked beein travicked and raped and hit.

Do any of you got any advice? "
I was supposed to be aborted,"I think about this often. My mother was very unstable, had my older sister when she was 16 then got pregnant with my older brother less than a year later while cheating on my sister’s father. She aborted him. Another year passes and she become pregnant with me (my father is my sister’s father’s best friend, yikes) after cheating once again. She immediately was going to be an abortion but my dad wouldn’t give her money for it because he didnt have any. She had also just recently moved to Texas where it wasn’t the easiest place to find abortion clinics. 


4 months into the pregnancy she went to the doctor where he suggested I be aborted because I was extremely likely to have a mental deficiency probably due to her drug and alcohol use. She wanted to but my grandmother talked her out of it. My grandmother said she would raise me. I was born with no mental disabilities. I was on oxygen and had to be breathing treatments a lot when I was younger due to my mother’s smoking while I was in the womb, though. 


21 years later here I am. I just graduated from college with a bachelor of science. My grandmother and grandfather raised me and supported me throughout my entire life. A month ago my grandmother passed after a long battle with cancer. I miss her so but I’m so grateful for everything she has done for me. My mother went on to have 2 more children and abandon them. Last I heard she had a new boyfriend and was living on the streets. I have never heard from my father, I’ve been told that it’s because he never wanted a daughter, he wanted a son. "
My best friend’s mom just told me that my BFF was pregnant.,"First, my bff and I have been friends since college started and we recently just graduated. 

Second, a year ago, my bff broke up with this man whom she had dated for 2.5 years. So all of last year, I was there for her giving her advice, letting her cry on my shoulder, and just being there for her. Then in January, she gets back together with the man that she’d broken up with. 

I personally was upset when they got back together because I think she could do so much better but anyway, then today, her mother calls me to tell me that my bff is pregnant and she’s afraid to tell me. 

Honestly, I’m just so disappointed. I believe that she was way better off without him (whether she believed that or not) and now she’s stuck with him forever. She definitely won’t get an abortion, and i personally am not an advocate for people having kids before like 27 (30 if I’m being honest). 

I feel like the last year was a complete waste of my time and effort. I am disappointed and angry at her and yet I know I am “supposed” to be happy. 

Her mom told me she is happy, so I’m going to wait until she tells me, but for the past day I’ve just been in shock. I’m afraid of my reaction when she finally tells me. She knows I was against her getting back together with him and she knows I’m definitely against having kids at such a young age.

I love her because she’s my best friend, but I just don’t know what to do. "

I'm super self-conscious about how young I look,"I am an 18 yr old girl and I hate how young I look. I normally get called 11-13 and it's terrible. Every time I try to talk to someone about it they say  I shouldn't complain about it because it'll be good for me one day. It's more than just getting kids menus.

People treat me like a child, it doesn't matter what I'm wearing if I'm carrying my car keys or literally anything. I feel I don't really know how to interact with adults because no one has ever treated me like one literally ever. I'm definitely less mature than my other friends in some ways and I feel like this is the reason. 

It's mainly because of my height, I'm 5'2, which really isn't too bad, however my parents can be awfully strict on what type of clothes I wear (I can't wait to move out next year I'm going to wear whatever I want) so that also makes me look younger. But I don't look younger in like a cute sense if that makes sense I just look like an actual child. like no guy my age will ever approach me.

It REALLY hurts my self esteem sometimes because I'll see my friends or even girls a few years younger than me who actually look like women, or just look their age. It makes me feel short and stubby. In all honesty I don't think I'm ugly but it's really getting tough when people keep saying I look like a child.  

I just want to look like everyone else. normal. "
"At the end of this year im turning off the lights, and saying goodbye.","Life is ... Painful. There's so much you'll want to do from the moment you're born till the moment you die that you won't be able to simply due to being born into the wrong family. Or the wrong place. Or wrong timeline. It's unfair, but we all choose to live by it.

I'm tired of living. I'm tired of struggling tired of pushing myself to improve. All I ever feel is failure on failure, with limited success here and there. I don't believe in myself enough to continue anymore. I've tried to push past the depression (it's still there). I've tried to push past the procrastination (it's still there). I've tried to push past the loneliness and yet, its still there. Everything does nothing. We live in the same loop till we die. Death is the only thing that's going to get me out.

I'll have to do my preparations, and to all those who have cared for me, I'll make sure to leave a note for each of you.

In due time my friends, well see each other again."
I've never been good at anything,"I'm not athletic, artistic, good looking, sociable, anything. 
I've always sucked at sports, I was always the slow kid,I couldn't jump or swim, I sucked at football, gymnastics, everything. I was always picked last for everything. I wasn't fat or the weird kid I was just average at best. I can't play an instrument or draw, paint, sing, dance. When I ever though I liked something I was too scared to progress, things like skateboarding or parkour. Now I am at university. I'm doing alright but I excel at nothing. I don't have any friends, just acquaintances. I've never been in a relationship longer than a month and I can't pull to save my life. My face is asymmetrical and unattractive. I'm pale and sweat when I only think about the sun. I feel like I need something I'm passionate about and good at but it's hard to be passionate about something when even getting up is a struggle. I've been to therapy for depression but after a first round of sessions I didn't go back because it seemed useless and I couldn't even open up to a therapist. I don't want to go through life so passive, day by day, alone with nothing to live for. "
"I’m failing school and, for the most part, hate life","A little context: I’m 18 and am nearly done my first year of Uni. I made the decision to stay at home and go to the local university instead of one of the others further away. This decision was mostly based on the friends that I had going there and because I was told living at home was much better than living in residence. 7 months on, I regret that choice immensely. I haven’t spoken to any of my “friends” that attend the same school (they all live on res) and haven’t made any new ones either. The close friends that I had throughout high school and the summer no longer want anything to do with me (Long story short I developed feelings for one of them and she rejected me and cut me off and so did the rest of the group). I’ve gone on a few “dates” with a few other girls but I realize I haven’t gotten over her which just makes me feel worst. Socially, I feel completely obsolete. The only thing I have in my life is my best friend who goes to the same school. He’s the only person I have and without him I don’t know where I’d be. He’s in the same boat as me though, and other than him, I feel like I’m just a chapter in my past friends life and am nothing more than a memory. The only social interaction I get is through him and through my co-workers (who are all elderly woman). Academically, I’m failing school big time. I have little motivation to do well in something I can’t stand. The only thing that interests me is film and screenwriting, in which I’ve won contests in around the city with the same best friend. Often, I’ll completely ignore school work in favour of working on another script of mine. I’ve contemplated film school, but it’s around 10,000 USD a semester, and I don’t have that money and neither do my divorced parents. My parents are also fairly constricting, they’re very old fashion in that they believe life is defined by the degree you earn and the job you get, with little regard for doing something you enjoy. They don’t allow me to leave the house without extensive permission, and are suspicious of my every movement, so much so that I’ve caught my dad following me when I told him I was going out to the gym. I’ve also contemplated moving to LA in hopes of pursuing screenwriting as a career, where I’d be perfectly ok with selling my car and working a shitty full time to earn a shitty living, but I know that’s not how the world works and coming from Canada that’s nearly impossible. I honestly just don’t know what to do anymore. I feel nothing in my life, just empty. I never thought I’d say this, and I’ve never communicated the thought before, but my thoughts regarding suicide have changed from it being awful to viewing it as an escape route. I feel so behind in everything. Everybody has met new people or begun new relationships while pursuing something they enjoy, and I feel like I’m actively rotting away in my parents basement. 

Tl;dr I hate school and have failed first year. I’ve met no new people while also losing everyone in my past. I can’t get over a girl from 8 months ago, who cut me off and in turn so did her friends (who were also my closest friends). Life at home feels extremely constricting, and the only thing I want to do but can’t is pursue a career in screenwriting/film. "
Paris Massacre and Orlando,Yup...the religion of peace carried those out too...just saying. 
I really miss having sex.,"(this is obviously going to get NSFW.) ""Yeah so do I lol"", yeah dude well like this is my offmychest post all right? Get your own! :p 

I'm in college, and I broke up with a girlfriend of almost 3 years in early January. Later that month, and somewhat impulsively, I started a casual relationship with someone else. Long story short I wasn't ready for such a casual and romantic fling so things were cut short with her (no hard feelings though I don't think). 

>!But holy shit we had such great sex. I thought I had good sex in my previous relationship, but this girl really, really, knew how to fuck. She'd put her hands, legs, and lips all over me when we were together, she was so tight, and her boobs were extraordinary; full, plump, with really nice nipples. She was thin, but had a really sexy stomach, beautiful skin, and a gorgeous neck... She was really beautiful too, with cute cheeks, a nice chin, and a very kissable nose. She also had a rare brain cyst which apparently caused her boobs to lactate. At first I thought it was gross, but then I really, really, started to like it... She would often come twice or more when we had sex, and she has such a strong and passionate energy that I felt lucky to be with her. She could also take charge way better than my ex. All together, she was really really fun to be with in bed, Ten/10 for sure, like I'm not sure how much better sex could be.!<

Besides the sex being just really nice, I really got a lot out of it. It's a great physical activity, it made me feel intimate and connected with someone else, it was fun to experiment with different techniques, and above all else, just letting yourself just be unabashedly truthful to someone else just felt amazing. If sex is good and consentual, there's no mixed signals. The one thing going through that other person's mind is ""wow I'm really enjoying this and don't want to stop doing this, and I'm happy they're doing this with me"". There's no need for self doubt, because sex in itself is just so honest and liberating. You're both just riding the waves of oxytocin rushing through your brains. 

I also loved how well rested I felt after. It's similar to how I feel when I run for a long time; after a good long jog it feels just fantastic to have your body just be broken and done. But with sex, you're sitting there, being broken and done in a pile of clothes and blankets with another person, again, just really vulnerable and happy.

There's also the stages to sex, just knowing that you're going to have sex later (or at least have a high chance of sharing physical intimacy with someone else), seeing them, hinting at it through the night, the foreplay, the act, and then the comedown and relaxed state after. It's like an infinitely redeadable novel. 

My problem now is that I'm at a weird point in my life. I'm moving out of my college area in about 6 months, and I don't really want to start a relationship here. I really should take the time to be single and stuff, but ugh I miss sex. And I don't want to be the ""hey baby you dtf tn"" guy on Tinder/Bumble, but I also don't want to imply that I want to be in a relationship, but I'm also not sure that I'm ready for the happy marriage between the two, because that's what I had with this girl, and I clearly wasn't ready emotionally. 

I'm also just not sure that getting into a serious relationship now makes any sense until I'm at least 25-26. I have some plans to leave the US, possibly forever, and I don't want to leave someone behind. 

I guess for now I'm probably best off being single. It just sucks and I hate it! I really miss sex, and obviously having a really close romantic partner to share stuff with. But, I'll be moving to the city, and I suppose in 6 months or so I'll be ready again. I still haven't learned what it means to be single again, I'm so used to the pattern of a relationship that I need to reflect and be more independent. 

Sex is great, love is great, but it's hard (pun intended). Thanks for reading. "
I feel like romantic relationships simply aren't worth it,"As someone who watched their parents' marriage implode, I don't feel all too good about relationships. My parents went from being a happily married, young couple to an old, unhappily married couple sleeping in separate bedrooms, fighting and resenting the living shit out of one another. They stopped giving a damn - about themselves, their relationship and their happiness. I wish they'd got a divorce years ago. They merely exist in the same house, never talking to one another, never saying ""I love you"" or being intimate, nothing. 

&#x200B;

I'm 25. I've dated and had my heart ripped out twice - this was enough to last a lifetime. It's simply too much effort and exhaustion for nothing. I feel completely jaded and downtrodden. I never want to date again, really, because I feel it simply isn't worth it any more. Am I being completely unreasonable here or is this feeling coommon? "
"I love you, but our goodbye is coming","I've been holding it in for so long, and I'm afraid I cant hold it in any longer. It's been building up over time, though I've been mad for you since the day you walked up and said hi. I thought that when I had to leave for a while, the interest would fade. But why did I fall for you even more? 

Now that I'm back and we finally have time together again, you greet me with the news you're leaving. Now we only have 3 months. You said you cared for me, that I'm important to you, that you really like me. But it's goodbye when the time comes. You said we'll still talk but whatever we are will end. The future is uncertain, long-distance is hard, and you don't think you're up for monogamy. I understand, I really do. I don't hold it against you. You're flying off to greater things and I'm happy for you. So I thought it'd be good to just enjoy every moment I can have with you now. I thought I was strong enough for this. But I swear my love grows for you even more each day, and it already hurts to know you'll be out of my life in 3 months. 

I want to tell you because you deserve to know. Your love for freedom, your curiosity of the world around you, how you may be bitter but the way you talk about life and society makes it clear you have such care for the world, how you've always made sure people are heard and understood (even if you don't agree with them), the way you run bravely towards your passions, the way your face lights up when you talk about the rocks, the little crinkles around your eyes when you smile, the awkward way you rub your arms when you're feeling off, when your face scrunches up when you go off tangent and rant about some problem you were thinking about earlier - all of these make you such a bright shining soul in a world I thought was otherwise grey and dull. You make me want to be a better person and be brave enough to do things that I had endless anxieties about. 

Maybe I just want you to know that I'll always be supporting you even if we're continents apart. We may not have a future but I am certain of this - that right now, I love you. I love you. I love you. I LOVE YOU. 

Even if you don't feel the same.

My husbands heavy past [NAW],I’m so over dealing with my husbands baby mama and mother. I thought that after 6 years things would be better but it seems that the choke hold is still there. I knew going into this relationship that the baby mama was gonna be different and sometimes challenging but god damn it’s unbearable sometimes. And do not even get me started on his mother. He and I both wish she could vanish but she’s still making problems. I just hate that IRL I really don’t have anyone to speak to about this that doesn’t roll their eyes and go “well that’s life. “ I need someone who will go “yea they’re being real assholes.” It’s so frustrating. 
Off my chest for the first time,"I'm never sharing any of my thoughts with anyone. I'm like a robot who's programmed only to tend to your needs. Saying what you want to hear, being what you want me to be and I'm sick of it. So I'm here trying to get something off my chest for the first time. This might not seem like a lot but for me it is something, a start."
"I hate goodbyes, but you know what I hate more than goodbyes? Not being able to say goodbye!!!","I know it sounds weird. 
I hate goodbyes because I can’t seem to let go of that person. I know that I won’t be able to see that person ever again. But at least I get to hug them, kiss them, tell them how much I love them, tell them I’m sorry that If I ever caused them pain, and get to set peace between us. But not getting to do that fucking sucks! One minute you love them and can’t wait to see them again. Then you get that call that rips your heart in half. They are so right you will NEVER understand how much you love someone till you lose them!"
I get terrified when 24 year old people are called adults,"I am 24, have already graduated Uni, study for second major, work full-time, volunteer at an animal shelter but, because I live in my parents house, am not in a relationship, don't have kids and can't cook (all times I tried were a huge failure), I can't see myself as an adult. I graduated high school 8 years ago and it feels like yesterday. I love Pitch Perfect and High School Musical etc.

I know I am an adult but it scares me. "
I’m short,"I’m a short man, if I’m being true to myself I’m 5’3, but no one has ever really seen me shorter than 5’5/5’6 because of shoe choice. 

I’m fairly good looking others have said, not skinny but am fairly well built with some nice muscle. My metabolisms very slow but I strictly control what I eat so it doesn’t show too bad. I’m intelligent and a really good person I’d like to say. Im popular and easy to get along with but I’m short. If it wasn’t for being short I think I’d be as perfect as is reasonable.

I think any short man will understand me on some level, but my height cripples my self esteem. I hate it so much. I hate myself because of it so much. It’s such an awful thing and I’d never wish it upon anyone.

Every moment of every day is filled with thoughts about my height. How I walk, how I come across, what people think of me, how I want people to think of me. It riddles my subconscious thinking. Always have to stand up straight, slightly raise my feet when someone is nearby, how to seem taller in photos.  It limits who kind of girls I can approach and puts a subconscious limiter on everything I do.

I love clothes and think I have a sick sense of style but I’m short. Nothing I want to wear would suit me and even if it did I’d look like a fool near other people who are taller. It’s debilitating. Even forgetting those, finding anything that would fit nicely is a huge nightmare. Flat shoes are also a myth. I’ll have to wear heeled boots for the rest of my life.

I have a girlfriend who’s my height. Beautiful woman, and I feel so badly for her. I know her friends must make fun of her because of me. I know she could be with someone much more physically impressive than me, and it pains me so much that I can’t do anything about it.

I want kids in the future so much. It’s one of my life goals and I think I’d be an amazing father and I could teach them so much. But I’m crippled with the fear of screwing them over for life. What if they can’t deal with it and repress it like I can? I’ve cursed them for life to deal with a horrible insecurity that I know full well about. 

I think about what it’d be like to be tall. To live my life without a chain vest dragging me down. To walk about with a reason to hate myself and be able to do nothing about it. 

If you’re tall, and by that I mean anything over 5’7, please please please appreciate it. You won’t understand what It’s like to have your every waking moment undermined and questioned and emasculated, and be able to do nothing about it.

I don’t know what I expect from this. There’s nothing anyone can tell me to make me feel better. My height will never change. This is just there for any other man who’s living just like me, never able to tell a soul. 

Ever upward

My cat was murdered,"For years we all thought he was hit by a car. My dad found him, wrapped him, and buried him. He didn't let anyone see him. And yesterday, he told me the truth. Mooch didn't have a head. It wasn't that his head was crushed, he had been decapitated. It was nowhere with his body, and to my knowledge, was never found. 

&#x200B;

Mooch was such a gorgeous and sweet cat. He loved everybody, never bit, hissed, scratched. Just wanted love and to give love. Even people who hated cats loved Mooch. He was a beautiful fluffy white with crystal blue eyes. It really devastated us when he died, all of us. I still miss him a lot. My dad didn't have the heart to tell my mom the truth, so she and my sister are still unaware. I wish he hadn't told me, but I also am sorry he had to see him and shoulder this by himself all these years. 

&#x200B;

Somebody did this to him. I don't know who, but someone out there murdered my cat. Cars don't cleanly take the head off and leave nothing behind. I'd never heard of any other animals going missing or being decapitated or rituals or anything. So why Mooch? What did Mooch ever do besides bring joy to everyone? Some sick fuck took him from us. He was fat and always had his collar on in case he was out, so I know that they knew he was a pet. I don't know who you are, but I hate you. How dare you strip away a family member's life (in such a horrific way no less) and just dump his body in a ditch like a piece of trash. Whoever and wherever you are, I hope for your suffering. I hope you choke, I hope you bleed, I hope you burn. And in your suffering, I hope the pain you caused haunts you until you are the one rotting in a ditch. I hope no one mourns your worthless existence and you die alone and forgotten."
I popped a Genital Wart and wiped it on a friend that thought it was just pimple pus,"I forgot she doesn't have warts, but she might now. Idk what to tell her."
I wish I knew about reddit growing up.,"More so when I was a teenager into my early twenties. 
I was a middle child between my golden child of a brother and my baby sister. My mother and I hated each other and I couldn’t trust my father after he had left us for a while. 
I had no loyal friends or friends that accepted me for who I was and what I enjoyed. All I had was Karen O and her music and even more when I found photography and writing.
All of my relationships from when I was 16 through 24 were incredibly toxic and I couldn’t see it since I was a serial people pleaser or have anyone to tell me otherwise and those past relationships still affect me today. It also didn’t help that I was an alcoholic for a few years as well. 
I know now that I am worthy of more than what other people have put me through. I’ve learned that honesty is above other traits and respect is far more above that. 
Respect for others, for life, for earth, for history and truth and for myself. 

There is a post that I can’t remember the title or the sub but it stated that they felt guilty in all that they did. I can relate! I will always abide by that voice in the back of my head that tells me to do better. Although I am still young and that I have so much more to learn, I wish I got here sooner. 

“The one thing that I know, is that I know nothing”

Thank you to Reddit. 
"
A cop confused my friend and I for lesbians last night...,"My friend Jess and I were changing in her car when a glaringly white flash light shone into my eyes. It was a cop. At first I asked him what was wrong, if he had a warrant to ask us to step out of the car. He told us to relax. Said “I used to be a teenager, I get it.”  

He ran both of our socials, but neither of us knew what he thought we were doing or what was happening. He came back and leaned in through my window. 

“I see you both come from small towns,” he said almost pitying us, “but you don’t have to be ashamed here now that you’re in college. You ladies are 18 so you’re adults now. If you want to do stuff then go get a hotel room and do it! Don’t let me catch you guys hooking up again!” 

Ok. So we were both relieved now that we understood why he was questioning us and told him it wouldn’t happen again but I still don’t know why he thought we were having lesbian sex? 

One of the weirdest moments of my life and I’m still confused. Also, he said that he “saw her head pop up from my lap and saw I wasn’t wearing any underwear”...but I was just changing and she was checking her phone... lol. 

Funny thing is, we’re both straight. Not that anything’s wrong with being gay... just a super weird misunderstanding and experience. "
I’m so out of shape.,"So because of various reasons I’m on an interruption to my uni studies and while I’ve been applying and looking for jobs nothing seems to be actually working out in that department.

As much as I enjoy sitting on my ass all day eating snacks, Diet Coke and playing video games and how it relaxes me. 

But I’m starting to reach a point of unhealthyness where I can get out of breath jogging up stairs and rearranging bedclothes, or doing my shoelaces and (tmi ahead) I am actually starting to struggle to reach round and wipe my ass. 

I used to be a national level trampolinist but now I’m all but retired from that the only real regular exercise I get is a short 10-15 minute walk with my dog each day. 

I find myself making meals so much larger in portions than I need and I guess because of my current situations and anxiety’s/ probably depression I can imagine I comfort eat a lot too.

For example the other day I made some noodles with carbonara sauce, peas and bacon for dinner but then somewhat on hunger autopilot I also heated up TWO microwave pizzas and got a corner yogurt from the fridge. This can happen a lot where I make one meal to eat and then just add to it...

I try to eat healthily but tbh a lot of healthy food tastes like crap and I like things that taste nice and nobody can blame me for that.  I have a couple cans of coke left and then I’m going cold turkey just drinking water but I don’t know what I’ll do about food. 

to top it all off my brother is taller and eats as much as me but is basically a skeleton."
I don't want to stop using.,"I'm in my late twenties and I use methamphetamine recreationally. Immediately I feel most people read that last line and scoffed, thinking that it's impossible to not be the ""Not Even Once"" poster stereotype junkie. I'm not a bad person. I go to work, pay my bills, have a healthy relationship with my family, and most things people say you need to have to be ""normal"". I have never been stolen, burglarized, or robbed to support my habit. If I can't afford it, it doesn't get bought. I'm okay with not having it. I'm not using to cover up or numb anything, I simply enjoy the effects produced. Besides the drugs themselves, I don't do anything illegal or immoral. I'm just a person...a person who happens to use an illegal substance. "
He had a dream about me without even knowing me,"This guy I sort of had a crush on (not enough to actively pursue it first) recently hit me up and told me about this dream he had when we first met. He called me a vixen and told me he couldn't get me out of his head since then (3 years ago?). But, he's so bad at getting back to me and I don't go out of my way to text him because that's how I play. I don't even know if he likes me. We've had an on and off thing for the past year. We get along really well, but since we don't talk consistently, I feel like I barely know him. But, I feel like it isn't just some small thing that he would have a dream about me years ago and hold onto it for so long. I dont know, this has been torturing me. "
I realized I've never confronted the feeling of his impending death,"My dad was diagnosed with Parkinson's in late 2013. I moved back home across the country about a year later. Not out of nobility, but because of necessity. I was so mentally unstable that I couldn't manage life anymore. I've watched my father decay day in and day out and I feel like he's watched me do the same. 


I was medically disqualified from service in the national guard and ended up admitting myself into the hospital three separate times since 2014. I've barely held down jobs in retail since moving home. I can barely keep my head above water. My dad has done nothing but watch me fail since I've come back. Car repossessions, phone shut off, several mental breaks, shutting myself down, etc. The only positive that I've given to him is that he hasn't had to bury his youngest son. 


I've been so focused on myself that I've ignored that fact that he's literally dying day by day. I'm not sure if that's because I don't want to confront it or that it just hasn't fully clicked. 


At 30 years old, I listen to the sound of my father shuffling to the bathroom in his slippers and the embarrassment in his voice as he cries because he's lost almost all control of his entire life. 


We moved into a smaller home a few years back to make it easier for him to get around. When we showed up to the new house, the first words out of his mouth were, ""This is the place. This is where I'll finally die."" 


How do you prepare yourself to hear those words? Every day I hear him tell me how he refuses to take the medicine he's prescribed because he'd rather be naturally miserable than to have some pill start to destroy him while it makes him pretend he's getting better. 


I've begun to wonder now if the two minute small talk sessions I have with him before I trudge off to work at the lock grocery store chain will be the last correspondence I have with him. "
I want to be somebody else,"I cannot stand being myself. I truly feel that I am a boring person, I have a plain personality and I am average at everything I do. In fact, I am so dull, I’ve had to introduce myself to the same person on multiple occasions because people tend to forget me. I’m not saying any of this to get people to tell me otherwise. This just happens to be how I see myself. If I were to meet someone like me, I would think “holy hell, she is the human embodiment of the word ‘bleh’”. Don’t even get me started on my physical traits.

I have never talked to anyone about this partly because I don’t want the pity and partly because I don’t want to hear the whole “oh I’m sure this is all in your head”. I just genuinely think I am nothing special. I wish I could change everything about me. I wish I could just be someone other people find interesting. I wish I could look in the mirror and be happy with what’s looking back at me. 
"
I feel like I don't have anyone left to talk to,"This is gonna be a long one for me so I'll put a TL:DR on the bottom for the main reason I'm writing this, which is honestly also summarized through the title.

A little backstory, I started working in the oil field in North Dakota a week after I turned 20. Pulling 100+ hours every two weeks is normal to me now, and I've been in the rhythm of not doing much besides working and sleeping for over 5 years. 

For this time I've lived with by brother and my parents, my brother covers our rent and I try to pick up the other bills around the house so our parents can focus on building retirement. However, I'm not very emotionally close with my family and we dont really open up to each other at all. I've tried in the past: my Dad usually just shutting in and never saying anything because he doesn't know how to respond, my brother has made it clear he will always refuse to listen when conversations get too personal, and my mom has enough trouble keeping her own emotions in check and suffers pretty bad breakdowns as it is.

The worst part for me is I'm a very introverted, reclusive person. It's difficult for me to go any farther than small talk with most people, and I get stressed easily when I go to public events or when someone invites me somewhere. I wish I wasn't like this and it was easier for me to open up to new people, but a lot of times I feel like my mind runs into a brick wall in these situations. I'm sure a good bit of it stems from my complete absence of self-confidence and self self-loathing I've built up for myself over the course of my life. I've always tried being better about it by dieting and exercising to improve my image of myself, learning better social habits, and things of that nature but it never really seems to help.

My emotions are also really hard for me to communicate on the best of days. I've had relationships fall apart specifically because I didnt know how to open up and just say how I felt. I honestly just feel broken because no matter how many times I try I just can't because of that brick wall.

There is one person, until recently, I would turn to for emotional support. My best friend who I'll call Jack. 

I knew Jack since middle school, and we were always friends since 8th grade and actually became best friends during high school after we both joined the theater club together. We were always really close, played games and did a bunch of stupid stuff together like try to start a YouTube channel. We still talk and play almost everyday even though half of America is between us. He's a brother to me and I love Jack as such but I've always had issues opening up to him.

The majority of these issues are because of my own personal failings, and its only exacerbated by his personality. I love the guy but he's a borderline narcissist. Everytime I've tried opening up to him, especially things about us that have bothered me, he'll either immediately spin it into a story about himself where I have to listen to him vent for half an hour or more about his life issues, or try to make me into a villain for trying to ask him to stop doing or saying something that was bothering me. One of his favorite quotes is ""thanks for making me feel like an asshole.""

The reason I bring all that up is that there was something he did several months ago that still really bothers me from time to time, and I have to get it out there somewhere out of fear that it'll just keep eating me up inside. 

So about a year ago I was in a super rough period of my life. I was finally able to escape a nightmare of a job that had me working nights for over a year straight. I was constantly stressed doing the work that four people do during the day, driving around checking sites and making sure crude oil pumps were running, natural gas was flowing, and produced water filters were clean. I had about 100 sites I was responsible for keeping running through the night that spanded a field that took me about an hour to get from one side to the other. That job, along with not having anyone besides my immediate family and one best friend and having little to no life outside of my job, broke me down. It had a horrible affect on me mentally, physically, and emotionally. 

I was stuck in this dark, damp hole for so long even after I got away from that night shift. I lost all my energy to do almost anything besides lay in my bed all day. The only thing I could bring myself to do most days is gorge myself on all the shit food I bought. I felt so lonely, so drained, so worthless for such a long time. My trips to and from work consisted of me just trying to hold back tears because I wanted to so badly just to die just so it would be over. I went to bed every night hoping I just wouldn't wake up the next day, and I started every morning being disappointed.  One of the few things that kept me going was the struggle for my dream life.

One thing Jack and I always talked about was that one day we would move somewhere we could both find work and actually hang out on person again. Somewhere we could play D&D together, create content just for fun off of whatever we wanted, find good women to settle down with and enjoy life again. The idea that one day I would dig myself out of all of my debt so I could live somewhere nice and not be bankrupted from a mountain of bills within a couple of months was the only thing that really kept me going.

Well during one of those really rough patches for me, I tried talking to Jack about it. I tried to talk about how I didnt know if I could keep going. I made a comment about how I didnt think that I would make it out of North Dakota, and I just didnt think I had it in me to keep going long enough to get out. After I sent a long spiel with basically that as the topic, i didnt get a response from him for some time. I tried other calls and texts because I didnt want to be alone but I didnt hear anything from him for three days. Three whole days.

After the third day I finally got a text from him telling me that he decided to give me the cold shoulder, as a punishment for saying that I didnt want to make the move anymore. That he felt it was a personal attack against him. So he completely ignored me for three days because my venting hurt his feelings. That text destroyed such a large part of me that it was almost unbearable. It took me so long to be able to talk to him normally again. 

I try not to hold it against him that much, because at that time he was in a really abusive relationship. It got so bad that if he tried to leave she would threaten to call the police and tell them he raped her. She would cut and bruise herself and threaten to tell people he was the one doing it. I remember one instance that we had to get up in the middle of one of our gaming sessions because she tried to break his console. It took her cheating on another guy and running off with him to be able to get out of it, which honestly is the best thing that could've happened to him at that point. Since this was happening right at the same time as my problems, I convinced myself to not hold it against him and just blamed it on his shitty situation.

Even with all of that though I still havent tried to confide in him again since. I cant bring myself to try to open up again after what happened, and since I lost the ability to vent to him the little I could, I dont have anybody. 

It got to the point I needed to write this out when I lost my cat recently, as pathetic as that sounds for a grown man in his mid 20's. She meant everything to me. My mom and I found her my freshmen year in high school a couple of weeks before Christmas in the local airport parking lot, and ever since that day I've had the strongest connection I've felt to anything else in my life for 10 years. She helped me through all my years of high school, been there for me through three crazy relationships, kept me going through my one year of college I went on campus for, helped me survive the huge move across the country to North Dakota from the Southeast coast, and was one if the only ones really there for me when I came home in the mornings struggling on my night shifts for so long. I just had to have her put down due to lymphoma about a month ago, after trying to help her eat and drink to no avail, be there to catch the stomach acid she threw up, and held her whenever I could when she got so weak she could barely stand. She took a huge piece of me when she left my life, and I've felt so empty, so alone ever since.

It was this isolation that's grips me now that made me feel like I had to post this somewhere, just get it out of me before i was eaten alive. Jack is still my best friend and I haven't had any big issues with him since, and he still does try to be a good friend. It's just that one point in time that just really got to me, and was only made worse by losing Syrup, the only one I counted on to be there for me every day. I just want to find something close to what I felt for her again before I give up on myself.

I know it's a lot but I needed to talk about it because I never really had the chance before, thank you for reading if you made it this far.


TL:DR: I tried confiding in my best friend at a low point in my life, and he ended up ignoring me for 3 days as a punishment for upsetting him over something I said while venting."
I'm getting my clothes back tomorrow.,"I'm not looking forward to it. It's over. I don't want it to be, but she does. It's been a super rough few days. But, at least I get a sweatshirt and some sweatpants back. I'm returning her stuffed animal too I can't look at it anymore. 

 I'm dreading it. "
She’s better than you,"I hope this belongs here. There’s something that’s been bothering me for days now and I can’t really tell anyone cause I don’t want to look needy or pathetic or whatever. It might be me overreacting but it hurt me deeply and I have to get it off my chest.

I (F24) have a male best friend. We’ve been really close for years (never romantically involved) and always told each other everything. We both liked the fact there was no sugarcoating between us, so if we were rough to one another or told each other the ugly truth when needed, neither of us got mad. You get the picture. I got into a relationship with a guy a year ago, and I know that is it. I just know we’ll spend the rest of our lives together and when you meet someone ‘meant for you’ you just know it. My boyfriend and my best friend got along perfectly and we all started hanging out together. Life is/was great.

But yesterday he said something I cannot forget and I doubt I ever will. Me and my best friend went for a coffee like we do most days to just talk and chill. (I don’t know how) we got to talking about a girl that was all over my boyfriend before we started dating, texted him nonstop and wanting to get together with him, but he never did because we were already hanging out at that time. We laughed about it and i jokingly said ‘’ good thing I won ‘’.
And then my best friend said :

‘’ Haha yeah, I mean she’s totally better than you, but you stole his heart definitely ‘’

I went silent, waiting for the laughing or ‘JK’ part, but it never came, so I just quietly stared at him.

‘’ What? Come on, let’s face it ‘’

I’m in no way needy or jealous, I mean I never needed to be and I think it’s a waste of time, but this... In that second I felt like I got hit by a truck.  Not only I have no idea why would she be ‘better than me’ since we’re not in a freaking competition and second... who tells their best friend that? I didn’t want to start a fight over it so I just brushed it off and changed the subject, but honestly... I can’t bare to talk to him anymore. And what hits me the most is the fact he will notice something isn’t quite right, but won’t even know what went wrong. 

I mean, the more I write this out the crazier I feel. Am I wrong? Am I overreacting?

I don’t know"
My current relationship gives me a feel of stagnation and it’s the last thing I want right now,"I‘m laying in my bed right now and tomorrow I‘ll break up with my girlfriend. It hurts cause she‘s done hardly anything wrong and doesn’t deserve to have her heart broken. It’s just that my feelings have vanished to the point where I feel like spending time on my own. 

I’m fairly young, 22, and it’s just so frustrating that this is the third time in 3 years that I’m ending a relationship. Every time it was because of the same reason: I lost my feelings for that person and felt like being single again. It’s a pattern by now. I know that I’ve still got plenty of time to find the right person but I just don’t know whether that will ever be the case, judging from my past experiences. I was left heartbroken four years ago, since then I think I find it difficult to show emotions, to become attached. Cause that would make me vulnerable again and no, no, we don’t want that. 

Maybe I should be more patient, take more time to evaluate the situation before committing to a relationship, but in that situation I can’t help but feel ecstatic and 100% in love, so that waiting becomes really difficult. Maybe that’s also due to the reason that relationships have been a major consistency to me over the last few years. To feel loved is a wonderful thing and not having that feeling makes me desire it. 

We’ve been together for 10 months now and it feels way longer as we spent so much time together. We pretty much lived together in my student flat with 35square meters right from the start until I recently moved 45 minutes away into a big city. Now we still see each other rather often, but our paths suddenly go into different directions. I just finished my studies, while she still has two more years to go. I want to camp in my Van throughout Europe, get to know new people, maybe do my master’s abroad, re-invent myself and so much more but I feel that the commitment of a relationship, or maybe only this one, is holding me back. I feel depressed and know that if the situation doesn’t change soon, I’ll regret it for the rest of my life as this gift of time & freedom after graduation doesn’t come often. It’s feels dumb to “blame” her for this, but I feel like this is not something you can control. 

I’m scared to talk to her tomorrow but at the same time I don’t think that I should be. I have the right to feel the way I do and maybe she’ll understand me & makes it easier. Maybe she’ll be fed up with my attitude and thankful for the decision. Or maybe it will be a nightmare. I suspect the latter...

If you’ve read all of this, thank you very much! I hope you’ll have a wonderful day! I for one already feel better. "
I (21F) just told my (Christian) mother I was almost assaulted when I was 14.,"When I was 14 I was cornered by a bunch of older teen guys and almost raped. It terrified me and I only told 2 of my friends who were both supportive. I never sought counseling because I wasn't actually raped and felt like I would be overreacting and they wouldn't believe me. I grew up in a fairly religious town, and most people seemed to view rape as the victims fault. I strongly valued my ""sexual purity"" at this time of my life and didn't want to say anything to anyone that would make them think I wasn't virginal. I just told my mom and now she's angry at me for not telling her and thinks I need therapy. I feel like she is overreacting since they didn't actually succeed (the only physical injuries I sustained from this were bruises on my arms and shoulders where they grabbed me, which I just hid with long sleeve shirts) and the fear from that experience has since dissipated. Of course it was traumatic for me, but now, 7 years later, therapy seems like too much."
Quit being a control freak,"Recently moved in with my parents for a while, separated from my husband and trying to work things out. 

My mom complains about how I do any chores. She’s ‘taught’ me how to sweep and wash dishes and scrape dishes and hang the bath mat. Whatever I do is done wrong. 

I quit doing shit. Now she’s complaining because I do nothing and she won’t believe it’s because she’s forcing me to do it her way. 

Yes, I’m financially contributing and hope to move back in with hubby soon. "
Do you miss me baby?,"I’m sorry if you do, baby."
I broke a Woman's Credit Card a few days ago,"I was working at my drive thru when I received a very frustrating order. It took 10 minutes to resolve. I was so upset and embarrassed that when the next lady pulled up to pay for her food, I squeezed her credit card so hard I cracked it almost in half. I also broke the chip in half. I apologized and asked if she wanted to see my manager. She said no and drove off.

I told my manager just in case she called my restaurant. However, I hear from a friend that everyone in my restaurant knows about it as everyone discussed it the next day and I'm highly embarrassed. 

I feel both extremely embarrassed and guilty from it and find it extremely funny at the same time. "
I'm really tired of not getting laid,"I haven't had any action in five years. Actually that's a lie, I got some head from a girl several months ago, but honestly wasn't that attracted to her, so I kinda don't count it. She was a last resort and was all I had. It's funny, because it's not like I'm unattractive, I'm at least a decent looking guy, a solid 7/10 at least. I use to have a lot of girls that wanted to have sex with me back in high school, but I always rejected them in fear of getting one of them pregnant. My friends get ass all the time. I'm actually quite jealous of them. I don't have any malice towards them, hell, it's not their fault I can't get laid, but damn you'd think since I'm friends with some guys in the game it would rub off. I don't want to pay for an escort. I don't want to lead a girl on just to use her for sex. I don't even necessarily need a girlfriend. I'd be totally content with a cool friends with benefits situation (I also had a girl offer me this the summer right before we went off to college, but again, I chickened out).

&#x200B;

My problem now, is that I'm too much of a fucking recluse, and my life is boring. I don't feel particularly interesting enough to attract women. Yeah I'm kinda handsome, but not handsome enough to not have substance and still have girls throwing their panties at me. My day consists of going to work, looking at my cute coworkers and wishing they thought I was a cool and handsome enough guy to hang out with, but never actually  to initiating some sort of conversation to get things rolling (because, you know, ""don't shit where you eat."" I'd rather them bring up the idea than me!) , going home, and browsing the internet or playing video games until the next day (the usual suspects for guys like me).

&#x200B;

I want to grow out of being a recluse, of course. I want to gain some new interests and hobbies, but I don't know where to start. Me and my friends don't hang out anymore, just play xbox together, and we have the same job. Maybe I need new friends. Perhaps I should just take all this attention away from women all together and just focus on creating results in some other area of my life. Like I said man, it's been five years. I gotta do something different."
I was played and lied to.,"    A friend of mine for over a year tells me she likes me, we both agreed to see how things turn out. After a few days she decides to stop everything the night before I have a big event, I wake feeling like shit the next day but I was over it soon. She felt really bad about everything so I forgave her. She told me ""I think you're a hella person but I cant handle the emotional part of dating right now"". ....  2 weeks later she tells me shes going on a date.....
"
"I've reached a point where I'm happy being single, so stop feeling sorry for me","Friends at the pub the other day: Friend 1, just because there's a single girl who's here too (who I have never met), doesn't mean I want them as a girlfriend, and it doesn't mean you can literally push me towards her and say I should chat her up. Maybe you mean well but it takes my dignity away, is kind of embarassing, and I would never do that to you.

Friend 2, when I said I'm happy on my own, it's kind of insulting for you to reply with ""really?"" and laugh at me. I know it's difficult for you to understand, but I'm fine on my own. I'd certainly rather be on my own than with the wrong girl, which, honestly, can be hell on earth. I have extensive experience with both and I choose solitude every time. Just because you're emotionally unstable and have cheated on your fiance because you crave women's attention doesn't mean I do too.

Friend 3, who has bullshit arguments with their wife, and who told her to ""fuck off"" over a triviality the morning after your wedding, same goes for you - stop feeling sorry for me. I haven't met the right one yet - the difference is I know that and I'm fine with it.

Same goes for you, Friend 4. The snide comment you made about me made you plummet in my estimations and I don't feel I can really trust you again.

Honestly, the worst part of being single is having to explain to you guys that I'm fine. Stop feeling fucking sorry for me."
"I try so fucking hard. I put my heart into everything I do, but it’s never good enough for anyone. Not even for my own self. I WILL NEVR BE ENOUGH!!!",  It hurts that I can’t be what anyone needs or wants. It hurts that I can’t be what I need. And I’m just so tired of everything.
I believe it's finally over...,"Throwaway because reasons. tldr; cheating wife, enough is enough, I'm out!

I've been married just over 7 years, and in this time i've caught my wife cheating, or trying to cheat on me several times over. Last night was the straw that broke the camels back.

We didn't get together under the most romantic way, it was basically a drunken hookup that turned into a relationship. Somewhere along the way we had a kid, and got married probably for the wrong reasons. The old saying that if she'll cheat with you, then she'll cheat on you is probably the most realistic thing I can look back on and see was absolutely true.

So we're married for about 2 years, and that rolls around the first 2 times i caught her stepping out on our marriage. I'm not certain she had sex with either of the 2, but had i not become aware of it, it almost certainly would have gone there. We work some things out, and get past it. So i thought.

About 2 years later, I start getting suspicious of her and this guy that's married with 2 kids of his own. She's being ultra secretive with her phone, she's acting sketchy and coming home late for no reason or under the guise of hanging out with friends. Well, one night i get into her phone and find text messages that confirmed my suspicion, this time 100% proof that she had sex outside our marriage. That should have been the last straw looking back, because as we know history repeats itself. Yet here I am.

So we spend an entire year in marriage counseling trying to work through our issues and such, I believe we get to a good point with everything and counseling ends. Due to past history, of course there's 0 trust. Everything goes back to normal I spose, for about a year.

That brings us to 2-3 months ago, where I catch her AGAIN texting someone, this time it's the ex-bf of one of her good friends. You sensing a pattern here? Yea, me too. I'm a fucking moron. Blah blah blah, we talk about it, we work on some things, we get past it I guess. I'll be honest, by this point i'm reaching my limit. I'm ultra patient, it's convenient, we have our kid, etc.

This brings us to 6 hours ago. Again i have my paranoid suspicions about her and stuff, just nothing concrete. So i check her text messages, and of course find more sexting. This time she sends a guy a photo of her topless and saying she wants him to fuck her. On a separate texting app, she's texting a 2nd guy and the conversation is sexual. I really am a fucking glutton for punishment huh.

I've been up for 24 hours now, I can't even begin to consider sleeping. She wakes up, and comes down and says she won't be drinking anymore (LOL) as if that was the sole reason for her. I know this is one side of the story, i'm no fucking hero by any means and I've made mistakes along the way, but i can say with complete honesty that i never stepped out of our marriage, and stuck it out for 7 years.

Divorce has been on my mind for a while now throughout this series of events and I'm finally ""putting my foot down"" and saying this shit is over. Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me 6 times, shame on me.

I don't know that I feel any better getting this off of my chest, but it's the first time i've put anything together regarding this situation, and it's interesting to re-read as a whole and get perspective.

Thanks for reading."
i'm happy to see my mom get clout,"idk if this fits into the sub but 
today my mom posted a st patrick's day photo of the dinner we all ate on facebook today and while she already has friends irl it just makes me happy a lot of friends of hers like and comment on not just that pic but all her pics. idk gives me a happy feeling like she's not only appreciated by her direct family but also friends/acquaintances "
i want to leave,"i want to leave this life i have now and never come back. I am so bored with my life and just want to run away and never look back. Of courses i would take my family but i really just want to start over. I’m 15 so i can’t really do anything about it, and moneys tight so we can’t really move at the moment."
Urges for men....,So I have a girlfriend but sometimes I just wanna try giving a guy head 
Lately I have been unable to sleep and often spend the night thinking about emotional events that affected me as a child.,"I know compared to some, my childhood was not that bad but certain events have been plaguing my thoughts leaving me uncomfortable and resentful. I hope writing it out can help me and encourage me to move on with my life.

As a child my dad would ofter yell at me, not like a slightly elevated voice or even the way partners may argue with each other. I can recall several instances where my dad would yell at solicitors, when they would not leave and make several of them cry. If you could put the vitriol emotion of a physical altercation in a voice, that would be his. I would often get yelled at for things like accidentally getting hurt, etc, etc. A specific moment that stands out in my head was when I couldn't have been older than 6 years old. I didn't clean up my Barbies and my dad screamed violently at me and locked me outside the front door. I cried loudly, knocking trying to get back in, it wasn't until a lady passing by saw me and asked me if I had been locked out. I remember nodding my head yes while trying stifle my crying, she knocked loudly and asked through the closed door if anyone was home. It was not until then my parents let me back in and I can't help but think how long I would have been out there if that lady never came.

As I got older around 5th/6th/7th grade My dad would still yell at me and sometimes say demeaning things to me but something with me slightly changed. After he would scream at me I would go into my room and sob while hitting my head against anything and everything. I would slam my head into walls, on books, etc. and sometimes even trash my room. Another specific moment I remember, was when I needed to buy Word Document for school, he did his thing, and yelled at me again but it was severely longer this time. I scream cried in my room and when my mom came in trying to calm me down I would just scream in a hoarse out of breath voice 'I want to die, I want to die"". I don't know if I actually wanted to die or if I literally crying for help but my dad just looked at me with disgust and told me to 'stop being dramatic'.

Around high school my father stopped berating and screaming at me so much, before it eventually completely stopped. After I experienced a severe breakdown in college, two or three years ago he apologized to me for how much he would yell at me. I never really had anyone to talk to about this, since the majority of my friends know him as he is now, which is outgoing and friendly. Things have changed and I don't want to strain the relationship I have with him now by halting to my life to focus on the past. I hope this can help me move on."
"Honestly, why am I even still alive?","I've had my share of traumatic experiences and horrible mental and physical situations in which I am in the middle of feeling right now. I know that my horrible past is behind me and the people before can't hurt me anymore and I am living in such an amazing home and family now; everything is *so* much better than my old life, my old life that tortured me for 9 years straight. 

What's so bothersome is that my emotions are such a mess, I've destroyed myself to the point where I cant seem to feel anything anymore. I have to force smiles or my friends think I'm angry, I have to *fake* a smile or a laugh to make others happy. Sometimes I get so tired of it and all I can do  is just cry because *no one* can help me feel like a real human anymore, even then crying is such a rare thing for my body to do cause I don't even feel sad nowadays. I just feel frustration, anger, irritation and then nothing; I don't want to feel like this anymore. I cant even remember when I was last happy and I am not saying this so you guys can pity me, I just genuinely can't seem to feel anything else. 

Anyways yeeet I feel nothing :/"
I don't have a reason to live anymore.,"I guess this is what I got to. I moved away from home this year trying to make it on my own but I never realized how far off I was from interacting with others. My own assumption of everyone hating me made everyone hate me. At work, my boss absolutely hates me. And since that's how I grew up with, it's to those things I'm attuned to. I'm trying to socialize with new people, but I don't even enjoy myself. 

&#x200B;

Whenever I'm around others, I just think everyone hates me, because that's how I feel about myself. I don't have a job I like, I rarely talk to my parents, I feel like no one cares about me anymore, and I feel like there's no reason for me to keep living in this world anymore.

&#x200B;

Literally everything I try now I give up within a short amount of time.

&#x200B;

I asked a girl in my work out and since I got rejected I get SOOOO resentful. WHenever she's around, I feel like I don't deserve to exist. Literally I'm slowly dying inside. Like, there is no point to work anymore. There's nothing I want to do anymore.

&#x200B;

I dont even stand up for myself because I agree with my haters. I feel like I should be hated."
I reported my roommate cause I heard her having sex,"Legal edit:


Jenny has just kicked me out of the apartment. She threatened to call the police because I committed a crime. Crime being,
Recording without consent. 

Now, with my situation, I was not on the lease at the end of February, due to my expectation of leaving so soon, I didn’t want those ties to stay. So she has the right to kick me out. However, she still has a majority of my belongings in that apartment. And she’s also threatening me with a crime.  


Currently staying at a friend’s place for the night. Again, I hoped for a peaceful resolution, but this has gotten way bigger than I imagined. 




To preface, my roommate (we’ll call her Jenny) and I are both in the military. She’s been in a serious relationship for 3 years with her boyfriend, who is stationed in a different state. This all happened last night.

I’m in my bedroom, headphones in, reading a book. Jenny just got a dog, who is very well behaved. I only hear him bark whenever there’s a stranger. Around 1030 pm, I hear him barking. I get out of bed to investigate the issue, but before I could even reach my door, I hear Jenny’s voice mixed in with another man’s voice. I stop and listen, and couldn’t make out what they were saying. We give each other very ample space and privacy, so, thinking there’s no issue, go back to reading. 

About 10-15 minutes go by, and I hear it. Moaning. Loud, excessive moaning through my walls. At first I was annoyed, then I remembered about her committed relationship. I quietly got up and my heart started racing. I knew Jenny had a boyfriend, and I knew for sure he wasn’t here. So, I start to investigate. I didn’t want to exit through my door into the hallway. Jenny’s room was directly next to mine, and our doors creak. Thankfully, I have my own private back door entrance that goes into the second floor hallway. I silently make my way out, and enter through our front door. 

Jenny’s put the dog in his cage, to prevent him from going into her room. I look around and see a hat on the kitchen counter. Now, for our command, specific people have their hats embroidered with their title. And this hat had her former leading petty officer’s (basically her supervisor) embroidery and insignia. We’ll call him Adam. Adam is too high of rank to even be here in the apartment. (military law restricting that type of intersection depending on rank) Adam also has a wife and three kids who are all living with him. Shocked, I stood there, and then I hear Jenny’s phone going off. She left it in her backpack, and her boyfriend is just blowing up her phone. 

At this point, I’m pissed. I exit through the front and go back to my room. I can still hear them going at it. 

Eventually, around 11 pm, it stops, I sneak up to my bedroom door and listen. I hear the familiar sound of her door creak open, both of them whispering. I hear Adam lightly walking with the obvious sound of our military issued boots heading hardwood. Adam leads Jenny to the front door, and I hear it shut. I rush to the window and wittiness him get his car in full uniform and drive off.

Before I could confront Jenny, I hear her on the phone, talking to her boyfriend, like nothing just happened. 


I snapped. I called our Command Duty Officer, (command leader for the day who you report everything to) and let him know what I just experienced. I sent him pictures of the hat, the car, and audio evidence of the moaning. He’s asked me to come tomorrow morning to file a report. 

TL;DR

I caught my roommate fucking her boss. Both are in committed relationships, so I reported it and there’s going to be a formal investigation on them. 




EDIT: 


There’s a fair amount of comments disagreeing with my decision. 

Look, the military is very different from any other job. I get it, personal business is personal business. If this was her with some random stranger we didn’t work with, I’d confront her. However, since this is two people who work in the same command, who are superior and subordinate, that’s 100% against the UCMJ (Military Laws). There’s laws against higher people of certain rank involving themselves with people of lower rank, especially when that person holds a position of authority. There’s laws against adultery, which, of course, definitely happened here. 

I get it, if I had not snooped, this wouldn’t have happened. None of this would have ever occurred. But let’s say they continue to do it, knowing they could get away with it after the first time. Then what? Allow these two to cheat behind their SOs backs forever? I’m not ruining their lives or careers, they’re ruining their own for breaking the very set laws the military has. If not me, then who would say something?

I posted this to get it off my chest because I had that indecision you are all telling me. I considered not doing anything. But what does that make me? A bystander who had the power to stop something, and decided not to. 

And for those who have shown support, thank you. We’ll see how it goes it the following weeks. I hope for a sensible resolution in the end. 






FINAL EDIT:


This was posted here so I can get this off my chest. This is not here for me to debate with you all the morality, the justification, and the laws that the military abide to. I’m done explaining myself to people who aren’t competent enough to do their research and understand what kind of laws the US military operates under. I stand by my decision, but that doesn’t mean I don’t see your perspective as well. But when you’re saying things that just sound like you didn’t read what I said nor did the proper investigating of what the UCMJ is, I’m not going to waste my time. 


Thank you."
"I am losing my best friend, because of his girlfriend","Him (M) and I used to hangout almost every day, if we didn't hang out we would just call each other, even for 15 seconds , just to ask hows it going, we are both 17 and he never had a girlfriend before (he is good looking guy and has cash, he just hasn't got confidence).

My friend (well call him L) hooked him up with this one girl (decent looking but easy catch, she just went out of relationship with this one guy (S) we hung out a phew times with). First date S and L ditched them on purpose so S could get rid of her (they were in along relationship and she wouldn't move on). She invited him on their second date, day after first date and they hooked up then.

Since that day he was so happy, we didn't hang out as much, but I understood, it's his first gf, he wants to spend some more time with her. But this is just crazy now. We threw a party at his place (we are doing this all the time, he has a nice house in the center of the city and is empty when he wants it to be). So I call him several times before the party to confirm everything (drinks, time, people and stuff), most of the time he didn't answer the phone whole day and would call me past midnight just to say he is tired bcs he was with her whole day.

Fast forward to the day of the party he calls me to tell me I need to come to his place to bring some drinks 4 hours before I was supposed to bcs she wants them to hangout... ( I dont live that close to the center so I have to travel to him by bus), but that was OK I can go and hang out there until the party. BUT No, he tells me I need to gtfo bcs SHE wants the whole house for themselves (I'm thinking maybe they want to have sex so I just leave).  Now there is no time to go home and come back in time, so I go to other friend and hangout there (he was coming to the party too). I call M to confirm when we can come and he tells me the time. The friend I was at was bringing speakers (big ones), so we are carrying them to him (15 min walk, but speakers are heave af). We are in front of his building at exact time he told us to be, I call him and he literally tells me sit on the bench or something I don't care, don't come up yet she wants us to be alone. I am pissed but I wait 30min on a fucking bench. I call him again and tell him I dont give a fuck I'm coming up (he knows I'm pissed at this moment so he agrees).

They didn't have sex, they didn't make out they just hung out... As is discoverd later... So we are 2 hours in a party, we have a place for like next 15 hours, and he comes up to me and tells me hey man you all (like 25 ppl at a party) need to leave NOW. I'm like wtf, he just tells me he doesn't care how just to take care of it and that I have 15 min to get everyone out including me, and that she said she wanted them to be alone.

The party was utter shit, we all had to get out, I haven't talked to him since then and I don't want to call him, I wonder how much time hell need to remember he has friends, or in how much time she'll get bored of him. I am pissed right now, bros before hoes man... I ain't saying she is a hoe, but she doesn't control you man, you have your own mind and opinion, and if you think this behavior towards me and our other friends is okay, lets see who you'll cry to when she leaves you. "
"I hate myself so much because I’m the ugliest person i know [f,17]","Why don’t i look normal? I feel like everyone is pretty but me. I can’t even look at pictures of myself but it’s worse with videos, it feels like the person I’m seeing isn’t really me. I don’t know what to do anymore i feel uncomfortable in public because i always have to think about how ugly i must look right now. I know that you shouldn’t compare yourself to others but that’s the thing I’m doing literally all the time! Everyone just seems to be pretty all the time without even trying and that my younger sister is very beautiful and gets all the boys is just making it worse. I just feel worthless"
"I miss my best friend so much, and there's absolutely nothing I can do about it.","My best friend is the opposite sex, we have been really close for many years now. However, over the last year especially, our relationship had grown even more so. We were sharing deeper thoughts, talking daily, etc.  Everything was great, my mental health was even improving. He was my only true source of a safe place to talk/vent about literally anything, and now it's gone at the snap of a finger. 

My friend had been single for quite some time, and wasn't in fantastic relationships even prior. Suddenly, he went on this date, and (per the usual lack of expectations) wasn't exactly holding his breath for it to go well. But it did, it went so well that a single date turned into a multi-day hang out. They immediately started spending huge chunks of time together, and he seemed genuinely happy for the first time in forever. A few weeks passed and she was living with him....

Over those few weeks his availability to chat was less and less, which was fine. He's  enjoying a new relationship and being happy. It was great for him to have it and feel those things without limitations. He's the type of person that doesn't use his phone when he's with friends/family etc. So this sudden change of constant communication, to never being around because he was enjoying her, was a little shocking to the system I guess you could say. Now that some time has passed, we haven't spoken in weeks outside of a quick 3 text snapchat that was him telling me about how awesome she is, and all the plans/trips they are taking. I am trying so hard to be happy for him, and supportive of him. But I feel like my best friend just died or ghosted me, after first reeling me into a deeper friendship just to mess with my head or something. I feel guilty, shameful and like a horrible person for what I'm feeling right now, but I just can't help it. I'm uneasy about his sudden leap into this intense relationship after being single for so long. And I miss having someone to just chat with, vent to, listen, and share cool moments throughout my days. It's just not the same, and I absolutely hate it. "
Does anyone else do this? I can't be the only one,"Ever since I can remember, when I get bored or stressed I pick pieces of the inside of my cheek off with my teeth and sometimes I don't stop until I can make it smooth again, I do the same thing with my tongue

I know these aren't the best coping mechanisms, I have tried to quit because sometimes I can't eat certain foods because if #1, and #2 just isn't healthy but no luck yet

Does anyone have any tips on how to quit?

I’m a 26yo grownass woman who cries when her father tells her she makes bad life choices,"My father is a good man. He worked his ass off through depression and bad health issues to bring me a flat to live in, and a good Art school. I’m really thankful for him for helping me having a good life. He is a good father.

But yesterday we had a small argument about shit, and I can’t help myself but feeling like a miserable human being. 

I’m currently searching for a formation that could help me financially for the first few years after school, so I can be financially independent. FINALLY. 

And the only positive answer I received was from a tattoo-shop. I was really happy about it. I love that form of art, and I really think I could make a good tattoo artist. 

I told my dad over the phone and he’s been really negative about it : « 5 years in a good school for this... It’s not going to help you find a job. Employers will look down on you if you have that formation on your CV. » I tried to explain that Art as a job doesn’t work this way... But he didn’t listened and seemed really disappointed and sad. Then I told him I wanted to hang up to end the conversation, he told me in a very sad way : « I don’t want to argue about this... Can’t we talk for once ? We can’t ever talk if I don’t agree with you. »

I don’t think he gets how the job of artist works. I feel like I can’t work on what I want if it disappoints him. When I was younger, he used to be really awful when I decided to do minor things that he didn’t like, like not wearing THE dress he likes on me for a family meeting. He would make the same comment about « my ugly outfit » until I decided to change myself for the thing he wanted. Shit like this. 

But he’s not mean or manipulative or any terrible thing. He’s just... Him, I guess. He’s a human being with his own flaws, a good father and I love him.

I feel like a freak and a terrible person for making him sad. He literally payed for my scholarship with fucking blood and sweat. 
I feel like an asshole after what he told me on the phone. Am I a prick ? Am I a spoiled child that doesn’t listen when people disagree with her ? I want to hurt myself, I’m disgusting. I hate myself. I feel like a total freak for over-reacting like this after a minor argument. I know he reacted like this because he’s scared for me. I hate myself 
"
i hate my ex,"so. i don’t really know anyone else who has this problem

so there’s this guy i’m with. we got together through a mutual friend. he saw me on his snapchat, thought i was cute, and started taking me on dates, right? 

well. this guy is “best friends” with my ex now. apparently. i never noticed them being this close, like i knew they were friends when i was dating my ex but they weren’t, like, BEST friends. but now they smoke weed and do lsd together all the time n shit like that. whenever we went on a date or hung out, my ex would facetime him and start talking to him about some stupid shit. my ex always talks about the dumbest fucking things oh my GOD

i didn’t really care at first but these past few days i’ve just been losing my MIND. i told the guy i’m with that i couldn’t stand him and that it bothered me that they were together so much. i told him that i feel like i’m never going to get away from him. he understood. he said he wouldn’t answer his facetime calls or texts whenever we’re together.

well we were together last night and he was blowing him UP!!! like back to back facetime calls. he didn’t answer any of them and he just kept calling over and over again. he even texted him and told him to fuck off.

and a couple nights ago they were spamming instagram and snapchat like “oh my god i love this dude u need to fuck with him” & stuff like that.

i’m really tired of it. i like this dude but this guy it making it really hard. i told him i wanted to end it bc of their friendship, he doesn’t want me to so i feel stuck. it makes me super angry and it’s been getting in the way of me enjoying doing normal things. i don’t feel like i have anyone to talk about it, either because 1 no one understands how technology influences relationships and fucks with ur head and 2 it’s just me complaining about a stupid high school relationship so i don’t feel taken seriously at all

tl;dr the guy i’m dating is super close with my ex now and they’re both really obnoxious about it"
[Positive] I found my boyfriend's Reddit profile...,"...and honestly it's changed my view of him a bit, but for the better.

Let me explain:

My boyfriend is very much your typical headstrong almost-an-asshole type. Super sweet with me, and his behavior hasn't set off red flags (it's not like his friends hate him or my friends get weird vibes, he's just got that cocky sense of humor). I taught him how to use Reddit a while ago, and we have fun with memes and such.

I happened to remember his username while scrolling through something else, and after a few tries with spelling, found the profile.

He hasn't posted much, but what he has is in his favorite game's community, and it's just him being honest and positive and cooperative. I've seen him talking with online friends/teammates before, but it's always been typical gaming slang. This is the first time I've really seen him be open and eager to learn and help others and ask about what he's not sure about. I guess without a name/face to his presence online, he's not pulling the 'prideful know-it-all' card that he tends to use to mask his insecurity (so he can go silently discover things on his own behind the scenes).

Made my evening! :)"
everything was fake,"he only asked me out because he wanted to make me happy. I called him my boyfriend when he didn’t love me at all.. I know he had good intentions but I’m just ruined right now.  I poured my heart into the relationship that was blooming but it just so so quickly crumpled into nothingness... like usual. 
everything was fake, from when I bought him pizza and lay on his lap to when he called me cute every now and then.
I actually loved him, and I wish he loved me in the same way. But lying to me and playing with my emotions (unintentionally) just makes me super fucking depressed, only adding on to the fact that he’ll never love me back.

"[Undertale] I want to roleplay Chara, as a Tsundere Loli, getting the bonezone from Sans.","I couldn't find an Undertale confessions subreddit, so this was the next best thing.

On a throwaway acc for hopefully obvious reasons.

To clarify, i'm not a pedo. Just some horny teen.

As context, I'm in the Deltarune Amino. In one roleplay, I was Chara and someone else was Frisk. Chara had mentioned Mad Mew Mew looking like a Loli, and Frisk had claimed that Chara fit the definition of a Loli to a T

Jokingly, I drew a drawing of Chara as a Loli in full Lolita, arms crossed and yelling, ""It's not like I'm into you or anything, S-Sans-Sama!""

Now, it's been stuck in my head. For quite a while actually. I have no idea what to do about the situation, but I do have some friends who are into that shit, so I may end up breaking and just asking one of them to fulfill my sick fantasy.

I'm not sure if this kinda post is allowed. I'm fairly new to Reddit other than occasionally listening to r/ videos on the bus. I don't know what a Meta post is, or if this counts, so I really hope this isn't breaking the rules. Just delete it if it is, I really just wanted to type this out and vent a little bit."
Tired of being single,22. Never kissed anyone. Never even cuddled with anyone. So tired of this. 
I hate being creative,"whenever i bring this up with people they always seem confused and i understand why creativity is usually seen as a good thing and it can be but its also pretty isolating because nobody except for a small number of people ever really understand your ideas, you have to spend years and years becoming good at a skill that the vast majority of the population doesnt appreciate, even once you become extremely good at your skill its very difficult to monetize so those hours of practicing just end up being a hobby. the worst part of all this is that no matter how much i complain i cant stop, the only thing in my life that really gives me joy is art which most people dont really care about 


i dont want to sound to whiny because i love that i have the ability to express how i feel into the real world  just wish i had a passion for math or fixing things mainly something that could be of use to society and i could make a stable income through, i have tried really hard to find math ineresting and i can appreciate some parts of it but its just too stagnant and im even worse at fixing things and building stuff."
Nurological disorder,I just wanted to say this fokr a long time. I had a nurological disorder of 8 months i was a bulider about to finsh my apprentership in about 16 weeks. I have lost most if not all of my frenids and only a few in my family ever talk to me any way. I am so alone it not even funny finding every day hard becouse there is no one to talk to or be around. Often i am alone for a few day at a time and most of the people around me dont understand 2hat it like. My memory fail 6 out of 7 days a week and my ability to talk has demisoned by about 80 to 90 percent. I am struggling every day with basic task and my ex frenids like to say I have made it up. It sucks so bad. I work out 4 days a week and final seeing a speacilts how understand my disorder just last week. Has anyone 3ver had things like this before 
"I've had anorexia, BED, and now Bulimia. No one really knows, or cares.","I'm a high schooler, hopefully graduating soon. If you were to ask the few people who have known me for about 5 years how my appearance has changed, you probably wouldn't believe them.

&#x200B;

In the summer after  middle school, I developed anorexia, and went from 141-85 lbs. I remember being praised by my friends and family, and the only person who really showed concern was my sister who had bulimia. Even then, though, she never fully realized I was anorexic, or that I copied off of some of her dieting habits. I remember it used to hurt to sit or lay down because my bones stuck out so much it hurt.

&#x200B;

Then something in me just snapped after some months of restriction, and I began to eat again and couldn't stop. I'd go on crazy binges eating thousands of calories, and in about four years I went from 85 lbs -180 lbs. Everyone thought I was a pig. Anyone who used to be friends with me isn't anymore. I cut them all off because I couldn't handle the whispers between them about my weight and how i'd 'really let myself go'. So many people talked/talk about me in high school, how i went from some  thin girl to a grotesque fat monster. My ex boyfriend jokes about how he really dodged a bullet (I guess he did actually...) to his buddies. I refuse to see any people, including friends or relatives anymore, that remember when I was thin. i can't take the disgusted look on their faces anymore. Now I just binge a lot and vomit. At first it was just binging, but now I make myself vomit too because I hate it when I feel so full after binging. I tried to get some therapy, but it didn't really help and it was too expensive anyways.

&#x200B;

Occasionally I'll try restricting again (usually about once a month). I usually end up losing 10 lbs in about 2-3 weeks because of major restriction and exercise, but then I end up seeing the food my parents bring home and it ruins it for me.  I hope that whenever I get to college I can lose weight again because I won't have enough money to buy food, and I refuse to get a meal plan.

&#x200B;

I sometimes wish I could tell people this, but would anyone really believe some fat girl used to be anorexic? Would anyone believe I make myself vomit when I don't even look thin? Hell no. It just sucks, but I can't tell anyone because no one would ever believe me. Looking back I sometimes wish I would've just starved to death."
Petty first world anger at turbotax,"I can afford this.. but TurboTax is charging me $99 to file taxes because I have losses to report and require a Schedule D.

I was willing to cough up $60 or whatever for deluxe but apparently that doesn't include state (which was free when I didn't have deluxe 🙄). So now it's 99 total.

Yes TurboTax provides me a convenient service and I'm not willing to fill out tax forms for over two hours myself (even to save $100?).... But I'm just mad because if I hadn't decide to use tax loss harvesting this year I would be able to file under the free version.

Like the deferred payment I get thru reporting this loss is not going to make me back $100 at all 🙄🙄🙄

So it's more my bad than TurboTax's... but it's not like I would be able to anticipate this crap so I can't really blame myself either. Also TurboTax has lobbied to keep taxes fucking painful to file so they could charge people like me $99 to report losses we had this year in stocks. So F U TurboTax.

Okay rant over :("
I cry myself to sleep every night.,"There’s a lot going on in my life right now. I’m a high school student and was diagnosed with depression and anxiety a year ago. I went through a lot of treatment just to grow worse every day. Not only does school take a toll on me, but my personal life does too. My parents have taken habit to insulting me every day. Nowadays, I also worry about my significant other and what I do them on account of my illnesses. They’re absolutely perfect and wonderful to me, but I get worried about what they say, what they think, up to the point where I’ve decided to just stop telling them things about me altogether—including this. Every single night for the past month, I have cried myself to sleep. It doesn’t seem a huge deal, but my depression has never affected me to the point where I have cried everyday. Because of this, I wake up late every morning and get to school late as well. I always want to tell someone, please bear with me, I’m struggling because x, y, z. But my problems just seem so insignificant and mundane that there just isn’t a point. By now, I’ve began contemplating suicide or self-harm. I know I won’t act on it, but just thinking about it makes me feel like I’ve hit rock bottom. "
Scared Shitless,"I'm currently in a relationship with the love of my life. She is definitely the one for me, no doubt about it. However I had a dream last night about something that could tear us apart. HIV. I have had other partners in the past (1-2 yrs ago) and I have never been tested. I've never experienced any symptoms. Ive never really even thought about it until now. I want to spend the rest of my life with her, but if I get tested and its positive I will never get to do that. I dont know what I will do without her. 

I'm going to get tested tomorrow. I really hope it will be ok."
I need help,"So recently I turned away from Christianity. I can’t believe anymore I just lost faith and I think my parents know about it too. 


I’m agnostic right now and this morning we were about to go to church because my parents make me go anyways. And I told my mom I don’t like going to church because it’s boring. 

And she told me I should be ashamed of myself. Before this I was talking to one of my friends dad about everything I’m going through. He understood everything I told him but my parents don’t. I can’t tell if they fully know but I don’t want to go to church anymore and I need some advice about it.  I probably should have out this in the advice sub Reddit but I need the most amount of advice I can get"
I hate my father,"I've never told this to anybody. Not even my therapist whom I've been seeing close to 10 years now. But the biggest reason for all my problems is how my father rejected me as a child. 

  
I was just an innocent child, why did he not love me. Why did he leave and destroy my family. Why did he love other children more than me. Why was he never there when I needed him. Why didn't he call when I was in the ICU because I tried to kill myself.   
I was born into this world with the need to be loved and I wasn't loved. I don't know how to live in this world. I don't think I can ever be happy at all. 

  
He has a new family now, new children, new wife.   
I think I loved him very much at one point but I'm just cold and hurt.   
It left me being unable to love and being loved. I push everyone who wants to love me away because I'm afraid of them leaving, like my father did. I'm afraid of them judging me, like my father did.   


To cope I bury myself in a coat of fat, so no one can hurt me. I'm wearing my own armor. I put tattoos on my body so I'm shielded from judgement.   


I'm a mess and it's his fault.   


Sorry if this is overly confusing, I'm rant-crying.

How do have faith when you are so fucking pissed at god?,"Hi there, well don’t know if anyone will read this. First time on posting to reddit. 
My mom passed 9 months ago today from congestive heart failure. Now if anyone had known anyone to have this, you know you don’t know if have it till your in the hospital on your death bed. If you catch it early enough you have a few months...that it. That was my mom we caught it early enough, they gave her meds and sent her home. She had in house therapy which helped a lot. We all got excited including her that she was getting better. Doing stuff on her own, forget her Cain, making herself food...etc.
She had her cardiologist appointment a month later. She had the visit and he told her the meds weren’t working and she needed to go to the hospital immediately. Well my mom despised  hospitals. She always said that’s where you die. 
4 days later she collapsed at home, 2 days later on Father’s Day she was gone. 
I know or people say god has a plan for everyone and you have to have faith and acceptance that what it is. 9 months later I’m still so fucking angry. I know there is horrible deaths with people. Car accidents, cancer, bombings...everything. How does one have fn faith that that was her plan? Or anyone’s plan?She didn’t want to die. I just don’t know how to over come this feeling. I want to know if she’s ok? This feeling is just horrible and I hate it. 
Any advice would be so great."
GTFO of my mind already,"7 months and I can’t go a day without thinking about you, you’re getting old in my mind please just leave me alone"
I’m laying next to you.,"You’re asleep right now, and I’m getting there myself. I’m in love with you. I’m thankful every day that someone so loving, kind, and caring is here with me. I know that I don’t deserve you, but I promise to work every day to be the man you deserve. You make me want to be a better person, and challenge me to confront the worst parts of myself and do better. And I challenge you to do that for yourself. 

Sleep tight, beautiful. I’m going to marry you some day."
Beardless sex,"Had to shave my (M52) beard about two weeks ago, to have Skin Cancer surgery. Tonight  she (F56) says that she wanted to see how sex would be without my beard if it were not for her back problems.   Before that she was afraid to have sex because of a weak bladder, her doctor gave her kegal exercises to do but said she didn't like doing them so she hasn't. 

I have given up on any sexual contact, I love her with all my heart and she is the mother of my awesome son. I could never have an affair or think about a divorce.  She is my best friend so I guess this how I will be living."
I(20F) misjudged a situation with a friend(20M) and pushed him away accidentally,"A close guy friend and I were hanging out yesterday with about 5 other friends at one of their apartments. So the rest of our friends are catching up on work and we can't really relate, so we go and talk in the empty bedroom. We have a lot in common and have gotten a lot closer in the past year, so this isn't too weird. No, the weird part starts as soon as we sit down on the bed. We start talking and are sitting pretty close and he starts caressing my hand, when we hear our friends in the other room saying stuff like "" do you think they're finally going to fuck ?"" Of course, this made me feel weird because I have a pretty big crush on him, but he was very oblivious and I hadn't told anyone because I thought he wouldn't be interested in me. He always has lots of girls after him because he's the rich, attractive ""indie boy"" type, he's got plenty of choices. Anyways, I feel awkward and get up to close the door and look at him and just sort of laugh, expecting him to join in, like ""hahaha, I can't believe they think we're going to fuck, that's ridiculous.""This was an attempt to make light of my discomfort, but also in wanting to make him smile (he's had a really shitty last few months). He just stares at me, deadpan, rolls his eyes, and his face goes red. Immediately, I recognized this face of disappointment he's done since high school, and I knew I fucked up... but I didn't know what I'd done wrong. So, I ask him if he wants to go back into the other room, thinking he was annoyed after spending 20 minutes alone with me. I was confused and mildly upset with him for what I perceived of this.

So, we walk into the main room and everyone else is just sitting there. They ask us to go get takeout, and I immediately sit down and ask why it has to be both of us. He adds that he doesn't need help getting takeout, but they insist that we should go together. So, he opens the door for me and slams it as soon as we're both in the hallway, then begins walking very fast so I have to run to keep up. I catch up with him and put my hand on his shoulder and ask whats wrong. He immediately softened and looked at the ground. I didn't know why he was acting so emotional about me, but I assumed it was because of his bad last few months. I suddenly had the feeling to lean in and give him a hug, but thought against it. I thought he would take it the wrong way. (?)

We returned with the food and spent the rest of the time talking as a group until he had to leave. He kept looking at me, either looking upset or confused, I didn't really understand. I had heard from someone else that he had a girlfriend (or at least he was having sex with someone) but he seemed like he was flirting with me. I felt kind of hurt because I have such a crush on him, he is a wonderful person and I wanted him to be happy.

I fell asleep on the couch at my friend's apartment since it was late. I woke up around 12 at night to the sound of the door opening and heard my guy friend's voice. I decided to listen, and heard my friend and him talking. He was asking her if I was seeing someone(because he wasn't), if I was upset with him, and telling her that he liked me, and he felt he should move on but wanted to tell somebody. He went on for what felt like forever as they talked in the kitchen about how he wanted to tell me but didn't want to mess up another thing in his life. He left probably about 20 minutes later and no one knows I overheard.

All I had been doing was trying to keep some distance between us because he was dealing with a lot of shit and seemed like he wanted space. Instead, I made it worse by being oblivious

so yeah. I don't know what to do, and I feel like shit because I'm a stupid clueless 19 year old who not only can't understand other's emotions but can't deal with her own

TL;DR- Thought my friend wanted space, turns out he wanted to be closer. I misjudged the situation and made it worse"
I’ve never liked being the only child,"I am an only child with one parent—my father. Now, there’s honestly nothing truthfully *wrong* with this. But looking out at other teens with siblings makes me feel forever left out; from what I see, siblings: add less loneliness to life at home, can be a decent source of transportation when need me, someone to vent/rant to, and other small things. 

Maybe I just overthink this, but, truthfully, I’ve grown to abhor being an only child in a world where I’m literally a minority because of that. Maybe it wouldn’t be as bad if I had both parents. I don’t know. I struggle with abandonment issues and just general loneliness, and I assume it’s because of that. I hate it. "
Social media and relationships. Men I ask you why ?!?!,Someone please answer the question I’ve been dying to know in every relationship I’m in..... why do you like other women’s provocative sexual pictures?! Especially when you have a sexy women you’re with. What is the point of double tapping the picture so your gorgeous girlfriend can see who you compare her too. We know men do it constantly why rub it in our face. I’m over it. 
All the feels,"I’m currently watching the third season of Queer Eye more than a makeover. Several episodes bring me to tears, however, episode five is about to make me ugly cry. Why do people have to be so intolerant of each other? Why can’t we just love each other as souls existing and why do people have to judge based on skin color, or sexual orientation? Why judge? We’re all human. Period. It just breaks my heart and makes me so upset. Hell, I’m even scared to make this post because there is so much damn judgement out there. Can’t we just root each other on? We’re all trying to get through this thing called life, and it’s hard enough as it is. "
My experience with the dating experience,"Now before I start this is my opinion and this is how I feel. I'm a recent college graduate and I've been single for the past 5+ years. After spending 3 years of college dealing with emotional issues from a previous relationship and personal issues I thought it was time to give dating a try. So I did. I spoke to more people and got myself out there but whenever I would meet someone I would like to go on a date with and maybe start a relationship I always end up rejected and they end up with someone they just met where I'm spending months trying to get to know them. It makes me feel worse when I would talk to them and it's always the same. Their last boyfriend cheated or did something shady behind their backs and that's the reason the relationship ended. After the nth time of being friendzoned I got tired and moved to internet dating using apps like Tinder, OkCupid, Bumble, etc. At first I just wanted dating experience or just to meet new people. On Tinder I met a great person that I still talk to this day and interest is still there for when we eventually meet up and go on this date. On OkCupid I meet a few people and only went on a date with one of them it was fun getting to know people but reality stepped in and things fell apart either because of personal unfinished business on their end or they just disappeared one day. After that I took a year or 2 off dating apps because things were getting too toxic and I started to see it affect my personality. 

Now here comes my rant. The majority of the people I see on these apps are; women who complain, sellers and ""bad texters"".

Lets start with those that complain. Why do women want people to message them first because they're shy? Now not to discredit those who are actually shy or have been hurt in the past which has lasting effects. I was raised traditionally so all the time I was told to ""be a man"" and to take charge but I too was a shy person. The reason I say ""was"" is because dating apps forced me out of my shell in the worst way. If I liked someone I had to do something or nothing would happen.  These same people that complains about messaging first would get mad when they get replies like ""hey"" or ""what's up"" so now I'm crafting original openers based on information I can get from their profile and mutual interest. And it brings me anger when after all that I get are the same ""hey"" or ""what's up"" response they complain about and they can't keep a conversation going. If you put no effort out don't expect any effort in.

Sellers are self explanatory.  Meet someone and they're just trying to sweet talk you into paying for their ""premium snapchat"" 

Now bad texters or any variation of that are just people bad at managing time or their priorities are all over the place. I see a bad texter as someone who can't communicate well through the act of texting not someone who takes a month to reply to a message. 

Going back to the toxicity of dating sites/apps affecting me I just gave up on meeting people a having a potential connection and just try to look for sex. Most people my age have matured because they were able to get all that sexual frustration out during college or went through their ""hoe phase"". I wasn't so lucky because I spent my time in college improving myself emotionally and academically. Even the friends I hung around weren't super popular so there weren't crazy parties or opportunities to hook up. Now most people would say just don't go on the apps and I have to agree that when I weren't on these apps and sites I felt a lot better but when I'm at elongated periods of time when I'm doing nothing and friends are busy with their lives I eventually find myself back. Currently I'm in the middle of the process of moving because of a job giving me a lot of free time until everything is finalized but I have quiet moments where just having someone to talk to would be great.

Sorry for the long post. this was just something I just had to get off my chest.             "
I'm 15 and I just got jumped and robbed last night.,"After leaving a party, my friends ditched me so I was walking home alone. I was wearing an expensive jacket, gold chain, you know typical teenage outfit. While I was walking (it was really dark), I heard running footsteps behind me and suddenly a punch came in at the back of my head. A group of 5 guys were punching me and grabbing me, eventually taking my wallet and phone. I tried to ran away, but I was so drunk that I couldn't keep up with my pace and eventually I fell down into the ground, struggling to get back up. As I was on the ground they kicked me and stomped me and took off the expensive fur of my jacket as well as my gold chain. They ran away and so that was when I knew it was over.

I couldn't believe that night just happened. I was really scared and when the bus finally came, I hopped in and everyone including the bus driver was staring at me because my whole face was covered in blood. The worst thing was that there was a group of people standing next to the bus stop where I was beaten up, saw what had happened, but didn't do anything to help me. Then suddenly, a very kind woman in her 60s sat next to me and as she did she noticed that my face was bleeding. She asked me if I was okay and said that I should call the cops but I didn't want to because that would make a snitch and at school people would hate on you and some people would beat you up for being a snitch. I knew my friends wouldn't help me to get my stuff back because I don't think they give a shit about what happens to me. The old lady said that being a snitch is better than allowing others to hurt you, but I couldn't believe that. 

I talked with my parents about this and they were extremely pissed because they realized that I was hanging out with the wrong people, aka gangsters, which led me to getting beat up and robbed. They said that the only way to get my stuff back is to report to the police, but that would make a snitch. If I don't want to be a snitch, which they fully understand the concept of it, then I would just have to let it go. I believed the value that I was robbed was over $2000 which i could not get it over my head. I worked hard for that expensive jacket, and my dad bought me that special gold chain for me.

I thought about telling the police, but I don't think that will be the great decision for my social life which is my fear. If I don't tell the police, then I lose what I had worked for.

As a 15 year old high schooler with no life experience, I need your guys' help on what I should do. I know one guy part of the group that robbed me, but if I call the cops all of his friends will be on my ass forever. So it's either be a snitch or let it go."
fwb- is it the lonely mans attempt at an “intimate” relationship?,"I have just started a fwb relationship with one of my good friends “friends”. I say this because they have an off and on dynamic, and whenever stuff goes south with the both of them it goes south for me. Anyway, that’s not the point. I wanted to say that the girl that I am in “relations” with currently has given me a lot of my first experiences, in the sexual manner. Does it make a man lesser to have their firsts with the “town bicycle?” It feels good in the moment, but a an underlying emptiness the week after because at the end, I know that all I am is a hook up. "
I'm fucking done. I just need to get a grip man.,"I just need to get my head on straight. I've got so much shit bouncing around in my skull. Current thing I'm having a hard time grasping is, how my life has managed to unfold like this at the moment. I know better. I'm so much smarter than this.
I don't know how I've let myself be so fucking shelled again. I hate this. Please understand, that before this turns into a sob story, my life has taken a 180 since last year. In many good ways but, as far as how fucking shelled up I've managed to get again, I'm stuck.. again.
I don't have the space I need. I'm being treated like a stay at home mother at times just because I'm a woman. The worst part is, this isn't the first time. This happened under better circumstances mind you but, I still feel like I'm in a cage. 
It makes me feel guilty at times that I even think like this.. I've been used and abused so many fucking times I can't help but have this feeling burning my belly again. Even thought he's not the same as my ex.. I still get the sick feeling in my stomach that some of the intentions are the same.
I know he's different. He really is sweet. We've been through a lot in a short time but, genuinely for the better. Things are great between the two if us. Our life is filled with love and laughter.. I can't get these feelings out of my head and it's killing me.
This is just what I needed to get out.
It's been fucking tearing at my head."
My life just loves to become shittier but I’m at fault,I did something really stupid and I decided to hook with a guy. He is five years older than me and I’m 16. He was my first and was nice. He told me he didn’t want to use a condom but he could pull out in time and I was stupid to believe that. Now I have a huge chance of being pregnant and he won’t do anything. He told me if I was he was going to leave and no doing anything and I couldn’t say anything but I understand. I feel so stupid and helpless. I mean what did I expect. I hate myself so much. 
I didn’t live a bad-boy life and keep wondering what that lifestyle would have been/felt like!!!,"
A life of partying, drinking, dates, sex. "
"I love her more than anything, but this sucks.","Two years ago I fell in love for the first time in my life. She is perfect, kind, intelligent, and beautiful. She is the best thing that has come in to my life. The circumstances of the beginning of our relationship were complicated, sure, but it wasn't anything that we couldn't handle. Then she got raped, a couple months after being together. 

We were both in school at the time, her assaulter was in the same program as her, and because our school is small, she was forced to be in several classes with him. In the aftermath, she failed one of her courses because she was not able to turn the work in. This prompted her government (she is from a 3rd world country living in the US on a student visa) to revoke her scholarship and sue her parents for the three years of school that they had already paid for ($80,000 dollars, forced to pay $1,500 every month). 

So, now she was faced with deepening depression and unmistakable signs of PTSD, anxiety, insomnia, an immense burden of debt, and another year of school to finish. And goddamnit she did it. It was never easy, it took longer than we expected, there were attempts at suicide, but we managed to both finish school, while also paying down the debt. 

Except she didn't finish school. She had two essays to finish, two fucking essays, but she couldn't. I was working and studying for a graduate school entrance exam, so it was hard to find the time to help. Her professors didn't mind, they knew what was going on and told her that she could take her time. The problem was always insomnia and anxiety. She would write the essays, but at night, she would lie awake in anxiety, and convince herself that her essays were shit, and that she needed to delete them. So it went for a couple months, she must have wrote each of those essays a dozen times, but each time she deleted them and no matter what I tried to do I could not help as much as I wanted to. In the mean time, after months and months of waiting, and hundreds of dollars spent on application fees, she got approved to work in the United States in her field. She had a good job lined up, full time, well paying, benefits, in the engineering field. She started two weeks ago, she got her first paycheck last Friday. I just got a new job that I am starting on Monday, everything was looking up. We had finally made it to financial stability and we had nothing left to do but work and enjoy life. But with her life, it can never be that simple.

On Friday night, the same day she received her paycheck, she received an email saying that her student status had been revoked and that she may no longer work because of the two essays she had not finished. But she did finish them, she had an appointment with her professor this Monday to turn them in, to finally be done with all this. But it cannot be. So now, she needs to apply to be reinstated as a student, and if that works, we think she then needs to reapply for work permission. Together, this could take 9-12 months we think. 

If she goes back to her home country, she will die. I don't know when, I don't even know how, but I am absolutely certain that this is the case. If she goes back home, she cannot come back until she has had her status approved. This means she will not be able to go to her brother's wedding in May.

So that leaves me with one option, I need to support her for the next period of our lives. I calculated, that if I work my two jobs and do 70-80 hours per week, I can pay for her rent, for her debt payments, groceries, as well as my own personal expenses. 

This sucks, so much. We were on the verge of escaping the dark place we have been in for the past two years. I love her more than anything, I have since I first started to get to know her two years ago. There is no question that I want to be with her, I just think it is bullshit that our relationship has never really even had a chance to prosper. Maybe all this suffering will make us better people in the end, better equipped to empathize and help others and to deal with the future hardships that might come.

We both know that we have it so much better than so many other people, but that doesn't always make us feel better. I don't know what to do, I don't know if she is going to survive this week, let alone this year. 

I didn't really have a plan when I began this post. I am sorry it got so long. Thank you, kind stranger, for reading this. I suppose any advice would be helpful as well, but I am reasonably sure that there is very little to be done here.

TL;DR: I fell in love with an international student. She was raped, she failed a class, and lost her scholarship. Her government is suing her for $80,000 and demands $1,500 every month. Even so, she acquired another scholarship and finished school. She just got approval to work, and because of mental health issues, she lost it, possibly forever but at least for a year. If she goes back home, she will die. I need to support her. I love her, but this situation sucks. "
"Tried to help my family get closer, only made things worse","I (20f) grew up afraid of telling my parents anything about my personal life, because everything outside of their ideal for me was seen as bad. The more I differed from the person they wanted me to be, the worse our relationship became. ""Bad things"" involved dating before college, sex before marriage, going out too often, staying out too late, drugs and alcohol of course, and anything that wasn't Christian. I've failed them in all of those and have disappointed them to the point that they completely gave up on that ideal for me. On one hand it's a good thing, because now I can just do my own thing. On the other, it feels fucking awful because they stopped trying with me at all. 

Since my relationship is ruined with them, I want to make sure my younger siblings don't have to deal with the emotional neglect and lack of comfort with them as well.   
My littlest brother, freshman in highschool, has been telling me for weeks about this girl he really likes. He wants to ask her out in a super sweet, surprising way and is trying to plan it all out for her. I think that's the cutest thing ever and have been encouraging him to do it, because dating is a normal fucking thing and you can't forbid a teen from liking people. Yes, we all know it's not going to end well. Who cares? Let the kid experiences emotions - even the bad ones. Either allow him to date and be there for him through the whole thing, or forbid it and let him date behind your back (just like I did) and let him suffer alone when they finally break up. 

Since I don't want him to feel as isolated from the family as I do, I encouraged him to tell my mom about it. (Honestly I don't think my dad really cares what we do as long as we're safe and smart about it, my mom is the one who has problems about it.) So today my mom and I were both in the kitchen and little bro comes in and tells her about the girl.   
Immediately my mom's demeanor and tone of voice changed and she asked all these questions about the girl. I don't know if she was *trying* to be condescending like in a joking sort of way(?) or if it just came off like that. But she made disapproving noises after everything he said about his crush. He asked her for advice on asking the girl out, and my mom's magnificent and tolerant reply was, ""You should just tell her, 'Well I'm way too young to date right now so when I'm in college do you want to go out?""'

She went on a rant about ""How are you even going to hang out with her? Just beg your siblings to drive you to dates since you aren't even old enough to drive? Is that what you're gonna do?"" 

Just the most crushing and patronizing bullshit I've ever heard for a little kid who JUST has a harmless crush on a girl. 

So of course he immediately shut down and said, ""See pencilwithnoeraser, I told you it was a bad idea."" My mom was confused so he said, ""The only reason I told you was because pencilwithnoeraser told me to."" 

My mom just got quiet. I think she tried to be calmer and be more open to it after that, but the damage is done dude.   
And I feel like shit for it. I gave my brother so much hope, telling him that our parents really just want to know what's happening in our life and that he should be open with them. I guess maybe I was just hoping they changed?   
But no, these people are about to make the exact same mistakes they made with me. And I'd bet my entire bank account that they're going to be sad about it once everyone is grown and won't talk about anything important with them. Kind of like how I'm currently suffering because I'm so terrified for my health and in so much pain, and I can't even tell them that because it's all due to an STD. I got enough shit about my sex life when my mom snooped through my drawers, found a pregnancy test, and tried to use it as proof that I'm a problem. 

Sometimes I wonder if my parents even remember being young. 

&#x200B;

Tl;dr: I've learned that I can't tell my parents about anything in my life, but don't want the same for my siblings as it's very hard to deal with. Encouraged my brother to tell my mom about his crush and all she did was shame him for wanting to date as a teenager. "
Beyond Heartbroken,"Can't believe I'm in this position again...

It’s a very long story so I will do my best to keep this short.

Met A Oct 2016 and immediately felt something I never have and I’ve dated and been with a lot of women. She’s a modern dancer and Pilates instructor. I work in finance on a trading desk. A happens to be my best friends girlfriends sister. I live with my best friend and A lives with her sister. Yes it’s a complicated dynamic.

She had a bf at the time, a month after they broke up A and I slept together for the first time. My roommate didn’t want it to continue and her sister told A she couldn’t date me. Every time we saw each other there was intense chemistry. 5 months later she’s “hooking up” w/ some kid and we end up sleeping together and both admit there’s something between us and want to date. Roommate and gf break up that week and we agree that we can’t see each other. A month later they’re back together so A and I start talking again, see each other, make plans to hang out. Apparently she’s been seeing somebody from out of town for a month or so, she cancels plans on me. About 2 weeks later she dumps him and hits me up, we start dating. We date for 3 months, very intensely. No official talks or anything but going on dates and sleeping at each other’s places 3-4 times a week. I’m under the impression she is crazy in love with me and we’re about to get serious. She goes away on a family trip, everything seems great, she comes back, we hang out a few times and less than a week later she blindside dumps me saying she’s not ready for a serious relationship and we’re in different places in life and she’s not ready to fall in love (she’s 23 turning 24 at the time I’m 27). I’m destroyed by the break up.

After this the following events take place: We sleep together 2 months later 2 weekends in a row, she flakes on 2 things with me, I find out she’s hooking up with one of my good friends roommates, she brings some kid she apparently hooked up with on that fam trip (we weren’t exclusive at the time though I thought we were about to be) to a friends party where I am (she winds up calling me the next day apologizing), she starts coming around more and we become “friendly” again and this brings us to this past July.

She’s leaving for a 3 week trip, we sleep together the night before she leaves. I think it’s just a one time thing and plan to use the 3 weeks to try and really get over her bc to that point I had not moved on. To my surprise while she’s in Italy she begins texting me and we start talking. She gets back and we start hooking up again pretty much every week for the next 2 months. During this time she’s telling my best friend she’s not ready for a relationship but likes me likes hanging out with me etc. after 2 months of this everything changes and she says she wants to be with me. “You’re special to me, being away from you made me realize I want to be with you, I’ve been an idiot, I’m done being scared, you make me happy, you’re the only one I want and will be exclusive to you and give you my whole heart and when you’re ready you can give me yours (I told her I want to give it a shot also but she’d have to prove herself and get my trust back after everything that had happened)” are things she said.

We started dating again. Again very intensely off the bat. Quickly she introduces me to her whole family. Talks of future plans like trips and owning a dog together. Everything seems like a fairytale once again. She tells me she loves me first. Eventually I tell her I love her too a few weeks later. We have a few small fights (one medium size one) this time due to some of my trust issues with her so it’s not all perfect but I was working on it and she was doing her best to help as well. I’m under the impression everything is great though, we love each other and that’s only growing stronger, we have a whole future coming to us. She invites me on her families Christmas vacation. I’m ecstatic, the girl I’ve been wanting back this whole time is telling me she loves me and pushing the pace of the relationship. I’d say about 4 or 5 days into the 7 day trip she starts acting weird, distant, I ask her whats wrong and she says everything is fine, eventually snapping at me at dinner our last night (I tell her not to snap at me), something is seriously off so I try to give her space.

2 days after we get back she breaks up with me. Things she said when ending it:
- She said it all started about 3 weeks before this, we woke up together, she was getting ready to leave, I kissed her cheek, and she started doubting or being unsure. She pushed them aside and felt better about everything and then they came back on vacation
- said I deserve somebody who loves me as much as I love her
- loves me but isn’t in love with me and really wants to be (Truly don't get how she can say that. The way she would look at me, kiss me, light up around me, how affectionate she was, the things she would say, texting me at 1am just to tell me how much she loves me...)
- I love her too much
- we see the future differently (which I said we’ve barely spoken about that) so she changed it to we want different things because were different people, that she’s more free spirited and wild and spontaneous and I’m more planned and organized and like to plan my fun
- said I hold her down (I said I’ve never once stopped you from doing anything you’ve wanted to do) she said whenever I want to do something I feel like I have to see if you can do it too then said that didn’t come out right
- said I base too many decisions on her decisions
- said I only do things she wants to do then said but then again you’re so easy going you’d always do something I want to do but she doesn’t want that for me
- said that I did things for her that made her think “don’t do that for me”
- said she’s unhappy sometimes (which kills me and confuses me because she was always smiling, laughing, giggling, seemingly in love and happy when with me)
- that we were falling into the relationship at diff rates
- when I said let’s take some space and talk about these things that she’s never once mentioned anything to me about what’s bothering her making her unhappy she said what’s the point these feelings will just come back and there’s nothing I can do

I am so beyond confused and hurt. I know things were not perfect but it felt like we were completely in love with each other with so much to come that we were both excited about, that we had an incredible connection, i truly thought that she was ""the one"" the first time we dated, she came back to me and this go was even deeper and reaffirmed those feelings and out of nowhere this is what happened after everything we’ve been through. No difficult conversations of her telling me things that are bothering her or making her unhappy.

3 weeks later I had to see her at a buddy's birthday and it appears she’s completely moved on and doesn’t have a morsel of feelings left for me. I tell her I want to speak now that I had some time to process things, she says ok but not now, she leaves the party, I call her a couple of times (I'm blacked out drunk like an idiot) she says she can't talk so I just text her again saying I think i'm owed a real conversation and she responds the next day saying basically she'll talk if I have things to say but nothing has changed for her, shes happy and has no interest in getting back together and that I should move on (Really nice from a girl that just a couple of weeks ago I was holding in the ocean and she's telling me it was a moment she had been waiting so long for and loved me so much)

What the hell could have happened? I don’t get how we can be on such drastically different pages and me have no idea? I don’t know if she’s not a good person (my roommates tells me she always breaks guys hearts), if she’s just too young and immature for a real relationship with me (she just turned 25 and I turned 29), or if we’re somehow incompatible? (Though I never felt we were incompatible at all, different types of people yes in some aspects but had a ton in common and really thought we fit great together). Maybe I scared her off drunkenly telling her I'm so in love with her or there was too much talk about future plans? (not marriage just summer and next fall plans). I think maybe the ""fights"" and when i'd get moody over things (i don't know why I got moody, that's really not like me at all!) changed the way she felt about me? Maybe because I never really moved on that ruined this go at it?

I’ll provide any missing details if you ask because there’s a ton I skipped. It feels like she had a few days of perfectly normal doubts/uncertainties and let them get away from her and when we were on a pretty intense vacation together she let little things get under her skin. Im most upset about the fact that she never came to me with what was bothering her. I’m just so beyond confused and heartbroken and was hoping for some insight. I just want this nightmare to be over and her to be wrapped around me in bed, not writing this..."
"My ex looks happy, and I didn't self harm.","I was scrolling through Facebook when I came across my ex's new profile photo of him and his new girlfriend. They looked happy together.

My first reaction was to click on it, and look at the caption, but the library WiFi went down and the page wouldn't load. I packed up my stuff and went home. While it was bit heart-wrenching, and I got the familiar longing to scratch all my skin off, I did some yoga and I feel better now.

I'm still working on getting over this relationship, but I've finally started therapy (I've been on a waiting list since November) and I'm going to try to and become the healthiest and happiest me I can be. 

I deserve to be healthy and happy. I need to stop starving and hurting myself when I feel bad. Hopefully yoga, and impulse buying house plants will become more instinctive coping mechanisms.

I fucking hate being a mother and I’m on the verge of a mental breakdown.,"I’m a SAHM of a 12 month old and I am on the verge of a very serious mental breakdown. I’ve struggled with mental illness throughout my life so I’m able to recognize where I’m at at this point, and it’s not good. I hate my life, I hate being my child’s mother, I dread waking up every day knowing exactly what I’m going to be doing, and that it is everything I fucking loath. I have felt this way since my daughter was born. I did not want to have her and raise her, but financially I didn’t have access to an abortion at the time and my husband wouldn’t let me put it up for adoption. So here I am. I don’t hate my child at all. I don’t resent or blame my child for my life being what it is. I hate myself and resent my husband wholehearted for it. We are the reason this is my life. I have no idea how I’m going to survive this. I just want to run away and disappear. I only ever think of suicide in the context of “at least I’d be able to be free of this” (I am not actually suicidal or thinking of hurting myself, this is just part of my depressed mindset sometimes). I know that if I ever divorced my husband I would not hesitate to give him full custody and just pay the fucking child support. I’ve tried 8 different medication and tried therapy but was unable to manage having a baby with me at all times, and finally cracked and told him I thought I needed to admit myself into an impatient facility (for many reasons,  but namely that I am no longer functional as my own person and am barely able to manage as my child’s caregiver at this point, I’m drinking every night to cope and my eating disorder is getting out of hang beyond anything before), and I found one that’s an hour away and his response was “what are we going to do with (child’s name) and why should I lose my job over this?”. I’m so weighed down by having to be a parent I can’t even help myself without failing my entire family. I fucking hate my life and I just want to disappear into the night. "
They keep getting in my way and they make me feel like a bad person.,"My parents are ""they""

Recently my dad was saying he's miserable and isn't happy with anything. My mom then asked if he's miserable with her so she can just leave him, and he said he didn't want to fight about it.

I asked her why he said he was miserable later on, and she basically said that his parents thought he looked unhappy, etc.

And then she called me miserable and that she's always in the middle of things and has to absorb our misery (I guess) and said she's the one that's always stressed out.She even said along with the fact about my dad being miserable, that I treat him like shit because I don't talk to him and all that. And I don't refer to him as ""dad"" and instead of male pronouns like he and him. As if he was a total stranger. Which is how I feel in my own house because if the way I felt growing up around only my parents. Made me feel like I fucked up my whole life. 

They've made me feel guilt and shame (even do the same for my pets) and that took a toll on my mindset that everything is my fault, even though most of the times it isn't. If I expressed myself, I was judged. And it made me shy of being who I am. I had to hide things. My interests, social media, sexuality, views etc. Because if I dare say something, it's gonna get shit on. Of our spoke out to them, especially if it's my dad's racist antics, it was put down. 

Growing up with all that made me feel bad about myself and made me hard on myself too. I just feel like a prisoner in my own body around them. If I'm not with them, I'm happy. I don't care who I'm with, if it's not my parents I'm happy. And the connection with them doesn't even have a spark. It's just flat dead. 

I don't talk to my dad as much for that reason, but I would talk to my mom. Even so, me and her just end up arguing and nothing ends. It's rare to have a heartfelt conversation. 

I've been called a brat,heartless, selfish, and that nothing is good enough for me. And it hits me right in the heart. It hurts. My own mother on Christmas Eve said I would be happy if my father died because we thought he had cancer when it wasn't. 

And my mom has said that I hurt people like my grandparents because I don't visit them like I used to. Mainly because I don't feel comfortable there either and I don't want to be there when everyone's fighting. It's like everyone in my family is at each other's throat. I live in an toxic environment and I hate it. Yelling either ta me or my pets. It's hell. Even a bunch of actual animals get hurt by their words. Animals have feelings, and so do I. And I feel like an animal. A caged animal. 

She compared her rape experience to my own struggles and made me look low for it. She was even more worried about my friend's sexuality when I told her she got molested by a female. And she forced me to come out the closet aftee in said that when I wasn't ready to come out yet. 

She was very mad and gave me the cold shoulder after I gave her her answer. 

It makes me feel like a damn animal or monster and I know that's now who I am. I'm tired of living a double life. At home, I'm whatever they say, and at school I'm actually me. A human being. I'm tried of feeling this way. It kills me from the inside everyday. And it affects everything. 

I want to get a job, but they put restrictions against that. I want to buy my own things, they go again that and then shame me for making them buy me things when I said I would pay for it myself.  I can't even hang out with a friend because they can't trust them. And my mom hates one of my friends. 

I have to hide my relationship with my girlfriend, who makes me feel warm and happy when I talk to her, because I'm afraid they'll hurt her with words or something like that. I could care less on what they do to me. 

My mom thinks she's in the right all the time, even when she's not. My father is a prejudiced spoken homophobe who hates people and said that no one cares for his opinions and misery. 

And I have to be a masked person to avoid being yelled at all the time. This isn't me. It fucking aches. Makes me sick. I've had too many existential crisis and considered suicide at one point. 

My girlfriend,friends  and people who accept me for who I am are the only things that make me happy. And where I can live my real life. Not some fake, toxic filled life at home. 

I'm not trying to blame anyone and I don't blame myself anymore. I don't know what to do. 

I'll be turning 18 in September and me and my girlfriend plan on finding an apartment. I want to get a job to pay for it, but they won't let me get one because it's either ""too much gas and you're bad at talking to people"". My therapist even suggested I don't get a fast food job because of my severe anxiety. Last time I did, I almost had a panic attack in the restaurant. 

I'm tried of being dragged down, and I want to get my life together but I can't even seem to do that. I'm still getting shit thrown at me and I'm tried of feeling like a villain that ruins the day. 

It's my prerogative to make my own decisions"
Being Ugly,"Being Ugly and Feeling Ugly. When I look at myself in the mirror, I don’t like what I see. I am ugly. I have an ugly face that’s only getting worse because of bad sleep, an ugly body and ugly style. I am ugly to myself and I am ugly to others, there’s no other way around it. It devalues the rest of me in the eyes of others. I don’t like living while being ugly. It only holds me back from things. Because I’m this way, I’m super limited for romance on top of being short/small framed. It makes me not desirable romantically ever ( knowing and thinking about that makes me feel bad) and it makes me inferior in the eyes of others. I’ll never have the luxury of relationships, dates, anything. I’ve never been loved and never will be loved (even on a family sense - my entire upbringing being another issue altogether that won’t be the main focus of this piece). I dont have the luxury of being confident because by default I've been cursed with something that is forever lasting. Forever. From now until I die. This is the only life I have and I’m stuck with this.  This is a part of my identity I’m stuck with! I get depressed every time I thoroughly think about how I’m stuck like this. I always want to cry. I can’t feel cool no matter what I become because of this piece of me. There are so many disadvantages that come with being short, ugly and brown, I couldn’t list them all. To sum all of those things up, more people want less to do with you than they would an average looking or attractive person and see you as beneath those other people. Anything that involves being face to face with another person affects ugly people. “Be confident” doesn't mean a thing to me. It's an imaginary idea. I have too many problems and insecurities and circumstances that make my life miserable. I don’t like being associated with this ugly. I don’t like being reminded by myself that I look this way. It’s like going outside with your shirt inside out... but with a shirt you can fix it, but being ugly is something that is forever. The only way I can go outside is by forgetting that I’m ugly somehow or by forcing myself by adopting a nihilistic mindset before leaving the house. I’m tired of being beneath others and not good enough. And I can’t do anything about this pain. On top of enduring this pain, I have to suppress it so that I don’t hurt myself or become a danger to society. Being ugly isn’t just something that holds you back. It’s something that eats away at you. I can’t do a thing about it. There are times when I don’t even want to go outside because of the way I look. It’s painful. Sometimes, I have to remind myself that I have to live my life and can’t let being ugly take over. There’s no solution to this. I just have to deal with it and the sadness that comes with it. Many people don’t have to deal with this at all, so they don’t have the solution for it or need a solution. No matter how much I explain how this feels, no one who isn’t like me will ever understand what it’s like. I’m tired of my therapists sugar coating things for example telling me I’m not ugly. They only say that because there’s nothing else they can do or say to people when they’re ugly. And I envy the attractive population so much for it. Wanting to experience what it would be like to be with an attractive person and feeling love leads to viewing of pornography and the viewing of pornography leads to more envy and frustration (on top of all of the other bad things about pornography which is another problem I’m dealing with - health problems). Being reminded of my looks by seeing myself, by seeing someone with better looks or with generally normal or good looks and by seeing people who are intimate irates me so much the same way the other things I'll say do. I wish I could take out all the feelings of anger and envy and inferiority on something. Before, I even wanted to take those feelings out on others but I suppressed those feelings by remembering that doing something unfairly doesn't solve the unfairness I've been dealt.

Recently told my best freind I couldn't trust him.,"While not officially diagnosed, I think I might have some mental issues. I can't control my anger and paranoia as well as my other friends can, and that's what led to this. My best freind has gone out of his way to comfort me and help me, which I've been unable to pay him back for. Here recently I've been worried that my BF was stalking my messages and that he was some hacker that knew when I screenshoted our convos, I told him about my concerns and said I had to step away. He didn't tell me directly but he looked extremely upset, I don't know how I can forgive myself for turning my back on him after all he's done."
Does alcohol actually act as a truth syrome? Or do people just say things out of their impulsivity?,"I had a threesome a couple of days ago with my ex and my guy bestfriend (I’m a guy). We were drunk so you could imagine how things could have lead up to the situation. Anyway, a lot of things were said. My guy bestfriend told my ex that he loved her and that he hasn’t lost feelings for her (they use to be in a relationship as well) but he also said he had feelings for me as well (there was something going on between us two as well but it was never direct). Then when he sobered up I asked him if it was true that he still loved her.....because I guess I was hurt at the fact that I felt used for him to get back to her, but he said I was overthinking things and that he didn’t mean anything he said about her (the I love you part)....but idk this whole situation has me fucked up in the head. What do you guys think? Does he really still love her or was he just saying that because he was in the mood and the sex? "

Two Bois One Night,"Repost because automod wouldn't let me ""use the slur sl*t or sl*tty"" even though they were used as terms of endearment and empowerment in the original post! Ok.

Wow, ya'll. This happened two days ago and I can't get it out of my mind!! I really needed to tell someone! I'm gushing with the news. So, I am one of those ethically non-monogamous folks with multiple romantic partners of various levels of commitment, 99.99% of it being almost competitively casual. I don't have a ""primary partner"" and I live alone in a 1br apartment with my cat. I'm pretty independent and certainly consider myself ""sexually liberated."" Here is the dish:

The other night, one of my partners came back into town from a month long trip, and made his was to my place for sexytime. We banged and the poor guy was super jetlagged, so he conked out after a very brief Round One around 10:30pm. I enjoyed myself immensely, but I eventually got up to watch TV and toke.  My insomnia has been hellish this last week due to stresses at work.

Low and behold, at 1am I receive a text from another partner, Guy B, summoning me for late night sex. I initially declined because, well, Guy A was in my bed, right then, snoozing like a nekked angel. Gut B asked if I was sure. I sighed and I looked deep within myself and asked myself what I wanted vs what I needed. And, that night, I needed Round 2, 3, and 4 with Guy B from 1:15am-4am. After that I went home and slipped into bed with Guy A. We cuddled, woke up, and Guy A and I finished up with Rounds 5+ all throughout the next day.

What's the offmychest? I feel like I should be ashamed, or disgusted, or sl*tty, or dirty, etc etc etc. In actuality, I feel so incredibly PROUD! I had so. Much. Fun. I did all of this without lying to, misleading, hurting, or pissing off anyone. I can't say poly dating practices are easy, in fact it's one of the hardest things I ever have to deal with. But, this is the reason why I do what I do. I used to go to gang bangs and have threesomes and all manner of sexual adventures. I truly consider myself a sexual athlete. But, I'm telling ya'll I've never done the Go From One Partner to Another And Back In The Same Night!! I'm so, so pleased with myself. I love leveling up and continually developing my skills as a super huge mega sl*t. Thanks for your support!"
Excessive Yawning??,"This actually a question.. so I’ve recently started taking Escitalopram  ( Lexapro) and so far my only symptom has been excessive yawning, Has anyone else experienced this while taking it?"
I’m ready but I’m not,"It’s been a week since my boyfriend broke up with me. He had already emotionally and physically detached from me since December. This has made me feel a whole wave of emotions. Mostly positive, knowing it was probably for the best and it was unhealthy always loving him and he didn’t love me as hard as I loved him. Because of this and not being lovingly kissed or shown affection for 3/5 months I feel like I’m ready to explore and meet new people. But there is still a part of me that feels like he’s mine and I’m his and I shouldn’t be making friends with other people in general. "
Seeing a dark entity/dark skeleton while on LSD,"OK so I recently saw a post where an evil looking skeleton is kissing/biting and embracing a woman. It said...

"" A profound sketch of a woman giving her all to a man that can offer her nothing. The transfer of energy is real. If you're constantly surrounded by, interacting with, having sex with, pouring feelings and yourself into an empty person, eventually the'll suck you dry. Know your worth and surround yourself with people, places and things that won't leave you spiritually empty on skin and bones"".

This image reminded me of my ex. Once I was at High Park with my brother, his gf, and my ex... When we used to do lsd together, I was actually scared of looking at him because he looked just like this image of an empty person, just bones. I'd see a dark entity in that body. He was the only one that looked like that.  Needless to say, this was a very toxic relationship that made me lose who I was for a while, sucked me dry to the point I wanted to die.

I'm doing a lot better now. Def don't want to die and I love life and most importantly myself <3

I think he is doing a lot better too and I hope that w.e was taking over has left and that he is happy  and full of light =)"
"My ex girlfriend had an abortion while together with me, and it haunts me to this day...","I was 22 years old, and she was 20. I was living on my own for the first time and she was living partially with me, partially with her parents, who were borderline emotionally abusive. 

We used protection, but one time the condom broke. She said it was at a time of the month where we didnt have to worry, so we didnt bother with plan B. We had full on unprotected sex before relying on times of the month where she thought she couldnt get pregnant ( bad move i know). After missing her period, which happened sometimes, i was concerned but thought my fears were unfounded. After 6 weeks she took a pregnancy test.

&#x200B;

I was stoic, and had to be the brave one. I was willing to discuss options, but she broke down and called her parents. The very next day she booked an appointment at planned parenthood without much discussion on it. The weeks following were the most difficult of my life. I was hanging on by a thread emotionally, but she was a complete emotional wreck. Many times in the middle of the night id get a call from her while staying at her parents and she'd be crying uncontrollably, and id lyft her over to my place.

&#x200B;

We broke up mutally several months later, for unrelated reasons, but im sure that was the beggining of the end. I tried to be there for her afterwards, but her behaviour turned very toxic. She demanded my attention, but she had no interest of reconciling or even friendship. I had to move on with my life ( I was a full time student and worked 20plus hours a week).

&#x200B;

Fast forward 3 years later. The only people ive told are my brother and sister,and my best friend. My parents, friends, current girlfriend of over a year have no idea. Not a day has  gone by where i havent thought about what happened. Whenever i see a baby or toddler who looks even a little like me, i think that this couldve been my child. Whenever anyone asks if im thinking of having kids someday (26 currently) i cant help but think of the child i could have had. I have come so close to telling more loved ones, but i havent been able to bring myself to. I know ( or think i know) that i made the right decision, but this has been a cross ive been bearing for nearly 4 years. My ex has moved on and has dated a new man for almost a year now. We dont talk. I often wonder if shes told him. I hope for his sake not. 

&#x200B;

Not sure what opening up to those close to me would do. I have nothing to get over, i know that given the circumstances it was the right decision ( or i think i know). I am pro choice and think its a womans right to choose, but that hasnt helped me shake this dark cloud.

I think my work environment is toxic. Today a colleague told me that I’m neurotic. Should I get a new job?,"Last year I (27F) was diagnosed with depression and anxiety, I’ve come a long way and feel like I’m in a much better place. 
I don’t think it’s fair of others to brand me as neurotic because I struggle with anxiety, it’s a very common mental illness and there are loads of others out there who feel just like I do.  I am not my mental illness.
Also, this same person said I was too nice in the workplace and they said that other people often take advantage of that. 
This all came about because a group of colleagues I used to be friendly with have stopped inviting me out and this colleague in particular is someone I travel to work with, so I asked them why I was no longer being included.
He said, “A word of advice, if you want to be popular, don’t be nice”. And then he said that I also have a neurotic personality type because I let these things bother me. He has said this to me before. 
I am always friendly and take an interest in others. I work in a theatre and come from a creative background so I’m used to being around big personalities. I’m never rude and I try not to be overbearing however now I worry that I may be over sharing. I’m not actually sure if I am or if I’m just being made to feel this way. There is a lot of gossiping and you never know where you stand with people. 
My workplace is very cliquey and, in my opinion, can be toxic. Most of my co-workers have slept together (sometimes even having group sex) and take party drugs. I mean nothing wrong with that, if that’s what you want to do, I’m just not interested in sleeping with any of them or doing lines of coke after work on a Friday.  So part of this is obviously the reason they don’t ask me out, but to say I’m neurotic I feel is unfair. 
I’m not the only person who works there that feels this way, a friend of mine (also a co-worker) said that she felt like this group in particular were bullies. She is now looking for somewhere new. 
I got a second a job waitressing last summer for extra money and felt so welcome by everyone that I started second guessing if people genuinely liked me because of my full-time job. People there still ask how I’m doing and they made me think that actually the problem isn’t with me. 
Is this just a toxic environment? Should I find a new job? 
"
I'm coming out of my depressive episode,"I've become so closed off, so I have no one I really trust enough to tell. It feels so good as I lost hope. My first was just over a month and this one was about 3 months. I was so scared it would never end but I feel so much better."
"I’m a teenager bummed about a guy, nothing new","Hello what’s up my name is u/Jesine and I’m really fricking down because of this guy, good to mention that I’m also 15 so yes I know I shouldn’t be sad about him since I’m young and life goes on but this is still something that currently is breaking me down. 

Maybe I’m exaggerating, listen:
My friend from school plays football and last Wednesday evening sent me a video of him showing my Instagram to a few of his teammates and one of them is really, really cute and my friend from school knows that I think so, I think.

Anyway I got the guys snapchat but we barely wrote anything to each other, like really didn’t write anything. And he took a long time to respond most of the time and last night at a party he removed me from snapchat after I sent two pictures.

I’m so, so, so, so down about it. He’s a year younger than me and even has a girlfriend and I know that if it ever were to become us he would probably talk to other girls while with me like he’s doing now. Whatever, it just sucks. My friends told me I can do better, he’s a year younger, he has a GIRLFRIEND. 
I didn’t write or send anything suggestive considering I don’t want to break girl code, I mean come on you really don’t try to take someone’s boyfriend, not like this. 

I haven’t been in a serious relationship and idk if I’m desperate. I’m not actively looking for relationships but this guy in particular just made me so incredibly bummed.
Plus he’s a good friend to my school friend, I don’t know if or how that could affect things but I feel like that’s good to keep in mind.

I want to keep my focus on school and myself. Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk."
Am I childish/sensitive for crying?,"Ever since I was young, whenever I got scolded by a teacher, or my parents, I start to cry. 
Now I'm 17 and whenever I'm really angry, or get yelled at by my mom, I tear up even though I don't want to. It's just automatic, like I get emotionally triggered easily.. Am I too sensitive?
 I feel childish for crying..."
need to start a new life,"dose anyone els suffer from anxity and depression and just think running away and starting a new life would make them happy but at the same time you got no money so your just stuck in this horrible place, sometimes i think living with a community like people who live of grid  but at the same time i feel like i like being on my own i could happily live in the woods on my own no stress of life just living peacfully. or live on a boat haha people will need to swim to bother me then lol "
Lifting things,"Sometimes, when I'm alone and required to lift something at work or school (boxes, crates, wood) that's really heavy and that I'm struggling to lift, I'll just say to myself: ""Come on, Peter. Come on, Spider-Man. Come on, Spider-Man! COME ON, SPIDER-MAN!""

My name is not Peter, nor do I have Spider powers."
I'm tired of all the scumbag centrists on reddit.,"I've seen so many people on here say both sides are just as bad when Trump supporters/Republicans/Conservatives are the ones with blood on their hands with all the rhetoric they have been dishing out for years now with that shooting in New Zealand but I've seen so many people say it's not their fault(what's even worse is people who are ""liberal"" saying it) when it clearly is. It's hard for me to think of these people and the people defending them as human beings when they have no humanity in them at all and act like monsters. This is why I'm not sad or upset when I hear about bad things happening to conservatives in the news. These people are disgusting."
The one that got away (maybe for the better),"Most of us go through that person who you had great memories with, but for some certain reason you guys went your separate ways. I had a guy like that, the first semester of college. We were all in a close group of friends and we were especially close. Personality wise, we were pretty compatible- both very friendly and flirty. Except I didn't see a future with him (bf material, not husband material). We went our separate ways during college when I chose another guy over him, and only last summer did we meet up again, fresh out of college. 

&#x200B;

Once again we've stopped talking just last month (he just stopped trying to reply) but we had a great time seeing each other in person. It was like nothing changed. He told me he still loves me but won't do anything about it, and I'm also in a very happy relationship with a guy I can see a future with.

&#x200B;

I just think about him a lot from time to time, and sometimes wish I can go back in time to relive it. Maybe I miss the playful flirting and free-spirit of being a freshman? I wouldn't change anything, except maybe the guy I chose that ruined our friendship (he's an ex now anyways). I kinda wish we're talking still but I also feel guilty I have these feelings when I have such a great boyfriend already.

&#x200B;

It just feels wrong to rant about this to any of my friends so here I am. Thanks reddit.

If anyone has experience in this type of thing or advice on how to face this and move on, I'd love to hear it."
Just because we aren't of the same religion doesnt mean we aren't willing to participate,"This happened years ago in highschool. A little background: Im a Pakistani muslim. My highscool & neighborhood seemed as if I stumbled into an all white school when I first moved there. I realized the 6 people of color in the entire school had their own little group lol, so needless to diversity was very low. 

Later on I participated in a nation wide Vans shoe design contest along with 3 other students and we won a trip to NY for making it into the finals. First thing that seemed weird to me was when I asked if i could bring my mom with me (because it was the only way she was allowing me to go) they said I couldn't. My teacher loved me though and fought to make sure I could go (teacher couldn't come though as her husband was very I'll at the time, I believe it was cancer). 

After a week of talking with them they finally agreed, and when we left me and my mom saw everyone's parents were there with them. It seemed strange to us that it seemed to only be an issue for us but we didn't push it. After the event where they announced the winner was over (we lost), everyone went out for dinner together and one person said they wanted to say thanks to God for this opportunity.  They all reached for each others hands EXCEPT for my mom and me. They acted as if we weren't even there. Said their prayer.  And started eating. No one even made contact with us.

Its been years since that happened but it always bugged me. I wished they just once thought to include us. They were just saying they were thankful, why would it matter if we arent the same religion, that has nothing to do with expressing thanks. Sure we don't hold hands before dinner to say that but we wouldnt have denied to participate if atleast one reached their hands towards us or made eye contact with us. 

Anyways, i just wanted to express that. Not sure if this is the right sub for it, I mainly just want people to know that just because you may have not ever been exposed to different cultures or religions doesnt mean you have to exclude them in such instances like the one I experienced. "
My Parents are so hateful.,"They hate: Homosexuals, Catholics, Atheists and especially Jews.

I often get into heated arguments with them. Last night was a pretty bad one. Basically my inbred mule of a step-father watched the New Zealand shooting video, and you know what he said? That the guy should have went to a Synagogue. When he said that I literally lost my shit. I asked him what the fuck is wrong with him? He went off and said, and I quote: ''Jews are monsters, they should all be killed, every single one of them.''. I responded with a question: ''Including children and babies that did absolutely nothing wrong?'' And I'm not even kidding or exaggerating he said, yes.  ''Better to prevent an illness, than to cure it''. And my mom just agreed with him.  He even said that if he could, he would go to our local Synagogue and do the same thing. I got so angry that I slammed my hand on the fucking dinner table. And then I told him and her that they're piles of shit and should go fuck themselves. I actually wanted to punch them both in the face. But, I decided to go outside and cool off. An hour later I went back and tried to ''apologize'' for making a scene. And they basically said no harm done. And went on to act like nothing happened. I mind you, this isn't the first time we argued about these topics, they said before how Jews and Homosexuals should be killed. I realize that me arguing with them is pointless, I'll never change their minds. So I decided the next time a topic like this comes out, I'll let it go. Just wasting my time and getting my blood pressure high for no reason. From now on, in my opinion, they're just as bad as the actual shooter.

I'm done with them. Fuck them."
How do people with disgusting and toxic personalities end up getting anything they want?,"I'm talking about the people who think the louder their voice is, the greater their chances are in winning an argument, the ones who are physically abusive, emotionally unstable, and make irrational choices. 

I don't think I have a say in this since it sounds like I'm talking down to a specific group of people, but I keep getting told by a lot of people that I'm ""too nice"" and the more I think about it, the more it kills me on the inside. People I've dated for a brief while in the past have told me this too and ended up taking advantage of me because they knew that I would take the blame for whatever problem came up. 

I'm starting to think that being ""too nice"" isn't really taking me anywhere. It's like I have to be mean or have a toxic personality to get what I want.  Maybe it's because being ""too nice"" is just another way of saying that I'm boring and bland. Maybe I should start developing a toxic personality since it gains a lot more interest in other people.


It even shows on social media. Those who do bad things end up going viral and trending. They're the ones that end up getting famous and maybe end up earning a lot more money as compared to someone who follows the rules and blends in with everyone else.



I don't know. This is all making me dreadful."
How come I am always alone?,"Why am I always lonely? My whole life I always stood kind of on the outside. I  wasn't like the other kids and when I was younger I got bullied relentlessly for it. Now I am much older, grew a thick skin and learned to defend myself. But still it seems like I am not able to form long therm friendships or dare to dream romantic relationships. 

I never saw myself as a lonely wolf or something. I am a switcher personality wise, means I can talk to lots of people and enjoy human interaction but then need some alone time to recharge and calm down. I am independent and always try to get my act together alone because I don't want to depend on peoples help. On the other hand I am a pretty giving person. I don't mind sharing my notes from class, helping with assignments or supporting my peers. Also I think I am okayisch person to be around and not to hard to look at

But then I find out that there was a house party and everybody from my class got invited except me. Or that two friends of mine spend a lot of time together. And this doesn't happen for the first time. Last year a volunteered for a charity organisation in Central America and one time a group of students visited to make a new website and we got along pretty well in my opinion. I kind of was their guide and made sure they got to places on time and translated when necessary. The last day in the mourning they had a tour and I went with them. They invited me to their goodbye party and told me they would message me where to go. Around six I made myself ready and asked them on Facebook messenger where to go. The message got marked as read but they never replied. I waited till half past eight in the evening before I accepted that they had uninvited me. The next day nobody of the other volunteers could look me in the eyes and I knew what had happened. I talked to one girl which I thought I had a good relationship with and asked her how her day before went. I asked one question after the other until she admitted that there had been a goodbye party and everybody had been there except for me, but I never dared to ask her for the reason. And this happens in some kind of variation to me over  and over and over again.

I even developed a light form of pure OCD from it because I thought people saw something in me, I just wasn't able to see and that is why I would always get avoided. I managed to snap out of it with the help of my therapist.

But the problem persists. Now I am actively trying to be okay with being alone. I go to the cinema alone, I travel alone because if this is going to be my life I'd rather be prepared.

TLDR: I am always alone and are now trying to just accept it."
I contacted the family of my father,"So I just had a phonecall with the sister of my father. I have trouble with family and its hard to connect.

I called for a very selfish reason. Years ago she offered a room at her house for me and as I am currently struggling with my mother and grandmother ( mother of my mother) who are mentally ill and I'm somehow incapable of feeling really what family is because I've been raised by my mentally ill mother for 18 years, I need to move away so that they dont know my adress and I can focus on getting my life back together. Now I wanna study starting October but in the meanwhile I need to go. My home does not feel safe as my mentally ill part of the family has my adress and my roommate is struggling with mental issues as well.

Years ago I reconnected a bit to my father and his family but cut contact when I was struggling. My relationship to my father is tough as he has also mental issues from the past and we met each others when I turned 18 so theres..no feel to it. I dont live up to his expectations and tho I say I dont hold any expectations for him I may have held some  unconsciously .Now today I called for this selfish reason of needing to move somewhere where I feel safer and explained whats been going on for me. She was very kind and while she told me she cant just give me the yes for moving in in the meanwhile she said she was happy I was trying to reconnect to my family. She said she understood how depression goes and wasnt mad at me and that even the family is probably not mad at me.

Tommorow I'm going to meet her in person to just discuss a bit how life goes and so she can know me better and it feels..challenging yet good. I have like a lump stuck at my throat which I cant really pinpoint what it is.As I said this whole family thing is hard but I'm hopeful I can maybe reconnect to the family of my fathers side and maybe even with my father tho that'll be a long road I think. As I said I struggle with this family thing overall but Im happy about how friendly my aunt was to me and I maybe more hopeful for the future.

Starting college again at 21 after huge depression,"**I really don't know where to start**. Let's see...

&#x200B;

I am from **Costa Rica.** I graduated from one of the best high schools in my country. Ever since I was a kid, I was pushed by my parents to become ""successful"". Never really knew what they meant, but I followed the order nevertheless. I graduated with a below-decent PGA (we use a different system, but it is pretty much the same) and I got admitted in one of the best universities in my country to study business management.

&#x200B;

I loved my freshman year. It was probably one of the best years of my life. I didn't really enjoy my degree though, and all my friends were studying medicine, engineering or law school. I have always been very artistic, but I knew that art school was not going to be a very good idea to sustain my life. 

&#x200B;

During my second year, I felt lost. Also, my parents got divorced and we were going through some tough economic issues. I was depressed. I had to listen to my mom complain about everything and feel powerless, and that had an impact on my decisions.

&#x200B;

 I dropped out and became a slave in the system.

&#x200B;

I started working as a customer service agent for 2 years. I started studying on a private university, and each month, I will pay this capitalist universitiy with my shitty income, to get a decent education in computer science. After being in such an amazing uni, being in a private college did not seem like a very fufilling idea.

&#x200B;

I dealt with it with coping mechanism. Started a band, had a shitty relationship, watched stupid show, etc. One day I woke up...Particularly when I started reading 1984, Steppenwolf and Brave New World. Overall, reading got me out of my autopilot mode.

&#x200B;

This year I got admitted to political science on my first college (the one i trully love). I would be my second year since I already attended to some of the general courses and seminars. But I feel depressed. All my friends are already graduating, soon I will be 22 and I just feel really old. I want to enjoy my major, I don't want to study just to work anymore. I wanted to truly learn something, hopefully be a writer and do my own research. I want to fight for those consumed by this neoliberalistic transnationals that are taking over my country enslaving young people, because I was one of those. My youth was stolen by a job. 

&#x200B;

Sometimes I feel that this pain that I have was needed in order for me to value my education, but sometimes is way too much for me. I feel old, dirty and that I don't deserve this opportunity that I have. Sometimes I feel like this is my time for redemption, to pursue the life that I really want. This opportunity that I have is not about getting a diploma and having it on a wall anymore, is about enjoy every freaking class and getting the most out of it, and I need a healthy mindset in order to do that. It is not about the diploma anymore, every class counts for me now.

&#x200B;

And so... I don't know if I should keep going. Right now I have a job, but I want to quit this fuckin job even though I kinda need it. I want to be a student again. I am sorry if it is way too long and the ideas are all over the place...It is just how I felt in the moment. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for your time people."
How the fuck do you make friends and date as an adult?,"I am so frustrated lately. I actually feel like I have a decent group of friends, but they live all over the US in different cities so I only see them a few times a year we plan big trips. Which is great. But locally, I really only have two close friends who I have known forever. The problem with this is that one is married so rarely hangs out, if he does, he brings his wife, which is fine but I wish she had friends to bring too which she doesn't. The other friend if he is dating someone is MIA for months until they breakup. 

I just have no idea how to meet new people. Maybe the problem is my area is too large, I know people through car hobbies but they, again, are at least an hour away, which means I rarely see them either since they don't come towards me ever really. The rest of the people I know are coworkers and we just aren't that close that we hang out on weekends. 

This also inevitably stems outwards to my dating life. I am either way uglier than I think I am, or my stature impacts me more than I think because I have practically zero success on the apps. Everyone says they meet through friends but none of mine know single women, or any other women for that matter. You would think my sisters may help but no, they just say I need to date someone but would never set me up with one of their friends. To be fair, I've also never gotten the impression that any of their friends would be into me anyways. Hell, even my coworkers recently keep saying how badly I need to find someone ""because I'm so great"" yet no one offers to set me up or anything. So just feels like a ton of un asked for beatings down when that happens.

When I go to the mall, the store, or just go for a drive I see so many attractive women, I just don't know how to talk to them. None ever ""give me the look"" at bars (which I barely go to anymore now), I may as well be a ghost, or they are far out of my league, or in large groups with men and women. Or in other instances, I just know from my sisters or girls I know, that they are there for a purpose. So if its the mall, they are trying to shop and leave. Coffee shop, there to do work no be hit on by some creepy dude. Gym, obviously there to workout. Grocery store, there to shop and go home to eat. 

I just feel so lost lately. I do a lot of shit on my own just because of my ""friends"" barely wanting to do new stuff but when I'm alone I almost switch to being introverted even though I'm definitely more extrovert. Just feel like I'm legit going to be alone forever at this point. My older sister is married with a baby, my baby sister now getting married, and me, still single for the past 6 or something fucking years. Just so tired of this and feel like I'm never going to find a way to meet anyone. "
"Married with a baby, still in love with my ex!","First time poster and honestly don’t think anyone will read this but hey, gotta get it off my chest y’know?

So I was 17 when I met my now ex who I felt I was madly inlove with. We would spend all our time together and went on adventures all over our small city. I was still in high school at the time at an all girls school. He was just everything. 

So I finished high school, took a break year and then went to university. All throughout we were still together and by then talking about getting engaged. Thennnn, at uni I met a guy, funny , cute and super charming.  I ended up cheating on my boyfriend with this guy and he too was in a relationship that he ‘was ready to leave ‘ for me. 

Needless to say he didn’t, and I thinking that I needed to go out and meet new people. I left my boyfriend. I thought I was doing great for a couple of months distracting myself with friends and going out a lot. But when I got home I always wondered what he was doing. 

In the meanwhile he was trying to convince me it was a mistake and trying to get back with me but a was certain I need to explore more. 

A few months down the line I tried to get back in touch with him, he had found someone else and it was serious and I didn’twanna mess that up for him cause he deserved to be happy. 

I’m now writing this with my baby in my hands, married to someone else. But every night I go to bed thinking about him, wanting to just talk to him or just even SEE him in person. Even during the day I think about him and it’s not that I’m unhappy in my marriage i love my husband and my beautiful baby boy. I can’t stop thinking... what if?

Oh and I did what any sane woman would do and looked him up on social media, he is also married with a kid. 


Will I ever stop thinking about him?"
"I'm 20 years old with no aspiration for anything, and I feel guilty over this","This is my first post here, so any feedback regarding rules or anything really is appreciated. 

I'm 20 years old, I currently study in university and have a part time job. This activities take up much of my time amd and I try to use my spare time as much as I can. However I can't find the ambition to do anything. I've spent two months without using my gym membership, I can't get to new hobbies, my guitar is taking up dust in the corner for a long time now, and I feel so guilty over this because I want so much to do so many things but I can't get myself to do any of them. 

I had a week off work and I did literally nothing, I couldn't get myself to get off the bed. This week the weather was amazing, and I wanted to take just a walk, but I ended up just playing video games instead.. I feel so bad about this, I just want to be productive but I can't, I want to eat healthier, exercise, but I can't. 

Ι haven't talked to anyone about this, but thank you kind stranger for reading this. "

My dog is dying and all I can do is watch,"He’s a big dog, but not too big—I’d say for his size, he’s awfully proportional. It’s cute, really, because he just seems to have been made right. His eyes, though jet black, always managed to light up along with his big, cheeky smile. It was adorable to watch. 

He’d have different haircuts throughout the seasons. When it’d get warm, we’d have his thick mane trimmed down to something more suited to the weather. He always looked like a too-big toy with too-cute fur afterwards, and for some reason, it just made sense.

I can’t say I spent a lot of time with him. I’d always see him around and I’d play with him every so often, but it was always an every-now-and-then arrangement. But the moments we shared, though few, are still very fond to me—he’d jump up on me even if I was dripping with sweat, or he’d just lay on the ground like a long, chunky loaf of dog.

A few days ago, he was diagnosed with distemper. Turns out his vaccinations had lapsed and we were none the wiser.

What sucks is that I know whom to blame, but I also know that I should have known. If only I’d cared more; if only I’d asked more questions; if only I’d nosed around; if only I had known.

He only has a couple of days left in him. We’re holding out hope but I can see that he can’t hold on for much longer. And now he breathes with shallow and faint breaths, legs and jaws scratching and biting imaginary playthings; his once-jolly smile replaced now by a gaunt look that reads nothing but silence.

I’m sorry, Lilo. You deserved better.

I’ll do right by you, buddy. "
I am sick of my addiction!,"I just ordered an other pair of shoes online to join my stock of nearly 20 unused shoes. I am obsessed with buying new shoes. Trekking, running, homeshies, high heels, flip-flops, boots, slippers...all kind of shoes. I don't buy anything else like cloths or so because my size keeps changing and since I realized, our foot size never changes, I dont even think second time when I see some nice pair of shoes. I want to stop buying them or waiting for them or trying them and being happy. because I feel it's too much. But i cant stop  😩"
I had my first one night stand last night and I’m filled with regret,"I’ve been in a relationship on and off for the past 3 years. My ex wanted to take another break and I told her I couldn’t do the “on and off” part any longer. So we broke it off and I told her if she ever makes up her mind we can be together then. 

This was only like 3 weeks ago. I’m still very much in love with her. And last night this girl came onto me and I was feeling lonely and confused. I was also kind of drunk so that didn’t help. 

The girl came back to mine and we hooked up. It wasn’t fun. It felt so impersonal, and I wasn’t even in to it. We only had actual sex for a minute or so until I said I couldn’t do it. I’m still too attached to my ex. She wasn’t very understanding, but she still slept over. 

I feel so guilty and gross this morning. I don’t even want to get out of bed but I have to because I want to wash my sheets and shower and pretend this never happened. But a lot of my friends saw so I know i can’t just pretend it didn’t happen. It feels like I cheated on my ex and I’m not even dating her any longer. "
I want a mom and dad so bad.,My parents were dead by the time I was 18. My mom died of breast cancer when I was 12 and my dad died of leukemia when I was 18. I’m 21 now and would say I’ve moved on from their deaths. It’s been really weird lately I’m extremely jealous of those around me who do have parents. I just want the safety you feel with parents who love you and I haven’t felt this way since I was 12 watching all my friends with their mothers. I’ve found myself looking online to see if I could “rent” a mom or dad. It’s really embarrassing. I don’t have anyone in my life I can say that has that type of role in my life. It’s just a hole in my heart. When I was a teenager I used to argue with my dad about moving out and getting out of town. He always told me that there would be nights I would just want to go home and sit in front of the fire. I want to go home so badly. I’m getting this off my chest because it’s making me vulnerable. It’s really gross and I’m ashamed of this but my deep need for parents has made me a target to older men. Or maybe I did this to myself. Whenever I meet an older person it’s like I latch on to them. These people don’t know or when they do they don’t care. It hurts and I want it to stop. 
My(17M)gf(17F) doesnt post photos of us on her IG because she wants to only post ''professional photos'' not selfies.," 

My gf has posted photos of us in the past but recently she tells me shes gonna post, then she says she needs to wait for a better time to post the photos for more likes, and then eventually she just never posts them.

Recently she told me she doesnt want to post selfies and wants a professional look for her insta, now she justs post portrait photos of her upper body. She doesn't show any cleavage in them.

Shes very self conscious about her likes and we realised once that when she posts a photo of us together she gets less than half the likes than when shes on her own.

This has been happening for quite a while, but it never really caught my attention too much.

Its weird because we are progressing really well in the relationship sex wise and even going on a picnic trip with her family and freinds on tuesday.

Its not really such a big deal but its has made me just a little bit sad, and now that I realised that she has done this like 3 times it just feels eh.

TLDR; gf wont post photos of us together and its made me a little bit sad."
My mom is always angry and I don’t know what to do,"My mom is always so angry all the time. I legit think she has a mental problem. She gets angry at the littlest things. She is always yelling at my dad and I. My sister is obviously her favorite too. She never yells at her, she’s the golden child.  But she always yells at us. My mom doesn’t have a job, but my dad works 10 hours a day. We are not the poorest, but nowhere near the richest ( I would say the working poor class). Her getting a job would definitely help our financial problems. But she is too lazy and doesn’t want to get a job. 

She goes to bed at 2am watching TV or on her phone, and wakes up around 11am each day. She doesn’t even cook anymore like she used too. She still does chores, I’m not saying she does absolutely nothing, but over the years she’s slowly gotten more lazy. My dad works 10 hours a day and has to come home and make his own food and do laundry and a lot of things. I mean the least my mom could do is make his life easier right? He has a hard job and it just stresses him out. If my dad complains my mom gets all mad and makes my dad feel like the bad guy. She’s always yelling at everything. If I forgot to text her I arrived at school, she’s yelling at my face about it. The problem is that she’s cussing too. She says so many things to my dad and I. I have seen my dad cry many of times cause of her and I cry just about every other day cause of her. I don’t know what her problem is. I want them to get a divorced so the yelling can just stop. I have two more years till I turn 18, but I can’t leave my dad with her.

Feel like I’m failing,I chose to do something to make money and I’m not making any. I’ve seen other girls do it and get paid but no not me. I feel like I failed and no one likes me enough in the adult industry. What am I doing wrong? 
How can I say this,"I saw this subreddit and got my anxiety skyrocketing because I remembered this time. So sit down and grab a snack. I was a ‘douchebag’ when I was 13, punch kids, curse a lot, act like I didn’t care even if the world exploded, smoked weed with friends, I was called stoneface because I was stoned a lot and didn’t show expressions. We were at the forest (me and 2 friends) we were listening to music (not new music but kinda like russian hardbass) we were eating some chips and just chilling and we saw a kid walking there. Full gucci and supreme and 10/10 fuckboy that would date chicks for sex. We were broke and decided. Lets rob that kid. My friend tapt on his shoulder and asked if he knew were ... was and then my other friend kicked him from behind in his back, I was a strong and big boy so I was last. I punched him so hard he fell on the grounds and hit his head on a rock. Uncouncious, I grabbed his chain from his neck when my guts just twisted and split open. No heart beat. I said nothing but soon they felt it to and we looked at each other with this face that screamed:oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck 100X. We burried him under the shed that we were chilling in. We didn’t stole anything afterwards we just left it with him. I still feel sorry and am really scared now but also feel better now I’ve told someone."
I've lost feelings for my girlfriend and I feel terrible about it,"First off I am going to establish who I a and who my gf is. I am a girl, and also a lesbian (obviously haha). While I want to act like this isn't a significant part of my life, and that my sexuality is no different than a striaght man...that isn't completely true. This will be relevant later. Also I am 18, my gf is 17 and we're both in our last year of highschool. This is pretty long, but if you want to skip some of it skip down to 'current time'. Or the TL;DR buuut I'm not very good at those so it is very vague. 

Alright so backstory (this part is not necessary to read, I feel it is somewhat relevant but not completely necessary):

Anyways, so I've technically known my girlfriend for years. Since grade 6. We went to different high schools, she never told me she was switching schools and while I wanted to stay in contact I'm very socially anxious (or was, I still am but I've gotten much better) so I never texted her since I had never texted her much beforehand. I honestly had a crush on her in grade 8 so it really hurt me that she left. To be fair though I was crushing on a lot of girls because I was desperate for any girl to like me since no one else I knew was gay. I hadn't even really fully realized I was gay yet. Anyways, 2 years later her high school closed down and merged with mine. Meaning we now went to the same school. She wasn't in any of my classes but I saw her through mutual friends. Just seeing her again rekindled my crush...I remember a specifically awkward moment where I asked to put my number in her phone and she asked me 'why'or something like that. Also lowkey flirting VERY awkwardly.Being a kind of eccentric and 'odd' person, along with being a girl, this behaviour was overlooked. Also I really do mean lowkey, it was not obvious at all. I didn't really expect anything to come of it, I was in the closet and didn't plan on out anytime soon. I didn' actually plan on acting on my feeling I just kind of hoped that everything would fall into place. I'm going to also bring up my best friend who I will call Chase. That's not his name and he doesn't even use reddit but I'm paranoid regardless. Chase didn't know I was gay (no one did) and I very much did not want to tell him, for a while I would play a game with myself where I would see how many gay jokes about myself I could make before people suspect something. I kind of wanted people to just know what I was instead of having to come out I guess. No one ever suspected anything somehow, but I stopped because I became actually very nervous about people finding out. I had a homophobic friend tell me that if I ever dated a girl she would stop talking to me, because that was disgusting. This just made me make more gay jokes around her out of spite but also realize that I could lose friends over this...and that not everyone is accepting. Some people will hate me. Also side note, my gf had come out to both of us as bi couple months after we all started hanging out. So me and Chase were hanging out and he mentioned some joke about me being gay, like an obvious non serious joke. I laughed at it for way too long and he just responded 'wait are you actually??' long story short I told him I wasn't ready to talk about it. I ended up telling him in the following days and it turns out he was bisexual also so I was very happy because I thought he was homophobic tbh from past comments he had made...which was just him covering his own ass so people wouldn't think he was gay. Also, my gf had appearently told him that she liked me, which lead to me telling him to urge her to just go for it.

Current time (aka the relevant part):

So we have been dating for a couple months. I don't even feel like we are dating. I feel as if we are just close friend and I feel like I have lost feelings...and I feel fucking terrible about it. I feel like shit saying this but I've never been super physically attracted to her, it was her 'personality' that got me interested. Now that I have had time to think, it wasn't that. She is a very kind person. But also she lets me ramble on about whatever I wanted to. No one usually let's me do that. I thought we had a lot in common, but we don't. She just let me talk about stuff I liked for hours on end so I assumed she liked that stuff too...but really she just didn't have anything to contribute/new conversation topics, as well as not telling me to be quiet. That has become a big problem. I feel like she can't talk to me. She is quiet, which is fine. I love being so close to people that silence between conversations is comforting. But she literally never starts conversations, she doesn't tell me anything about herself unless I pry, all our conversations are one sided and I hate it. I know this is bad, but the other day at lunch (at school) I'm usually the one that asks 'what's up?' 'how are you' 'what did you do last night?' but this is when I was growing tired of being the only one talking, so I said hello and just waited. For her to say something. My other friends we mostly on their phones today, whereas both of us usually don't do that so it was the perfect situation. She didn't say a thing to me besides a response to my hello. It made me feel sad because I felt like she wasnt interested in talking to me and instead just listened if I felt like talking about myself. I just wanted her to ask how I was, or how MY day had been instead of it always being the other way around. Or her only asking after I had asked first. 

I realized this was a dick move though, I can't be mad at her for something she doesn't even know she is doing wrong. I brought up to her that I felt like she seemed bored around me, and that at anytime she can talk to me. About anything. And that when I'm talking I like to here what she has to say. She said that she knew she appreciated that...but nothing changed. I vented to Chase, and to ask for advice. He decided to subtly bring it up to her, from his perspective (that he noticed she didn't really talk to me). I guess it wasn't subtle enough though because she texted me saying that the reason she is quiet sometimes is because she is nervous around me. This made me upset because I try to be very open and portray that she can be comfortable around me. I asked her what I could do, to make her feel safe around me but she just told me I wasn't doing anything wrong. After this text conversation I tthought she finally understood that it upset me more to NOT hear her talk. We planned to meet up this week, and we hung out for a while but nothing changed. At this point I was having another one sided conversation, doing everything I could to spark a good conversation. Asking things that would prompt most people to talk, but she is so vague with answers i have to pry basic information out of her and I feel like with my girlfriend I shouldn't have to do all this. For example: she is very into photography, it's one of her only interests so I try to talk about it a lot with her. I started talking about something to do with instagram. She mentioned something to do with having multiple accounts so I of course asked about them. She didn't really answer so I said I wanted to hear about it, were they photographe accounts? something else? They were a photography and lgbt page. I felt like I was being rude by prying but I just wanted to hear more about her interests, and talk about the pages she runs/posts on. Also I know shes lgbt(clearly) and likes photography so why wouldn't she want to show that off to me? This also prompted her to say she made one of my pictures her background. I was confused, and she took one of my photography pictures I took and made it her phone background. That's so sweet!! and I asked why she never told me, because I think that's really nice. She just said it never came up, even though we talk about photography a lot and she can just idk. Tell me things unprompted. Ive never asked anyone what their phone background is unless they show me. This got to the point where instead of me just trying to subtly and kindly express to her that she can feel comfortable around me, I just told her how I felt. 

I told her felt like a lot of conversations we had were one sided, and that felt I was always the one starting conversations as well. That conversations had to be balanced. She told me she was happy listening, but I told her I wasn't happy always talking. I like to just listen sometimes too. And I wanted to hear from her. She just responded that she legitimately didn't have anything to say. 

Before all this, on my birthday, she also basically invited herself to my house for a sleepover, I was very excited because I assumed she had something in mind. I wasn't expecting anything too big, like sexual of anything (my family was home). Just cuddling and falling asleep watching a movie or something. Nothing happened though. Idek why she wanted to come over, I would scoot really close to her. Like almost on top of her and she did nothing back.

Similarly, I grabbed her hand the other day and she was super awkward about it. She didn't grab my hand back or say anything really. 

Another thing that upset me but I couldn't bring it up to her since it was kind of my fault and also I needed to be supportive: she came out to her mom, and told her mom we were dating without really telling me. She had expressed that she wanted to come out to her mom. And also that she kind of wanted to tell her mom about us. She asked me what I thought of the idea, I said I don't think I really cared. When I got home from work about a week later I had gotten a text that just said 'I told my mom, she's okay with it'. I had a feeling what she was talking about but still asked what she had told her to be sure since I also didn't think she was the type of person to do that without telling me first. I know I told her I was fine with the idea, but that was it. It was an idea. She asked me what I thought about it, not if it was okay if she did. She also never told me she was doing it that night. It still kind of scares me that now that her mom knows she could tell my parents...but I also had to be proud of her for coming out to her mom and didn't want her to have negative feelings attached to a very important step for any lgbt person. I just wished she had texted me beforehand, or we waited until out relationship got more serious (since she could also just say she was bi, not that she was dating me). Ultimately though I should have probably expressed my thoughts more or told her not to do it anytime soon when she asked my opinion on it. Although I still dont understand why she couldn't have just called of texted me either. Idk. 

Being gay actually has turned out to be more relevant than I thought typing this out but the thing I had thought would be relevant to that was that jumping into relationships with the first other gay person you know, or crushing hard on the only other gay person you know is very common with lesbians. While I had had online relationships before this was a lot more 'real' so I'm going to count her as my first girlfriend (no offense go anyone in long distance relationships). The thing is, for a long time a lot of gay teens feel very alone. You don't know many, if any at all, people like you. Plus your dating pool is already very small. You feel like you'll be single and in the closet forever. So you think your in love when you finally meet someone that you can date, someone you never thought you would ever meet. It's very easy to mix up 'infatuation' and love. I never thought I would do this especially when I've heard other lgbt people speak about this online before. But I think that also played into my feelings unfortunately. 

One more thing to add, is her mom only let's her hang out once a week. I don't know why. It is just what she says whenever she is asked to make plans more than once a week (although we hung out twice this week when I urged her to ask her mom once she initially said she wouldn't be allowed and her mom said yes). I've asked why her parents have this rule, she says she doesn't know. I've asked her a couple times to ask why but she hasn't given me an answer. Once Chase asked her to hang out while they were on the phone and he swears when she got up to go ask her mom he heard her still in the same room. Her parents don't care about her grades, and I would understand if she had chores to do or something. It just comes across as an excuse, but idk. I can't really know unless I straight up ask her mom which would be pretty rude. 

I feel so shitty about this whole thing. I know she still loves me a lot. She wrote me a note on valentines day that still makes my heart flutter. I remember being so happy when I found out she liked me. But I can't ignore how I feel about this as a whole. I feel like I lead her on, and I know it's going to hurt her when I say I think we should take a break and be friends for a little longer and maybe pick up the dating thing again when we get closer. Although I don't even know if that will happen...but I don't actually want to break up. Because I still love her but..ugh! It's just all so complicated :(. A year ago I dreamed about this, and I feel I'm being selfish by throwing it all away. I know I can't force myself to love someone but I still feel so bad. I haven't told her about taking a break yet, I won't see her until Monday and realized I had to do this on Friday when I last saw her. I want go do this on person and didn't want her worrying all weekend if I said 'we need to talk' but can't say about what until days after. I want to stay friends with her and I feel like I'll make things awkward. And make her mom hate me for hurting her, or even worse make her hate me.

TL;DR All my conversations with my gf are one sided, and it has caused me to lose feelings. Also it feels more like a close platonic friendship than a romantic one. And i feel fucking terrible about it. 


Thank you if you actually read this whole thing. Ultimately though I think I just needed to type this all out. I don't need validation, I'm not a victim here but I'm also not a bad person...of a good person. Ugh. Just needed to get it all off my chest.

My best friend is going through a rough time right now but I don’t think I’m good at helping people get through tough moments,"She recently had an emergency medical surgery, moved into a new home, has been struggling financially and her mother has been diagnosed with cancer. My friend is very resilient and barely seeks emotional help so when she tells me about stuff like this, I feel like I don’t know what to say and I feel like a horrible friend. She never makes me feel like I’m a bad friend but I wish I was better at putting my thoughts and feelings into words but I never really know what to say. I wish I can take all the pain and upset away from her."
How I remain friendly and easy going,"My friends always ask how I can be upbeat, positive and nice to everyone all the time. It’s really not that hard. I follow a few basic rules and the rest just falls into place. The first and most important rule is to not let you emotions control you. For any big decision under no circumstance make it while either angry or horny. 2nd rule, Masterbate one to two times a day to take the edge off. Rule 3, bottle up all your emotions and don’t tell people how you really feel. Of course sharing your feelings is important but don’t overburden your friends with your neurotic thoughts. Rule 4, when you can’t fall asleep at night because all you think about is how much you hate yourself, remember that you won’t kill yourself because you couldn’t burden your loved ones. Then cry yourself to sleep. Rule 5, go out for breakfast because you lasted till morning. "
I’m probably the reason why my mother is unhappy and possibly traumatized.,"today was my 20th birthday and my mother had an emotional outburst over something that happened w dad in the morning. i wish i had the energy to detail everything that happened but I don’t. but essentially I found out that my mother has been emotionally and psychologically abused by my grandma/her MIL, been through a certain degree of emotional neglect from my father. she admitted that the only thing keeping her tied to this family was me being born and she’s enduring because of me. I feel horrible for not never realizing all of this. she’s been shielding me all along but I just.....never noticed or cared to realize and I feel like a terrible piece of shit. 

she didn’t mean it to guilt trip me, but I feel guilty nonetheless. if I wasn’t born, maybe she would have had the freedom to leave a marriage that hurt her so much and do something else she wanted. I’m a mistake, and I didn’t want to text anyone this irl because I don’t want be a burden more than I already have been. my chest feels like exploding tho and if you’re reading this I appreciate it. "
Played off attempted suicide as a joke,"This happend a while ago so the details may be a bit fussy. Sorry about that
So i go to a high school where i would need to walk about 5 to 10 minutes to get to the bus stop and on the way there you'd need to cross 2 or 3 streets. On my way back i used an alternative route (right in front of the town library so people saw). I knew there was traffic and had noticed that there was one old man who'd speed through every week or so. I tried catching him 5 times before that but failed. This time i didn't so i intentionally walked down the narrow street when i saw his car coming. If he hadn't pushed down on the breaks so hard I'd probably be dead now.
He only reacted with slight anger but didn't come out of his car.
I know it's selfish to push my death onto another but I really didn't care before and I still don't really. The only thing that changed is that the man doesn't use that street anymore. At least I don't see him. "
I texted my ex last night when I was drunk and now I want to crawl in a hole.,"Caption says it, big mistake. Don’t remember much of it bc I’ve gotten into the habit of deleting things right after it happens. 

I love him, and I want to be with him even though I ended it myself... I just see the value you in him now. I know we broke up for a reason, and I have to be my own independent person but I still love and miss him..... 

I want to cry and crawl in a hole right now. "
Feeling empty and sad even though my life is going great,"Recently I graduated college, and been on a job hunt for about a month now. In all honesty it has been going great, I have had two second interviews with two different companies, so most likely I’ll be having a job by April. Companies I’ve had interviews are very positive about me and seem to have great interest in hiring me. I have a loving boyfriend, loving family, my financial situation is (considering the situation) really stable and I have many friends whom also love me for who I am.

Nonetheless, the last month I’ve been feeling empty, sad, incomplete. It almost feels like I’m falling into a depression... nothing seems to satisfy me anymore. In some way I feel worthless and Idk what to do with my life. Something in me just doesn’t want to live it anymore. Im clueless about why I’m feeling like this. I didn’t have any traumatic experiences in life, I’ve had a great childhood, so I’m completely clueless....

Its almost like theres a void inside of me and I dont know how to fill it up... I try to keep myself busy but the void just seems to get more noticeable...

Does anybody have had the same experience?
Or any tips?"
Why I think I don’t have feelings for people (I want to know if it’s just a stage of my life or I have something else),"(I’m new with this so I’m gonna take my time). I’m 15 years old, i have a brother and my mom and dad are happily married, I don’t feel good or connected to people, when my best friend died when I was a kid I couldn’t cry, when my third brother died before being born, I also couldn’t die. I don’t know if this is because of how our culture has given death a minor impact but I just can’t feel bad or cry about people, and the only times I got into tears is when I feel like I disappoint my parents. 
To give some back story about this, since I was a kid my parents always told me to do my best effort, which meant a 10/10 or 20/20 (in past times) but when my grades started getting lower they started to shout at me whenever I got a low grade (they never gave a physical punishment, something I appreciate) but I still felt bad about that and because I never got a low grade before I was a littler explosive about that topic. After some time I got to overcome that problem but my parents still pressed this topic over and over again something that got me a little into hating them.
Second thing. I can’t hate people because I think that... well I’m just angry for some time and then I forget it.

Then I did the worst thing I could do, I stole money from them, I... don’t know why I did it but I just started doing it and I couldn’t stop. Then, they caught me, and I got punished by them taking my phone and going to a psychiatrist.
Now they don’t trust me and they live in their lie of my family being the perfect family always trying to be such a superficial. And I hate myself cause I can’t tell them whenever I don’t want to do something because it’s their house and their rules, so now whenever I’m angry I punch something or use reasoning to remember why is it not right to get angry (because it is not productive), I... don’t know what to do to continue like this and once I graduate and leave the house never talk to them again or continue faking this lie till they die"
Just found out my school teacher had a crush on me,"This is really weighing me down today.

A few weeks ago I met up with an old school teacher for dinner. I’m almost 40 and he’s almost 80. We remained in touch after I left school, in fact he keeps in touch with many ex pupils, he loves to see how they are and where life is taking them. I always thought it was a cute thing to do. 

Our paths have crossed in a professional sense since I left school too, and he still substitute teachers and has similar creative hobbies to me. 

So we were having dinner, just catching up like old friends do, and he’s a bit drunk, and he tells me he had a crush on me when I was in school. He corrected himself and said when I was 16-18, (the legal age of consent in my country is 16, but you are still classed as a child). I laughed it off because I was totally freaked out. I told him it was weird, but... ok. We moved on and he started talking about his wife who he was with back when I was at school and who has since died.

This guy is a pillar of the community, he is loved by what seems like everyone. I adored him (in a platonic sense)

And now I feel weird. Totally messed up. I feel almost protective for the childhood me. I feel angry. I don’t have children, but if I had children that age I know I’d go mental. I haven’t told my husband about this and now I feel like this is a major thing I need to tell him. I have some professional work things lined up with this guy this year. I don’t know what to do?

I keep trying to tell myself it was an innocent thing, I was ‘off age’, he didn’t actually do anything, I’ve never felt unsafe around him before. I don’t feel unsafe now.

But I do kinda feel a bit violated. 

It’s so weird and my head is a mess."
Saw my dad cry for the first time cause of my sister,"I’ve NEVER seen my dad cry in my life, he’s a big burly guy who’s worked construction most his life and tends not to show emotion , growing up I knew he loved me but he never showed much affection and vice versa but I know he cares. Recently my sisters been causing some problems in the house , she’s always the trouble maker and me and my mom are damage control, I know my dad would never hit her but his temper is pretty  bad and so is hers so it’s just recipe for disaster. Today she said she wanted to go to Mexico with her friend over the summer , she just turned 16 so my parents understandably don’t want two young girls travelling alone and of course they’d be paying for most of it. Basically things got very heated and my dad said something about how her cousins were so well behaved , my sister hates being compared to people so she looked at him and said “why don’t I compare you to other dads, you’ve been working construction for the past 10 years , your so slow that you can’t even move up because you don’t know how to do basic math, everyone’s dad works office jobs and you couldn’t even go to college, your just insecure mom makes more than you.” There was a lot more anger and swearing involved but I prefer not to add that in. My dad had a lot of difficulty with school , he’s a smart guy but academically he was behind in the learning curve and it was a struggle for him to get his high-school diploma, my moms a nurse and my dad could get a bit insecure like our mom always helping us with our homework cause my dad couldn’t, But how could you say that to him, he worked so hard to give us everything , I know he hates his job but he wakes up every morning working 50+ hours a week cause he wants to put his kids through college and have the education he didn’t. After saying this she went upstairs with my mom, and my dad just sat at the kitchen table with his back to me. He sat there for a while and then I heard him start to cry, and all I could say was “sorry dad.”  Everyone’s gone to sleep but I can’t fall asleep I keep thinking about what happened and I know my sister feels bad but she’s too scared to apologize. "
We let my mom’s husband’s ex wife live with us for a while.,"She became homeless and needed a place to stay so my mom let her live in our basement. When I moved out, she lived in my old room. I cleaned out EIGHT yard sized garbage bags out of my room of her stuff and her dogs’ poop. We had to remove a carpet because her dogs peed on it so much and the hallway still smells like pee. Now I’m FIVE trash bags into cleaning the basement and I just feel overwhelmed with anger. She lived here rent free for eight months, and she has disrespected us like this. Now she comes over every singe day to either visit or pick up her kids that get off the bus at our house despite her living where they can get off at her house. We tried talking to her about this stuff and she said, “all I left was a coat and an umbrella.” I’m so mad because I can’t clean for very long due to my back problems and I’m the only one who lives here that cares."
Doesn’t anyone have manners anymore????,"Went to see Captain Marvel last night with my boyfriend , daughter and her girlfriend. Spent close to $70 on tickets and concessions. We went in fully aware that since it’s opening weekend the theater would probably be packed and a bit noisy. BF and I sat in the way back, the girls sat near the front. BF and I ended up lucky enough to have 6 middle school kids in front of us and two older couples on either side of our seats. 
We laughed at the middle schoolers antics through the commercials and previews figuring they’d quiet down once the movie started.
Spoiler alert!
They never stopped talking or shoving each other. I asked, super politely, for them to please be quiet as I couldn’t hear the dialogue. They stopped for about 30 seconds. Then the couple on my left started whispering... and didn’t stop. 
I actually left an hour into the movie to get an employee. I’ve NEVER done that. I hate confrontation. I was so livid I was shaking. The employees response? He came in and told the kids to hush...
The kids never stopped, the couple next to me never stopped. Captain Marvel may not be super deep but I have no fucking clue what went on for the first 90 minutes of the film because these people couldn’t be bothered to shut up!! 
And of course BF is pissy at me now because once the lights came up he asked me how I liked the movie. I said (a little louder than necessary but NOT yelling) “I’d have probably liked it if I could’ve heard it over the rude, disrespectful little shits in front of us!” 

I mean seriously, what is so fucking hard about putting your cell phones away and being quiet once a movie starts? If you can’t handle not talking for 2+ hours, maybe you should opt to wait till it’s on Netflix."
21 years down the drain,"I started working young like 12 years old young.   Off the books work to pay board for my horse.  That grew into a 21 year career in animal care.  

The last 6 years I spent working for a rural animal shelter.  What I'm about to share is purely my opinion on how I was bullied out of my job and how my passion was destroyed.  

In the last 6 years I was employed at this place I had been through 5 shifts in power!! Directors stepped down,were fired, or we just ran without one. 

The actual staff was and still is AMAZING!  We had one director in particular who pulled the shelter out of its lowest point and actually had it running and holding it's own with some of the top shelters in the state.  This director took over following a PR nightmare surrounding a director arrested for animal cruelty. This director had us running at ""no kill status"" raised employees wages to actual living wages.  Our adoption rate skyrocketed and our community image was the best it's ever been. 

Unfortunately for some unknown reason our board didn't like this.  They were on a mission to get this director out. This director  ended up resigning suddenly. After the resignation two board members started running the place. 

They instantly started causing tension, granted tension comes with every shift in power.  These two board members would start drama between staff members.  They hired in hand picked employees while telling existing staff the former director left us broke and we couldn't afford raises or staff.  Policies were changed day to day or moment to moment depending on what board member you dealt with.  Often times employees would be cornered when leaving, alone. Verbal weight was thrown around. "" do you even want your job?"" "" I can shut this place down with one phone call""  asking for information on co workers. Offers of pay raises or company phones.   Advice/opinions would be asked then totally disregarded.   Nice to your face or around others belittling and low key legal harassment alone.  Never crossing into hostile work environment but on the line and only a matter of wording.  If they made mistakes it was blamed on the staff.  Even if it was directly due to a policy change they made. 

I had been promised a promotion and pay raise the week before the directors resignation. That was immediately pulled. These board members had previously attacked my job several months prior so I knew my time was limited. 

I began job hunting while still doing my job as well as many aspects of the promotion pulled from me. I blocked both board members from my personal social media, years earlier.  I was vocal on this social media about looking to change careers.    These board members found someone who was willing to screen shot private posts to them.  Totally legal what's put on social media is never actually private understand that. Personally I feel it's immoral but whatever. I never spoke poorly of my job or the board members.  I cited burnout for my want to change careers.   The board members in question would corner co workers and ask about me and if it was professional of me?  When co workers would tell them to talk to me or offer to get me eyes were rolled and they would claim not to want to talk to me. They would constantly text my company phone after hours questioning everything and anything that had happened that day. Often times for hours at a time.  They expected me to act as a manager all while telling me they were dissolving my current position and had no intentions of promoting me.   I was a manager when blame needed to be placed but when praise was due I was nothing with no job security. 

I fully intended to speak with them, to cite my burnout and discuss my plan to change careers. That I would like to stay until I found employment as I was the only staff member well versed in our contracts with city/county. As well as rules and regulations regarding animal care/welfare with the department of agriculture. Any time I tried to have this conversation I was ignored/pushed off or privacy was not granted to speak with them without hand picked staff members in the office. 

One morning I came in and the staff was buzzing that the night before they were yet again questioning coworkers about me. I'm a single mom and had taken time off due to kids with the flu. I cashed out all my sick time and PTO to cover my Check for that.  They flat out asked our office manager to not allow me to use that time. When told she legally couldn't as I had earned it eyes were rolled.  A comment was made that I would be let go anyway.    I immediately texted a resignation as of course neither was in the office turned in my keys wiped my company phone and left.  It was just to much and my mental health was not doing well.  I'm diagnosed with anxiety depression and PTSD.  My mental health is worth more then any paycheck.  

Days later I was informed they are being very vocal at social get togethers about me.  How I was a terrible employee. Not reliable and lazy.   Funny seeing as I was the only employee for the past 3 years on call 24/7.  Spent hurricanes on the shelter floor with my kids. Ect.  Our city is small and rumors fly.  

I have many interviews lined up in the coming days and most jobs I'm applying for start out at a higher pay rate then I was making after 6 years. 

I would love to go to the media and blast them, I would love to shit talk publicly like they are.  Instead I'm closing a chapter and moving on. Any talk I do would only hurt the image of the shelter and in turn hurt the animals.  My employers treated and continue to treat the staff as less then the animals they care for. 

This is my post to get it off my chest so I can fully close this chapter and move on.  I know my reputation has taken a hit and I know that will linger.  I do however know I've been brought down before and fought my way back up.  

Please excuse typos new phone that I'm not familiar  with yet.  "
I hate my life and nothing makes me happy because i can't have the girl that i want.,"Of course there are lots of things that i may want but i don't have. Must of us do. But nothing makes me more depressed and angry than being deprived of the girl who i sincerely love. Nothing makes me more jealous to see the girl who i love with other guys. Nothing else could make me happy without her. Even if i become a billionaire, my life wouldn't be happy enough without her. Why do i love her so much? Because she is such a fun, talkative, outgoing and beautiful, cute girl in a unique way. She can sing and she is really good at it. Who is she? You may have heard her name. Miley Cyrus. Yes. You may have heard about all of those stalker guys who sneak into celebrity girls' houses and get arrested soon. But my situation is more intense and serious than all of them. I love her ""from the bottom of my heart"". I adore her. I need to put it up this way to make it clear. I love everything about her. I am sure that i could hang out 24/7 with her non stop and not get tired of it. It doesn't matter how hard i try and what therapy and medicine i use or what hobby i stick to, i can't forget her. No other girl could replace her for me. I want her so badly. I really want to get her attention. I comment on every single post she makes on social media and particularly Inatagram and try some methods to keep my comments on top of the comment section to make them be easily visible. Maybe she has seen my comments. I don't know. But for sure thousands of her fans aready noticed me and they are shocked by it. I've tried to get her phone number to call her. There are some premium websites that give celebrities contact info in exchange for money. I am going to try them soon. Damn. I would make all my way to the place if it's necessary. Yeah these are parts of my crazy actions and plans and i am really serious about. It gets even worse when i see that she flirts with other men and i am being ignored here. I see her boyfriends, co workers, reporters, interviewers and even random fans and folks hugging and kissing and taking pictures with her and she fancies them and flirts with them and makes their whole life probably. But when it comes to me people say that i should leave her alone and stop stalking her and seek mental help or end up in jail. This is not what i deserve. This is not fair. I am not less than any of those guys. I can't just see her getting used for their fun and joy while i am just here watching and dying with hate and anger and a sick jealousy that is killing me from inside. My jealousy arises from the inferiority complex that i have. I see how insignificent, pointless and pathetic my life is compared to some other men. Compared to what i really want and deserve. Death is better than a life like this. I wish that i could hug her so tightly and tell her how much i love her. I wish that i could at least talk to her even if it's online or on the phone or video call or in any way and tell her about my feelings. I swear that even talking to her for a few minutes could change my whole life. It could change a lot of things about me. It could save me. I don't wan't to take all of my wishes with myself to grave. I feel sick. The only way for curing my sickness is talking to her. My love for her is not a illness on it's own. It's a strong natural desire that has turned into a problem. But it causes illnesses such ad depression and anxiety. So curing these illness is not possible as long as the root exists. Even if my obsession is a mental problem, there is no way to cure this in any way except talking to Miley. Lots of people said that they want to help me but i say the only help i need is the help that would lead me to Miley. I want to talk to her. I promised myself that i'd do whatever it takes and use any tool and method to get to her. Sometimes i cry for her. Sometimes i feel so hateful and angry and i want to take revenge from anyone and anything that stops me from reaching her. Sometimes i want to end my own pathetic life and free myself from all of these troubles and pains. I am tired. I hate this damned life."
why do people always have to stick their nose into my love life when they literally know nothing about us,"lmfao so many people have said that me & my bf’s relationship is creepy/gross just because of our 4 year age difference but theyve never even met him or know how our relationship is like. the only thing people know about us is our age gap and they just take that on TINY piece of information and assume that our relationship is toxic and that i need to escape as soon as possible. it was consensual and not gross when i was 17 and its the same now that im 18. no, im not being manipulated and no, theres no power play going on because of age and no, he didnt specifically look for a high school to date because he has some weird fetish. we just met, became friends, and grew to love each other. he didnt even know how old i was at first. he makes me so fucking happy and hes so loving and sweet and honest. i can always rely on him and i feel closer to him than anyone else in the world. 

honestly when i look at the mess people at my hs are in when they start dating each other it makes me 1000x more sure that im happy where i am because i wouldnt trade any boy anywhere regardless of age for my bf ever.

Paper waste in establishments,"I’m all for reducing paper waste in any kind of establishment. But this one is mainly about food establishments. It’s allergy season and I need to blow my nose. I’m not going to blow my nose in a napkin in a room where tons of people are eating. I’ll politely go to the restroom and blow it. Well how am I supposed to do that when they only offer hand dryers and no tissues, and the only place I get something to blow my nose is in the toilet paper in the occupied bathroom stalls. Should I just blow snot rockets in the sink? I think if you’re only gonna offer hand dryers (which is ok In my book) at least offer tissues. "
I'm fed up with running linux and also life at this point.,"It is brandished everywhere that Linux runs pretty well on old computers. I've jumped two distros. Both sucked. I know this seems not so emotional. I've been frustrated for a long time.

There are never any solutions. Somethings actually run better on Windows. Asking around in Reddit is a waste of time. All I can get is some condescending reaction. 

Everything is slow. I can't seem to do anything about that. I can't run applications. There are just tons of bugs.

Well enough about my PC.

**I need a outlet from whatever that is bugging my life. I don't have many friends. Nothing interests me. I like avoid everything and live inside a shell. I talk to myself. I like being alone. I don't have any love for life nor any ambition. I just wanna die at any given chance. To avoid all that frustates me, I suppress my emotions. I don't express much. I cry contemplating myself. I just want an outlet. The outlet being some tv show, some movie, some book, or a PC game. But I already hate using phone. I mostly be on my PC. When I need my PC to refrain from confronting myself. It refuses to work. It's been like this for years. It just gets stuck running and in finally without any solution I would hit my laptop like a lunatic until it turns off. I'm surrounded by dead ends. I just want to die. Fuck living.**

I Feel Trapped Here,"I guess I should set up some background on this. I am in my last year of university and it has been kind of rough. From the get-go, I had a hard time finding the type of housing that was right for me. I was approached by one of my current roommates on my school's Facebook page for housing. It seemed like a decent deal at first. Cheaper rent, a short walk to campus, nice amenities, etc. The only issue was that I had some conflicts with the girl I was sharing the room with. At one point, she didn't speak to me for a week because she did not like the arrangement of the beds. She didn't tell me that one of our roommates was her boyfriend. I also didn't realize that I was going to be the only one to call in maintenance when it's needed. I don't mind the last part since I'm hardly there to do much in regards to cleaning most of the apartment. But I'm not there most of the time because it just feels awkward. Ever since the silent week, I haven't felt comfortable living in the place that I am currently at.

&#x200B;

A couple of weeks ago, I got an opportunity to start an internship in a city that's not too far from where I am now. The only trouble is that I don't have a car or access to real transportation, so I would have to move closer to the area. This is my chance out of the awkward situation I was set in these past 7-8 months. I told my roommates that I would have to be moving out of the apartment somewhat soon in order to start the position in the next couple of weeks. They would only have to come to the leasing office with me to sign me off the lease. They haven't been very receptive to the news and it makes me wonder if they're even going to sign me off. I've gotten text messages that have seemed to be passive aggressive in my eyes, so it feels as though they're going to try and get me to stay with them. It's very tortuous and somewhat cruel. It's been a couple of weeks now. I've been trying to get us together to sign me the lease, but they seem to be mad at me. I already have a place lined up, people helping me move, etc., but my ""freedom"" is contingent on them signing me off. As the days continue, it feels further and further away.

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I've never felt comfortable in my current living situation. Now, I have the opportunity I've been looking for and my roommates just have to sign me off the lease. I don't know if they'll do it though."
What’s wrong with me.,I feel like I’m having a mental breakdown and I really don’t want to live this life anymore. It’s just too tough I can’t do it. 
I killed my cat and feel nothing but guilt.,"I recently split with a long term partner and had a heated argument Thursday just gone. I was so upset I put my youngest to bed at 8pm and told my eldest I was going to bed too and to call the cats in just before she does too. 

(I should explain at this point I do not blame her she is just 12. I am the adult and it my responsibility to look after the children AND animals. I failed by being selfish and crying at the break up and knowing a big storm was coming.)

Friday morning came round, my daughter set off for school before I had woke, I get my son to school and as I was still upset over the break up, put food down for my 3 cats and went out for a drive to try clear my head, I didn't realise my ginger boi was missing at this point.. I came home, looked through my kitchen window and noticed the fence panels I had stacked up against a wall had blown down in the back garden, I thought I would leave them there as the storm had set in bad by now and they would only blow down again.. My children had gone straight to the ex partners for the weekend and the evening rolls round, that's when I notice ginger cat hasn't come in.  I call and call, no sign.. I finally give up at 1am and call it a night.

Saturday (yesterday), I get up, make coffee and go outside still calling for my cat, I move 3 panels over thinking the worst, I didn't see no sign of him. I go out into the estate and start calling for him like a woman possessed. I put a plea up on Facebook to look for him and messaged everyone I could think of. Evening rolls round, my other 2 cats are looking depressed, I put it down to the storm. Still no sign of Simba, I have that gut wrenching feeling - he doesn't go far, he'd be home by now. 

Today, I over sleep and wake up at 11. I have a message from a friend asking about the cat, I tell him I have a horrible feeling he is under the other fence panels I didn't pick up. I tell him I'm going to have another look and thanks for asking.. I actually stop what I was doing and alarm bells start ringing in my head to go look under the other fence panels right that moment.. I move 5 out of the way, I get to the 6th and see my ginger boi lying underneath as I pick it up, I launch it out of the way and collapse screaming ""FUCK"" over and over, I kneel in closer and stroke it's head, the realisation sets in he could have been there since Thursday night/early hours Friday. I'm hysterical. I run in the house and phone my ex, it was his cat as much as mine. My ex arrives and buries the cat, he tries to reassure me it's not my fault.. but I just cant help this feeling of guilt. I tell my friend he was under the panels (I also feel awful for dragging him into ""finding the dead body with me""..although, he wasn't physically there) 

I'm having terrible thoughts about how long my cat was stuck there, how long did it take him to die, I sincerely hope it was quick but it looked like a struggle..  I can't stop picturing my cat being fucking sandwich by fence panels and suffering unimaginable pain and no one there to comfort him.

 WHY DID I HAVE TO BE SO SELFISH AND GO TO BED EARLY THURS, WHY COULDN'T I BE A FUCKING ADULT AND ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ANIMALS. ABSOLUTELY FUCKING HATE MYSELF RIGHT NOW. 


TLDR: I left my cat out thurs night and went to bed early, knew there was a storm coming and had a gut feeling he was dead under fallen down fence panels (on sat), didnt fully move them all until today. Now torturing myself over cats death.

My boyfriend isn’t husband or father material yet I want a family with him.,"Me & my boyfriend have been together for a while now (3 1/2) so you know obviously I’ve brought up marriage & starting a family more then a few times. He doesn’t really like kids & gets awkward around them. He doesn’t know how to approach them, talk to them, hold them, play with them correctly for their age. I don’t know 1 person that has been together this long & doesn’t already have a kid or is at least engaged. He did get me a promise ring but I had to talk him into it for a while plus I got him his first(which he has only wore it 6-7 times since I got it for him last April.. I want a baby before my mid 20’s. But he gets annoyed & tells me that he never thinks about our future. I got pregnant a month before I turned 19 & had a miscarriage due to my rare blood type. He was mad I was carrying our baby & asked me every day for the short 2 months I was pregnant to get an abortion. I was devastated. I was physically, emotionally & financially ready for him or her. He didn’t shed a tear after that life changing night I lost our baby. We have different long term life goals. I love him but I don’t know what to do."

Something I've wanted to say for awhile,"When I was a freshman in High School, I met a girl that I fell in love with almost instantly. I talked to her for months, got her number and did all the typical relationship build up stuff. We ended up getting into a relationship, and our feelings only got more intense from there. I seriously loved her more than any girl I have ever met, even now. She ended up breaking up with me out nowhere. I say out of no where because the weekend before, we went on a date and made out after. It felt normal. Something I should mention is that she was a junior at the time, and she broke up with me because of the age gap. That happened right before summer, that same summer my Grandma died. I was alone and depressed for a whole summer. That sense of loneliness changed me, and is something I wouldn't wish on anyone.

&#x200B;

Fast forward, and I'm getting ready to be a senior in high school. I still think about her, even though its been 3 years. Its not like I have feelings for her or anything, it's just kinda like the memories are always just kinda sitting there waiting around. Anytime I go somewhere, or smell something that reminds me of her I just can't help but fall down the rabbit hole.  Sometimes at night I think about the times we spent lounging around all day, making out. I just don't really know how to feel anymore. Sometimes I can go weeks without even remembering, and other times I go days only thinking about her. It feels like no one is gonna live up to what we had, and no one is gonna be as good as her. Again its not like I have feelings for her, if given the chance to get back with her I'd say no. I just hate not being able to give my all in a relationship anymore, because of this. I gave away a piece of me, I don't know if I'll ever get back.

Friends i guess,"i had two friends in elementary. They've been my best friends for.. i dunno how long. Then came the big question, 'where do you want to go to high school and what do you want to do?' . I chose grammar school(some languages call them gymnasiums) while they chose engineering. when we talked about our choices, they were so fucking biased you wouldn't believe it. nothing came from it and we were still best buds. We used to have really long conversations and they were ALWAYS trying to push their agenda of me being inferior when it came to education. Friendship and relationships in general are about respecting each other right? because of these situations, i feel like they've lost respect.

Now, one of those friends had a birthday party yesterday, and it somehow came to 'ye olden times' before high school and all that shit. Fuck elementary school. Fuck everything that happened there. Again to no surprise, agenda time.

F1: I liked you better when we were in elementary(other one agrees)

Me: (little shocked) People change i guess

F1: No(some bullshit i don't remember, i zoned out but it was something about me being inferior and all that)

Me: OkF2: I fucking hate the people that go to gymnasiums, now you better behave( still don't fucking know what he meant) or i'm'ma beat the living shit out of you and i'm gonna enjoy every second of it(and descriptions of how he would be doing that)

Me: (really uncomfortable, jokingly say) Yeah sure let go of me dude.

conversation ends, we go downstairs to the party. and it struck me. they liked me for being spineless, not being able to talk back. I grew a spine and they don't like that. I changed, i know that, but i don't know if they're still friends.

And its eating me up, the fact that I'm an alien to them. I thought they knew me. I thought we were going to support ourselves. i need help. I really don't know what to do now.
EDIT: grammar stuff"
I (21M) am resentful that it seems that people have lots of casual sex before getting married,"I (21M) go to university. I'm of Indian background. Born and raised here in the UK, my dad is Indian but was also born/raised in the UK. My mother is also Indian but she was born and raised in India, and her marriage to my father was arranged. She came to England 28 years ago, also it wasn't a forced marriage or anything, as it stands they've been happily married since. My mum is definitely ''westernized'' now (has a 'broken' English accent now) and works alongside my dad running a business but when came to England she couldn't speak a lick of English.

Now I went to my cousin's (27F) wedding recently. She's marrying another Indian dude (30M) who was born/raised here in UK.

As I was at the wedding function, I couldn't help but look around me and see my cousins' friends and my own extended family and I zoned in on the people close to my cousin's age (late 20's/early 30's). **When I looked at them, I kept thinking ''Wow these people are married now or getting married....but when they were in Uni 10 years ago, they were probably sleeping around a lot and having fun and now have settled down.** I then visualized them at their own respective universities, having one night stands.

It made me feel very resentful when I came to that realization, because I've only had sex ONCE at university (from a drunken one night stand). The rest of the time, I just wasn't confident enough to go through with the missed opportunities.

But anyway, once I had that showerthought, I felt very resentful and angry. Especially towards my cousin and her new husband, I had no feelings of good will towards them. I hated being at that wedding and I hated being surrounded by extended family who had their casual/sex fun. Basically I felt inferior.

I think when I get married, I might just get my parents to arrange my marriage to a virgin Indian woman from India (which is what my mother was), rather than get arranged with an Indian woman here in the UK, because Indian women in the UK have slept around a lot at uni, and that would make me feel insecure because I'd feel inferior.

Dear M,

&#x200B;

I love you. Always. That sounds cheesy, I know. If this were a loveletter, I wouldn't have written it right at the beginning. But it is not a love letter, I just wanted to clarify. Nevertheless, it's about us and what we are. You are the person I have shared most of my life with. It always felt like we were meant to be right from the start. Meant to be side by side for the rest of our lives. Meant to dance under trees and lie on rooftops and talk about whatever comes up, because everything makes a little sense when you are around.

Most days I felt like we might be more. I liked carrying you around in the swimming pool, drinking hot chocolate together in a cafe full of dates and looking into your eyes really quietly. I liked how your sheets smelled, even when you hadn't washed them for weeks. I liked the idea of getting old together and kissing in the old-people's-home.

I know that's not going to happen. Please don't even imagine it. Don't try to understand and find yourself tempted to tell me you want it, too. I don't want it anymore. The only reason I mentioned it, is to clarify in which way I liked you, since you always call me pragmatic. (And since people around you seem to confuse affection with touching you once and running away.) I loved you madly for all those years. We once kissed when we were 14 and didn't talk for a year. We only reconnected after assuring eachother we were over it. But I was never over it and you have noticed by now.

I suspect it must have been a baby elephant in the room growing slowly over time. When did you realize that I loved you? And when did you decide to lead me on? How far would you have gone?

I was planning to send you a confession letter eventually, but now I'm glad that I never did. Last weekend, when I visited you in the new flat for the first time, it all started to crumble. You read my fortune and I read yours. They spoke tales of passion. You played your song and lit candles in the dark. You made me answer the 36 scientifically approved questions that make two people fall for eachother. But you never asked me how I was doing. You fell asleep while I had a panic attack right next to you. You left me alone with your diary. I know I never should have read it and I beg your pardon, but I'm glad I did.

It opened my eyes. You never loved me when we were 14 and you surely don't now. You never loved anything but the attention, the idea of having that special someone. And you are desperately trying to fill that empty seat with whoever is available and withstands your trial. I was available, I read my name in a list of individuals deemed ""intelligent people I can have great conversations with"". Still, you wrote you ""weirdly never felt a spark"". So now you're forcing it.

I don't want to interfere with your soulmate search, but let me tell you this. You're looking in the wrong places. Love doesn't grow from intelligence, neither from applying pressure. I admired you out of empathy and I knew it was real affection, because I *didn't* care about your looks or your performance or your school grades. I just liked your being as a whole, with every flaw and every bad decision. I never thought of you as perfect. But I thought I knew you. I can see through most of the fakeness you tend to put up sometimes. But I thought you were perfect for me. I even found my feelings confirmed and validated by the fact I'd support you unconditionally. By the fact I valued having you as a friend and keeping you in my life rather than trying to get into your bed. These are things that came to me naturally. I didn't need a quiz or a yankee candle or 5 years to figure this out.

You don't love me and that's totally fine. I knew it anyway. But it hurts me that you're trying to lead me on now. I really want to talk to you, but I'm bad at talking. Especially right now: I'm in the middle of an episode and you don't happen to have much time these days. Sometimes I wonder where you are when I'm stuck at home, having daily panic attacks and noone to talk to for days on end. I used to put up with the loneliness ""out of love"", but I am starting to think you don't even care about me as a friend. Don't feel guilty. Please just explain what is going on.

*We accept the love we think we deserve.*

Love Always,

\-me"
What did your ex teach you?,Tell me your story.
I am developing feelings for someone besides my wife,"My wife and I have been married for about 12 years.  We were high school sweethearts so we were together for a long time prior to marriage too.  We have always been very different people, but that has never been a problem before.  We always found ways to compliment our differences and get along even though we don't share many common interests.  We have always supported each other and managed to get along even when times were tough.  In short, we loved each other and we were happy.

&#x200B;

That all changed about a year ago.  She cheated on me.  I couldn't believe it when she told me.  It was like the whole world froze and my heart imploded in on itself.  She was sorry when she told me, I know this for certain.  It was a mistake.  She will never do it again, I'm sure of that.  But things have been different since then.  At first I thought maybe we would get through it without a scratch, since I didn't have the traditional explosion or emotional meltdown.  We just kind of went on with life, and things seemed fine.  But a couple months went by and I started to notice that our relationship had changed.  And so had I.

&#x200B;

We weren't talking as much.  We didn't sit next to each other when we watched TV anymore.  I was no longer excited when she walked into the room.  A couple more months went by, and it kept getting worse.  Fast forward to today and I am miserable 24/7.  I enjoy going to work (never used to like it) because it gets me out of the house and away from her.  I no longer enjoy being around her.  In fact, it makes me upset.  Part of me still loves her, but part of me doesn't want to be in the same room as her.  The little differences that used to be no big deal?  Those are a huge problem now.  Spending time with her is a chore.

&#x200B;

And now there's someone else.  I have a lot in common with this person, and she makes me happy and excited the way my wife used to.  To be clear, there is nothing fishy going on.  We are friends and nothing more.  She is married too, and there's no way anything could ever happen between us.  But the fact that I hate spending time at home and enjoy spending time with someone else instead is hard to deal with.  I'm not going to divorce my wife or try to have an affair.  But I am torn and confused, and my heart feels like an anchor every day.  I really don't know how to deal with this."
Unrequited love is the worst thing ever and I wouldn't wish it on anyone,"I have the biggest crush on my housemate. I like him so much it hurts. I don't fall for people very often but when I do, I crash really really hard. I've never wanted to date someone so bad. I don't even want to sleep with him I just want to cuddle. He is one of my best friends and I see him every day. He treats me like a sister and I just wish he'd see me a different way. 

I've never had so much fun with someone. We got lost on a road trip last weekend that added an hour to our drive. Instead of freaking out and being upset we jammed to music and looked at cool houses. We talk about anything and everything. Last night we went out downtown with a group of friends. We danced, drank, he hugged me a few times, we held hands, drunkenly staggered along the sidewalk barely holding each other up, and I laid my head in his lap the whole drive home. I almost confessed to how I feel about him when we got home but I can't ruin a friendship this way. 

Yet every day I have to watch him have feelings for my other friend/housemate. Watch them constantly text, her nap in his bed, I know he likes her and she is gorgeous so I don't blame him. I'm not mad at either of them, he doesn't owe me anything and no one can control how they feel about someone else. I'm starting to resent my friend and I know it's wrong but I can't control how my brain operates (and NO I don't want him just because she likes him, he liked her all summer and I didn't care). I just keep telling myself he doesn't like me. I hate how much it affects my mood. When we all hangout I get so down about it and I know I ruin the mood so I try to hide how sad I am about it. 

I know people who read this will say it's just infatuation, but I loved him in a platonic way before this. I don't know when things changed but one day I just looked at him a different way. He has to be one of the nicest guys I have ever met. I kept asking him last night if he liked my friend and if he was going to date her because I thought hearing it would make me like him less. All he said was that she is nice and that he wasn't going to date her. They had a thing a few months ago but he ended it because he doesn't trust her. 

We fell asleep in my bed a couple weeks ago after we got drunk and built a fort over my bed and we slept back to back, but at one point his arm brushed my skin and I can't even describe it as anything else but electrifying. He came home the other day and hugged me from behind, and we play fight a lot too. I had a dream that he picked me up and I just kind of looked at him and kissed him. I've never wanted to kiss someone so bad. I hate how cringe and weird this makes me but I just like him so much. The emotional turmoil I'm going through absolutely sucks and I would give anything for it to go away. It's sad that I'm looking forward to summer vacation because I'll be away from it all for four months. I just want to work and not think about him. Yet I'm dreading saying goodbye. 

I've never dealt with unrequited love to this degree and I honestly wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hate my brain for picking someone I pretty much spend all day everyday with. I get along with his friends, we hardly ever stop laughing when we're together, we come from similar upbringings/backgrounds, the list goes on. I hope I get over him one day and look back at how nuts I am about him and laugh. Honestly I'm just hoping one day it evolves into more. 

All in all, having a crush is the worst thing I've ever experienced and I never want another one

"Why is there never any ""changing of the guard"" or ""passing the torch"" to the next generation of fighters in dragon ball? Why is it always Goku and Vegeta are the strongest and no one will ever be able to touch them forever and ever and ever?","I have a feeling I know. Because all the NEETs in Japan who sit at home with their black curtains drawn in their room and watch dragon ball all day will riot and stampede all over Toriyama. Toriyama tried to make Gohan the strongest originally, but there was a major NEET rebellion where they threatened to stampede Toriyama if he didn't make Goku the strongest forever and ever and ever. The NEETs also though Vegeta was so cool so they wanted Vegeta to be the strongest too with Goku but nobody else. So now Toriyama is stuck with keeping the older generation, who are senior as Grandpa AF now, remaining the strongest forever and ever even though that doesn't make sense. There will never be a passing of the torch, never be a changing of the guard for a new generation of fighters. Because if Toriyama tries to do this again, he fears another NEET rebellion, just like what happened when he tried with Gohan.

Toriyama fears all the NEETs in Japan who are obsessed with dragon ball and who use their parents' money as the major supporting source behind the franchise because they buy up all the toys of the new Frieza and Vegeta action figures and put them in their NEET rooms with their black curtains drawn and continue to be NEETs doing nothing but watching dragon ball all day.

And while we're on the subject, let's talk about Dragon Ball GT. I'm not saying GT was that good, it wasn't. But you know, it was what it was, and Toryama originally made GT canon, but the NEETs rioted over this because it wasn't to their liking, and Toriyama was forced to backpedal and say ""oh no GT isn't canon it was never canon just for fun"". He did this because he feared a NEET uprising and needed to quiet down all the NEETs who were rioting in the streets over this because they have all the time on their hands because they don't work and live off their parents' money and watch dragon ball all day with the black curtains drawn shut in their rooms on the 58th floor in their highrises."
So sick of it!,Currently stuck in a group in which it is clear that I'm the one people don't like/look down on and just have me around to take the piss out of. Every time we hang out it feels like there is something that is not being said. My opinion is simply not listened to in any conversation and they're all just slowly trying to erode my self worth until I explode and they have a nice little story to tell. Worst thing about it is I'm stuck with them for the next few months as I live with some of them. Situation makes me feel so shit smdh 
Yesterday was such a shitty and hectic day,"Wanted to post yesterday, but was simply too tired. 

Anyways, I was in the French Quarter in New Orleans yesterday visiting two historical homes as part of a class assignment. After I was done, I called my mom to pick me up. I made the huge mistake of asking her to pick me up on the corner of Bourbon and St Louis (if y'all know, bourbon street is a crazy place). However, my phone unexpectedly died and I couldn't call to update the location. Payphones were no where in sight, and the museum that I visited just closed. I was torn on what to do- remain where I am and hope that my mom's white suv will come (which never did), or leave and go search for a payphone. 

After being stranded on the corner of st louis and bourbon for over an hour (and my mom being stuck elsewhere in the French Quarter with no idea where the hell I am), I finally decided to draw some money from a nearby ATM  and hail a taxi. However, hailing a taxi in the French Quarter (and especially near bourbon) was much harder than I thought. Eventually ended up having to walk two blocks to get a taxi. "
I hate everything and I'm just too tired and angry to deal with people,"I honestly hate myself and everything around me. I have no reason to. I've got a pretty good career so far and I'm a fairly well-balanced person. But I always feel like I'm never enough. I feel painfully mediocre and that I think I was destined for great things, but I'm never living up to the expectation. I'm bright but not the brightest. I'm fit but not the fittest. I have friends who are really nice and think I'm funny but I don't feel like I have enough or feel like the really like me, nor do I feel like I'd be their first pick. I feel like I have best friends but I'm not *their* best friend. And the worst is the romantic department. Guys just want to hookup with me and I haven't dated anyone in 8 years; though not for lack of putting myself out there. I feel like there's something fundamentally wrong about myself but I don't know what. And now, I don't know if I'm reading into things because of my emotional state, but it feels like my friends have stopped inviting me places. I always make the plans and people sometimes agree to come out, but no one asks me out.

&#x200B;

I've tried being more open. I've tried all the ""loving yourself"" bullshit but I feel so unfulfilled and eventually I cycle back into depression. And now all these feelings are boiling over and I can't help but feel like this non-stop for the past couple weeks. I'm even starting to feel sad about stuff from my childhood (being bullied for being ugly etc). I'm angry and snappy and sad and tired all at once. I don't know what to do but I just want it to stop."
I still hate you for it,"During the time when we should have been building trust and really getting to know each other you had to mess everything up. You robbed me of my honeymoon phase. Even though I have decided to forgive you I find that I still blame you, I still feel all of this pain. Lately I can't even be myself because I think that you chose her instead of me when the two of you were taken. You were the one to pick her up and you were the one to kiss her. I feel like I'm not good enough. I want to talk to you about it over and over but I get the same type of remorseful replies and I know I'd be beating a dead horse. I want to be mean and yell at you over and over, because what we had was so strong and we had been so happy at the time.

I think you're an idiot for doing what you did. You were the type of guy friend a girl's BF feared and hated, because you would be there for her behind his back. Instead of growing up and dealing with her issues she would run to you and you felt justified because you always heard the bad. It never occurred to you that maybe you were a part of all their problems. The friend who really wasn't a friend, just the back up guy to make the BF angry.

When she ditched you in favor of him again you fell into a funk that was so damaging. Then you met me and suddenly things were better. Then she found out how happy and taken you were, and she got mad. She contacted you and like a dog you came running.

You took advantage of her in a bad situation and confessed, and you made out with her and it's ruined my life since. I do not know how to really move on, or to trust you. I am so uncomfortable thinking about what might happen in the future, if something like this will ever happen again. You had no trouble doing it in the moment, only after did you feel bad. I wonder about who you're talking to all the time. I wonder why I always have to go out to bars with you.

It's forever changed the way I view you. Childish, impulsive, weak. You were unable to uphold your relationship in the face of a test. You failed. It's made me crazy, like nothing is real, like it's all a game, like relationships are just jokes. But even before we had something, the way you were with her, being a friend that the BF never met, listening to her inflated victim rants and somehow justifying that what she was doing was right...knowing she didn't give a damn about you but doing it anyway. Such a loser.

Sometimes you really disgust me. And I still hate you for it."
We’re going on strike.,"My mother and I are the only ones who clean in the house, my father and my brother sit around and don’t help much.  We are going to clean the house, and go on strike for a while."
Why do good girls like bad guys?,"(This is a genuine question, I'm not referencing a dead meme.)

Has anyone else experienced this? Where a girl says she wants a good guy and one that treats her right but as soon as one of them come by she friendzones them or just doesn't talk to them. As soon as guy that treats her badly comes along, she falls for him. He breaks her heart and then she has the audacity to lreach that all guys are the same.

I hate when this happens. Lots of nice guys and guys that deserve a lot are being turned down. Why? The girl falls for the 'bad boy'.

No, I am not claiming that only girls do this. I just, personally, have never seen a guy do this. 

This was not meant to be ironic or self-aware. I was saying my opinion on something that I, personally, hate.

I am not clamning to be a 'nice guy' at all. I may be a douché. People have told me that I am a genuine nice guy. I'm still not sure what the difference is between 'nice guy' and nice guy."
Love sucks,"I can't believe how hard I fell for you. Holy fuck. You are the most perfect guy I could ever be with and I can't be with you. I fucking hate the way life worked this out 

Stupid ocean 
Stupid age

It's so fucking frustrating and makes my heart hurt. It's not fair. 

I love you

i just had terrible sex,I just tried to have sex but it didn't work and he said there was something wrong with my vagina and then he didn't want to talk or cuddle and he said he felt nothing and I feel everything and fuck why did I do that
My childhood sexual abuser hugged me at my Mom’s funeral,"I was a rambunctious kid. I had a lot of energy and very little discipline. A young girl tomboy who played in the dirt and not with the dolls. I got into mischief. I was always curious. I drove my parents crazy chasing me all around trying to get me to focus. 

He was a loser teenager. My cousin. So duuuumb. We were playing hide and seek. I was only 7 when it started. He was 16. He took me in the closet and started rubbing me asked me if it felt good. It did. I froze. Crazy I can still remember that exact moment. I don’t remember much else about my childhood. 

I told my parents at some point. Police were involved. In the end, nothing happened. Most of the family didn’t believe me. I was the mischievous tomboy. 

My family and I never talked about it again the rest of my life. 

Here I am at 32. Got a couple Masters degrees. Left that fucking podunk town at 18. Avoided him most the rest of my life. Then he comes to my Mom’s funeral. Lines of people coming through to give condolences. There he is...He hugs me and apologizes for my Mom. He’s gone as fast as he was there. 

I think I forgive him more for the abuse than the humiliation of looking like a liar to my family at 7 years old. Fuck. 

"
Thanks for coming,"You’re supposed to support me. Yet, you’re tired. That’s fine. But that bothers me. "
It’s only weird that I’m dating a 22 year old when I’m 17 because I’m not yet 18.,"I turn 18 in September, my boyfriend turns 23 in July. We are doing nothing wrong, we both understand it’s taboo or whatever the fuck, we were friends before. He’s like my best friend, we play video games together, he helps me with music theory, I help him to understand production more. We communicate well, he hasn’t tried to groom me, he’s not creepy, he gives me good advice. He’s helped me break out of anti social shell, he’s helped me become more confident in my music skills. He teaches me about his hobbies, and I do the same to him. We haven’t even said I love you yet, because we don’t believe we love each other truly at this stage. It’ll take a few more months for that to be real, possibly. Maybe even more. It’s only a 5 year age difference, it’s seriously not that bad. It only seems weird because I’m still in high school. I’m graduating in 2 months, then going straight to college in August. He’s already im college, he took 2 years off and will be a sophomore in college when I’m a freshman. I’ll be 18, two weeks after college starts. We both have jobs, I’m taking my drivers test in a few weeks. I’m tired of being told it’s unacceptable, by my sister. Our older sister is dating a guy 13 years older than her. In 6 months from now, our relationship will be totally fine. I don’t give a shit if my family doesn’t like it anymore. My dad actually doesn’t care anymore, surprisingly. He know nothing terrible is happening, he knows we’re not doing drugs, not getting pregnant, etc. Age of consent is 16 in my state anyway. I am FULLY aware of the downsides to an age gapped relationship, but I’m not stupid. I know what I need to do, I know that I need to communicate, and I do. And if shit happens, it happens. If things don’t work out, that’s fine. But right now, I’m focused on building an even stronger friendship and relationship with my boyfriend. It’s not like we met and said we were so in love with each other, lmao. That’s just really cringy. I don’t love him, but I am interested in him. He was the one who actually brought up how he’s not head over heels for me, it’ll take him awhile to open up fully, but he’s interested in my personality and me as a person. It’s great how we share the same interests. He’s not spewing bullshit out of his mouth. He doesn’t even say goodnight to me lol, most of the time. We don’t talk constantly, we spent most of our days at work or working on our own projects. He’s building an RC plane, and I work on music production, learning in the process. I had to get this off my chest, the point being that I’m not being groomed for sex and I’m totally conscious of what the hell is going on. "
My mom read my diary and now she thinks I'm gay,"(Sorry if my english is bad, I'm not a native speaker.)

It's been a year I guess since my mom has read my diary, but she still thinks I'm gay! It all began when my mom found my diary (where I wrote every fucking personal thing about my life in,) in my room and read it, after bringing up topics i wrote about in my diary, she admitted to me that she had read my dairy and asked me if we could get a fresh start again, at the time I was 14, I didn't have a lot of friends so I kinda agreed.  

In my diary I wrote that I had 'gay thoughts' and maybe thought that I was bi. I still struggle to give myself a label, but I'm not gay for as far as I know, because I get crushes on boys sometimes. I'm still a confused teenage girl and I was and still am not ready to come out to anyone when I don't even know what my sexual orientation is.

The thing is, that even after a year or so, my mom still tries to get my out of the closet(by saying that it's okay if i'm gay and I don't have to be afraid to come out etc.) and it makes me so fucking mad. I've told her on many occasions that i'm not gay and in fact straight and she still won't listen. If she had let my diary just go and never talked about it again, I would've 100% forgiven her by now, but she keeps bringing the problems I wrote in my diary up and it drives me crazy and makes me feel really uncomfortable, I can't even watch movies with a gay couple in it with her because I'm scared that she'll think I'm gay again.

thanks if you made it this far, I just hope my mom will drop the whole gay topic and moves on with life, and I hope the next the she'll have some more fucking respect for me."
I want to dig my face into his chest,"We’ve been FaceTiming more than usual in the last few days. Since he’s 3 hours behind me now, it’s usually before I go to bed but still relatively early for him. But this time he called me in the middle of the night, when it was midnight for him. I only sleep in underwear, and I want him to crave me, so I’m not usually shy about “accidentally” showing my chest, or at least teasing with it. Most of the time, he’s still dressed because it’s early for him. But tonight it was late, so he took off his shirt and got into bed while we chatted. And then I saw his chest— my favorite thing. It’s so thick and muscular and warm, and when I used to be with him, he’d squeeze my face into it while we slept and I’d breathe him in and feel his heart pounding and nothing in the world was better than that. I try not to think about it too much these days because it makes me miss him too much. But tonight while we were taking I had full view of it and oh god now it’s all I can think about while I try to fall back asleep. I can still feel it if I think about it hard enough. Can still remember what it felt like against my cheek. 

He was high tonight. I love it when he’s high, he’s so incredibly goofy. We have the most fun conversations, even if I’m sober like I was tonight. But lying in bed without my clothes, seeing his face and his chest while he lay in bed, and laughing til it hurt felt almost normal, like I hadn’t spent the last 3 months without him. 

Then he told me I have a great ass. Damn straight.

Please come back. Please come back. Please come back. "
My cat was very proud of himself,"I’ve had this cat for almost a year now. Very good boy. Playful. Loves to lay at your feet. A few months ago, he caught some mice in the kitchen. Didn’t even know we had mice but hey, I’m happy to have a little exterminator in the house. The issue is both times he wanted to eat the whole thing and we had to chase him around the house to let us throw it away. I just didn’t want blood on the carpet.

Well on Friday, I was laying on my stomach on my bed, talking on the phone. My room was open and I see my cat walk into the room and jump on the bed. I’m not really paying attention to him. He drops something behind me onto my bare feet. He has a few mouse toys and glitter balls, so I figured it was one of those and he wanted to play. So I sit up, turn around, and OH MY GOD THERES A DEAD MOUSE ON MY BED

AND ITS FACE
AND ONLY ITS FACE
WAS MISSING

I swear this cat is Hannibal Lector. He stood in front of his new “toy”, lighting swatting it with his paw (which he usually does when he wants me to throw one of his toys so he can chase it).

Yeah, no thanks bud. I did yell, because I was started. I do not like surprise carcasses. I apologized and told him I was proud of him. And then I had my boyfriend throw the mouse away because I’m a coward.

I love my cat, but what the hell."
I'm really meantally ill and its like my pshyc doesn't believe me...,"So to be fair.. I have experienced alot of stuff in my life.. Nothing like what's going on in war torn countries but everything is relative right??

Like I'm falling apart. I basically do what is required from me to survive from day to day... And Im so over it...
i just want to be ok again...

I wish I could either be diagnosed with a illness so that I can get treated and get it over with.. Or that I can just snap out of this... I think the first option is most likely.. But I don't care... I just want to live again...

I'm dead inside and constantly thining dark... Arg.. I could keep on rambling... I just know there is something really wrong with me and the seem to not be able to help... This would be my 5th pshycologist I have seen in as many years and I just seem to stay depressed.. This seems not right...

Anyway.. Thanks  for reading if you made it to here... Im sure it's all over the place... But you made it... 

Thank you."
Im disappointed,"Everything is just falling apart I’m trying to pick up the pieces and make everything go back to the way it was I’m just so messed up at the moment ... all these tears all of this effort I’m exhausted I’m tired of being so pressured of trying and giving it my all and still being seen as someone so helpless I know my self worth and that I’m awesome and amazing but there vibe is hurting every day the arguments the decisions my eating habits are getting worse I’m eating less and less and I can’t help it anymore I can’t sleep at night I’m so stressed I’ve lost every true friendship, but this is life and I’m still trying to see the good side of everything my heart has gone through hell and back I’m so upset and disappointed at myself knowing I can do better but I will try .. I will try even if I end up hurt again and again and again I won’t loose myself because of others everything is a process just have to trust God’s plan </3"
My older brother came home drunk last night threatening me. I don't know if I still feel completely safe | I want to spread the word.,"So this is going to be a very long post where I ask for advice on two things so I'll leave a TLDR here

**Part 1 TLDR: My older brother came home drunk last night and I believe will be trying to come after me.**

**Part 2 TLDR: I want to spread the word on addiction and mental health in my community**

Ok so lets start this. Yesterday there was some family drama between my parents and my older brother, and I was in the middle of it. Just to keep a long story short, my brother threw a tantrum at all of us. To provide a little background he is 24 years old and I am 20. He does have a history of having ADHD, depression, anger, and possibly bipolar based of how he was acting last night. He also does have a drinking problem, as he does have a DUI on his record. So after he throws his tantrum - which was very intense, my parents and I all collectively agree that he needs to be kicked out of the house. As he is packing his stuff, he comes back at me trying to fight me and pushes me. I get up and tell him, ""I wish you the best"". I wanted him to leave the house there, but he refused to leave and would keep coming back at me. Eventually I decide to call the cops. I'm going to paraphrase here, but basically cops show up, talk to him in the garage, talk to me and my parents in our house. The cops really can't do much, but they suggest to him that he leaves for the night, which we all wanted him to do that. But before he leaves, our parents want him to take a breathalyzer and so the cops ask him if he will take one. He refuses and leaves.

At exactly 2:30 in the morning I get this [text](https://imgur.com/a/4Vk17Wt) from him. About an hour later I hear someone walk through the back patio door from the basement and towards my room. Luckily my room is locked, but a loud FBI breach kind of knock is pounded upon my door. I immediately call 911. I try to grab some sort of thing that I could use to defend myself just in case he happens to enter. I make sure I place camera facing the door to capture anything that could happen. He is yelling at me through the door for about 5 minutes calling me a bitch, saying he is going to sue me for false accusations, and destroy my car. He keeps urging me to open the door, but I refuse. I would later find out through the cops that he had a BAC of about .214 and possibly on some hard drugs, like amphetamines. Once the cops show up they start off talking lightly, but he keeps pushing it, by getting into my Dad's face. He is handcuffed and taken into a police vehicle, where he is given his BAC, that he tries not to take. There isn't really anything he can be arrested for, so the cops make him call an Uber and leave our house. The cops(who were great and very professional) give us a pamphlet on a restraining order. My brother doesn't take so kindly to that. All while everything was happening, he is specifically targeting me, threatening me saying that he is going to show up at my place of work and to not go out tomorrow. After his Uber takes him away, he sends this [text](https://i.imgur.com/wwezbSo.jpg) to my mom,dad, and I in a group chat. So that is the last I heard of him. Right now I don't know exactly where he is, but I do have a little bit of fear that he may come after me. He did leave his car at our house as well. I just feel like he is too unpredictable. My Dad is handling that restraining order process, but I'm not too familiar with how that all works. I would appreciate any advice from anyone on how to go through this.

**Part 2**

Based off the events that happened last night, I can say with 100% certainty that mental illness and addiction played a role in my older brother's behavior. I know that a situation like this can destroy a family, and it absolutely will leave a scar on ours. But I want to be able to shine some light and possibly make something good out of this. I want to be able to spread the word on mental illness and addiction in my community. I'm a big fan of boxing and so I saw the [Interview](https://youtu.be/XrM6WqYEj9Y?t=188) between Tyson Fury and Joe Rogan, where he talks about his depression and mental illness, and how he is trying to spread the word for people who might be in a similar situation. This is very inspiring to me and I feel like I can do something similar. I am in my second year of college and I live in a city of about 170,000 so it's not very big at all. A lot of people know each other around here, and some people have a big social media influence. I don't use social media much at all or have many followers, but if that is what I need to use to get the message around, then I will.

I want to be able to encourage people to seek help if they have mental illness or addiction to drugs or alcohol. For anyone that suffers from mental health problems the worst thing that a person can do is take drugs and alcohol. But that is the most common approach with dealing with it. And I've seen how it can destroy families and friendships. I had a best friend from the time I was in kindergarten who ended up getting mixed up with drugs and bad friends. By the time he was 17 he had a DUI and he barely graduated high school. I want people to know that there is a blueprint and a healthier way to deal with these things.

Most importantly I want to be able to be a role model - that my older brother never was- for my little brother, who is 16 and in high school. I want to encourage him and the people his age not to go around and get caught up thinking that they need to be doing what everyone else is doing. Because we live in a culture that is glamorizes partying, drinking, and drugs that young people will see all over social media. I don't believe that is a healthy way to live. I want to encourage these young kids and people of all ages to become leaders and people that leave a good example. And I also want to learn alongside them. So I would also appreciate any advice on how to approach this goal that I have.

If you made it to the end of this post I thank you very much for taking the time to read this. I have faith that I can do everything in my power to make some sort of difference."
People,"I want to “murder” people right now why the fuck do people have to be so annoying and rude oh my ticking godfucking damnit! Ahhhhhh! 

Thank you. "
I tried to save a dog then a truck hit it,"I am still shaken up so please excuse me if this isn’t well written. Yesterday was mine and my boyfriends 4 year anniversary and we both worked so we’ve been planning a date day today for a few weeks now. 
Well this morning on the way to brunch we were turning out of my neighborhood onto a busy street when I looked in my rear view and saw a huge black and brown dog running towards us at full speed. It was a long haired German Shepherd; my dream dog. 
So I yelled “get out” to my boyfriend who was confused and I got out of my car as fast as I could and tried to slow the dog down and get in his way. 
He had a collar with tags on it. 
I failed, he darted around me and onto the busy street and was hit immediately by a truck and the noise killed me, it keeps replaying in my head. It’s been about four hours. I had to run away down the street crying because as much as I hate to admit it, I cannot handle these sorts of things, I was traumatized the second it happened and would have rather been hit by a car than an innocent animal getting hit. 
I was screaming and almost puked. I was getting dizzy. I couldn’t been I hadn’t fixed this situation. My boyfriend, the driver of the truck that hit the dog and another couple were at the dogs aid immediately. He/she was rushed to an animal vet who i later called to check on it and they told me legally they couldn’t give out info but that the owners were had shown up. 
I feel like a failure. I could have saved a life and I didn’t. I can’t eat, I can’t drink. 
I thought going home and loving up on my dogs would help me feel better but instead I feel more sad for the owners of the dog that was hit because they can’t be doing what I’m doing right now. 
I also keep thinking if that dog were  mine this wouldn’t have happened. I can’t wrap my head around the misery I feel right now and I have nobody I can talk to. I feel lonely and sad. And I’m hoping this isn’t a permanent feeling. "
Suicide Pact.,"So I recently found out that my best friend is just as tired as I am. Just tired. Of being alive, of hating ourselves, of not being happy, just tired. So we made a suicide pact. What she doesn’t know is that I’ve just recently wrote my note and picked a date to go through with it. My new problem is this pact. I love her so much. She means the world to me. I want to be gone, but I can’t stand the thought of her giving up. I care too much about her to let her kill herself. I just don’t know what to do in this situation. Any advice?"
My mom got mad at me,"So. I woke up in a great mood today and I got ready. I go downstairs and my mom tells me to have breakfast. I said I wasn’t hungry and told her I’d skip it. I normally do this and I’ve been fine. Today, for some reason, she got really mad at me for not eating. I asked why I should eat something when I’m not hungry. She said I should because it’s time to eat. I’m really sad and my Mom’s really sad as well. I’m not really sure what to do.

Sorry if this post doesn’t really belong in this subreddit.

EDIT: I sent a note just like u/peanut-butter-18 said and it worked! We are both on good terms now."
I hope people never stop making chill art,"I know most of you know what I’m talking about, if not go to “pure imagination trap remix” on youtube and that’s what I mean. There are times where I truly feel lost and lonely, I’m trying hypno-therapy soon to see if I can fix whatever is wrong in my head but it all goes away when I see art like that. I know it’s strange but I really wish I could make art like that but I’m colourblind and have never been artistically inclined. So I truly, genuinely, desperately hope that artists never stop making that art"
A lot is happening in my life right now and i have no clue on how to deal with it,"Five minutes ago, my boyfriend (almost fiancé) broke up with me. He said that it's was better for the both of us and I know he is right. But I'm devastated. I don't have anybody to turn to. Soon, for personal reasons I won't be able to contact my friend and family. I know it may sound pathetic and stupid, you name it. ""It's just a breakup, no big deals"". But when you're living it, the pain is excruciating. I had really dark thoughts but I'll never do anything stupid. I just feel extremely lonely. And I just need to get this off my chest..."
The bomb cyclone blizzard in my town was four days ago and nobody in my family has asked if I'm ok,"There are like 20 of them in different parts of the coast with varying levels of ""supposed to give a shit"" about me and it's been four days.  I don't have kids and am not married and I just saw many of them at Christmas. And there's so much more to the story but gosh, I thought we were both making efforts.

&#x200B;

I just thought somebody would wonder about me and nobody has.  It hurts my feelings. I feel very alone and disappointed.  I'm crushed.  I mean, I always make sure they're alive at least.

I hang around with people that are always cruel to me at school because I don’t want to be alone and they are the only people who accept me in there group.,.. advice? Btw I’m at a very small school and practically know everyone.
I suck at reading.,"(Sorry for the poor english, etc. etc.)
I am on my second year of law school in a very well ranked university, but I suck so bad at reading and studying, my academic life points to nothing but failure.

I have always been one of the ""smart kids"". In high school, I would top the exams with little effort, all I did was take notes of the classes, only did homework when it was graded, never had to really study for any test.
I managed to get 5th place in the university entrance exam, no sweat, it was easy. All I ever did at home was spend all afternoon playing games.

The first year was pretty smooth, just like HS. The classes are more interesting, and the other students are way cooler than my old school colleagues. I finished the year with very good grades, still no sweat.

Well, life can't be that easy, right? Second year is absolutely DESTROYING me. Right from the start, all the subjects required me to read a stupid lot of books, which I just couldn't, I never had to sit down and read a paper pr anything to get high grades, I never had to tale notes from books or anything of the sort. Now that i HAVE to do this, my brain is melting! 

Every time I try to read something for school, my mind goes blank, my eyes get tired, and I can't read the words. I think that I should just give up on learning anything now."
It sucks being big.,"Some background: I have been dancing for 13 years now and I absolutely love everyone at my studio. All of them are so incredibly supportive, but I have been struggling with this for more than a few years now.

Let me just say, it really sucks to be big. Everyone who wishes they were a few inches taller wishes they were tall and skinny. Nobody wants to be tall and not skinny. I don't want to be tall and not skinny.

I am a dancer. The dance community has historically been incredibly accepting of sexuality, gender, etc, but have been the least accepting when it comes to body image. It's hard to be big and dance. I was the second-largest person at the studio when I was 13. Not only was I not skinny, but I was tall for my age. I am now taller than the average woman by about 5-6"" and still not skinny.

When you're my size and dancing, there's a constant fear that what you're supposed to wear won't come in a size that fits you. When you try on leotards for the show, you timidly grab the biggest one and pray it fits because if it doesn't, nobody gets to wear that leotard. It stretches weirdly in certain places, it draws attention to parts of your body you wish it wouldn't. You feel uncomfortable and stiff. You can't dance when you're uncomfortable and stiff.

And, if the leotard fits, you're still not done. Here come the skirts. Here come the pants, here come the jackets, the shirts, and the hats.

If you ever want to feel shitty about yourself, try on a skirt you HAVE to wear for the show and have it be too small for you. Someone has to take the skirt apart, attach a new waistband, and fit it back on you until the sizing is right. You just made someone work for another 4+ hours because you were too fat to fit into a costume. You aren't even fat. You're just big.

That's feeling shitty about yourself. It really sucks to be big."
My sister is popping out another human soon and I do t want her to.,"EDIT: I don't want her to* also, apologies for the crude title. 

Also thanks for letting me rant like a Looney. It feels good to just express these thoughts and get a little more understanding of then. 

OP.
She had the first child, a girl, and I love my neice. But I thought that at some point if they had wanted another child, they would be kind enough to adopt some poor fucker that was already here against his or her will. But no. She is having another one of her own.  

The world is going to shit and she's just popping out kids like everything is ok and it's fucking not ok. By a massive and uncountable margin, things are NOT OK. We are massively overpopulated and there are so many good foster kids waiting for a good home. I think it's the most selfish thing in the world that she would just put out yet another person into the world while there are already so many children in need.  

Am I wrong? Should I even bring it up to her? I don't know what to do and I am often considered wrong in this family. Maybe I'm the crazy one.  I don't think I am. But maybe I am wrong? My family would berate me for even having these thoughts.  I want to scream until my throat bleeds. "
"As crazy as it sounds, I realize I am in still in love with my ex and he just died...","I met my ex husband David when I was 16. I had just moved to a brand new school in a brand new city knowing absolutely no one. He had his friend give me his number, I suppose intrigued by the new black goth chick running around the school.

We lit up like fire in a dry forest. 3 long years together every. SINGLE. day. We got expelled from school due to stupidity and spent that very first year of our dating life in a classroom literally in desks right beside each other until further acting up saw us separated. Even still we spent every other moment together and I drank him like a dying man found an oasis in the desert.

I fell in love with him harder than I ever would've imagined I would have when I got that little piece of paper with his name on it.

The second year we were together we bonded when he left for the military, the army as a Military Police. Graduated top of his class as a sharp shooter;As brilliant as he was beautiful.

He's gone. I can't accept it. I know what people mean when they sit in denial repeating to themselves over and over again saying 'They CAN'T be gone. This is just a horrible joke, it has to be!""

I've paused every few minutes for the last few hours since I found out saying ""This is a dream right? There's no way that man that stole my heartbeat like a thief in a jewelry shop is gone!""

I loved him despite the severe issues we had. I got hit by him a couple times for each year we were together. I got raped. I got verbally abused and degraded and yet his eyes were so sad.

He looked like a little child that is dying for just a drop of love, just something to make him feel necessary and valued, and I tried so freaking hard to be that drop for him.

I tried so hard, and he's gone.

Like those 3 years together, the 2 years after of back and forth running to each other and hating each other, and 8 years of me randomly messaging him and him responding wanting to hang out.

I LOVE THIS MAN and I feel like I can't think straight. I can't breath, I can't comprehend right now that he is literally no longer in existence.

I look at him and I can see him try to be a better man. It's like all the things I needed him to be when we were together wanted him to be he blossomed into when we were apart and he grew as a person, and as a man.

I don't know if I changed him or if he would've changed regardless but he seemed to be in a genuinely good place here recently and devastated is incomparable to what we are feeling right now.

I'm so hurt and I wish I had been better;Wish I could've been what he needed and brought him that light he so desperately gasped for. I feel like a failure and I feel so defeated."
Why do I feel like I need love so badly?,"Everywhere I go, see, hear, look, wander, everywhere all the time I see love, I see passion, I can feel that love in the air and see how happy it makes people. I’ve been in one relationship and it was fake. I loved it, the feeling of belonging, the feeling to just hug someone when I needed too. But that was 3 years ago, and this does not seem to calm down. I want love, I want someone to make me feel like I belong. Why do I want this so badly, it hurts me, I feel selfish for being jealous of everyone with love. I just want to know why I feel this way, I want to try and stop myself from becoming obsessed with the idea of love."
I have friends again!,"I (20f) have been struggling with getting myself out and making friends again. My best friend recently moved across the country and I’ve been feeling so lonely. I have a partner but it’s been nice to be with people outside of that. 

I contacted some of my friends this past week and rekindled old friendships/work relationships. I feel amazing! "
Girl I talked to for months ignores me at the bar,"So I was talking to this lovely girl for about 7 months. We got really close and I was ready to take it to the next level while she wasn't so we decided to stop. After a few months we get coffee and while we still agreed to remain friends, she invites me to come out that weekend.

Well the weekend comes and I text her. No response. So my buddies and I go out anyways. But by pure coincidence I see her at the bar I'm at. It took me a while to make sure it was her but once I did, her friend saw me and whispered something into her ear. Next thing I know both of them make a bolt for the exit.

This really angered me because I thought we ended on great terms and a simple hello is common courtesy. "
I'm a man that just ugly cried about a sick (maybe dying) cat,"My wife brought this cat - Fancy - with her to our marriage almost 8 years ago. Fancy turned 20 years old literally yesterday. We celebrated by having some tuna outside in the sunshine. She looks about like you'd expect a 20-year-old cat would; she smells awful because she doesn't bathe anymore and her fur gets all matted up because of it. But she gets around the house well and hasn't seemed like she's suffering or anything, so we've just let her linger on for as long as she seems not-miserable-to-exist. As much as you can tell with a cat, anyway.

Well tonight she started pissing outside the litter box (in the laundry basket, in the dog bed, on the carpet, etc.) The piss is a little pink. Blood. 

This old smelly feline has decided to wait until the day after her birthday, a weekend, to get sick enough to go on. My wife has her at the emergency vet right now. We think this might be the end of the line for her. I sobbed because she was sick. I sobbed because I couldn't be there for my wife when her cat she's had since age 9 might end up passing on (our kids are already in bed, and there's nobody available to stay with them). I sobbed because *I* couldn't be there for the damn cat. 

We've been joking about her passing for the last two years, trying to lighten the blow for when this day finally came. I don't think it helped. 


**Edit:** It looks like it's just a run of the mill bladder infection. All she needs is a bit of antibiotics and she'll be back to stinking up our house. The vet doesn't think she's suffering other than being a bit uncomfortable from the infection. Fancy lives!"
I hate myself amd I want to die,"I want to heal, I want to feel,                                  What I thought was never real                                        I want to let go of the pain I felt so long                     I want to heal, I want to feel                                      Like I'm close to something real                                     I want to find something I've wanted all along       Somewhere I belong          edit: the format didn't work..."
Everything Is My Fault. But It's Not.,"Somebody could have died tonight and it would have been my fault.

Except, it wouldn't have been my fault but I cannot help thinking and feeling as though it is. It's a simple scenario; I asked my father to drop me off at university at night instead of taking public transport the next morning as I usually do. A motorcyclist who wasn't giving his full attention to the road (as he admitted himself, he was a decent human being who claimed full responsibility for his mistake) crashed into the side of our car and consequently onto the road. He was alright. We were alright. Everyone was alright. But I couldn't shake off the feeling that it was my fault. If I hadn't asked my dad to drop me off, if I hadn't waited until that very moment to leave the house, if I had just taken the train, none of this would have happened to anyone involved.

This feeling of guilt has been building up over a long period of time and this incident just caused it to erupt. I am the reason my family has the problems it does.

I was an accident; much like what happened today. My parents had me much later than all of my siblings and this has been the reason why they have been struggling past retirement age to put me through school, college and cater to every dire need in between. (I do freelance but I cannot work part or full time due to visa issues).

I feel guilty for being born. I feel guilty for being a burden upon my parents. I feel guilty for being a burden upon my family. I feel guilty that my parents and siblings were not able to live as well as they could have had I not been born. I feel guilty that I'm the reason we're poor and struggling. I feel guilty that by the time I may be able to repay my parents for all they have done for me, they may not be around anymore.

I feel guilty for resenting them and I also feel guilty for resenting myself.

I feel guilty for just existing. 
"
I Used To Be A Camwhore on Omegle for Horny Bi or Gay men,"I have to get this off my chest and forget it. It's kind of part of forgiving my ex boyfriend since this happened to me a week after we brokeup since I was so thirsty for attention. I almost constantly did this whenever I went on Omegle and spent hours on there giving horny dudes my Snapchat, jerking off for them, moaning, and fingering myself for their pleasure. I didn't do it because i enjoyed the sexual bullshit, I did it because I enjoyed the attention. Almost everyday they did this and they grew concerned if I wasn't online for a day or two. I have friends and I love them, but these people wanted me in their daily routine and that made me feel good.  I don't know why but one day it hit me that what I was doing was disgusting and I'm glad I stopped. I realized that I didn't need their attention, i had friends that cared for me to death and didn't just like me because I made them cum. They cared because I'm a good person with an amazing personality who is more than just a camwhore."
I(20F) hate being insecure when my boyfriend(26M) is loyal and does everything in his power to make me feel beautiful and loved.,"Sorry if this keeps bouncing around, I just need to get this stuff out.

In my past relationships I've been cheated on, manipulated, and gaslighted so finally being in a healthy relationship is refreshing and a little weird. Ive been trying to put my past where in belongs, behind me, but I keep overthinking about little things that were problems in past relationships. I'm not sure how to stop other than constantly repeating to myself that he won't hurt me and that he actually loves me. I hate myself for putting up with my ex's and letting them damage me this way. I hate my ex's for treating me so poorly that I still feel this way even though all of that ended three years ago. 

I still suffer from a restricted eating habit because I was 'Overweight' (I was 145-150, mildly athletic, now I'm 110-115 and can't stay outside in the heat for to long because I'll pass out)

I am currently working towards an Associates Degree and am doing 4 classes online so I can help my mother-in-law and don't have to drive 2.5-3 hours to school (5-6 hours of driving for a 1 hour class each day) but since that's all I do I feel like I haven't been doing much. I have a bad habbit of procrastinating but my school work doesn't suffer from that to bad, only the occasional assignment that causes me a lot of stress. I feel like I could be doing more with my life..

My boyfriends job is pretty cool, he works at a freshwater fish farm. It gets pretty hot in the building and huts so clothing is always minimal unless it's cold which is rare. He usually just takes his shirt off and sometimes his long pants cause he wears shorts under them. Sometimes when all I have to do is take notes I'll go to his work and hang out. I've become sorta friends with his coworkers in his department (2 females and a male). Now Im not sure if it's just my mind playing tricks on me or what's going on, but I keep catching one of the females staring at him (not his face, more at his chest. My boyfriend looks like an athletic Shaggy Rogers with longer hair. Almost 0 body fat on him, all muscle) and it makes me feel uncomfortable. I'm not sure if she's staring off into space and just happens to be looking that direction or if she's actually staring at him. 

I wish I could just stop thinking about things like that. I've grown to trust that my boyfriend won't do anything but it still makes me uncomfortable because some people don't care if I'm right there.

TL/DR: I'm insecure due to past relationships. Trying to get over it but sometimes my insecurities get the better of me. My boyfriend is amazing and tries his best to make me feel good about myself. I want to be better, not overthink."
"10 Years this October, and I still miss my dad.","My boyfriend and I had an argument tonight. No biggie. My first reaction after dissolving the situation was to listen to my dad's favorite band, Lynyrd Skynyrd. I've been listening to their first album, and only wondering if he had heard these songs. (Definitely, he was born in '60 and this was a '73 album). I just wish that he was still here to talk about it with. I was only 13 when he died, and I wasn't even old enough to appreciate some good southern rock. But every now and then, especially in bad situations, I need to connect with him. I'm nearly 23 now, and at any and every point in my life, I wish he was here. To talk to about my day, to rant to for advice.. To just chat with. My mom and I have a wonderful relationship, but it's not the same and she understands that.

I guess I just want everyone to know who loses a parent, it gets easier, but it never really goes away. Its like the tides going in and out every day. 10 years later and there are still times I wish with everything that I am that he was here. Most days I don't think about it anymore. But the days the grief hits, it hits hard. HARD. Especially in the past year while shit is crazy in my life. 

My father was not a religious man, but I feel him with me sometimes. At least... I hope that's what it is. I don't know if he's in heaven or just dead. I don't even know what I believe in.. I just know in these moments of stress, when I can listen to music and feel like he's got the other ear bud.... Those are the moments I try to hold on to."
What do I do now.,"Ever since I was a kid I loved animals and nature and all that junk. I always wanted to work with them or be a biologist. Well now I’m 23 with a shitty environmental degree, I know now I’ll never get to do any of those things. I have a rough job in hazmat that doesn’t pay very well but it’s better than nothing. But I’m starting to become extremely depressed again, since graduation I’ve started gaining weight, I’m not even skinny anymore. Nothing romantic ever worked for me so I don’t have much hope of being happy in that area either. I feel like the last thing that was anchoring me to even being alive was working with wildlife or nature but now that’s gone, I feel like there’s no point of sticking around anymore. I don’t know what to do. "
today was my last shift at my first job.,"hi everyone. 

today was my last day at my first job. I’ve been working at a restaurant ever since I turned 18 and now that i’m 21, I’m leaving for a career related internship. 


i have a great relationship with all of my co workers. i was the youngest out of all and my co workers treated me like their daughter. (all of them are above 40... haha) 


i clocked out tonight at 11:30 PM. after clocking out, i was just causally talking to my co workers about how i’m gonna go eat w my family this Saturday to celebrate my accomplishment (yay). 


and then boom. one of my co worker handed me an envelope that says “to ‘my name’”. I broke down instantly.  I wasn’t expecting to get a goodbye gift or anything. I bawled my eyes out. I wished all of my co workers the best and once i got to my car i cried more again. 


i opened the envelope when i got home and there is a letter from everyone at work attached with money. i cried more again. 


it would be a lie if i say everyday was amazing at my job, however i don’t regret my choice of working there my teenage years. ive learned so much and grew as a person internally & externally. 


i just wanted to get that off my chest. i’m home now and i still feel scared to start at my new job in few weeks. i will eventually get used to not seeing my awesome co workers every week. i will eventually like my new job and get to know people from there.... 




it’s been great 3 years. cheers to my next chapter of life.....

THANK you for reading this long ass vent...... i sincerely hope everyone has a great day today :)

"I don’t like my friends, but I don’t like being alone.","Ah, the pains of being an introvert and depressed with social anxiety to top it off. Making friends has always been a challenge for me and it’s just gotten more and more soul searing as I’ve grown into adulthood. The only friends I’ve managed to keep are the ones from high school. These friends have always been extroverted, fratty, have had no filter when it comes to what’s on their mind, and are so......... annoying. I’ve come to terms with being the ‘quiet one’ in the group and it’s been the bane of my existence ever since. I’ve always struggled with expressing emotions, and have never had the nerve to stop them from constantly dominating the conversation. I’ve also come to terms with being used as the driver of the group, as I’m the only one with a car. I just want introverted friends who actually listen to what I have to say, without constantly interrupting and constantly talking about themselves. I’m just too much of a coward to stop hanging out with them, because they distract me from my thoughts. "
Emotional Dump,"I've always been the kind of person that cares a lot about my friends. I genuinely lend my time for their personal issues and counsel them as much as I can. I care so much because I know they trust me and because I love doing it. I made it to the point where I am handling multiple issues within a week. I just wanted them to be happy and know that they will never be alone. On the contrary, I barely give my own issue on other people and I was fine with that until someone pointed out about my mental state. How come I can handle this much emotional stress when I also have my own to deal with? Who console with me when I feel like its too much?

I just want to say that my answer to that is because no one bothered to ask and because no one will truly care. I already accepted that no one will truly care. I just don't want to be that kind of person that pretends to acknowledge what you have been through and then forget about it like it was just a trivial statement. Its my personal choice to be an emotional dump yet my answers to those questions never truly redeemed what I feel. It bothered me so much wherein I started breaking down time to time and I don't know what im supposed to do.
I never tell them this because I know they will just be pressured to hear what I feel and what I have been through. I know people will be naturally selfish and its fine, just dont want to be that way. 
"
One of my best friends passed away six months ago and I can't get over the guilt of thinking it's my fault.,"...I don't even know where to start. 

&#x200B;

**Backstory:**

About eight years ago, I met someone who would end up being one of my best friends. She, through primary school (elementary school), was one of my only friends; she was my only friend in my final year of primary school. We did everything together, and we were always there for eachother, and I will never forget any of it. Once highschool started, I went to a school about 1 hour away from everyone else however, by luck, she also ended up going there. After my first year, I moved 2 hours away - I had only seen her once after that. However, despite being so far away, we still talked almost every single day after I moved. She is one of the closest people to me, and was always there for me... and I guess I wasn't there for her this one time.

&#x200B;

**What happened:**

Longer story short, she was in a tough situation and she was telling me about it. My opinion ended up disagreeing with what her actions were, and that sparked an argument. The argument got out of hand and, thinking back, it was entirely my fault. That was early September 2018, and she hadn't talked to me for a few days afterwards.... on September 7th, I contacted her sister - I found out that, that night, after the argument, she decided to go for a drive to just get out and away from everything. I don't know if she was driving wrecklessly because emotion, or if something else happened and it was a mistake, but she ended up in hospital after a car accident. Just that, alone, made my cry so much and, if I just didn't escalate the argument, she wouldn't have went out and nothing would happen... but it got worse.

&#x200B;

A few days later, when I asked about her condition (I asked every day), I was told that she didn't make it... that broke me so much, and it still does. Even worse, I was told about her funeral two days after it happened because I deliberately wasn't invited. Her sister was updating me on things, when I asked. She called me and told me about the funeral two days after, she told me that she hates me and it was all my fault - I guess that was why I wasn't updated without asking and that's why I wasn't invited to her funeral.

&#x200B;

To this day, I know barely anything about the situation. Even then, all I wanted was to go to her funeral and have a proper goodbye. But now, all I think about is that our last conversation was an argument. I just don't understand why this would happen, she didn't deserve it at all. I just wish that it was me instead of her, that it's her that is still able to live a full life. I fucking hate myself for what happened, and I always will. It shouldn't have been her that lost her life.

&#x200B;

**I don't know what to call this:**

So, now, just a bit more than six months later, at 1am, it is still all I can think about. It's not even like I deserve to feel sad, it was entirely my fault.

&#x200B;

Either way, thanks for reading this and giving me a place to get that off my chest."
I’m 22 and I’m at a point in my life where I feel “stuck”,"I graduated college this past December with a bachelors in biology. The plan was to apply to grad school this year but now I am not entirely sure. It’s not like I am going to ditch school altogether, but for right now, I am sick and tired of it. A thing that I love and feel very passionate at times about is language learning. I love hearing and learning different languages. I find it immensely interesting. I was thinking about taking this time off from school to apply for a program that would allow me to teach English in Japan. The thing is, is that I feel like this is something that I would love to do (I won’t know unless I try I guess)  but at the same time, I feel like I wasted my time pursuing a degree that has nothing to do with teaching. Let alone English. The interests I had back then don’t interest me as much anymore and the hobbies that I had, are now things that I feel very passionate about.  I’m just sick and tired of seeing and experiencing the same things every day. I feel trapped where I am right now and I feel like I need to see and experience new things.  This japan teaching program is something that I feel like I can learn a lot from. Especially about myself.  I’ve had this idea for about two years now but I hadn’t really thought much about it until I graduated.  I really do believe that I would enjoy teaching English in Japan. I guess what I’m asking for is advice? Any input would be appreciated :) "
My boyfriend fell asleep before we were able to say goodnight. I started crying and had a panic attack and I don't know why.,"I don't know if this is the right place to post this,but I just really want to get this of my chest. 

So, my (long distance) boyfriend and I have been together for nearly a year. Before we were even together,we'd talk before bed until we'd fall asleep (this is the reason why he and I got so close and became so attached to one another so fast). For almost a year, nearly every night before bed, we'd talk and fall asleep together.

 Tonight, I was playing games and he said he was gonna go lay down. I didn't want to keep him waiting so I told him I'd go get ready for bed. He said that he wasn't very tired,so I didn't feel the need to rush (most nights he usually browses Reddit before bed for 8-10 minutes while we talk,so I didn't think he'd fall asleep). After 15 minutes I was in bed. I called him a few times,but I guess he muted his ringtone or just slept through it. I messaged him couple times,but after 15 minutes with no reply,I knew he had fallen asleep. I wrote him a goodnight message for in the morning and turned my phone off and laid down. I laid there trying to sleep and all could hear was the street light buzzing outside (and my heater turning on occasionally). I'm used to hearing his voice at night, and it's what puts me to sleep. I checked my phone again and read over the goodnight message i sent (all it read was, ""Sleep well sweetheart. I love you. 💖""). I started feeling so lonely and that progressed into such an intense sadness that I started tearing up and crying. That crying turned into a deeper more intense cry. Ya know,the kind that makes your stomach and throat hurt? I had no odea why i was crying like that and was freaking out.  I let out a slight sob and when I went to inhale,that's when the panic attack started. I was laying on my stomach and I could barely breathe because of it. I rolled over and propped myself up on my one arm. My face (mainly around my lips),my hands,and my feet had the pins n' needles feeling in them and I felt light headed. After 8 seconds or so, I managed to calm my frantic  breathing. I felt like I was gonna faint so I laid back down. I laid there for a moment collecting myself before I started crying again. All I could think of was, ""What the fuck is wrong with me?"". All of that happened over the course of 5 minutes and I'm so emotionally drained and exhausted. I don't have bad anxiety,I'm not bipolar,or anything of that sort that might cause a reaction like that. All I could think of that might've caused it are my severe abandonment issues. I don't know if something as little as that could've triggered something mentally or what,but I still have no idea why it  happened. I'm debating even telling him it happened because I don't want him to feel bad or to blame himself for it. Thoughts?


(Ps. Thanks for reading. ♡)"
I miss life before social media!,"Maybe its just that I was a child without a care in the world just before social media became prominent in daily life, so everything was better when you are kid just playing with friends (I was born in the mid 90s and grew up in the 2000s-10s).

I got my first YouTube account in 2005, I had MySpace and Bebo around 2006-7 too, but these platforms weren't yet so dominant. Then I got Facebook in 2008, but still never used it that much. I remember using MSN often too.

Before Facebook, we used to have to knock each other's doors, make phone calls more often, much less FOMO, no bullshit superficial posts, girls/women didn't try to look like blow-up dolls or mannequins as much as they do now, less annoying selfies, no obsession with likes, no swipe left/right and so much more.

All of a sudden, social media just blew up in front of our faces in around 2010 and it almost seems like the world cannot live without it. Depression and anxiety is on the rise, particularly for young women (google Jonathan Haidt). I don't want to seem too negative about it as social media definitely has (had) it benefits, but now, it seems like the world knows everybody's personal life and if you haven't got social media then you are deemed a misfit.

I only use social media to promote my music, business and to communicate with family/friends, but never do I scroll through feeds anymore. I remember the craze when Snapchat was first popular, Tinder, Instagram etc. and thankfully, I never jumped on the bandwagon since these platforms seemed to do more harm to mental health than any good. You'd think that social media has improved interpersonal relationships but I believe it has just caused more isolation, envy, loneliness and social anxiety.

I wonder what the generation born around 2002-2010 currently perceive childhood or adolescence since they didn't really experience life before social media.

**TLDR: Social life was much simpler and more pleasurable before social media.**"
My depression is ruining my life,"I have been struggling with depression since my teens and have survived suicide attempts a few years ago. Shortly before meeting my boyfriend things got better because I faced my problems , got to therapy and tried to push trough the pain .After getting together I was really happy for a while. My depression never fully went away tho and it's  coming back with full force. It's  destroying my career and my friendships. I struggle to get up for work and I'm  exausted after half a day of work. My best friend left me after screaming at me for being a terrible and unreliable friend and to go fuck myself. My bf tries his best to support me but he is in ini in a different  state and there's  only so much he can do. I want to change my situation and improve and not be a birden to my family and friends but I  don't  know how. I am deeply ashamed of not having accomplished more by now and not being a stronger person. I just wish I could die in my sleep so l can get out without hurting my beloved bf and family too much. "
planned my first solo trip,"i've been contemplating killing myself on and off for the past few years, and lately due to a mixture of different stressors, my mental health has been getting worse.

last night was particularly bad, but i had a moment of ""fuck it, might as well"" and started looking at flight tickets. I've never travelled anywhere alone before (I just turned 19 and barely moved out of my parents house a few months ago for college), but I figured that before I die, i might as well visit one of my dream destinations before that happens, whenever it happens.

the planning and research helps distract me whenever I'm feeling down, and the trip itself helps give me something to look forward to. for the first time in a long time, I'm actually excited for the future. I hope that things get better from here on out."
I think it’s time for me to give up.,"Nothings working 
I have no friends , no money no self respect . No love left no time or ambition. My creativity is dead guitars are collecting dust Art and life is meaningless to me now 

I’m going to delete everything. Facebook, ig, Reddit , everything 

None of it means anything to me . And Im just a pathetic useless dramatic joke . 

I’m deleting all my contacts . All my photos . All my connections to the world and going to become as invisible as I can , even if it means the worst 

Goodbye to you guys 
Keep living your life and have fun 

I’m done with my life."
Went to the beach,"Saw the sea and felt that feeling you get when something gargantuan is before you. Felt insignificant. Peaceful, like nothing ever mattered.

&#x200B;

Wanted to drown myself; dying happily.

&#x200B;

I wish i did."
"I hate myself, for being not myself around my friends and family. I ready do.","is it just me who change their persona when hanging out with people and putting up a wall before they get too close, even family members? 

i still remember it when my dad walks away from my life on my 6th bday 4 in the morning when he promised to buy me a gift later in the afternoon. I waited for him on that day, but he never did return home. That same year my mum got sick and rushed to the hospital. When my mum is all better, she decided to work full time sometimes leaving me and my younger brother alone. 
I remember seeing my mum awake at night working, cleaning and crying. I didn’t like what I saw, I even came up to her one night and cried with her because she was crying. Idk, I think this what made her decide to send me and my brother to live with my grandmas. From then onwards, I would move from different house every 2 year to live with different relatives, thats when I started to learn to build walls that I now regret so much. And what hurts me more is that when I realised it too late that I’ve lost their trust because I’m too selfish to share what I truly feel."
I have to hear my abuser’s voice all the time,"Throwaway account because reasons but here goes:

I was sexually abused by a superior where I work. And given where I work is a media company where said superior is often called upon to read/report the news, it feels as though I cannot escape his voice or his face. Everywhere I seem to look, he’s there.

What’s worse is that nobody would care if I ever reported it, I’d only be buried and denied ever getting a job anywhere else in the media. And that’s precisely how I was abused in the first place. The job. The career. 

My superior promised he would help my career, he would mentor me, blah blah. Jobs are hard to come by in the media, I thought maybe I’d just have to put up with discomfort to get where I wanted to go. Then he gaslighted the hell out of me (I realise now). 

Then he sexually abused me. I asked him not to, repeatedly. *Don’t touch that*. He’d say ok.

Then do it again. And again.

He’d put on porn in front of me. He’d talk about sex constantly. He’d guilt me if I didn’t spend time with him or give him attention. He’d shame me. It’s abuse, I know it is. He still does it.

But oh... another reason why nobody would care if I reported this?

I’m a man.

I’m in a personal hell over this. I feel like the walls are all closing in. Thanks for letting me get this off my chest, Reddit, I wish things were different."
I think watched someone die yesterday,"I’m traveling, in a city that isn’t mine. I’m not a city person. I’m away from my husband, from my people. My son is with me. He was with his team, I had forgotten my medication and sunscreen at the hotel. I was in my rental car, about 4 cars back, and this pedestrian... just... stepped out into traffic. I saw it in slow motion. The car had no chance to react. I mean zero. We were doing 45 mph, the light was green for us, he made no eye contact, no indication he was planning to go.  I happened to be looking at him because I was looking at street signs and restaurants in the area and he was there and then under the first car. The car, of course, hit its brakes. The second hit its brakes but has no chance of missing the first. The car in front me narrowly missed involvement. The man... his condition didn’t look conducive to life compatibility. It was horrific. 

The driver of the first car, she was so young and inconsolable. I had covered the man with my jean jacket as we waited for emergency services. I hugged her and took her to my car, gave her water and tried to calm her. I don’t even know her name. Her life... what will this DO to her? She’s just a baby. The driver of the second car had some pretty bad injuries, he was driving one of those really tiny cars... a fiat I think? We couldn’t even get to him until emergency services arrived. 

Ugh. I’m sorry. I just needed to write this out somewhere. I’ve been trying to be stiff upper lip. Trying to... be okay. "
Being civil with an Ex(20F) isnt hard. Grow up.,"I really just need to write this somewhere and get some reassurance that I'm not insane. Also on mobile, formatting.

I was dumped by my Ex girlfriend last month. Not the first time , but the last. I know how to handle the pain and I've been taking steps to get better and back on my feet. The break up wasn't pretty but I made clear there are no I'll feelings from me.

I found some old photos in my room, I threw away old photos a time before and I regretted it deeply . So I mailed them to my ex with a note explaining that I didn't want them and she was free to do what she wanted. 

I started up a tinder account to get to talking to new people again. Going from talking to someone every day to no one is jarring, that's why I got back on the app. I was in a trance where I was swiping and barely looking at anything and ended up swiping right on my ex. 

Tonight I got a 60 dollar charge from an unknown Microsoft account , I remembered I was logged into her Xbox one with my account when we were dating so I thought to call and ask if she knew anything about it. 

Every one of the instances listed above she has responded to me with nothing but anger. I have responded calmly to each of her responses. (She texted 3 times , I texted 2). 
I can without a doubt say every time I talked with her after the break up I have been nothing but respectful.

I get it, she doesn't like me. But I'm not trying to butt into her life , she threatened to get A restraining order on me. I don't want to talk to her , every time I do I feel sick. 
I want to live my damn life. I understand she wants to live hers and probably feels sick when she talks to me. But that doesn't mean that being a decent human being and talking like adults is off the table.

Everyone out there, you don't have to like everyone but show respect to the other humans around you."
I realized I don't have a good understanding of boundaries at all,"I was thinking about how my friend is setting boundaries with me when I realized I don't have boundaries myself nor do I understand what boundaries really are. Even though I logically know it isn't true, i feel dumb for not realizing this sooner (I'm a teenage girl). This is because my parents have no healthy boundaries and I got abused badly growing up. However, while I understand why it happened, it's now my responsibility to fix it. I just have no clue how to get started. I'm crying very badly over this and I just feel very lost about all of this. "
So tired of my shit life.,"I was the HOT girl...growing up, as a teen, til I hit 18, omg I was phenomenal. When I was 12, I was asked out ALL the time by older guys, men even...because they had no idea i was only 12. I was freaking gorgeous. Killer body. I was happy, cheerful, bright future ahead. But i got into a relationship with an abusive piece of garbage, and he destroyed me. Made me cut my hair, made me dress all frumpy, I started self harming...it got really ugly. 

When I was about 17-18, I got on antidepressants, because all these psychs wouldnt just tell me to get out of this crap relationship, they gave me massive doses of this med and that med. In about 8mos, I went from being 110lbs to 190. My senior year started out in a size 5, and my prom dress was an 18. The following year, the meds continued being yanked around all over the place, long story short, by the time I quit taking all antidepressants, I was at 260...and I'm only 5'1"". 

My 1st husband was incredible, my soulmate, and he fucking died. I met my 2nd husband, who was an AMAZING man, we have 2 kids, he NEVER made me feel anything less than a queen. He loved my body, because he loved me. Even after 10yrs together, I never fully believed he was truly attracted to me. On that superficial level. I knew he loved me, was attracted to me BECAUSE he loved me...but not simply on looks. If he were to meet me on the street, I always told him hed never even look twice. He always argued that, but still. 

I now weigh 290, I'm 5 feet tall, all my weight is in the middle. Boobs, belly, butt. And I cant lose it. I have spent years eating right, no change. I used to walk 3miles every morning...never lost a pound or an inch. I've tried diet plans, medicines, so much...but nothing. A few yrs ago I started having chronic pain, which everyone blamed my weight on my small frame, but I knew it was more than that. Finally, I got a real diagnosis, I have Psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing Spondylitis and severe fibromyalgia. So exercising anymore is nil. I do physical therapy in a pool, but that just keeps me a little mobile. More or less, I'm bedridden now. I can barely walk. I use a cane. I'm in constant pain due to the damage to my joints. My husband died last year, so now theres the severe depression and trauma. 

I'm a young 2x widow, disabled, with chronic pain, I'm morbidly obese, and I'm so depressed I just want to die. My children keep me going, but i am so hopeless. I want to be thin again...i want to be healthy...i want a LIFE. But i know I'll never have it. What's the point? What's the point in living a life in agony, in bed, just rotting away? Why fucking bother? My kids would be better off raised by my brother and his wife, they're healthy, active, financially comfortable, here with me they're stuck in my depression. I'm so tired of living. I'm tired of my body, every morning i wake up and hurt so fucking bad i would rather swallow all my pain pills than face the day. I could quit...painlessly. why the hell dont i? These kids? Again, theyd have a better life without me. And that's not bullshit...they really would. I know no one can replace their mom, but I'm not exactly much of a mother to begin with. Not anymore. And dads not here to make the difference. Fuck idk. I just am so sick of existing in this nightmare, and I feel like theres just no hope in changing it. The pains only gonna get worse, the kids will resent me more and more as they get older, eventually they'll leave home and I'll be in this hell alone...why the fuck should I even stay for all that? Of course I WANT to, I WANT to be a grandma, I want to see my kids grow up, I want to be there for everything. But, realistically, how much am I really gonna be there for? What, am I gonna babysit my grandbabies from my bedroom? Am I gonna even be able to do THAT?!? Fuck, I'm just so sick of everything always being shit. My mom killed herself, and I always thought it was selfish and wrong of her...but now I'm getting it. I've experienced so much death and pain, I've buried 2 husbands, I've been living with crippling fucking pain every damn second of every damn day for years, it's a nightmare just waking up each day. Off my chest, but definitely not off my mind. Fuck. "
I checked my ex's profile and realized he is a complete... I don't know. I am speechless.,"So I was with this guy for what felt like about a little more than a month.

We clicked. Amazingly. For the first two weeks we were together and it was extremely intimate. Then I went back home. 

I was stupid enough to believe he loved me. When I was at home he started growing more distant. He started saying long distance will not work and that he had goals which he wanted to follow and he wouldn't be able to give me more time. 

When I met him next (and the last time I met him) we broke up. Because apparently he was interested in some other girl. He denied any affair.

This girl ditched him later. He got another girl and he has been with her ever since. 

Today I realized he not only kept a long distance with her 9 months, he changed his job to move closer to her. 
 
I took two years to get over this relationship. I feel stupid and dumb. 

Now I realize his excuses were excuses and he probably just wanted the sex minus any commitment. 
"
I’m so fucking stupid,"You know when the one thing that you always thought would happen finally happens and then your dumbass is somehow surprised that it happened? 
That is all. "
"I hate being Mexican, nothing physically stands out about me.","My face is brown, my eyes are brown, my hair is brown, I look so plain and it makes me mad. I hate wearing makeup, I don’t want to wear makeup just to stand out. And plus I’d rather go places naturally. I look so basic and plain and it’s irritating. I wish I had colored eyes or something, I’d look somewhat more interesting then. Or I wish I had white skin, I don’t know. "
Engaged but may die alone,"Sometimes I worry my fiance just tolerates me. We are the same yet different on really fundamental levels. I doubt he can handle my anxiety and depression for long. Last night he said ""you don't have to get so upset about things"" his kid has stolen from my friends and I but sure let's invalidate my feelings. 
Idk. I'm a mess. "
Ahmed Mohamed,"Does anyone remember this little shit?

Than his stupid Muslim family tried to sue the school district for 100 million bahahahahahahahahah wait bahahahahahahahahah"
Thanks,"For all the highs and lows you've given me. Even though I'm a shy boi and never told you how I feel, it's like we both know and you didn't make it awkward. All the times we held hands and fooled around during classes. I'm kinda sad that I don't see you everyday in college anymore like we used to in high school, but the times I see you, my day gets better. Never knew a girl like you would catch my interest. 

Miss you, buddy. "
What did your first love teach you?,Share your story. :)
Over thinking,"I can't seem to stop over thinking stuff and it's driving me a bit nuts. I over think posts I want to write to the point I just forget about it and don't type anything. I over think what I want to say to a girl I find attractive and wind up not talking to her. I over think about what type of job I want and wind up not applying anywhere and sticking to a job I really want out of.

How do I get myself out of this?"
41 Days to a New Me!,"I’m embarking on a journey to change me, change my life, change my body, change my personality, just change.  I’m tired of the person I have become, tired of the way I look, tired of living in despair, just tired.  There are things I can control, things that I can change that should make a difference if that person really does try.  I’m trying!  I’m am really TRYING with all my heart and soul!!"
failed at staying sober,im in a rehab clinic rn and they let me come home for the weekends. ive been sober for about 3 months now. i was a heavy drug user and destroyed all my relationships and family and everything my hands reached was destroyed. im 19 and i know alot of things can still change. i went out yesterday and mixed benzos and alcohol and got blacked out drunk and high. dont remember shit. i have to go back to the clinic today. my mom trusted me to go out with friends and stay sober and ive hurt her in so many ways. i hate myself for hurting her so much and i hate myself for being an addict. i have no idea how theyre going to deal with this at the clinic but what fucks me up the most is that i fucked up my moms trust. im so tired of being an addict. i dont want to do drugs or deink but i cant stop. im trying my hardest i really am. i cant imagine my life without drugs or alcohol like ever again because thats what im supposed to do after i come out the clinic right? stay sober..? i hate this addiction. its not even the addiction to drugs that fucks me up. its the addiction to destroy. i got addicted to destroying things. i know i have the power to create beautiful things because i have done it before.. but im addicted to toxic shit. im so tired of myself.
i’m a dumbass for not asking for his snap,"i was fucking around on omegle and put the interest as tik tok bc i thought it would be funny, and accidentally met a super cool guy on there. i talked to him for four hours and didn’t get bored and before we hung up i forgot to ask for his snap and i feel so stupid because i’ve never connected with someone before.

"Nights like this come with the job, but that doesn't make this feel any better.","While I have vented about this in pieces tonight, I need to get this off of my chest before I try to get some rest.  


I worked a serving shift at a fairly busy restaurant in Atlanta, Georgia tonight. It didn't get as crazy as I expected, it being Saint Patrick's Day weekend and all, but it was steady and stayed that way until we closed at 2am. I was there all night and did a little over $700 in sales. Slow and steady, so I definitely had time to take good care of each of my tables. Within my first five tables, two of them left without tipping on an $80 check and then on a $110 check. While this stung, I said to myself, ""it's okay, there's still plenty of night left and it will all balance out in the end. I'll leave with more money than I came in with."" This happened a few more times throughout the night, and my last two tables were a 10 top of teenagers (maybe from a private school because they were dressed up for a prom of sorts) and a couple in a booth off to the side of them. The teenagers were all split checks but probably added up to about $150 and I made a total of 12-ish dollars off of them. The couple asked for to-go drinks that weren't reflected on the bill but I said, ""ah, you're my last table of the night, let's go a little crazy"" and gave them their to-go drinks without charge. Their bill was $40 and they also left without tipping. I almost cried at work tonight. I almost walked out after that... but then I'd be leaving all of my sidework and cleaning of my section to my co-workers and from what I heard, had a similar (but not as fiscally bad) experience tonight.   


Each time this happened tonight, I just let it roll off my back and kept it moving. And after tipping out, I walked away from a 10 hour shift, quite a bit of sidework, and silverware.... with $36 dollars. Yep. $36 dollars. And to top it all off, I just got home and my sweet dog is asleep in my roommate's room. So I'm venting to Reddit. And tomorrow is a new day... But I feel defeated tonight. "
"""My girl"" only talks to me when she's bored.","It's not too bad I suppose, I'm in a town where I don't really fit in. Sorry about the 'my girl' thing that's just how we talk but anyways, early in our chats she said she wasn't looking for anything serious with me. She lives about 90 miles away but we have been good with chatting through snap and stuff. She only snaps me when she's at work or hanging with other guys. Honestly I dont know why I'm typing this maybe I'm just looking for some magic advice that would get her to have the same feelings I do. 

Thanks for letting me 'voice' my lame stream of consciousness. Have a great St Paddy's day."
Fuck Test Results,"So, two days ago I was mailed my test results from an endoscopy. But they basically told me that I have a precursor for cancer. Essentially, that means that my cells could change & become normal or they could keep being fucked up & become cancerous. 

I'm SO fucking sick and tired of people telling me to ""be positive"" or imagine the best case scenario. I only tell people 'for the info' ... NOT for pity.
Very
By comparison, me getting cancer is not be the absolute worst thing in my life. My son getting cancer, however,  that was my worst thing in my life.

It’s 4 AM. My spring break is ending. It wasn’t enough time.,"I’m a double masters student at my dream school.


My spring break started last Friday — after exams, project drafts, a presentation, and a recital, my second semester into graduate school gave me a breather. But I needed to leave.


I drove back to my home state nine hours away that Saturday, stopping by a friends nearby, before getting home at 2am. I visit because I want him to be a groomsman for my wedding after school. 


I spent the next four days home. Half with friends and half with family. I asked the other groomsman for my wedding as well. There was a constant internal battle between getting work done and enjoying my time home to breathe. Many times I’ve needed to breathe. 


I left Wednesday night, and spent some time sleeping at a rest stop halfway through the drive back, getting back at 11 AM. I pick up a friend from the airport at noon who is here for graduate school visit. 

Thursday and Friday was spent hosting him and showing him around. Enjoyed the company but I still needed to sleep, and dropped him off to the airport at 4 AM into Saturday. 


I got up at 11 AM Saturday. Tripped with three people. This was my one day over break to myself. Enjoyed it, but I should have done work — that thought sat in my head throughout Saturday. 

It is now 3 AM into Sunday. I’ve just finished my schedule down to the hour for the next 48 hours. It’ll get done. I’ll put the work in like before. But God Damn, I want to fucking scream and cry. 


My fiancé and I are long distance for our schools, and we won’t live together until next year. I have some big auditions coming up at the end of the month and a research heavy class with a ton of work Monday. I had to do logistics and handle personnel for a gig Monday. I have to leave my research class early to get ready for the gig happening at the school that evening. I should have emailed my professor as soon as I out, which was two days ago. 


I didn’t.


She’ll understand (I hope). I’ve sat down with her after class before break and told her I’m trying my very best, and the premise of all we are working for. She understands and says I’m on pace with everyone else in class, and to not worry.


I want to tell my fiancé all this right now, but I can’t. 


She’s having a hard time with the long distance, and misses me. A lot. I miss her too, but it pains me knowing there’s still a lot of time left of school  and she’ll be miserable without me there with her to tell her it’s going to be okay.


I’ve been someone strong and stable to keep her together. She has a lot to go through, and I’m not venting to her about this right now because she’s been miserable this week. She couldn’t see family like I did because her flight tickets would have been $600 for four days.


So this is me. Venting. Just wanting to get this out there. I’ll tell my fiancé about all this once they come to pass and we see each other in May. But I’m going to be working like a fucking horse until then. It’s going to get done, that’s the only way. 


Not everyday is going to be great, and not everyday is going to be shit. I just got to admire the moments in my day that make me smile, and most importantly:

Breathe.


Thank you, Reddit for letting me vent."
"Life is good, and gets better, finally!","Last monday i received an offer for a job, after applying for Jobs for over a year. 

Last night i talked to an old high school friend that i wasnt friends with anymore because of something i did in the past. I apologized and stood up for my mistakes, i knew i had to do this and it feels really good to havee this off my chest. We used to be best friends, and i can finally look him in the eyes again. 

Man.. I dont know why i want to share this so much, but it feels so good. It seems like everything is on its way now.. I'm so happy in my heart right now."

I don’t want to be told “be vigilant” when going out with my hijab. I’m tired.,"I don’t know if I’m angry, or frustrated or simply just let down. I just  I don’t want to have to stay vigilant when I leave my house anymore. 

It’s always the same texts, “be safe”, “don’t go out alone”, “come home early”, “be vigilant”, when there’s an attack by either Islamic extremists or an attack on ordinary muslims. I just want to live as I live: peacefully. 

I’m tired. I’m tired of being on the train from work and wondering who might jump on me with insults, tell me I’m not welcome in the country I was born in. 

I’m tired of walking home and wondering if I’m going to be assaulted by a group of people too drunk and offended by their understanding of my faith.

I’m tired of people believing I owe them relief of their ignorance. I am just like you, I want to live, I want a family, friends to go out with, I just don’t want to have to worry if I’m going to be a target. 

I don’t want to have to compromise my identity to feel safe anymore.

I love my Nan,My grandfather recently passed and My nan had been a bit lonely so I’m making an effort to spend time with her. We recently found out that she’s been diagnosed with what contributed to my Pa’s death. (COPD if anyone wants to know) But I keep showing her images and jokes of WholesomeMemes and the smile is totally worth it. She used to breed Chihuahuas so whenever I see anything dog related I show her. As well as cats cause she has 3 cats. 2 that used to belong to us and 1 that kind of just turned up. I’m glad I can bring in the small amount of laughter back to her. I love my Nan and I know she will never see this but I’m glad she’s alive and I’m spending my birthday with her next month and I’m so excited cause I’m turning 18 and I get to spend that time with my Nanny. I’m so glad she is my Nan and I’m glad she gets to spend this important milestone with me. 
I feel like you hate me,"I sent you a text, I just wanted to convey some kindness. You are everything to me. I can’t just stop and put you on hold. I can’t just give you the cold shoulder and silence. I can’t stay mad at you. I love you. I wanted to make sure you knew that. I don’t know how you can hold onto anger so long and with so much hostility. Your silence hurts me more than your words. Why does seeing the message along with nothing from you make me cry? Today was suppose to be a special day. I can put my issues aside for you. I can be kind to you. Seeing that delivered sign, seeing the read message with no response makes my heart drop, tears flow out of eyes. How did we get to this point? Is this what I deserve for going abroad? "
Pretend friends (I know right?),"LONG ASS SHEET HERE EVERIBADEEE
So Hey internet?,for years of browsing the internet I know for sure this shouldnt be here,Im here to tell you that I have been having a pretend company with me for the last 4 or 3 years all ready,though I promise to you I am not mentally Ill lmao 😂,Im here to tell you what and why I have,since I dont have anyone to talk to and its still not the right reason why I should post this In the Internet but here goes nothing,for the past 10 years my life is boring,I have always wished to have an older brother and a set of guy bestfriend to keep me entertained In life but the older brother never came since I am the oldest and my guy friends In real life are,well you never want to know,then there It started,imagining that I actually have what I wanted to happen,escaping reality that I really am lonely In a family of 4,(Heads up if you hate  emotional sheyt) the pretend friends that I had were my travel buddies they made my current travels even more joyful and less boring and my friends,the real life they dont really give much or show much interest when you're down and only give you more insult when you tell them you need a comforting friend and a crying shoulder, since for me I really like to be with funny people with more humor and dark humor that anyone can imagine (no pun intended),though the real reason why I shared this Is I dont know when to stop,I know at some point In time I need to leave It Behind,and deal with reality,but still hoping that time gives me 7 guy friends that cheers me up when Im down though not with the same height and looks,and If that doesnt come In then I need to face reality as It Is,well thats pretty much what I wanted to share,Byeee!"
I can't handle life right now. I'm not suicidal but everything is grey for me now.,"My grandmother died and I'm being kicked out at the end of the month by my mom and her new fiance. I've been here for five months but due to me being basically alone for the first time in my life at age 28 I am super poor with money. 

My grandmother dying has affected me more than I would of thought. I've never had to deal with death before and where I previously had nothing but disdain for her now all the good memories are flooding back and I realize how much she meant to me and now I can never tell her. 

My mom is being totally self serving, she knows my mental condition and my life conditions and promised to always be there for me and to never allow another man come into her life and seperate us but she did.

Her new fiance Joey is an asshole. If I'm hungry I starve because sharing food is a no no. A couple of qoutes from him:

""I am the lord of this household, and my word is law!"" 

or 

""What does it matter if he has anything to eat or not?"" in response to my mom asking me if I had any food, because she knows I'm paying off garnishment debts and struggling with money right now despite working full time. 

The only thing that makes me feel better is weed and that's just numbing the pain, not solving the issue. I can't handle reality right now and I'm contemplating calling out of work today because I don't think I can even handle talking to assholes on the phone all day. 

I don't even know if anyone will read this but if you do could you please just send me some general positivity? I'm struggling with reality right now and I just want to die sometimes."
i don't think i'm ready for the responsibility of adulthood,"hey friends, first time poster on this subreddit. here's the rundown. i am an almost 18 senior in high school, about to graduate in june. i've already been accepted to university and have kickstarted my career in musical theatre (yes, i know, the arts are a dangerous feel but i'm in love with it). however, as my 'time' ticks closer to be an adult, i'm horrified. i'll be living in a house owned by my parents, but my roommate will be my elder brother. i'll be getting my only second real job (my first job is wonderful, but i didn't have to write up a resume and have an interview; my teachers hired me for their private tutoring gig). the one thing that scares me the most is voting. 

&#x200B;

i'll finally be of age to vote. i'm a very outspoken person when it comes to politics (admittedly more moral), and i do feel that it is my responsibility as a US citizen to vote. however, what if i vote for the wrong person? what if i vote for someone who will fuck up the country? 

&#x200B;

i'm also worried about living in a house where i have much more responsibility. i won't have my parents around to remind me to lock the doors, turn off the oven, etc. how am i supposed to be ready for that? how do i ensure that i don't burn down my family's sole home in the US? (US family living abroad, rip)

&#x200B;

finally, what about university? i don't consider myself to be stupid, but i'm definitely not a genius. i'm a hardworking student, but good god, i can be really lazy. i'm worried that when i don't have teachers and my parents on my ass to get my work done, i'll fail all my courses and essentially ruin my life for a good while. the crazy thing? i don't know if that fear is enough motivate me. i have a serotonin deficiency (so genetic depression pretty much) and when i'm down, i'm ***down***. i won't get up to complete any of my responsibilities and no one can motivate me to do otherwise. 

&#x200B;

am i truly ready to accept the responsibilities of what i call 'semi-adulthood'? yes, i won't have to pay taxes and yes, i won't have to pay bills. however, i'm getting triple the responsibilities that i have now, and that's scary. i'm only 17, i don't have real world experiences. am i really ready? am i lying if i say i am?"
I just want to get good at basketball but my mum wont let me leave the house,"I'm getting sick of being the worst person on my basketball team, so I've been wanting to go out and train at the basketball courts that are around a 10 minute walk from my house.

How to beat hate and violence,"Christchurch saddens me as it does most of the rest of the world. The attack is a product of fear and hatred. Violence can only be overcome when fear and hatred are overcome.

The peoples of the world can be divided by race, religion, wealth, education, politics, age, country, and on and on. There seems to be no limit the the number of ways to divide us.  Once divided it's a simple matter to pit us against each other, to make us fear each other, to develop hate for the others.

When some new group shows up in mass in the States they start as isolated and distrusted.  There is fear and hatred until they eventually are assimilated.  Well this is untrue....  It's something I believed most of my life but it's wrong.

What does assimilation look like?  Do they adopt our way of talking, well no more than people from Maine, Boston, Bronx, Nashville, LA, West Virginia.... Hmmm Do they dress the same, well no more than a Wallstreet analyst, a farmer, a construction worker, programmer,.... Do they have the same food?  Crap how mad would you be if you couldn't get tacos, or cheeseburgers, or shawarma, spaghetti, Barbaque ribs......

They dont assimilate by becoming like us.   And, we don't all become the same, that's not assimilation. You see assimilation is when we see and appreciate the differences.  It is familiarity and the lack of fear.  It comes from reaching out and getting to know each other.  When we assimilate we also see the similarities: love of family, kindness, need for meaningful work, etc.

To stop hatred and fear, thus violence the first steps is to make friends.  To reach out and help one another.  Assimilation isn't when someone takes off their burka, rather it's when you see a friend not how they dress.  Both sides use the burkas as a symbol to divide us.  When it no longer matters then it cannot divide us.

Thoughts and prayers are great, but go make some new friends who are unlike any of your current friends.  Find a divide in our world and reach out across that rift.  Yeah it will be uncomfortable outside your comfort zone but thats where all the cool stuff is....  

When enough people reach across a divide and make friends then the divide, the hatred and violence it generates is diminished.  It's one relationship at a time."
They are about to ruin my Life for good,"  

I’m in my early 30's still in college just when I was about to graduate or get my degree, I just needed to finish my Thesis and 6 credits of complementary subjects or classes (IDK which word English is not my native language), the complementary classes as the word says are complementary and no exclusive from your Pensum. Here is where my agony begins as you may assume from the background I left at the beginning yes I should have finished my career years ago actually I spent the half of my life in college and during that time they (my college) made a change of pensum when I was by the half of the career back then, they told me that they will let me finish with my pensum actually at that time it would be better for me the change, it was just the half and it was going to be easier but that wasn’t an option.

However when I managed to finish all my pensum and I was ready to start my thesis a had a tutor and all the stuff,  plot twist my tutor leaves the country for sabbatical year, I had made some progresses on my thesis and he leaves without telling me. Then some big head of the college told me that I have one year to Graduate under my pensum (the old one) or I will be sent to the new pensum, I thought that was ridiculous but I didn’t say nothing because it was possible to complete the remainig things, but I do explained to him about the situation with my Thesis and tutor. The thing it wasn’t just my tutor IDK how I managed myself to made a legal limbo out of my thesis, this big head dude though that my thesis was expired but it wasn’t because the expiration date activates when I introduce a paper at some office and I never did that because I was misinformed by that biatch (the secretary), when I talked personally he didn’t actually believe that I have a Thesis so I send him a letter as he (the big head) requested with my culmination plan were I explained all the details and he keep saying that it was expired and that I should talk to my tutor for an extension of time even after I told him that doesn’t responded my emails.

A few weeks later I decided to write to another professor I knew and explained to him the problem with my thesis and how my tutor abandoned me, he helped me to find a solution but he reply almost 3 months later and when I was on the middle of an internship to complete part of the 6 credits form the complementary subjects, however I found a day to travel and deliver the letter, I didn’t want it to email the letter to a dude who delays 3 months in reply a freaking email. In the letter I explained the details of the situation with my thesis and I added a note at the “**Please send me your resolution to this letter via email because I live out of the city**” and they know this kind of stuffs they have seen how the matriculates have decreased because of the lack of money and you think that they may understand because we live on the same country (Venezuela). I sent that letter a 28 of September and came back to my internship which I finish and deliver by November, I let December pass and that professor I knew had told me that he would give me the answer “personally” (we leave 4 hours of distance I think he meant by phone) however I believe in him, he was my favorite teacher.

On January 2019 I texted him asking when are they going to reunite the commission and made a decision about my thesis and he replies telling me that ""**they have made a resolution long ago""**, I have to play cool to made him tell me the resolution and he did. He told me that I could take another thesis and I was fine with that, I just wanted to be free to move on with that matter. 

   Here is my surprise when they mail last week me telling me that if I don’t present a thesis by April I’ll be sent to the new Pensum, What does that mean to me? That means despite the similarities between both pensums that means 20 more Subjects or Classes after I had finished all my pensum 2 years or more When I feeling to old for that and more important I can’t do it, I can’t afford lodging anymore. They are killing me I don’t have plan B I don’t know is this is definitive I haven’t talked to them yet, they made a resolution on the faculty Council with the deadline on april but was a generic one for all the people on the Old pensum, They are ignoring the fact that during the ultimatum year they were wandering around a decision.  

It’s hard to believe that the time was running in those conditions Im paying the price of staying alive, I was depressed even before the huge economic crisis; my autistic spectrum disorders didn’t make my life easy and the rejection of the people, classmates, etc. I was a complete looser outcast, outsider. I decided to stay alive approved my whole pensum, they made a new rule that includes the thesis to fuck my life for good. Im gonna try to make them understand sacrificing my dignity, but it’s hard now I can’t even die, I just think about how my parents are going to pay for my funeral? My parents have been so supportive I can’t even imagine how to tell them, they paid for almost my whole career and now they may not see the results.  "
My best friend wants me to apologize for something I don't regret,"It's a long back story but basically we are going to friends couple therapy to talk it out and she thinks I betrayed her, but I honestly don't think I did and don't know if I should apologize still and lie or explain with the possibility of us not being friends at the end.

&#x200B;

Basically, I am about to graduate from college and have been reflecting a lot. I realized I am very lonely and isolated and am doing what I can in these final months to make amends and leave college not regretting the relationships I left behind/never had/rejected.

&#x200B;

I apologized to my best friend's \~enemy\~ (who was our mutual best friend formerly) for cutting her out at the request of my current best friend, who felt betrayed by the \~enemy\~. I regret my delivery in how I told my current best friend that I did so, but I don't regret trying to be at least comfortable with the third person and making amends.

&#x200B;

I was starting to write the whole back story for everything, but I realized its all pretty much bullshit over the span of two years and pseudo-Victorian drama that takes a small novel to describe."
I beat my depression today,"Today i went through a pretty intense depressive epsiode where i just couldn't physically move and just wanted to lye in bed crying and not do anything.  it's insane how hard it can be to get out of bed when this happens.  

I find having a shower and getting clean helps me get through it but i pushed even further and actually left the house and went shopping. I was fighting bursting into tears for most of the time and i even saw an old friend but made it through the interaction without being weird.  

I'm so insanely proud of myself for getting through it.  Usually i dont experience these episodes during the day,  they always creep on me late at night but this is the first time i made it through and felt better.  

No one really understands how this effects me which can make it really hard to explain to family and friends. I haven't told anyone about today but i feel like i have set myself a personal best. I made it through the episode before i got to the point where i had suicidal thoughts.  I did this by myself and its insane how good this feels. 

If anyone experiences the same thing, feel free to message me and we can talk about this stuff because i know a lot of people just dont want to hear about it and it makes you feel so alone.  

Tl; dr. I pushed myself to get through a depressive epsiode all by myself today and im so proud of myself.  

Edit: one thing that I'm not sure if is good or bad is I'm a comfort eater and i went and bought a lot of comfort foods.  I dont eat them all at once but i feel like the highlight of my day is coming home and having some of my favourite foods.  I dont purge or have an eating disorder but does anyone else experience this? "
"What the hell do I do now? [tw: sexual abuse, suicide]","Hi,

I honestly don't know if this is the right place for this. I just need to get something out there so it isn't all stuck in my head. I apologize if this is all incoherent.

&#x200B;

I don't even know where to start.

&#x200B;

I guess I'll just start by saying I recently cut ties with my family. I am 20 years old and in college several states away from them. I do not have their financial support and have not seen them since August 2018. Not many people know this about me-- I kinda try to keep it to myself because y'know... it opens up the conversation as to why I don't talk to my family, and I'm not entirely comfortable sharing my reasoning quite yet. 

&#x200B;

Why? Because it's quite personal and graphic and I don't necessarily want people I interact with on a daily basis to see me differently because of it. Long story short, I grew up in a very unsupportive, manipulative household. Growing up, my parents always told me everyone was out to get me. That the only people I could trust were family members. That nobody would ever love me as much as they did. That if I ever turned my back on family, I'd be going to hell.

&#x200B;

As manipulative as that was, it was not the worst thing that happened to me at home. All throughout high school and until I left for college, I was molested by my (younger) autistic brother. Multiple times a week, I would wake up to him on top of me or touching me in inappropriate places. My parents were well aware of the situation and told me that since my brother didn't know what he was doing, the things he was doing to me were entirely my fault. They told me it was because of the way I dressed. The way I acted. 

&#x200B;

At the time, I was too terrified to do anything about the situation. I was scared I would ruin my family's wellbeing if I spoke up. So I stayed quiet. Nothing changed until my brother unabashedly felt up a girl at school. After that, my family had a social worker in our house on a daily basis to teach him social norms and such. I believe it was around this time that he starting seeing a psychiatrist for meds, as well.

&#x200B;

Although action was finally being taken to stop my brother's actions, they continued. I ultimately installed a chain lock (like the kind people have on their front doors) on my little sister's and my bedroom doors because it was the only way I could think of to keep him out of my room. My parents were NOT happy about that. They accused me of hiding things from them and threatened to take my door off its hinges. They told me I was disappointing them and that I should trust that my brother didn't have bad intentions.

&#x200B;

So the cycle of sexual abuse continued. The majority of my senior year of high school was spent with me rarely home. When I was home, I would spend all my time locked in my room to avoid confrontation and keep myself safe. 

&#x200B;

I think the week that finally broke me was one where I suddenly fell extremely ill. It was the summer after my senior year. Many days I'd be out of the house hanging out with friends, making the most of our time before going our separate ways for college. My parents saw this as me abandoning my family. One day, I got EXTREMELY nauseous. This nausea escalated to the point where I was unable to keep any food/water down-- I'd spend a significant portion of the day dry heaving because there was nothing left in my stomach. I was extremely weak and could barely make it to the bathroom on my own.

&#x200B;

My parents refused to help me. They told me that from that point forward, I would ""get what I gave"" to my family. Since they thought I was abandoning them, they completely abandoned me during a time of need. My friends were the ones that ended up taking me to the hospital. It was eventually determined that the nausea was caused by a medication prescribed to me for my anxiety.

&#x200B;

I thought things would die down when I left for college. They didn't. My parents attempted to micromanage me and send manipulative messages about how much they loved me and couldn't wait for me to come home. Living away from my family for the first time made me realize how FUCKED UP my life with them was. All throughout freshman year I struggled coming to terms with what happened to me. It was not until my sophomore year that I finally talked to a professional about it. My therapist was appalled when I told him about my upbringing. He contacted CPS (they didn't find anything) and helped me work through all the difficult thoughts and emotions my family caused.

&#x200B;

The week before Thanksgiving, I made the decision to stay on campus for break. I decided it would be detrimental to my mental health to put myself back in such a toxic home. When I told my parents, they immediately threatened physical violence (driving all the way to my school and forcibly dragging me home) because they ""deserved to see their child."" This sent me into a panic attack. I could not and would not put myself back in a situation where I would get abused again. Not after I had FINALLY started to heal from it all.

&#x200B;

In a panic, I called my university's after hours counseling line, who then directed me to the police, who assured me that if my parents did show up on campus, they would promptly be asked to leave. I informed my parents of this and subsequently blocked both of their numbers.

&#x200B;

I think that's when I knew my life would never be the same. I have not talked to my parents since. I spent winter break couch hopping and have declared myself as an independent student. Things are definitely difficult now, but I feel a sense of relief knowing I don't have to go back to my family any time soon. I currently work two jobs (between them I typically work 30 hours a week) alongside an intensive class schedule so I can make ends meet. This past week I caved under the pressure of it all and started having serious thoughts of suicide. On my brother's birthday, I received a voicemail from my younger sister telling me I ruined my family. At a therapy appointment the next day, I broke down and was eventually sent to the ER. Half of my spring break was spent in an inpatient facility. I was discharged a couple days ago.

&#x200B;

I'm currently sitting at work, unsure of where to go from here. I don't even know what I'm trying to accomplish by posting this. I guess I just want support... or words of encouragement... or advice... I don't know. I'll take anything. I'm just tired of dealing with this on my own. 

&#x200B;

thanks for coming for my ted talk.

&#x200B;

tl;dr: grew up with manipulative family, was molested by younger brother and got blamed for it, recently went no contact because of it, unsure of where to go next"
a diary entry sort of thing?,"dont think about future children
dont think about future home
dont think about marriage
dont treat it like it’s a long term relationship if the other person makes it seem like it’s short term.

is it normal to be in this many arguments and go through this much misery in the first year of the relationship? is it normal to be in love while also feeling the worst you’ve ever felt with them? is it normal to be insecure about myself when i see other women now? is it normal to feel like i can’t share my emotions without making the other person angry? is it normal to be this jealous? is it normal to be upset if the other person is happy and it doesn’t involve you? is it normal to feel like the one that loves you wants to cheat on you all the time? would it all be better if i shut myself off again? would it all be better if i just stopped treating this like something long-term, and just stopped caring so fucking much? i don’t understand how to do this relationship shit, and i have nothing to reference to because i haven’t been in any real relationships besides this one. i haven’t experienced the things that he has experienced. do i need to be experienced in other relationships in order to help make this one last? don’t get me wrong, i’m not interested in anyone else at all. i love having someone that’s here to support me, but at the same time, they’re killing me. i just don’t know what the best option is anymore. who the hell do i ask for help? God? a therapist? a new friend that probably has a bias opinion? the family that i ran away from? who? who the fuck do i ask. because i don’t know what to do anymore. i’m crazy in love, but this shit is actually making me lose my fucking mind, and self. who am i? why did i suddenly want to be in graphic design? is it because of him, or is it because of me? i don’t know anymore. i’m fucking lost. i forgot how to speak to people. i stutter and slur and mess up my words all the time now. one time i went to pick up a pizza and thought i was gonna faint because i was so nervous. what the fuck is wrong with me? why am i like this now? is it because i haven’t made any friends here yet? is it because my dad sexually harassed me? did he fuck me up forever? when did my stomach pains start? i don’t know anymore. it could’ve been when i started constantly fucking smoking, or when i constantly ate bad food, or was it when i lost myself? who the fuck knows anymore. will i ever get better? or will i be so tired of the pain one day and just blow my fucking brains out? or will i end up lonely on the streets shooting up heroin? will i ever be able to have a normal sleeping schedule? will i ever enjoy going to events anymore without thinking something is gonna fuck it up? will i ever have something that only gives me joy? will i ever be able to make good friends? what if i choose my profession and then change my mind and have to start all over again? what i get so depressed that i’m not motivated to work/study anymore? what if my depression and anxiety never go away? what if i can never stop smoking weed because i’m so dependent on it? what if i can never stop biting my nails, never stop swearing, never stop being a negative nancy? what if i realize that i don’t really have the same humor as my partner? humor is a huge thing for me. it’s like the #1 thing i look for. what if i ever got pregnant? would i abort it or keep it? and who the fuck would i ask advice from then?? everyone has a bias opinion. what if our arguments never change? i don’t wanna end up like p and n. imagine raising kids together and being together for so long and still having immature fights instead of mature controlled ones. at this point, i feel like i have to build a wall around my heart. if i keep letting things hurt me so badly, i don’t know what i’ll fucking do. i’m already sick enough as it is. i don’t want to lose my fucking oxygen and choke on my throwup anymore. i don’t want to feel my entire body go fucking numb. i’ve never felt that until i met you. i’ve never felt my legs, feet,arms,hands, and lips all numb at the same time before. who are you? who am i?"
It hurts me that you tell me u love me and yet you want be in an unofficial relationship and that’s why I had to end it,You call me babe and tell me you love me yet you wanna be in a unofficial relationship I’m sorry but I can’t hurt anymore and it’s time to move on I love you and always will but I need to work solely on me.....I’m sorry it has be this Way 
I reconnected with an old old friend and instead of feeling good it feels weird.,"Last month I reconnected with an old old friend who meant a great deal to me once, but we had a falling out about 8 years ago. I have thought about her on and off through the years and last month I was like 'this is ridiculous, why would I let somebody who once meant so much to me slip out of my life forever?' so I contacted them. We live far away from each other so we had a long 6 hour chat via messenger. It was great, and so nice to be back in touch. The other day I messaged her again and we had a good talk too, but it's starting to feel weird. It's weird how this person has grown and changed and I don't really know her anymore. The person I thought she was has been gone for years. And I'm sure she feels the same - the person she thinks I am has been gone for years as well. I knew she would have changed but I guess it's weird to just...see it. In some way, I feel like I've tarnished the memory of how much she means to me by contacting her again. 

I'm sure this won't last, and both of us would love to be friends again. It'll just take a bit of time. But it is weird. It feels weird.  "
I don’t know what to do,"Recently my ex posted a short paragraph slandering me to her followers and made me look like complete shit, I know I shouldn't let it bother me but the stuff she wrote about sorta wrecked my ego :/
I just don't know what to do and wanted to get it off my chest"
I want to hurt the people who made me angry,I want to hurt the people who are not my friends anymore and then I want to kill myself. The people who talked down to me and treated me like someone who was lower than them. Someone come fucking kill me. I'm a fucking inhuman piece of trash. I deserve to die. I'm not even human. I deserve to have my throat slit and then fucked because that's how I deserve to be treated. Like trash. 
Musings on sexuality,"I've identified as bisexual since junior high. I don't remember having some sort of crazy revelation or earth shattering moment, I've just always liked both men and women. The earth is round, water is wet, I'm attracted men and women. I've gone through phases where I had a preference for one or the other. I'm happily married to a man and I have no desire to be with anyone else. With that being said, lately I've been mentally mulling over my sexuallity. When I really think about it, it's not that I'm attracted to both men and women. It's that I can be attracted to anyone. I see beauty as beauty regardless of  what genitals someone might happen to have or what gender they identify as. I could have fallen for anyone, had I not met my husband... I just now looked into this and realized that there is a title for this, pansexual. At nearly thirty I have a way to identify myself. It feels silly, but it's exciting to put a word to it. "
Sometimes I forget how horrifying it actually was,"Lately I have been feeling like I need to scream out ~My Story~ to everyone I know. Instead I’m gonna talk here. 

On the night before Halloween 2015, my favorite holiday, I attended a work party. I remember being really happy - I loved my job then, and the people I worked with. We went to a bar after, I consumed alcohol, my friend put me in a taxi home.

And then.... nothing.  

I remember walking into the park near my apartment, I think. With a man - I remember clearly he told me he was 53, but I have no idea of the context. I was 20, in college, and probably a foot shorter and 100 lbs lighter than him. He had a dog, a pit bull. He wore a page boy cap. 

The next thing I remember clearly is being on my back, on the rubber mats on the playground. He raped me and I sobbed the whole time. I asked him to stop and he told me to “be quiet or we’ll get in trouble.” I remember seeing the dog tied to one of the poles. I had only had sex once before that, and this time it was so fucking painful. I realized the next morning that I had bled from it, my jeans were covered in it

I got dressed somehow, but I don’t remember. I remember walking home with him after, vaguely, at maybe 3 or 4 am. I remember carefully dazed turning down my street, said goodbye (fuck) and then i slept. I never saw him again.

The first thing I did the next morning was throw up. And then I did that for months, with no idea of the source (......morning sickness). I took a pregnancy test alone on new year’s eve - yup, positive. I got an abortion like six days later, at 12 weeks. And then I stayed alive somehow, though it was really hard sometimes, and now it’s been three and a half years since.

Sometimes I forget that this thing happened to me, and sometimes I feel like I am going to drown in it. Some of the details of it honestly sound more like a lifetime movie than my life. I don’t know. Everyone has their own trauma I guess? 

Thank you for listening "
My brother and I are unfairly stuck in the middle of my parents potential divorce,"A little backstory. My parents have been married 25 years, mostly happy. I consider the marriage successful no matter how it ends. But both my parents are in poor health, (dad had a massive car accident and esophageal cancer, mom has had cancer a few times and has bad COPD/other conditions) and its clear this plays a role in their arguments. It’s almost 18 months since my dads accident and he’s still getting surgeries on his knees/feet while my mom can’t really even do physical activities like she used to. This has both impacted the quality of their lives and leads to arguments (mainly from my mom aimed at my dad) that should both be able to do more. This idea of potential divorce also isn’t new, as this happened last year without anything coming to fruition. They also basically lead separate lives all while raising my younger brother while I’m away at school.

My dad has been calling me for a couple days and just venting all his frustrations with his marriage to my mom. And a lot of what he says is right and I agree with him but I’m therefore thrust in the middle of the situation. And I have stake in both sides. So while I hear him out, it’s frustrating knowing that 1. He’s right about a few things and 2. It’s still my mom and I hate thinking of her negatively. 

I then call my brother who’s in high school and he gets upset bc it’s clear he’s being used as a pawn. My dad waits until my mom and my brother are together before launching a tirade and storming out the house. Then my mom will use my brother as ammo for her arguments. So I have my dad calling me to vent and my brother very upset and begging me to come home so the pressure can ease up for him.

Then to top it off, I have my mom just fishing for information, making assumptions about what my dad tells me on the phone. And this isn’t without her talking shit on my dad. All the while she is attempting to get my brother to side with her which works, even though she’s just as in the wrong as my dad. So I have my dad venting, my brother being thrown right in the middle, and my mom fishing for for me to reveal what my dad says. It honestly just kills me to see my brother so upset and being treated like that.

It felt really cathartic writing this, hope someone sees it and understands the situation.

How should I deal with my jealous friend?,I have two best friends who I love equally but lately one friend has been feeling left out and jealous. Me and friend A (the one who is feeling left out) hang out together everyday and friend A hangs out with friend B loads too. Recently me and friend B went out together (which we never do) and friend A got jealous. I never hang out with friend B and I don't know how to stop friend A from being jealous. We explained to friend A that there is no need for her to be jealous but she still is. What should I do?
"If you’re the parent of a teenager, please don’t brush off their problems as “a teen problem” or “a phase”","I’m 16. Earlier, I was eating lunch with my family, and my mom decides to mention how I’m “too sensitive.”

This was in reference to what happened a few days ago when was crying to my cousin about how emotionally abusive my parents are to me and that I have never once felt comfortable enough to open up and talk to them about what’s going on in my life, or my problems. 

They think that the reason I was upset was because they wouldn’t buy me a new computer. But that is SO FAR from the actual reason. I was upset BECAUSE of how emotionally abusive my parents are, and on that particular day I vented to my cousin, I was just about to snap. 

For the record, I remained level-headed and kept my tone neutral throughout, and did not raise my voice or show attitude. 

I then calmly said to them, “That’s not the reason I was upset at all..”

They laughed at me. My mom laughed so hard that she probably would’ve started crying. 

I said, “Why are you laughing at me?”

My dad chimes in and says, “She’s not laughing at you, she’s laughing at the fact that arguing with you is equivalent to talking to a brick wall, or arguing with herself.” 

What the fuck? I said, “Since when were we arguing?” 

My dad said, “Well, I don’t know why you went crying to Karen (fake name for my cousin) about not getting a new computer.” 

Then my mom said, “Eh, teenage years. Wait ‘til these two *motions towards my younger siblings* get there. Then we’ll have to deal with this again.” 

I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I started crying. 

They laughed again, and said, “why are you crying now?” 

I said, “that’s NOT what I was upset over. I was not upset over not getting a computer.” 

My dad laughs again. “Okay, well, I don’t even care anymore.” 

Again, I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. “What? So you don’t care that I was upset?” 

My mom rolls her eyes at me. “u/XianGui, just eat your food.” 

No, I don’t want to fucking “just eat” when there’s a problem! I will never understand the logic behind just sweeping it under the carpet when someone is clearly upset about it. Maybe I’m missing something here, but I feel like shit right now.

I genuinely just wanted to sit down and talk with them over what the actual reason was, but I couldn’t because they were too busy laughing at me. 

I just got done sobbing in my room for about an hour and a half now. It feels great that there is absolutely no validity to my problems because I’m “just a teenager and it’s a phase.” /s"
I think my GF's mom is into bestiality,"On several occasions my girlfriend's mother has made comments that make me think she and the family dog have been intimate. He is a 130 lb. Lab / Akita mix who is just a pure drooling, barking, and humping machine. He is not fixed, still has all of his equipment. She is constantly petting, rubbing and playing with him. Cooing and making baby talk. She will make uncomfortable remarks about his genitalia and how he is such a *BIG* masculine dog.  
 
Her husband died a few years ago and she has not really re-entered the dating scene, so I think the dog has become a replacement for a lover. While it may not be hurting anyone it sure is uncomfortable. Any and all advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance!"
Why are females in constant competition with each other?,"It's strange how we keep advocating to empower women and how patriarchy is bad and feminism is good and woot de woot yet it's women who tend to really bring other women down.

It just feels like females are in a constant competition with each other, even when they're friends. There's always the prettier one, the smarter one, the fit one, and there's always that hidden contempt for whoever excels more in an aspect that you care about.

It's sad to hear females say things that they wouldn't want to be said about themselves to fellow females . It's sad to hear all the judgmental and often unfair comments. Then there's the useless and absolutely draining drama that starts and lives on.

Im not saying this to hate on a whole gender but to just get things off my chest. Sharp words and emotional blows really take a toll on me and it's always so disappointing when it's served by a fellow woman who knows full well the implications of those actions but chooses not to care in that moment as long as she's ahead.

I’ve lost my grandpa one year ago on this day,He was such a lovable person. And i hope he is resting in piece wherever he is. Love you grandpa and i miss you. Life is not the same without you.
A friends priorities have made me lose their trust in them.,"I haven't said anything to this person yet but I'm posting it here because I need to tell let it out. Maybe I should say something, maybe not. 
I helped a friend get a job in the same country I'm living in and at first I was happy with the idea of haivng this person working with me. And she is what I would call a close friend. We worked at a different company in the past and got along just fine but it feels like here, while things are fine on the surface, I've really lost my trust in this person. 

I decided I would help this person by paying for thier flight over and they would pay me back later on, with their first or second paycheck. The flight wasn't very expensive and I even said if she wanted to pay me back a little bit at a time that would be fine.  I also helped her out with some living expenses for the first couple months. It was things like lunches and dinners, not a big deal in my book. Every so often she would mention she would get me back for these things when we would get paid. I never really pushed this because it really isn't an issue for me financially speaking. 

After their second month I asked if she was okay paying for things on her own and she said yes and offered to pay me back for things that I helped here out with. We agreed that $1000 was a fair amount for all that she owed me and I put no pressure for her to pay me back just to pay me back when she could.  Then it felt like at first she couldn’t do it because she needed to pay back on her loans, and then it was because she wanted to buy Christmas presents for her family and friends. And now it’s all quiet because I know either she’s not saying anything in hopes I forgot or because she doesn’t want to pay anymore. Instead she’s making plans to travel and recently she put down a deposit to get some tattoos done. 

I think the tattoo is the thing that finally broke me in terms of trust and belief that this person is at all honest. For someone who never has money she somehow is going to buy two tattoos for herself. 

It just put a lot of things into perspective. I helped her keep her job here after it came out that she was slacking at work and was going to be fired. I heard from my boss that I was the reason she was going to be kept on after I spoke to the boss personally and asked for him to reconsider. I remember explaining this to her and didn’t get a thank you or anything like that. I brushed it off and considered it just her overall personality. Then something like her sending her makeup and some other birthday gifts got a full thank you and post on Instagram. I don’t know how to describe the feeling, I’m not someone who usually gets bothered by that kind of stuff, usually I get a bit embarrassed when people thank me, it’s just my personality. Just something rubbed me the wrong way about the whole thing. 

I’ve lost all trust in this friend and I’m going to cut off contact when they leave to go back home at the end of the year. I know I’m to blame because I let her slide by and have been passive about asking for my money back. Instead I get worried about how she would react because I’ve seen her get angry about this stuff before and often times it just leads nowhere. I’m not the best when it comes to arguing with people. 

At this point I don’t know what to do, I know she’s leaving at the end of the year to go back home. All I know is that I’m never going to lend anyone money ever again. 

TL;DR-I have a friend who I've lent money to and has made no intentions so far of paying me back. She's decided things like getting tattoos and presents for her family, friends, and going on overseas trips are more important than paying me back.

Another Sad Day,"So my mum just pointed out how I'm terrible at interacting with people. She kept repeating how I only have four friends. I didn't go out to reunion, and so on and so on. 


I know very well I'm terrible at making friends. Idk why I'm like this. I think I used to making friends just fine. I always been shy but I did have many friends back then. The thing is, why I only have four friends, it's because I'm tired for always being the one who tried to keep in touch with my other group of friends in High School. I'm tired of being the one who always wanted to meet up. So then I just gave up. I decided I'll only keep the ones who genuinely wants to be with me. And the reason I don't go out to reunion, or any event with bunch of people is because I'm so terrible at making friends, I'll end up feeling lonely and sad afterwards. I tried to have conversations with people but I couldn't keep it going. I thought, why would I do something that will make me feel sad afterwards. 


I really don't know what I should do. I'm already so frustrated with myself. I haven't been happy with my own self. And after my mum pointed that out, it makes me even more frustrated. She also complains how I never really share anything to her. I always keeping everything to myself, but I just couldn't do it. I feel embarrassed and ridiculous every time I share my feelings. 


Ugh!!! It's just so frustrating!!"

"I know this is a cliche, but my parents and teachers really hyped up my potential and now that I’m an adult it’s really fucking with my head.","I dont know. I have a learning disability that made me really quirky but still pretty smart, and everyone really hyped up that last part. I’m also a programmer and The Social Network came out when I was in high school is everyone made jokes all the time about how I was gonna be a rich famous tech guy. Teachers were the worst- I think the fact that I had an LD made me like an exotic teaching challenge for them. They all told me and my parents how I wasn’t like other kids and I was destined to do great things. It feels like a humble brag writing it, but I’m honestly just a mediocre dude who picked a lucrative field and now if I’m anything short of Mark Zuckerberg I’ll feel like a failure. 

I have a great job and a great life but I still have this perpetual state of wasting my “potential”. "
To a old friend.,"Hey friend, remember back when we were in grade school? How we had a little group. How you would tell us about the man you wish to become? How you wanted a wife, and some children? I remember.. I remember how we all used to sit at the table at lunch time with our little group. Laugh at each other's jokes and stories. Felt like time would last forever. We made promises to each other our group would last forever. In middle school we got put into different classes, we couldn't sit together at lunch. We still talked online though. It was fun, but it wasn't the same. We still talked like there was no tomorrow though. We still tried to hangout at school, we all tried to get gym class together. We all tried to do our best to do things together. I had no choice but to move in high school. We only could talk online with our group. Those dreams faded as we all graduated, and I was in a different school. We all slowly stopped talking to each other. We became adults and had to do adult things you know? We all had jobs, had to pay bills and had no time to be social online anymore. Time, ..was getting short. It seemed like there wasn't enough time to talk anymore. So I finally moved back. Moving back didn't change anything because we were all living different lives. Friends were joining the military, or others were trying to survive. I wish I had more time with you. With our group. Yesterday I found out that you had died that morning. That you made a terrible choice cause you were alone. I seen our group sobbing over you. Old friends coming together saying they wish you were here. I felt like I had no right to sympathize with them, did I have a right to cry? I felt like I was a terrible person cause I had moved away and we became so distant. We used to be bros, but I felt like I was the one who abandoned you. We tried so hard, and made so many promises. Yet I tried too late. I hope I am not hated for leaving, and for that I am sorry. 

Godspeed old friend."
I hate my roommate,"My roommate used to be my best friend. Until recently I didn't know what a horrible, manipulative person she is. I don't want to post stories because I'm afraid she'll find me but she has broken my boundaries, alienated me from the rest of my friends, and constantly guilt trips me. I can't wait to move out at the end of the semester. I feel intense anxiety just being around her and I want to throw up. She still pretends to like me and be nice to me because she thinks I'm stupid and don't know what she's done. I've let her walk all over me and I hate myself the most."
"Giving boys the impressions that it's a shamefull thing to feel emotions, cry or hug is bs.","Boys are so socialized to be independent and strong and not needy, and it's harmfull.

U get boys who are so touch deprived, and unhappy because of it, u cant express ur emotions, ur told to man up or don't act like a girl when u cry, ur taught to not seek romance especially in younger years but ""play the field"" ur told u need to be strong not ask for hugs, not ask for help, be independent ,"" u need to bring food to the table later and how are you going to do that if u don't man up""

A father can't cry, be strong for the children . Fucking bs. Telling kids emotions are something to be ashamed about isn't a healthy thing, hug ur 15 yo, tell your kid it okay to cry and express his feelings and lead by example . I think our society would be completely diffrent.

We are told we can't hug people or have any kind of physical contact with people, the only thing that's socially acceptable is sex.

Boys seek the attachments and contact they need, most boys become sex obsessed because it's the only socially acceptable way to achieve it.

Society: surprised pickachu face. "
I might go viral thanks to a crazy woman,"I was on the metro today on my way to a friend’s house. I luckily found a place so I didn’t have to stand up for god knows how long. This woman in front of me is staring me up and down as if I had just killed her dog, I think nothing of it and keep my eyes on my phone when suddenly, she tells this woman standing next to her that boys these days have no respect and should me more disciplined, etc a lil bit loudly while glancing at me from time to time and then she asks me why I didn’t let her have my seat (keep in mind she didn’t ask me politely beforehand) and i tell her that i took the seat first. She then whips out her phone and starts recording, making a scene out of such a simple situation, insulting me and shoving the camera on my face, calling me all kinds of names and basically just being totally insane. She keeps it up for nearly 12 minutes or so, ending her rampage by telling me that I AM gonna be on the wall of shame and all over the internet for being lazy and rude.

I make guys like me,"Today I found out my ex moved on. And I realized I need to stop making guys like me in order to feel better about myself. But I also realized that I am destined to be alone, because without actively trying I truly believe that no one will ever love me or truly be interested in me. 

I believe that because to put it bluntly: I am ugly. I have bad skin, hair that does not know what it wants to be, and not the best features. You would never look twice at me or focus on my face in a crowd of me and my friends. Nothing is really wrong, but nothing is right either. And I have actively tried throughout my life to make up for it in any way I can. I am known to be the funny one in my friend group, I was popular in high school, I am smart and knowledgable, and pride myself in having high emotional intelligence. I can easily connect with people and know exactly what to say in order to connect with specific different people. However, I was never the one guys were interested in. I have beautiful girlfriends. Beautiful like you would not believe. And throughout my life, I have never been the focus. Guys have never approached me. No one has ever called me beautiful or described me as so. And honestly - its soul-crushing. I pretended like it did not matter, but it truly did shape how I value myself. If you are not ugly, then you simply don't understand how much harder life is for those of us that are. I have to work ten times harder to be noticed. I have to constantly seek people to be friends with because I know for sure no one will even try to talk to me. And in the romance world, I am basically invisible. And so how I combatted that was making guys like me. And to my defense, at first, I did not do it intentionally. But as I grew up I realized what I was doing and how deeply my insecurities affected me. And hearing that my ex moved on was the last straw.

My ex is weird. Not in a bad way, but he is just shy, quiet, and has niche interests. He usually keeps to himself. However, he is attractive. He is tall and has a handsome face. It feels bad saying this but this is usually the type of guy I would go for. Guys that did not have much prior dating experience (I was his first kiss) or that were very outgoing and popular with girls. I then proceeded to grow incredibly close to him. If you asked him, he probably would tell you its because we get along so well. But its actually because I molded myself: my interests and personality so that I would basically be his perfect match. I listened to all the type of music he liked, I let him talk about himself endlessly, made him open up about his insecurities, and was always there for him. I even sent him memes targeted for his specific type of humor. And at the moment, I probably convinced myself our relationship was progressing naturally, but truthfully I was changing myself so he would like me. And of course, because I was the first girl to show interest in him I knew he would like me because he did not have any prior dating experience. I would never let the conversation end, I would talk about topics I knew he was interested in, I never even shared things about myself really. I was just focused on making him feel like the centre of the world. I gave him attention and because he never really had that before, he grew attached to me. He poured out his heart to me, would treat me like a queen, he told me he loved me, and even wrote and produced various songs about me. All our friends would comment on how lucky I was that he was so in love with me. But I knew it was partly fabricated. But I tried to hold on to him for so long because being loved felt amazing. I was desperately willing to sacrifice anything because I just wanted to have that feeling. For someone to actually be interested in me. But the usual happened. He grew tired of me and realized there was more out there. It happened slowly and it was painful. It was like seeing something deteriorate infront of your eyes. I remember the breaking point was one our mutual friends told him: ""Yo, you can do so much better than her. Yeah she has a good personality, but she is not that attractive."" and I guess because he began to notice it too, and notice that he could get more attractive girls he started to pull away from me. and now hearing that he has moved on (with someone who is a lot prettier than me) I cant help but feel so sick. I never want to change myself ever again for someone. And not only because I have decided its wrong but because I realized that no matter how hard I try, they will eventually realize what a scam I am. I can not keep someone interested in me. I am just destined to be alone. And I need to stop filling myself with false fantasies and hopes. Everyone around me can see it. I constantly go for guys who are underrated because I know that I can never do better. But here's the thing: No matter how underrated they are, they will always be better than me. I hate this feeling and I hate my need for validation. If I could just accept that this is my luck in this world I would be better off. I have great friends and a loving family. Life could be worse.

i don’t want to die [16F],"so i recently saw the news of louis tomlinson’s sister fizzy dead at only 18 years old due to suspected cardiac arrest. i was in shock and my heart broke at the thought louis grieving over his sister, two years after his mother passed away of leukaemia. he just released a song that describes him mourning and missing his mother; now he cancelled his promo to mourn another missing family and it makes me sad. (i am a fan, if you haven’t figured it out) 

i was afraid i was going to die at a young age due to unseen circumstances and i felt actual fear from not living my life to the fullest when i imagined myself dying at 18.

a bit about myself, i don’t think i am depressed, i never sought professional help for my issues. i was always insecure and felt that everyone hated me and were just pretending to like me. i had been bullied in high school and i felt like everyone thought i was a loner and had friendship issues (which i did) my best guy friend who i previously had a crush stopped talking to me all of a sudden and it felt like my life had no purpose. this was 2015-2016. 

my family was my pillar of support and i was really grateful for them cos they were who i could go to when i had a bad day and they were people that could cheer me up. however, i nv told them of the emotional baggage i had cos i didn’t want them to worry. one of the reasons why i didn’t jump out of the 13th floor was because of them.

cut to 2-3 years later (now), and i feel like i have friends that genuinely care about me and would go all out to help me or spend time with me. i have graduated but i still keep in touch with most of my close friends. it felt really nice because even though we are all in different schs, we still shared the same good memories and now share the new experiences we are going through.

i don’t want to die, i want to make my parents proud because i feel like i always underperform in national exams. i want to start being confident of being myself and making new friends in my new school. i wanna get a bf who cares abt me even though i’m scared i won’t and will just be single for the rest of my life. i want to have kids and be married to the love of my life. these things aren’t going to be easy to achieve but i’m willing to work hard for them cos that’s the beauty of life. 

i feel that life is abt setting goals and targets & achieving them through one’s hard work, while in the process feeling emotions & learning new things & meeting new people. thank you if you’ve read till here ❤️ "
"I’m lonely. I hate saying that, because I have an amazing husband who I have been married to for 14 year and is absolutely amazing. I am lonely for a friend. I am horrible at making and keeping friends. I do not get invited out on girls nights. I never get invited to weddings or things like that.","It’s weird because I am pretty normal. Hold down a good job. Co-workers include me I occasionally am invited out to lunch by a few of the girls. But my personal life I am so lonely for a friend. Here’s what happens. I make a friend, we totally hit it off. (I am also a very attentive mom of 2 and like I said me and my husband get along great so usually I spend my weekends with them. )So that does not leave much time for new friend. I rarely ever initiate phone calls or texts because usually about 3 weeks into the friendship I have convinced myself that my new friend is way to busy to talk to me or I will be totally bothering them. I have gone through this same cycle my whole life and I hate it. I know I can have great relationships. I see it in my marriage and in the relationship I have with my kids. Are some people just not meant to have friends? And only meant to have family? Sometime I want that person I can call and ask to go get a pedicure with or go to a paint and sip class. But as always I convince myself that they have better things to do with their time so I step back and then the friendship goes nowhere. "
Just feel frustrated and lonely,"I have been feeling sick for the last week, and my voice is nearly gone. I wish I could truly take a day and rest--I wish I had a space in my life where that felt possible. My husband doesn't realize how much expectation he puts on me to know exactly what I need and what I will need, and what I want to/need to do. I feel like I have to have a timetable I can report of what I will be doing and when, and when I'm sick, I have no idea how I'll feel.
Also, there's the logistical challenge of it literally hurting to talk. He keeps asking me questions--""Are you sure this ya what you want?"" And I'm like, ""I literally need you to take me at my word because I cannot talk.""
Also, he keeps talking over me because he can't hear me... like when I'm talking to our kid. A lot.

And I'm just tired and sick and sad.

"Eight months ago my ankle surgeon told me I might be limping and in pain for the rest of my life, but today I ran a mile","Basically just the post title. In May of 2017 I busted my ankle rock climbing and overnight went from being one of the most active people I know to being unable to walk without excruciating pain. I went to so many doctors and couldn’t get anyone to take it seriously until finally an MRI showed I had an osteochondral lesion. It took 8 months of near immobility (I couldn’t even walk around my own apartment without causing horrible pain) before I got a surgery. During the first surgery,  they found extensive synovitis and nerve compression was triggering the pain, and alleviated it by scraping out the inside of the joint. But as I started to heal from the surgery, nothing seemed to get better and I was in even more pain. 

Cut to July of 2018. I get a second surgery. My surgeon tells me in the check-up he removed more scar tissue from my ankle that day than he’d ever seen in 30 years of practice. He didn’t know what happened except something about the first surgery caused a bunch of internal scar growth making me unable to move my ankle and triggering the skin nerves on the bridge of my foot, causing horrible nerve pain. 

I asked him why it happened and he said it was possible that I had a genetic tendency to over-scar, and that the scars might just come back. He had no way of knowing if that was the problem or if it was something else. I asked him what would happen if the scars came back and he shrugged and said, “well, it would ‘lame’ you.” (Excuse the offensive terminology, this guy is in his 70s and also insensitive) I asked him for how long I would be lamed and he said that it would be permanent. 

I was beyond depressed processing the news because activity had meant so much to me and because the condition was so painful. I spent the first six months recovering, step by step, finding I was able to walk with a limp, then sometimes with less of one. Then the limp got less frequent and the pain started to subside but I didn’t have my full range of motion back so I always thought I was plateauing. I was grateful just to be able to limp without pain and then just to be able to walk. 

Fast forward to today. I still have nerve pain and it sucks, but it’s less frequent—barely once a week. I’ve been getting more and more aggressive with physical therapy at home and I’ve been able to walk longer distances. Today I finally gave a jog a shot! I thought I wouldn’t be able to run for 2 minutes, out of pain or out of being in bad shape. But once I started...I just kept going! I didn’t have to stop. The muscles were sore, but my body was ready for it and I just...I kept going until I checked my phone tracker and it said 1.3 miles. I stopped on a forest path next to my neighborhood and because no one was around I let myself get overwhelmed and I honestly cried a little. It felt amazing. I feel amazing. I didn’t know if I’d ever get to do it again but I did and I will never ever take my mobility for granted again. 

I am so happy. I cannot wait to start running again. Honestly anything could happen today and I wouldn’t care. Anyway, don’t take your mobility for granted while you have it. The ability to go for a run is an incredible thing. It’s the best thing that’s happened to me in years. I am so grateful. "
Trump loving boyfriend dumps me,"So I was on the phone last night with my on and off boyfriend of 32 years. Yea I know, I already feel like a worn out dishrag from staying so long.  Anyway we were talking about white nationalists,  specifically about the terror attack in New Zealand, which his response was, ""I have no feeling about it, maybe someone the killer knew was killed in the twin towers!"" I personally feel really upset about the attack , well the subject quickly turned to Trump and I stated that he lost the popular vote by over 2 million votes, he said he didn't care, it didn't matter, I told him I cared and it mattered to me and lots of people I know. He told me we are STUPID for caring about this. I reminded him I am college educated and he said, ""No you're not."" Then he hung up on me and text me, ""Goodbye,"" I hope your beliefs bring you happiness.""  I told him I would honor his goodbye and he text back, ""Good."" I'm convinced it's time to move on and heal from this abuse. "
I [20m] am doing everything I can to secure a new job/therapist/well-led life and it's really tearing me apart.,"So I just gotta say. I don't have a job right now and I can live with that. I have the patience to put effort into getting another job. I've gotten jobs before. I don't think it's an impossible task, but everything else in my life that orbits this issue is tearing me to goddamn shreds, and honestly I would not say I think it's worth complaining about because I know people struggle with much worse issues. But if there's any weight that I would just like to tear off my chest and throw into the high grass it would be this.

During August of 2018 I started going through a very difficult time. I had previously been trying to repress (or as I thought I was doing ""working past"") my issues with mental health. I was previously diagnosed during high school with General Anxiety Disorder and Seasonal Affective Disorder. I tried meds for a month and wasn't happy with the effects so I tried to put on a smile and just hope I could get situated  by myself.

Pretty much the day I turned 19 I realized I was going to have to put in some real work if i wanted to move past the place I was in. during my 2018 summer I was working three nights out of every week from 11pm-5:30am. It was a frycook job.  I was a certified trainer at this time so i was pretty heavily relied on to play a big part of the weekend third shifts.This really was taking a toll on me. I started to get pretty shitty admittedly. I'd be late to some shifts from oversleeping, or i would offer people money to take shifts if i just felt like i didn't want to work. I feel like ass for writing that out but still i never intended to make people's lives harder. I just didn't understand what was wrong with me or why I still felt depressive and anxious feelings.

I had previously been living in an apartment with my sister (we worked at the same place I got her the job)

but my mom had requested that I move back home because she was worried about my financial standing relative to my last few paychecks. So i did move back home, about 20 minutes further away from my job. I was late one more time. I was sick with the flu that week, and I called off one more time, and officially I was fired.

So i spent the next two months trying to get a new job. I got a job in a grocery store where I worked 5 nights a week 8pm-4am it was the most depressing job I've ever had. Then in the December my family had planned to go on a trip to Ireland. At this time I was pretty much as deep in the hole as I'd ever been so I suggested that maybe I should stay in the U.S. and focus on reworking job/life related things. I could sacrifice an offered vacation for that, but my family was pretty insistent that I go. So i went. before I went I decided to cut things off with the grocery store (their schedule usually were posted on the first day the week of the schedule and I didn't want to risk being fired for being in Ireland instead of there), so I already knew I wasn't going to have a job when I got back.

When I got back I spent January doing everything I could to try and get a job but things didn't go great. I had some interviews but even the ones that went well did not result in a callback. The only other thing I spent time on was driving from Columbus, Ohio, to Cincinnati, Ohio to see my girlfriend and her roomates/my friends. I still applied to jobs while i was down there. Being with my girlfriend/friends is definitely a different environment for me. When I was at my house I felt like I could never really accomplish anything even if i set my mind to it, but at the house with my girlfriend and our friends I felt like a completely different person. Like I didn't have to be afraid to get involved in life and I felt free to actually try my hardest.

After being to Cincinnati so many times and still not having a job after (at this point what would be) a month, my parents were very upfront with me in saying that they didn't want me to go to Cincinnati again until I had a job. My dad sort of jokingly suggested ""if you wanna be down there so much why don't you get a job down there"" I was understanding of their frustration. The weekend passed and I decided to bring up what my dad suggested. We argued about it for a night or two but eventually my dad understood what I wanted out of this and my mom and him gave me the okay to do this (to preface this both they and I understand that I'm an adult and they can't physically stop me from leaving, I felt I was trying to get their approval in light of all the support they had given me previously). So I packed some things and started applying for jobs in Cincinnati.

So now I've been in Cincinnati for a little over a month. I've been living with my girlfriend and her roommates They are the most supportive people I've ever met in my whole life. They've been helping me with applying for jobs and looking for therapists. They are completely understanding of how hard it can be to get a job. I'm honestly blown away with how open they keep they conversation. They don't treat me like I'm a problem person. They treat me like I'm a person with a problem. Their understanding and patience with me has gave way to my own understanding and patience with the situation I am currently in. I have never before in my life been so determined to follow through and succeed with something I want to achieve.

&#x200B;

So tonight my mom texts me and the texts seem pretty positive at first, but i do have to mention that both my parents, and my mom specifically, are pretty big drinkers, they usually have 6-8 a night every night,  so naturally i'm  a little nervous when my mom asks about job related things. I tell her I don't have one yet. I've been texting her updates for the places I've applied to and the interviews I've had, but tonight after hearing I don't have a job yet she's pretty upfront about telling me that I'm going to have to start paying my own car insurance and phone bill. They were paying it previously but now since I'm here and not there they would prefer that I pay it. I can understand that. My mom told me they would pay for both again if I came home. So it seems like this is less about me not having a job and more just not having a job but being in Cincinnati. I can live with this. Sure this will make getting jobs here a little harder but this isn't the end of the world.

but straight fucking up i will not go home. I came this far to go after something I really wanted: a job I can work, a place I can live with people who tell me they care about my happiness, a therapist I actually consistently go to and trust to help me with my issues. I know my parents love me more than i could probably understand and I love them more than I can explain, but to me the reality of the situation right now is: I gotta stand up for the life I want to live, otherwise I'll just let my parents choose how I should live, which even they would know is not the right way to live your life.

&#x200B;

I love my parents, and I know they want what's best for me and for me to have the best life I can, but my relationships with them is fucking me up. When I think about my relationship between myself and my parents I just question everything about me even being alive, it just throws me completely out of my center. The main point of this post right here is simply this: I just want to try and make a life for myself. I don't want to make my parents unhappy, but their lack of confidence in me is bringing me down.

&#x200B;

I'd like to reiterate that I feel like this is a very trivial problem. There are many things that would be much harder to deal with. I know people have abusive parents, or absent parents. So i do take my time to be thankful for what I have. But sometimes I just can't take theses confusing signals.

&#x200B;

 OMC TL;DR: I'd rather die in the streets than have someone else decide my life. I know my parents just want me to be happy, but the only thing that brings me unhappiness is my parents. I'm gonna live my fucking life no matter how wrong I might be. All I want is to be a happy man. Fuck. 

Note: I realize how overly dramatic my reaction to this situation might be, hopefully that will be indicative of the current state of my mental health. thank you for allowing me this writing space. xoxo"
Feelings I want to get off my chest. (Very gushy gross.),"I have been feeling absolutely trapped in a borrowed space for years. 

My family is mostly women who have very strong ideals and every female in the bloodline is expected to follow them, which includes me. My siblings and my parents are all full figured women with a doormat attitude, as they were taught and passed down. Women are supposed to be clean, presentable, lips shut, no opinions, no back talk, straight edge, go to college for a “respectable” degree (doctor, lawyer, therapist, etc), to be walked on by anyone with no protest, and that the word “no” or any argument with anyone was considered insanely disrespectful. I’ve seen women in my family completely shunned for not following this routine, and I’m afraid that I’m going to follow in their footsteps. 

I am a small woman, only 5’1 and ~100 pounds. I am androgynous but tend to lean more on the feminine side with pictures and such because of my family. My makeup is intense, my hair is short, I have a loud mouth, I take no shit but do no harm, and I’m constantly standing up for myself and those I care about. I have my own religious beliefs, a sort of mix between Buddhism and Greek Mythology, and I’ve just never fit in with their harsh guidelines. I speak my mind almost constantly, and when I was younger, they found it sort of charming. They called me a ball of fire, unpredictable and widespread. As I grew into adulthood, they slowly became more and more angry with how I haven’t changed. I think they expected me to lose all of that and become one of them, but I didn’t want to do that. My personality is what makes me individual and to lose that would be a death sentence to me. I’m always laughing, I have books in my hand constantly, and I never say the right thing. As I progressed, they just got more and more harsh/angry with me. They’d try to “correct” my behavior with angry conversations and stern looks in public, they’d critique me for the things that I wore, they’d look down on me for not wearing feminine makeup with long hair and such. The more I grow, the worse it gets. 

When I was in my teenage years, I pondered the thought of conforming just to have them accept me. No matter how hard I tried to be like them, I’d always find myself miserable and suicidal. I felt like I was losing myself, and I remember thinking that their acceptance isn’t worth my existence. Now, I’m questioning that again. 

I can’t help but avoid them. I love them so much. I’ve always worn my heart on my sleeve, loved everyone as much as I could, reached out as much as I could, empathized and sympathized, and tried my damnedest to not let any opportunity slip by that I could of given more love into. I feel like shit for avoiding them and being on the brink of giving up, but my mental health can’t take anymore of this. 

Thanks for listening. I know it was long winded. I love you guys. "
I spoke to a good friend for the first time in a while,"About a year ago, my friend group split up when there was some drama at another friend's wedding. 

There was some yelling and a little bit of physical confrontation involved.

We went our separate ways. I sent him a few messages through the year, but he never responded. 

Well tonight, we spent an hour on the phone and cleared the air. We both apologized and agreed to move on.

I'm so glad to have my friend back. It really is tremendous. I am very excited."
"Partly a story about my friend, partly a message to all men about their mental health.","If you don’t want to read all of it that’s fine, I don’t care, but all men PLEASE skip to the last paragraph.

My friend has been clean off of opiates, weed, and alcohol for a month, but he still has to deal with everything that drove him to using in the first place. I don’t want to go into detail with what’s going on, because it’s a lot. 

Last night we were watching movies, trying to have a good time when he suddenly squeezed his eyes shut for a second, tossed his phone on the footrest, got up and walked out. We found him having like his 10th cigarette that day. He ranted a bit and I gave him a hug and then we went back inside.

But for the remainder of the movie. His eyes were brimming with tears. The whole time. I could see him trying to actively regulate his breathing with the deep rises and falls of his chest.

Later on when we had to drop him off, I hugged him again, longer this time, and told him if he ever needs to cry in front of me that I won’t mind. I’ll hold him while he cries, I don’t care. It wouldn’t make him any less of a man.

And he said he can “suck it up.”

Men. Please. Don’t suck it up. It is okay to cry. It is healthy to cry. I would have much rather he started sobbing on the floor than sat through seeing him hold it all in like that. *Men who cry are still men.* Crying does NOT compromise your masculinity. Talking about your problems does not compromise your masculinity. Please PLEASE find people you are comfortable with crying and ranting to. I promise you will feel a sense of relief afterward."

My sister's father sexually assaulted me.,"Throwaway bc I don't want anything this personal on my main

&#x200B;

I have a (half) sister who is 9. When I was 9 her father (my step father at the time) was molesting me. I do have a support system that I am very thankful for and although he was able to post bond after his arrest a few years back when what happened came out, he will be going on trial within the next year or so and hopefully will be receiving jail time. 

&#x200B;

I love my sister with all my heart and the fact that she is the daughter of that man means nothing to me, she always has been and always will be my first and only baby sister. As I said, she is at the age I was when things were very bad. It kills me to know that our mother still allows her to spend time with her father. It is absolutely disgusting that our mother allows that, but it happens and there really is nothing that I can do to stop my mother from allowing this to happen. I don't have any hard evidence to believe that he is hurting her too, but c'mon, a rapist is a rapist and he targeted me when I was exactly her age. The thought of anything happening to her makes me ill and I constantly hope that if anything were to happen she could trust me enough to tell me (or anyone she can trust that would help right any wrongs). 

&#x200B;

Lately I've been feeling distant from her in a weird way. It's almost surreal to see my little sister at the age I was when everything was happening.  Since I've able to see my sister reach that age, the anger and utter disgust and hatred I feel towards him have somehow tripled in intensity. In a way it's like seeing a reflection of myself at that age and I guess  it's kinda put things into perspective for me. It's just a crazy feeling that I don't even know how to fully explain like I want to. There are just so many emotions that come up when I look at her- love and fear for her, anger and disgust towards him, self hate and self pity, so many emotions. Like a ridiculous amount and I don't know how to handle it. As a result, I've been finding it harder and harder to be with my sister. I love her dearly but I find myself so irritable and anxious around her, and not in a way that all sisters get from time to time. 

&#x200B;

I just want her to know how much she means to me and how important and brave and intelligent she is, but how can I be that sister when I'm so stuck being snappy and don't spend enough time with her. I'm so thankful that our family (aside from her parents) have been able to offer her support in ways I haven't been able to provide, but I want so badly to be able to be the best sister for her. It's really killing me to be having a rough spot with our relationship as a result of bad memories being brought up whenever we're in the same room.

note: ive never posted anything like this on the internet, but it's 2019 so i figure it's time to take advantage of subreddits meant for anonymous venting. just typing this out has made me feel a bit better, thanks for taking some time to read my thoughts... i really appreciate it in a time where it's difficult to share these sort of things with friends and family.

Thoughts,I’m new to this so I don’t quite know how it works. Thought it might be a good way to speak my mind but I don’t know really. I feel totally lost in every way possible and never know what to do. I feel defeated more everyday and can’t ever seem to escape these thoughts. 
"I wanted to be a normal kid for once, and now everyone's fighting..","So I'm 14 and was diagnosed with autism as well as something called sensory integration disorder when I was three years old. I've been pretty different from all the other kids, obviously, but something I've never really done is normal things that normal people do. I've been in a movie theater maybe 6 times in my life, and every single time it was because my parents or someone else dragged me along. I never liked it and ended up shuffling around a lot, didn't understand social stuff so I probably was a minor distraction to a lot of people around me during those times. Another thing is just movies in general. The thought of looking at *something*, even though it's supposedly entertaining, for hours on end and being completely still and not saying a word sounds super weird to me. Like, look at this for 2 and a half hours, don't move, and don't speak ok? That's movie theaters for me. I could get doing that with a spouse/SO but not in a public theater with hundreds of other people.

Then there was last Thursday and Friday. I decided that I wanted something to change. I decided that FUCK the person I was before. FUCK that socially awkward, never does anything a normal guy would do person. So, I eventually decided on going to a movie theater. That's something that normal people do, right? I asked 2 different kids at school what was hot in theaters right now and they both said Captain Marvel was this week. So there, I had my answer.

I don't pay attention to marvel at all, and I know that I wont know what's going on. All I know that there's a female leader, some of the fans didn't really like it and critics called the fans sexist or something. But I don't care about the stupid movie, I care about the experience of actually doing something normal for once. And then the main issue happened - what time we want this to be. It's going to be me, my brother, possibly my mom and my brother's girlfriend going.

We're going to see the movie tomorrow. Since this was my plan I supposedly could pick the time. I picked either 11:00 A.M. or noon, I wanted to go earlier in the day when the fresh morning air was there and there were less people, and I could continue going about my day after we got home. But, my brother's girlfriend is at her sister's tonight and is coming home sometime tomorrow, which is causing the fight. Originally, my mom created a good compromise by saying either 2 or 3 so that bro's gf could come home at a slightly earlier time than what was planed and still be able to see the movie with us. Then, about an hour later after texting her about it, the agreement somehow moved to 5 or 6 P.M. to everyone except me. When my mom told me, I shut her down (thank god I don't have trouble saying no to people) and told her that wasn't happening since it would be a huge time portal in the middle of the day, especially when I originally wanted it around noon. My dad said I should let my bro's gf fuck off and just not see the movie.

Now I'm starting to regret ever bringing this up. Why did I want to try and be normal and do a normal person thing like see a movie? Why am I even doing this when I know I wont get the movie without the context of what's happened in the marvel universe in the past, and I don't like sitting and staring at something for 2 hours, not moving or talking at all. For once, I wanted to be a normal person kid that did normal person things and it's just caused everyone to fight about time. Can someone help me out on what I should do? I really want to see it at 1 at the latest, and am willing to dump my bro's gf out of seeing it if I have to.

**Tl;dr** - I've had autism all my life, and never connected well with others or got social cues, but I decided to go to a movie theater since I was tired of being a werido and wanted to do a normal person thing once. Now my brother's girlfriend is upset because she wants to screw around at her sister's place and tried readjusting the schedule, and now everyone's just fighting about what time they'll see it. I'm starting to regret my decision..."
I feel empty.,"I miss you. I miss you, I miss you, I miss you. 

I started setting up the PC, and realised that I had no idea what I was doing - this was something you would do for me. You’d know exactly what you were doing. You’d set it up, and be all excited about it turning on. I shouldn’t have taken it home. I don’t want to be on it without you by my side. 

I’m going to miss hearing about your day, and what TV shows you’re interested in. I’m going to miss seeing you, and Comet. I’m going to miss feeling you kiss my forehead in the early mornings before you’d run off to work. I’m going to miss you snuggling into me late at night. I’m going to miss the way you hold my hand, and the way you wrap your arms around me from behind. I’m going to miss the way you look at me, and admire me from afar. I’m going to miss your calls after work. I’m going to miss *you*, and everything about you; you and your little phobias, and the way you need me to pick up a cockroach in your bag. The way you would dance like a goofball and kiss me on the nose. The way you’d keep me warm during winter, even though you hated my cold feet. You always made me smile, and you always made me laugh. You made me feel whole. 

I’m going to miss you wanting me, and loving me the way you did. 

My heart is going to miss loving you.  "
"Got my period during sex, I am mortified","I have been hooking up with this one guy for only about a month now and things are great. Just like no stings attached sex and I couldn't ask for more. 
I was supposed to get my period in a couple days so I wasn't too worried about anything so we started getting it on and I was having a great time until he just stops and points out that there was blood EVERYWHERE all over his white sheets. 
We only just started hooking up and now I just feel super gross and I am too embarrassed to try anything anywhere close to when my period is supposed to come. He was really nice about it though so I guess it could be worse.
Y'all should tell me your nasty stories to help me feel better about being all gross."
"Oh, I’m going to miss you.","M, I saw you today - you and your new little haircut. I admired you from afar; that smile, your eyes, that... smirk. I wanted to jump in your arms, and kiss you. I wanted to feel your hands around my waist. I wanted to feel your heart against mine.

I could tell you had drifted, but it hasn’t changed the way I feel about you.

I will miss you beyond belief, and I will continue to love you until my heart can no longer. 

I hope this time apart gives you a chance to get back down to your roots, find that confidence and have some proper ‘you’ time. Go take on the world, and maybe, when the time is right, we’ll make it work.  

You mean, *so* much to me. 

I’ll love you always. 

P.S: I’ll be here when you’re ready.

I think I accidently caused my friend's mom to miscarry,"When I was about 4years old, my best friend's mom was pregnant. My friend really wanted a sibling and from whatever reason it was difficult for her mom to get pregnant, so everyone was obviously very happy.

One day when we were at kindergarden me and my friend were waiting for her mom to come to take her home. At some point, I spun around and wanted to run somewhere, but accidently  run right into her mom's stomach. She laughed and shrugged it off and I almost forgot it. 

I don't remember how long after this my friend told me that she won't have any sibling. But she got a sister when we were around 6 years old. That's when I remembered the accident and realized it might have been my fault that she miscarried. 

I'm 19 now. I usually don't think about it, but sometimes randomly remember it and can't get the guilt from my head for a long time. The uncertainty if it was really my fault makes it even worse.

If you read this, thank you."
I had an affair with a married man and spilled much more than I can drink.....," When I told this story to a close friend she didn't believe because my story is messed up on all levels so I'm not going to expect you all to believe me too I just want to confess this on here since I don't have friends.

This is gonna be long but please bear with me. And sorry for my wrong grammar in advance. I'm not from an english speaking country.

When I was on my last year at college I gained a friend and eventually he became my boyfriend he told me that he was a single dad. I fell in love with him and when I found out that he was married, forcefully, to a girl, I decided to leave him but he insist not to because they'll eventually get annulled cause their relationship is not working. I believed him. 

We were so happy, he introduced me to his kid who was the most precious thing ever. We would go swimming and travel together and sometimes with her kid all while his wife is working and wasting away their business money with her friends and also her ""boyfriend"" we always had the best time together. 

Then came when their business started swooping down and him and his wife need to work together. They would be working for hours and days for months and would only see me for once every 2 months. He would sneak out of the office to go to a nearby cafe to facetime me which only happened for 4 months after that nothing he would just text and chat me no facetime or whatsoever. 

All I could think of that time was maybe him and his wife's relationship worked out. I fell into depression and became alcoholic. 

After months of being away from each other he eventually came back and we were again together traveling however i noticed something was wrong, he would say he loves me but not like before. 

Until one night I was so drunk and finally mustered the courage to tell him that I should leave him, he cried and keeps telling me he loves me, i provoked him and in just a snap i started telling him how a coward he is until i told him to punch me and slap me, he did it because i forced him into doing it, i was so aggressive and passionate about it. He would say sorry but all I did was tell him that he's gay cause he can't punch me enough to break my face. 

It went on for weeks, I would put on a fight, he would try and storm out of the room because he knows where this is going but I would just chase him until he punch my skin raw with bruises on my face, he would say sorry and I'll say sorry too. It was a horrible phase in my life, I would go to school with a bruise on face or arms or wherever in my body. 

I became alcoholic and depressed and messed up. While he would come home late always and me waiting at home waiting for him so I could fight him and he could get physical with me. 

One night he's had enough and decided to bring me to a psychiatrist, we had counseling together and turned out I had repressed memories of being physically abused and molested by an uncle when I was a child up until my teenage years.

And he on the 3rd week of counseling, finally admitted to himself that he's gay and just don't want to admit to himself because he would disgrace his family's name, explaining why he's coming home late and why on the months working with his wife he's had little time with me. 

Although the bitter turn of events he told me that even though he was gay, he really loved me like how he loved his boy crushes on his lifetime. 

Him being gay also explains why he just let his wife have many affairs and waste their money because his wife was actually blackmailing him into giving her a big share in his company or she'll tell his family and be the disgrace of the family. 

And that's the story of how I am now diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder."
"I don't like the way people treat me after weight loss, and sometimes I wish I was fat again","I'm female, 20 years old, and I lost 57 kg. I reached my goal weight almost 2 years ago. I'm 163 cm and 60 kg. I decided to lose weight for health reasons - I don't want to die young, and frankly, I was just tired of being fat.

People started treating me differently after I lost weight and because I was always a fat kid, I'm not used to it. Strangers always either ignored me or looked at me with contempt, sometimes I heard laughing or snickering behind me. Now random people smile at me, they want to talk to me and are kinder and more patient when we interact. People don't get as angry when I fuck something up. I also get attention from guys, which is completely new and I never know how to react.

Friends, family and people in my circle treat me different, too. I always used to be a black sheep, but now I'm usually in spotlight, which is very uncomfortable because I'm very introverted. They also seem to make up a whole new identity based on my weight loss. They seem to think that my whole existence revolves around the fact that I lost weight. Every time we talk, we somehow always end up talking about it, even though I don't want to. My mum carries my before and after pictures in her wallet and shows it to everybody. My friend introduced me to his friend with words "" this is HopefulWishbone. She's lost 57 kg, isn't it cool?"" 

The ting is that my personality didn't even change. I'm still an awkward loner. 

It makes me feel like the only valuable thing about me is my weight loss. It sometimes makes me wish I was still fat. I understand that it's a shck for others, but I just don't want to be treated as if my worth was measured by the number of kg lost.

I'm trapped in an abusive relationship.,"On mobile, sorry if formatting is bad.

As a preface, my fiance and I have been together nearly a decade, since we were teenagers. We have a daughter who's about a month old. My fiance is bipolar, I have moderate autism; where it clearly effects how I communicate and have visible stimming and processing issues, but I can still take care of myself and my daughter. He makes promises to get back on his meds, but flip-flops and changes it to ""we cant afford it, it wont help, it's too hard to get help, etc."" And refuses to make appointments.

My fiance uses his bipolar as an excuse for a lot it seems. Past drug use (pills, acid, shrooms) within the last year, constantly smoking weed (which is legal here), exchanging sexual favours for weed/pills a few times I know of, sex with random men on grindr when I'm ""not giving enough attention"".

He lies to me and when I give details proving I know what he's doing, his face goes cold and he just says I cant prove anything.

He used to hurt me a lot during a particularly bad period when he still lived at his grandma's, where he would grab, hit, choke, and slam my head into walls. He didnt care if his family knew, when his sister came in because I screamed and was loudly talking, she just said ""i dont know what's happening here, but keep it down."".

He hadnt hurt me in a long time, so i thought it was over. Then we fought yesterday, because he went out and had sex with some dude. I told him he was gonna lose everything if he didn't get help and get back on his meds. I said I had proof that hes done things to endanger our daughter. He grabbed me by the collar and yanked me around, and then pinned me down to the bed by a part of my arms that has large painful scarring.

He said he'd take her away or she'd get taken away by CPS. He's a good liar. Hes also a self-admitted sociopath whos been hospitalised for mental health issues. He can manipulate very well, and his family would back him up. My parents live with us and know I'm the one that takes care of her all night and most of the day, but itd be the three of us against a dozen of them who would use my autism as a reason to have her taken from me.

I refuse to give him the chance to take my daughter. She's my whole world and I wont leave her with someone borderline neglectful. I dont think hed hurt her, as he loves her a lot. But he sleeps through her screaming right next to him when I'm getting a bottle and will sit playing video games instead of interacting with her and get pissed when asked to do anything.

The thing is, hes very good at making me feel crazy. He says something and then when I comment, insists he said something different. Less than a minute later. He lies about past events and makes me doubt myself. I have a bad memory, my auditory processing disorder made me mishear, etc. Even my parents havent discovered the abuse beyond him refusing to help because he knows how to hide it and is an incredible liar.

He says I do worse than him. I cant comfort the baby who I've been caring for all night. He never has problems with her during my sleep period (after she's been up all night and is finally sleeping). He says parenting is easy, I'm just bad at it. 

I'm not willing to risk losing her, so I'm trapped with him so I can protect her. I cant do that if he lies his way into even partial custody away from me.

I dont know where to go from here, but I can at least take care of her this way. Even if I'm miserable, I'll make sure she isn't."
Why do people have to be so confusing?,"I don't usually write or speak very much in English, as I've migrated to a different country, so I'm sorry for any grammatical errors but feel free to correct me!

You're going to need quite a bit of context for this story, so let's get started...

So, it all started when I came into 5th grade (I don't know how it is in other countries but you change schools when you reach 5th grade here). I that was a pretty hard time as I had to leave behind my old school and my friends and we'd also moved to the other side of the town right after the school year had started and since my only device of transport was my bike, I had no way to visit my old friends anymore. My dad had also just moved to the other side of the country and I wasn't and still am not close to my mother or my sister at all. So a lot of horrible things were going on and of course, being a little 10yr old, I didn't really hide my pain at all, which resulted in being asked what was wrong by the girls on a weekly basis. Though they usually acted mean towards me, meaning not letting me join in any of the cliques and telling me off all the time, I still opened up every time they asked. BIG MISTAKE. So they were finding out about this 10-11yr olds suicidal thoughts. For this first year it seemed fine-ish but when we came into sixth grade...

So, I was still telling them what was going on and they were still asking me what was happening. I used to be a pretty open person so I remember writing that I couldn't breathe AGAIN in my status on WhatsApp. The next day in school me and two of the girls were taken out of class. I found out that they'd shown it to my teacher and said that it wasn't ok (as if they and my teacher would have a say in what I post online, even if it was only public to my own contacts). My teacher said that I had to stop that and that she would have to start monitoring all of our group chats and my status if it would go on that way (she could have been fired if she would have done so, as it's illegal for a teacher to have their students number here). I was terrified and also shocked, as the girls had never spoken to me about it all. Later at lunch I was sitting alone with my only real friend, who was one of the guys. He had close to nothing to do with the girls so it really surprised me to know that he had already been informed and the girls had tried to pull him against me too. And it almost worked. So I stopped telling anyone what was going on. If someone asked, I just said there was nothing and learned how to put on a mask. It was going fine again for a while, until my teacher split our class into two groups...the girls and the guys. We were in different rooms and the guys were doing something else with another teacher. 

So there I was. We were told to just sit together in a circle and talk...about me. Me, a lonely 11 or 12yr old alone against like 15 other girls and my teacher. They were saying that they were getting nightmares and that they couldn't concentrate because of what I had been saying (even though I had already stopped like a month prior) and my teacher of course believed them an didn't even listen to what I had to say. And then came the thing that confuses me to this day: A girl said that you should never bottle up your feelings and always tell your friends what was going on. Everyone said that she was right. So what? Were they telling me to tell them now, or to shut tf up? And were they just saying right then that none of them ever wanted to be my friend? I was broken and didn't know what to do. 

A whole year has passed since and I'm happy that the classes get mixed again in 7th grade, but there are still a lot of people (now mostly the guys) who bully me, but that's a different story. These girls really scared me though and now I have very severe trust issues and am only able to talk to one person about my feelings and pain (the guy friend I was talking about). But I've noticed that we too have started growing apart and if it wasn't for him I wouldn't even be here anymore. I've fallen deeper than ever about a week ago and I don't really know how I would go on without this one person, as he's actually the only person who really cares for me. Not even my parents do. I've tried my best to understand this all, but I just can't manage to do so. Can anyone of you help me??

Btw. I'm so happy to find this subreddit, as now I can talk about all of this without anyone from my school ever having to find it out and I really cannot hold in all of my bullying experience any longer."
Helping my friend...,"A couple of days ago I (19M)made a post about one of my dear friends (18M) and it was completely out of line. The post has since been deleted and I left out so many major parts. Parts that should’ve been included that would’ve help others better understand the post. And at the same time I said a lot of things in it that were out of line and wrong of me as a friend and as a person. So to correct that I have to say this:

We will call him josh. Josh is one of the most amazing young men on earth. He has the biggest heart and will always be my brother no matter what we go through. I wouldnt be the man I am today if it weren’t for him. I want nothing but the best for him. Josh deals with an insane amount of depression and as much as he tries to show otherwise he doesn’t know his worth. I can tell by the way he tries to “show off” to everyone we talk to. And we’ve sat down and talked these things through. He’s not happy with who he is. Josh recently told me, through teary eyes, he wanted to die. I hadn’t felt a broken heart like that in my entire life. I don’t know what I’d do without josh around and every time I’m not around him I worry he’s going to do something stupid. 

So every chance I get I spend time with him. We talk and we bond and I know how much he’s into smoking weed so I do that with him in hopes of showing him I’m here for him and that I accept any part of him. I don’t ever show disapproval to him in any way. I love josh like family but he needs help. 

He’s a part of this group on discord and they regularly get on there and play games together and recently I sat in on one of their little chats and no one but josh knew I was there at first and I was hearing the way this group of people talked to him and it’s the purest form of bullying. They talked about him smelling bad and how he’s fat and lazy and made fun of how he talks. I jumped in and found out who it was and did the wrong thing. I gave them the same treatment, except I was ruthless about it because no one should hear things like that especially with how josh is mentally. 

Josh tells me al the time how he doesn’t have many friends, and all the time I’ll hear about people who use him (his family is somewhat well off) and then turn their back on him. He explained to me that this is the reason he spends so much time alone, because he wants to protect himself from those types of people, so I told him my philosophy on friendships. I told him you can be “cool” with people and never let them get close enough to hurt you. At the same time you keep your circle tight and build off of each other. So to build on that talk (I was in town so I spent a couple of days with him) I found a couple of “get together’s” and parties and I brought josh along. He doesn’t get invited to parties from what I know and whenever I’m in town I have a lot of people asking to make plans and go to parties so I made sure he was with me. I made sure whoever wanted to see me was okay with seeing josh too and if not then I wasn’t going to go. 

Josh and I had a great week. We did all sorts of things and I saw genuine happiness from him. I’m hoping I made a change in him but deep down I know that he still feels the same way he did before I showed up. I want josh to be the version of himself that he’s happy with and I have absolutely no clue how to help him get there and that’s what kills me inside because I know that’s where the root issue comes from. I guess I’m just at a loss."
I have no one to talk to and I know if I did I'm come across as a freak.,I feel like I have no one to talk too. I feel so totally lonely and worthless but I know that that is unattractive to everyone and whiny. I want to just put on social media to send off into a void but I don't want people to see me that way but also that is the way I am. I feel like I just want someone to tell me I'm good and that they care about me and like me but I know I'm supposed to not seek validation from other people. I just want someone to care. I just want to be able to express these things with out coming across like a needy freak. I don't really know what to do. I don't have anyone I'm super close to anymore like that and I don't know how to get any closer since that means people seeing how fucked up I am. I just feel so stuck and trapped and I don't know what to do. 
When your ex just don’t leave you alone,"3 years ago I was in an emotionally abusive relationship with a very manipulative person. I ended it when I realized that his behavior was unacceptable and it could only get worse from here. We worked together so I continued to see him. He badmouthed me to all of our co-workers and I lost a ton of friends because I refused to share my side of the story. I looked like the bad guy. I really just wanted to come to work, do my job, be professional, and leave. It couldn’t happen. He relentlessly attempted to get me back. He called me, texted me, emailed me every day. I changed all my contact information, blocked him on social media, you name it. When he couldn’t get to me outside of work, he began emailing my work account and verbally abusing me at work.  I had to bring the situation to HR.  They were supportive but once he found out my new number (which he got from people at work) he began contacting me again. Work couldn’t help me. I didn’t want to contact authorities because, due to another experience when I was younger, I didn’t believe the police would be any help. This all happened in a 6 month timeframe. There were multiple times that I very calmly told him to stop contacting me. 

But it’s never stopped. Every so often I still get messages from him. Today, after making a new Instagram account, he followed me. I blocked him immediately. But I’m so damn tired of dealing with this. He’s been in a relationship since we broke up with the mother of his child. I don’t understand why I’m still having to shove him away. Maybe this is whiny of me but I don’t think it’s fair that I still need to worry about him. 

I don’t know what to do about this. Is this something I’ll forever need to deal with? Do I make contact and tell him to stop again? He’s the type of person that would take any type of contact, negative or otherwise, as an opportunity to continue contact. 

I wish I could vent to family or friends about this but no one seems to think this is an issue. I tell them things and I get blank stares. Am I being dramatic? I just want to live my life and not have to think about this dude ever again. 

This post barely scratched the surface of how fucked up the situation is. If I explained in more detail, we’d be here for days. 

tl;dr: emotionally abusive ex won’t leave me the f alone even after multiple attempts to stop him, it’s been 3 years and I’m still getting messages. I just want to be left alone. "
I kissed him!,"Long story short,I've started seeing this guy for a while now and yesterday was our second date.Everything went perfect,we talked about so many things and I felt so good around him.

By the end of our date,I decided to bite the bullet and I asked him if I could kiss him..on the lips,obviously.He said yes and I did so right away! Now I just can't stop thinking about those soft lips of his.

I told my friends and family but they didn't seem that excited so I thought that some of you guys might relate to this.We're going out again tonight and I'm feeling like I might kiss him again! Maybe even make out with him."
"I know choosing death is a selfish choice. But I didn’t choose to be born in the first place, to suffer this life.","Last evening after taking a nap, I got up and felt really depressed. All I could think was I couldn’t live like this anymore. Then I started sobbing. At that moment I felt disgusted, thinking about self-harming again (been free for 6 months). I feel really sorry for my Mom, because whenever I start sobbing out of nowhere she doesn’t know what to do then yell at me to stop. She worries about me, and I can do nothing to prevent her from worrying. I’m such a burden. I don’t want to make Mom sad, but I cannot get my life together anymore. I’m exhausted and hopeless."
I Want to Preface with I'm not Suicidal,"...But these past couple of days I've been saying I want to kill myself. My feelings are so heavy and nothing I seem to say makes the people around me take notice and care. Being diagnosed with depression again and having to drop my therapist all last December apparently isn't a big enough deal.

I feel like saying ""I want to kill myself"" is the only way to convey the gravity of what I feel. Sending long winded paragraph after paragraph to try to explain what I feel just manages to lose meaning with each word that drags on."
You saved my life,"I was and still am in a state of depression, but I’m better than before. I would make casual joke about it to make myself feel better and maybe deep down a cry for help. I play a lot of Xbox to keep me in a relatively happy or fine state of mind. I would message my friends and we would talk in a party or joke over texts, and one of my friends took my joke or statement seriously, I’m not mad I’m actually very thankful. They told their parents and they contacted the school therapist. Fast forward around a year more or less, and I’m doing a lot better. I asked the therapist who told them I made a statement about suicide, but they weren’t allowed to tell me. I don’t know who it was but I’m extremely thankful and want to repay them but I can’t and don’t know how. Sadly I broke apart from that group of people who I talked to on Xbox and in school so I possibly left the person who saved my life. I want to say thank you. You saved me."
I feel horrible,"Today March 17 is my brother birthday but he’s no longer in this world. Last year he was murdered right in front of home. I had to watch him slowly die and it hurts me that he’s longer here... it hurts that he didn’t get to make it to his birthday... it hurts to know that his life was cut too short and that the monster that took his life away is still free on the streets. I know I have to be strong, I know I’m trying, but I miss him way too much... I just never got a chance to say goodbye or to tell him how much I love him and now he’s gone.  "
My brother’s gone and I don’t know what to do. I need to let this out.,"Today, my best friend got married. It was a wonderful amazing night. We had an afterparty in a hotel suite and spent the night talking and reminiscing. 

I started talking to the brides brother and he’s telling me how he’s so happy to have found the person who’s going to rrat his sister well. How much he loves her and supports her no matter what. 

I lost my brother a few years back. Pretty much 4 years to the day. He was my anchor. He was my rock. He was my number one supporter against the world. I miss him so much. It hit me like a kick in the stomach. I had to leave the room cause I was about to loose it. Managed to keep it together and go back inside after giving myself 60 seconds to cry. 

Now everyone has left and I’m on the steps outside and I can’t stop crying. It’s like losing him all over again. I miss him so much. I hurt so much. He’s never going to be at my wedding. Never going to see me graduate. He’s gone. And fuck I just don’t know what to do. 

I can’t go home right now. I can’t go back to that house. I’m sitting out here with nowhere to go and I just... no one to talk to. It’s a happy day and I cannot fuck it up for my friends. 

But guys. I just needed to tell someone. I miss him so much. 

"
I really did it! I ran a 12 minute mile!,"I know it isn’t that fast, but I’m so damn proud of myself. 

A few months ago I joined a gym. I was fat, coming out of depression and ashamed at how out of shape I was. I had never run or lifted weights in my life. I started on the lowest possible settings/weights for everything and had to take constant breaks so I didn’t throw up. But I kept doing it, three times a week, a run on the treadmill and a cardio/weight circuit. The weight isn’t coming off the way I hoped, the pants aren’t really fitting much differently and I was getting so frustrated, I didn’t want to go today. But I did. 

And today, today I am a still fat, in somewhat better shape, runner. I did it. I ran the whole damn time and I did that whole mile in 12! freaking! minutes! 

And I didn’t want to throw up once.

Edit:
Holy Moly! A Gold! Thank you so much! 

Thank you everyone for the support and encouragement!  I am blown away by the love! My new goal will be a 5K by the fall, I really think I can get there! 

And for anyone who is thinking of (and intimidated by) starting to exercise or go to the gym, do it! I’m fat, was practically sedentary and in my late 30s. If I can do it, you can definitely do it!

"I’m a bit sadistic, but it’s really affecting my life.","Edit: told my mom about the problem, im having an appointment with my therapist today, hopefully he knows what to do. 

Hey guys, im new to this page but I’ve seen someone posting about a similar problem of mine, so i wanted to let this off my chest. This is going to be really hard for me to let out but I’m going to give it a shot. 

I am a bit sadistic, the type of sadism I enjoy isn’t the blood and gore granted, but rather the less messy type, electrocution is alright but what mainly gets me excited is beatings. This might be linked to my childhood, i used to get hit by my father for not obeying him or going against his will, and i feel it sparked something in me that made me admire and much more important feel excited about pain. 

I’m 19 going on 20 right now and what genuinely worries me is the possibility of this developing into something more serious, something harder to tackle. 

I’ve been recently diagnosed with panic disorder and I’ve been taking meds for it, i was hoping that medication would make me less interested in pain but it didn’t do me any good. 

This problem is stressing me out by the day, because I can’t go on a single minute without thinking about and/or searching for pain, it’s gotten to the point where there is a torture scene in a movie and i have to force myself to get up and leave the room so that I don’t seem excited about it in front of my parents. 

I was hoping to get help on here because i truly don’t know what to do, i come from a strict family but my mother understands mental problems and disorders because i got my panic disorder from her side of the family. I’m not sure if I should tell her about this or keep it to myself, though that worries me a lot. My mental health is plummeting because of this and it’s driving me insane. "
"After all these years, was it all a fucking lie?","I broke up with my SO of 5 years about 2 weeks ago. And I’m starting to piece things together.

DISCLAIMER: MY THOUGHTS HERE ARE NOT BACKED WITH PROOF, JUST SPECULATION AND STRONG FEELINGS

Her and I were everyone’s dream couple. Together since high school, everyone thought we’d make it together in life. Things do come to an end though.

She had bad trauma. Things that no one should ever have to go through. This was the base for her reason to separate. Because I loved her so much, I thought that I could do this for her so she can get the help she needs so she wouldn’t feel toxic to me. During that day she came over to talk about it, it first started with her and I communicating (which is what we prided ourselves for being great at with each other) on what was bothering her that I was doing. I thought this could simply be dealt with and we could work it out for the better. I then expressed how sexually unsatisfied I was. This was due to her trauma and how it affected her during sex sometimes. She then recommended we take a break and see other people because she never got a chance to date around and I never got a chance to fool around because of how young we were/are. 

This was feeling 1: did she find someone new and this was her shitty way of dealing with it. 

I wanted to be able to work it out and eventually come back together. She claimed she wanted that too, but said that she couldn’t promise it because, in her words, if she wasn’t ready for our serious relationship again and didn’t want to be toxic towards me. Look I get it, she wanted to date around and stuff for the experience cuz she never really got to, but this just makes me feel like it was an excuse to be able to leave me. 

How quickly she found this other person (2 weeks after the break up) shocked me. Now I can’t really say if they are dating because I wanted to give her space and it isn’t right of me to snoop and patrol her life. I wanted to give her time to do what she needed to do. But she post stuff on SC about how cute this guy is and how close they are. Also, I’m pretty damn sure this is the same guy she went on a “casual” date with.  This fucking hurts me. She said she wouldn’t be able to date for a while.

WHAT KILLS ME: She DOES have trauma. I’ve been up with her at night. Seen her shake and go into real panic attacks, scream herself awake from nightmares. 
WHAT KILLS ME: In the 5 years I’ve known her, she was not a horrible person and was always honest. She did love me and made me so happy. I do not see it in her to be this hurtful, sneaky, and untruthful. 
WHAT KILLS ME: How she cried and begged to stay friends with her. How she never could lose me as a person. 

I just know I’m being manipulated somehow. Whether it was so she could move on guilt free, or have me as backup if her adventures fail. I just KNOW I’m too hurt and full of bias to see and admit whatever this is. 

COULD THIS BE JUST HER NOT REALIZING HOW HURT SHE IS AND HOW SOON SHE NEEDED SOMEONE? Could be. I DONT KNOW!

I don’t want to go to the pessimists side of things, but I feel broken and hurt. Please, if anyone can help and share their insight, we can DM to talk more in depth about any questions you have. I just need answers... I do so much better with the truth and I wish I could just demand from her the answers but I can’t. Is she lying to me? Or am I just thinking to hard about a rough time that I’m going through? "
March 17 vent.,"This is just a vent. I feel like a very shallow person.

Today had been a bad day. I've been feeling horrible about myself. I feel lonely, but I don't want to talk to anybody because of me hating myself. And I want to talk about it, but I feel like it would be too much trouble for my boyfriend and my friends. I feel like I talk about myself a lot. And I find it futile to talk about it since my problem with myself can't be resolved because of myself, and because I don't know what to do or who to approach. I even feel bad about feeling uneasy about not having anybody to talk to. "
not sure what to do i guess, Life is just moving from one cope to the next and every time I return to a cope it works less and less and eventually there's gonna be nothing left. It already feels like there is nothing left honestly. I just don’t see how I am going to be able to fill something so bottomless. It just never ends and if I wait for however long and it still doesn’t get better then I won’t know what to do. Is being good at waiting a matter of being able to deal with the pain and fear of it all being for nothing or do people who wait well just not give a fuck what ends up happening? I don’t think I can just not give a fuck so idk what to do i guess. idk ending it around now would hurt a ton of people a lot but maybe its better to just rip the band aid off now and it'll be easier for them in the long run. idk i really don't get it idk what the right thing to do is. even if things are good for a little bit it always spirals back down and it just keeps going down and down and down.
I'm in a hellscape of my own making,"Someone told me once that it's tiring to keep supporting me because i run to him when things are bad for me mentally, and because of that i just stopped telling anyone anything whenever i feel suicidal or when the voices in my head act up again. I feel like i'm drowning and i'm slowly starting to plan my own suicide.

I don't even run to my boyfriend anymore because i'm afraid he's getting tired of helping and supporting me too.

I don't talk to that friend of mine about anything anymore. I just pretend i'm okay, even if i know that he knows how bad things can be for me.

I'm just exhausted of carrying things alone. I don't know who to turn to and i really just want to cry and isolate myself from everyone."
I waited too long I think...,"I’m 16M. Back when I was in 6th grade, moving from elementary school to middle, out of my own nervousness to talk to many people, I mostly kept the same friends as from elementary. But there was an extreme, or an outlier to that, and it was a beautiful girl I’d met in my first class of the day. As time went on I only started to grow familiar with how this new part of the world worked. Eventually, it became apparent to me that this girl liked me (this surprised me because I’m not even close to the best looking guy in our school system), and she was persistent with it. I was already friends with her, but she herself was too nervous to tell me she liked me, I found out from a mutual friend. I, bring an idiot, didn’t know how to react, and I tried to ignore it for a while. I didn’t know what to do in a relationship, and I was afraid to ask. Over the course of the next year and a half she grew on me, and I desperately liked her, and told her while we sat in the audience of a Talent show the next year. We shared that mutually, but neither of us knew the first thing about dating, and so nothing actually happened. We grew away from it again, still both liking each other, but too afraid to tell the other again. Time ticked by, and in the summer leading into 8th, I found out she was going to be moving that September. Talking with my best friend at the time about it, we decided I should find a way to tell her before she goes. And so on the second of December, I came into school with a great feeling of courage that I could do it, that I could tell her how I felt, and that I was an idiot not to have told her sooner. I stepped into my second class of the day where I would normally see her first in the day. She wasn’t there, because shed apparently moved the day before. She moved two time zones west of me, making it nearly impossible for me to see her any time in the next few years, if ever again. I spent a long time after that upset, spending hours at a time alone at home in tears, regretting not telling her before she moved away. Over the following two years we still talked and all, but the idea of the two of us liking each other never came up again for a while. Over time I’d known she’d changed, but I still liked her. She’d changed differently than you think. Sometimes, when you have the right groups, influences, and unfortunate genetics, you doubt who you are or who you should’ve been. For the last year and a half before last October, she’d gone by a different name, as well as mixed prefixes. When October came around, one of us finally snapped and spilled our guts to the other, and the second followed. In the process of me trying to be uplifting and supportive (over text mind you), she broke first, and told me she loved me. I followed, and told her it’d been killing me not to have said anything over the last two years prior. She gave up the male prefixes over the past few months, but still goes by the different name with her friends and all. At this point, we’re a few months before summer vacation, and I’ll be able to see her again. But the thing is, since I haven’t seen her in so long, I don’t know if she still uses the male prefixes and name as she started to when she got there or not. I fell in love with the girl that moved, but I’m not so sure if I love who she is now. She’s still just as beautiful as she was when I met her, if not more, but I don’t know what I’ll do if I don’t love the person she’s become now. This summer, I’m making a strong effort to take a plane ride west with another friend to visit her, so we can actually go for a first date, and I’m more than excited for it. Believe me, I wish I could hold her in my arms now, but I don’t know what I’d actually do if I were given the chance. I’m not the kind of person to go for that on an impulse. I’m doubtful of myself to no end. But I don’t know what to do. I would love to hear some advice on what I should do right about now."
I hate how I have to like something on social media to justify that I like it,Like can I like something without liking it or hearting it for the other person to know I like them
i feel like a dick,one of my best friends who also happens to be related to me is and has been struggling with depression. i have been in rough place for a while but i’m dealing with it as best i can and the way she is dealing with her depression makes me so mad. she isolates herself and posts on social media about being depressed and i bothers me so much.  part of it is that she’s gotten help and gotten diagnosed and i haven’t done that and i know i need to but i can’t bring myself to and i just feel like a horrible person for hating her for getting help and then posting about it and doing nothing with the help she’s been given
Just need to vent,"TW suicidal thoughts, mental health

I’ve told this to a million different psychiatrists, nurses, PAs, and social workers within the last week but I still feel like it’s on my chest, so here’s goes it.

I almost killed myself last week. I’d had two breakdowns, the first one I don’t remember at all, the second one I almost killed myself, and the third was when I called my mom and told her everything and then I checked into the hospital.

The second one was the worst for me because well, I remember it. It was 3:18 on Wednesday and I started absolutely sobbing and wailing on my kitchen floor. I know why, but I don’t want to address that here. I kept looking up at my kitchen knives and thinking about how badly I wanted to do it. How much I just didn’t want to be alive anymore. And then I thought no, that’s too painful, I should take a bunch of my sleeping pills and panic attack pills, so I could just drift off to sleep and never wake up. And god how badly I wanted that, too. I just wanted to die. But I didn’t.

In May, I was sexually assaulted. I still hate talking about it, I still haven’t resolved it at all with myself, I still am pushing it down further and further because it was my fault. I know it wasn’t, it was his choice and his actions and I was asleep and I couldn’t consent but it still felt like my fault. I was in his bed. I was seeing him. I had had sex with him that night. I gave up on objecting and saying no and that I wanted to go back to sleep. It was 5am. I didn’t want him. I’m still scared of him. I want to shout and scream at him that he’s a rapist even if he doesn’t think he is. I told one person. That one person now fucking hates me and I’m a mess still and I can’t talk to him now. 

I fucked up my relationship. I was making choices I wouldn’t normally make. I don’t feel like myself. I haven’t been acting like myself. And I wasn’t a great girlfriend. Hell, I don’t think I was even a good girlfriend. I’d rather not talk more about that though, it still stings more than anything. 

I checked myself into the hospital Monday and stayed there until Wednesday. A few times I caught myself thinking, “what if Ex is texting me right now and he thinks I’m blowing him off or I blocked him?” It’s not a healthy outlook at all, I was in the fucking hospital. I thought about trying to get his phone number from my phone if the nurses would let me so I could call him, but I didn’t think he’d want to talk to me anyways. I wanted to tell him everything and where I was. I wanted him to drive back up and come visit me in the hospital. I wanted to see him, to talk to him, to touch him, to cry on his shoulder (quite literally). I had texted him to clear out the air a while back, and he later texted me after the first conversation that he still considers me a friend. I was shocked. I haven’t talked to him since we talked about being friends, I don’t want to press him too much, yknow? I sent him a cool video on here yesterday I think. He sent me one back. It was good 

I cried myself to sleep the first night in the hospital. I don’t know how I spiraled out this far. I don’t know who I am anymore and I gotta say guys, it’s really fuckin scary. I’m so scared of myself for those thoughts I was having and what I was so close to doing.

I’m in college, but after the hospital visit, my mom and I decided that I’m going to medically withdraw from school and move home. I’ll finish my AA, I’m only one course away, and then transfer to the university here. I guess there’s one perk to growing up in a college town! I hate to leave all my friends. I hate to leave Ex with my feelings so unsettled. I hate that I don’t know how to tell him or if he would care anymore. I put him through so much because of how unstable I am. And I don’t want to make excuses for my actions, they were mine and I will own that. I just wish my head wasn’t so fucked right now. I wish my head hadn’t been fucked when I met him, or when I dated him, or when I ended it. I wish I didn’t have to go to the hospital that day. I wish I had been strong enough to deal with my shit with my therapist and psychiatrist. I wish I could have a fresh start. I wish I hadn’t failed my classes. I wish I hadn’t imploded my life. I wish I hadn’t smoked so much weed. I wish my medicine didn’t make me sick everyday. There are so many things that I wish I could change but I can’t. 

In case you read this far, I’m stable now. I’m sad, sure, I’m uprooting my life in college and moving home, but I’m with my mom and we’ve been doing productive things with our time. My sisters dog is here so I have her to snuggle with at night and walk in the morning. Right now, she’s my daily purpose. I’m seeing a psychiatrist Monday to be evaluated for a long-term outpatient program and I’m actually excited about it! It feels so good to be excited again! 

Here’s to hoping."
"Two years ago, I tried to kill myself.","It’s my anniversary. In a few hours, two years ago today, I tried to kill myself. I’m not suicidal or in a head space remotely close to the one I was in a couple of years ago, but I can’t help but feel panicked. I’m happy to be alive, so why do I feel so sick to my stomach?"
I feel undeserving of love because I don’t have certain features,"
I feel like a man would secretly dislike my weird boobs, stretch marks, KP on my arms and legs, bulbous nose, hyperpigmentation on my toes and fingers, etc. and would wish for something better. 


The fear of a boyfriend never accepting and loving my body and all of the imperfections that come with it, while I love every square inch of him. Or the thought of even losing my long-term partner after a decade of marriage for him to find someone new, prettier, or more exciting. The fear of not being able to discuss my insecurities because “guys LOVE confidence” and “insecurities are a major turn off!!” — I would hate to be a burden. It has stopped me from being romantic or even kissing a man. I feel like I would make the most perfect girlfriend, but at the same time, I am lacking so much. I’m so ashamed of thinking about myself in this way and of all the things that make me, me, to the point where I’m considering never finding love.  The fact that I would _actually_ feel sorry for having flaws is telling. 

Ugh, rant over. "
I’ll never understand why life has to be so hard on me,I’m so tired of feeling this way. I just want to be normal. I don’t think I’ll ever be normal. No kind of medicine is going to fix me. Talking to someone won’t fix me. Why am I like this? I feel deeply lonely
I'm alone on Saturday night and I can't stop feeling that none of my friends actually care about me.,"The title pretty much says it all. My roommate is going to a party I wasn't invited to, my other friends are all going to different places. I feel like all my friends are basically in one group, and when they're busy with other things I'm left with basically nobody. Maybe it's because of St. Paddy's day, but I'm pretty sure I'm the only one in my friend group home alone. Going to a bar alone at this point just seems depressing, because even when I do that everyone else is either there as a couple or with a group. It feels like all I can do it sit around and play games on my own."
What's wrong with me?,"The majority of people I would consider myself friends with, or not even necessarily friends, have been in relationships. Then there is me. I have never had anyone reciprocate feelings for me in a romantic way. Ever. I always try to be nice, I also try not to give people space as well So I don't seem to clingy, and I'm fairly funny, smart, and well I may not be Zac Effron, I'm not ugly. What am I doing wrong? Any advice would really help."
"My model friend who has done nude photo shoots and multiple porn videos told me that he only wants a pure, virgin girlfriend like me","
So let me get this straight. You’re an incredibly attractive model, and for some reason you’re actually quite humble. You’ve done so many photoshoots, including nude ones and you’ve made so much money that you told me you’ll retire in 5 years. I asked whether you’ve done porn before and your answer was no. When you found out that I (21F) was a virgin you told me it was the best news you’ve heard in a while. I was confused. 

You told me that you swore to yourself you would never marry a girl unless she saved herself for you. You told me that I am the girl for you because of my purity and because I’ve worked hard to get to where I am now in terms of studies and career. You told me that I have the materials of a wife and that’s what you can’t find in most women these days. I found out that you lied to me and you did indeed shoot multiple porn videos and made a whole heap of money off it. 

What I don’t understand is, how is it fair that I work so hard to get to where I am, everyday trying to focus on myself, my career and studies and not fucking around? How is it fair that you, an attractive male who has fucked around with multiple women and made money off it, only begs for a virgin girlfriend? I just don’t understand.. "
I'll never be at peace with my body without major life/mobility-threatening surgery,"And it's beyond depressing. I have Scheurmann's Disease, which basically means the upper part of my spine curves out too far and then my middle back curves in too far giving a hunchback appearance. The only option I have to lessen it is major invasive surgery that is life-threatening and has the possibility of paralysis. Along with making me absolutely disgusted with my body it causes so much pain everyday. 

And its just so hard to face the fact that I'm never going to fully love myself and that it'll probably get worse when I get older. I'll never be completely comfortable in my skin. I'll never feel confident with a partner during sex. The only man I've been with once told me when we were doing it doggy style, ""no offense but why does your back look like that?"" and I'll probably never be comfortable with sex again. I'm too self conscious to even wear a swimsuit in public because I know people see my back and wonder what the fuck is wrong with me. And being completely honest, looking straightforward I'm a totally normal, somewhat pretty 24-year old girl. I'm totally okay with my body other wise. I'm not beautiful but I'm normal and cute. But then I turn to the side and the back and I'm repulsive. I have the back of 60 year old woman. I'll have to deal with issues all my life because I was unlucky enough to have this disorder. and I know people have worse things but it's just such an odd, not common thing that there's no ""body acceptance"" campaign things or encouragement for people with fucked up spines or anything. It's just not very common and that's what makes it harder because there's hardly anyone to relate to. 

And no offense but it makes me so mad when people complain that their weight makes them self conscious, like I get it... to an extent it's genetic, or can't be changed but for the most part, if you really really want to change it, you can dedicate yourself to it and do it. It's fucking fixable. Be happy that it is. Unless I want to risk my life and mobility, I'll have to live with my disfigurement and it affects every facet of my life. and it's noticeable in clothes but not always so I'll always have to worry about a guy finally seeing it when I sleep with him and wondering if he'll run away because my body is so fucked up. It's just so fucking hard to deal with. It hurts me so much. It's painful and disgusting and this is what I have to live with. and it makes me look so awkward and slouchy and unsexy and I'd give anything in the world to feel pretty and to wear a fucking backless top or just a tank top and feel pretty and normal and not like a disgusting freak and I hope somebody loves me one day regardless of it and that it doesn't get worse and that one day I can deal with the pain and that it'll get better. I'm just so fucking sad. Most of the time I avoid even looking at my back in the mirror but sometimes it just hits me how disfigured and awkward my body looks. and you don't know how fucking hard it is when I see just people with straight normal backs, like fuck why of all things did I have to end up like this?"
Feeling conflicted,"I'm 20(F) and my parents recently separated and my mother is filing for a divorce after 20 years of being together and the last 5 leaving my mother very unhappy, that I have personally witnessed and she expressed to me. I never really had a great relationship with my father and he left our home about a month ago now and my mother now has a boyfriend. While I'm glad that she's happy, having that guy around the house so often all of a sudden feels weird and being at home doesn't have the same comfort level as it did before. She wants her boyfriend to move in, but he refuses until the divorce is final and might I add, he's married in a different country but ""doesn't love his wife anymore."" I feel like he's a hypocrite for not divorcing his wife before dating my mother. I want to move out to let her do her thing and I can find my own home. I don't want to be part or be this close to her relationship, it feels wrong."
I'm afraid,"I've been talking to this guy for a bit that I met on an online dating app and he's basically perfect. He's all I would want in a guy and from what I can tell the feeling is mutual. We're supposed to meet tomorrow, but I'm afraid. I've always been scared of meeting people because I feel like they'd be disappointed with how I am irl. I'm afraid of getting attached and growing feelings for someone. But most of all, I'm afraid to tell my parents I will be seeing someone. I'm in 20's, but I've been really sheltered. It has to do mostly with cultural reasons. I don't wanna lose the opportunity to meet an amazing guy, but I also don't know how to tell my parents I'm leaving the house because I have a date.

What do I do?"
i hate smiling.,"i am 20 years old. i hate smiling. why ? because when i do it, i feel plain ugly. i have a very gummy smile and braces and little teeth in general. every time i smile, i feel defeated. i am also a live actress and get denim roles because of my smile i absolutely hate it. "
Fuck you for making me feel bad about not driving your entitled ass.,"I realized I cancelled kind of last minute and yeah, that sucks, but it was for a valid reason. My car literally wouldn’t let me shift gears and I wasn’t about to get into an accident or get stuck an hour away downtown just because you wanted to party. I explained all this to you and still you had the audacity to say that me canceling was some “b**** shit”. Like I’m so sorry that you can’t wear the outfit you bought for the night but that’s the least of my concerns when I’m gonna be the one paying to fix my car. Which I’m sure, costs a whole lot more than your outfit. I’m honestly glad you don’t “fuck with” me anymore because you are an entitled little brat who’s still stuck in an immature high school mindset. I’m a grown woman now and honestly, had I been in high school, I probably would have gone off on you. However, I decided to apologize for something that was completely out of my control. The thing I’m most mad about is how you made me doubt myself and made me feel like shit and even made me think I should have to apologize to you. Grow up, things like this happen. And learn how to fucking drive if you’re gonna get pissy at other people (who you rely on btw to drive you places) when their cars break down. 

Okay, rant over. Sorry, I just couldn’t believe the entitlement that came from her. "
March 17,"Today hasn’t been celebrated for two years, although it deserves to be. Three years is a long time. A lot of dedication and commitment. Yet, for the past two March 17’s, our relationship seems to be in a broken place. Last year it was mended, and this year a new issue has made its way. I know you’re angry at me. I miss you. It’s been hard not being able to talk. After everything I still love you like the first March 17. I still feel excited around you and nervous like in Observatory Park. I know we’ve been through shit but the fact that my feelings are still so strong says so much to me. Despite everything that’s going on, today is still a special day for me. I’ve been thinking about you all week, and I will especially be today. You’re always on my mind, and I hope that next March 17 calls for a celebration and not a separation. "
"Young, black 18 year old male from GA needs advice!","Okay so this is my first post on here. I don't know what's making me post, but I guess I got tired of reading everyone else's questions (some does apply) and not asking my own. So basically I'm gonna break it all down.. I just turned 18 in February. As of right now this is where my life is: I'm not in school currently because I broke some property at my school back in October of 2018 and I been playing with re-enrolling in an Online school simply because school was just the last thing on my mind. I know, I should be focused. I should be good in school, but for some reason I can't. Well I can, but I don't. I'm what some people would refer to as a ""Thug"" or something. Which honestly I do live a street lifestyle and I commit fraud and scam people just to buy new clothes and shoes or laptops or electronics I want but can't afford. But don't let that fool you, I am still a decent person. I can play nice, I am still a regular person after all. I just want stuff that I can't have, and I'm a go-getter so I get it the only way I know how: scamming.  Now another issue I've been having is me and my mom has been getting into it a lot lately, well really since I could talk it seems. Everyday me and her get into it about something, then pretend it didnt happen a little bit later.(Dad's not around, he's literally a stripper in Texas lol). She has Lupus and a whole bunch of other illnesses and she's been sick for 11 or more years now.  I know She's probably miserable too, she can't work. She doesn't get along with none of her family. Neither do I actually. She can't pay her bills on time because she doesn't have good income (shes on disability) and she survives basically off the scraps the government gives us. Now before she was sick when I was really little she was doing well in life. I don't know how she interacted with people back then but I can assure you not as mean as she is now lol. But yeah anyways we cuss each other out all day, she just sits in her room and yells at me all day. I pretty much try to avoid her. Sometimes the arguments are my fault. But sometimes I feel she just wants to argue with someone. I get soo mad when we argue and I destroy the house. She says it's because she's a defenseless woman so it makes it easier for me to bully her ( as she would say on the phone talking mad loud with the door WIDE open from the room next door lol) In all fairness, I'm not no saint, but my mom literally starts with everybody nowadays. I just need advice on how to deal with her. It seems like her soul purpose of waking up each day is to ruin my day lol. Other than her, my whole family hates me because of how I treat my mom (cussing, breaking stuff, etc, even tho they've all been thru the exact same stuff with her) . More problems include the fact that I'm on Juvenile probation with 6 Adult felony charges pending on me. I have no job. I get interviews, but they don't call back. But I can't blame them. I borderline dropped out, no other real work experience other than working with my brothers moving business ( the one who hates me the most ) . Sometimes even like right now, I feel like I'm a total failure in just a short 18 years of life. I couldn't do the basic stuff like just go to school and be good. I'm gonna be honest. I put myself in all of these positions with family, school, and criminal stuff. I'm just trying to fix it. I just don't wanna end up a bum or keep continuing down the wrong path and end up in jail or dead. For an 18 year boy I been to jail (mostly juvie, twice in county) like 6 or 7 times. So death isn't too much more far away I think. I lost all my friends basically when I dropped out and cut off the rest trying to be independent. I just don't wanna be a loser in life. I don't want to have to keep stealing either. I want legit businesses, I want to go to college, I have goals and dreams too. But I messed them up, being dumb, and heading down the wrong path. How could I save my life before I lose it for good?

P.S. sorry if this post is all over the place, I'm new to this, and I had so much I wanted to say but decided to keep the post semi-shortened. Also forgot to mentioned some other things but might make a second post later"
Stupid customers,"I was stupid proud of telling the two my name, when I shouldn’t have to. We all don’t wear name tags and I was working as the cashier.

It’s a form of a habit, to ask for one of their names for a personalized order as much as it is to distinguish customers from the other - we don’t do numbers, since the receipt won’t print that, as much as that would be helpful, if you really don’t want to give me *a* name.

They return me with a “so what’s your name? You don’t have a name tag” - which, by the way, none of us do.

I tell them my name, and it’s dandy not simple like Siobhan or Sharayah or Sean, but something a bit more similar.

One of the two hit me with the “oh, it’s probably why you don’t have a name tag”.

That bothered me more than it should.

Should’ve been more clever but I took a passive “I’m stupid” approach to get rid of them and was relieved for the next person in line.

The two were loud, jabbing fingers and chattering rude to my coworker about it.

I’ve lost sleep over it. Gah. Leave me be, worried mind of mine."
My fiancé / best friend broke up with me suddenly,"We've been together for 3 years and close friends for almost a decade. He said that he can't promise a future with me anymore and does""t know what he wants but then he says he loves me and wants to be a part of my life. I'm so heartbroken and confused, and when I spoke to his mom and sister they were just as shocked. We've always had a positive relationship and felt as though we could tell each other anything. We disagreed on some and things but we never fought and we had similar life goals. We were just looking at houses on zillow two days ago!

He's been struggling with depression and ptsd and we think he's shutting people out. He refuses to go to counseling but me and his family strongly believes he needs to. I don't know what to do, I'm getting so many mixed signals and f things really are over, our lease isn't up for another two months. I'm also a fulltime university student and this is all just hitting suddenly at a bad time. I know that if things are over between us it would be better to stay away, but I'm also extremely worried for his mental health and safety and want to be supportive.

&#x200B;

(edit) would also like to add that he said that he doesn't feel good enough and that i deserve someone better. He told me he thinks he's holding me back, which I don't personally believe is true."
Regarding the New Zealand Terrorist Attack.,"I’m not sure how to start this, but my heart aches for the lives lost and damaged in these disgusting acts of terrorism. To the families, to the friends and the communities that these people are essential in.

I say this speaking as a White Englishman, living in America and with no religion. 

To the Muslim community - your response is beautiful, just like your religion. I’m not well versed, but I respect anybody with a religion. It’s a dedication that amazes me. I have never been shown an act of digression from a Muslim person ever, and to anybody this reaches, wether in New Zealand or anywhere who wishes to talk and hear safe words I would love to be able to help in this time of need. 

I’m not a religious man but I truly believe life is about love and that is what I see pouring out of the world right now. I have to believe that love will win. To the humans offering to watch others pray, to the humans donating blood for survivors, to the humans who are trying their hardest to comfort these families - to the humans - you are all incredible.

It’s sad that it takes such acts of atrocities for this love to be so visible but this love is beautiful.

To those humans of the world who feel that they are of a superior worth to anybody ever - you are not. It is sad and pitiful that you think this way yet I show no remorse nor pity for you. I do not think you are worth less than me, but I do think you are so unbelievably stupid. 

I also have to say for this to be documented ever as anything expect terrorism is a disgrace. 

Somewhere down the line, we are all one. 

If it’s from a god,
If it’s from science,
If it’s from anything else,

Somewhere we are all from the same and I don’t know who is right.

The ripple you can create will always be overwhelmed by the waves we will return.

So overall,

Fuck you and fuck your ripple.

I love my humans, even the ones I don’t know and you’ve made me love them more.

The things that have been rolling around in my head,"The last few days for me has been a complete shitstorm. From being moderately happy to depressed. The last few days my parents have been having the dumbest arguments ever, this has been going on the past 7 years. Usually what would happen is they would “break” up at least 2 times a year and when they got back together my dad would buy her something really expensive. The first time this happened I was really upset. I was maybe 11. But as the years came on I would soon find myself hoping that it would be permanent so that this whole mess would soon be over. When my bio parents split up, it hurt but I soon got over it as I realize how much a p.o.s my bio mom is. But this is different, the possibilities of my new family being torn apart takes a toll. I have a 3 year old sister and I don’t want her to grow up with split parents the way I did, she deserves a lot better than I had. But it hurts to see my dad and s. m fighting all the time. The last time they split s. mom left and my dad and I were talking about what was going to happen.( I have current plans to go to job corps to complete school) I had brought up job corps and he kinda brushed it to the side which made me realize that if s. mom left my whole plan for my future would be torn apart. My dad would probably either have me stay at home and watch my little sister or quit his job. Now the idea of s. mom being gone was nice b/c she as her own agenda of how she wants stuff going on around here. (The argument that had gone on tonight was how she was upset that my dad wouldn’t let her control and make decisions with the money that HE makes not her.) and most of these fights usually pertain to money. We are not poor but we are not rich. S. Mom has a whole bunch of nice stuff but she keeps wanting more. She wants my dad to sell my child hood house so we would have money to move closer to her own kids who live with their dad. This pissed off my dad but she somehow changed his mind and their set on moving there sometime this year, and this would also mess with my plans too as I would have to move to a different job corps campus that does not have the job training that I want to take part in. Her kids didn’t want to move with us because my parents won’t spoil them like their dad does. So s. mom wants to move there so she can be apart of their life more. It just frustrates me cause those kids get everything they want. They all have next gen consoles, brand new top of the line phones, they get payed at least 100 for doing their laundry each time. But honestly I’m quite frankly done with this shiz and I really hope that I can go before any of this takes event. I’ve tried multiple time to move in with my older sister but the parents shoot it down each time or her pos pill popper of a fiancée makes up some bullshit reason for me not to live with them, either it be my grades in school or my attendance. And this dude pisses me off big time. He is 35 and he comes to me, a 17 year old dude asking if I know anyone who sells percosets or any other opiate, and goes on bragging that he buys 800 dollars worth of pills each month. All that money could have been used to fix their cars or live a good life but no that pos has to make their life worse and make my sister pay for rent and all the necessities while he waste his money on that junk and it’s major bs. He uses his taxes to buy a used car every year because he somehow keeps ruining the cars that he buys. And don’t even get me started on his family. They all treat my side of the family dumb because most of us are deaf and his mom who raised a whole bunch of low lives constantly bails then out of jail and her daughter is in jail for possession of 10 lbs of meth, lsd, weed, and heroine in school property. How dumb do you have to be to do that. But yet they treat my sister like crap, they constantly bully her and pos fiancé’s brothers bring their dirty laundry to my sister like she is a laundry mat and it’s dumb. My sister had something good going for her until she met this dude. She got with him when she was my age and he was 27 when this had happened. It was all good for a while, my sister was going to college and pos was too. But then pos got my sister pregnant. (Don’t get me wrong I love the shiz out of my nieces) but once the kid was born, this was when things started going down hill. My sister had to quit college because of the pregnancy but pos continued college. (And the kicker is is pos isn’t even working at a place his degree would have gotten him to, he’s now working at a water company taking calls.) pos doesn’t even help my sister with the kids he just lays around the house doing nothing. I just feel really bad for my sister and I really hope she gets out of that relationship that she’s in and finds someone who actually cares. Well I’m done for now and it was kinda nice letting this out and I’ll update you guys if anything happens."
I’m gay.,"It hit me like a ton of bricks, on my birthday yesterday. I called myself bi, always said I’m attracted to the person. But no, the reason I couldn’t make it work with the perfect guy is that I’m a lesbian. "
"I'm a male, almost 25 year old and nobody loves me. I don't know what's wrong with me. Please help me.","I am 25 years old and I have nobody. LEGIT NOBODY.

Sorry if this is getting out of hand but god-fucking damn it i hate to always be the first one to reach out to people.

This is so fucking bullshit since i am actually likeable but people think i am a fucking idiot, like im so incompetent. Everyone avoids me and always try to nicetalk me when i confront them about why they wont talk to me, like i get it, they have their own lives and they're minding their own business but hell, not even a greet? are people so fucking busy nowadays that they cant even hit me up like yo whats up how you been and shit like what the actual fuck.

What really gets to me is when my ""friend group"" decides to hang out without even thinking about inviting me.

Im the most hated person among people i know and know me.

I wish i was being taken seriously. I wish i wasn't living like this anymore. I just want to be awknowledged and appreciated as a person but oh well i dont know what i can do anymore.

I do have a lot of friends dont get me wrong but whats the point when they show no little fucking bit of interest in you?

I have made many statements that i dont need anyone that dont need me but it is so hard to let people go.

Please guys this is a very horrible situation and i would love advices from you because i dont want to keep living like this in self hatred. I wish i wouldnt have to prove myself that im actually worth as a human being. "
Fake love from my bro,"I sorry if not allowed but I just need somewhere, to get a few things off my mind my talking about them. First so you know the bro I am talking about is a few years old then me. And we work together but we are or “friends” but I am starting to think that since this guy has lest things then I do that I am being used for the things I have. The guy has not always been this way but the last few weeks he has changed and I know that nothing is going on with him y is he being that way "
I beat someone up tonight.,"It’s St. Patrick’s weekend and the drunks are out.

A group of five of us went out tonight to dance and have a good time.  Punk band is playing, I’m eating chips and finishing a pint when i notice a bloke dancing with my girlfriend and her friends, no big deal. 

Girls aren’t really feeling him (he’s dancing like a drunk arse), my gf asks me to dance so she doesn’t have to dance with the bloke. We do everything is ok until after the song he walks up and tries to put  both his arms around my gf and her friend.  

They step back behind me and tell him they don’t like him and he needs to leave them alone. I affirm the statement and he seems to get the idea. 

Next song I hear a SMACK! My gf’s friend slapped him for groping my gf. I only heard the pop, and looked over and saw drunky messing with my friends. I step in for the second time and say “Hey! Stop
Touching the girls asshole! “ 

That’s when it happened. 

He’s about 6’4” and  about 12.5 stones (175lbs) 
I’m 5’11” and about the same. 

He step up and say “ Oh yeah, oh yeah!” 

I grab him by the tie (poor fella started a fight with his tie on.) and hold him against a pillar. While I’m holding him and frantically trying to find someone to hold my pint (I wasn’t gonna glass em) he swings and I duck. Girlfriend grabs the pint and he eats my overhand left and drops. I’m able to switch the tie to my left hand and hold his head to the floor while I rain down the rights. He ate about 12 heavy uppercuts. It was a blur. 

I feel arms around my neck choking me saying “ I’m sorry , I’m sorry!” It’s my GFs friend who slapped him. 

I pull away, safe and secure.. he’s pulled away bleeding and cussing. F this ballocks that. 

I’ve never been in a fight. I hate it. I feel awful. But I feel he deserved it too. "
I have been way too lucky in life,"I am becoming a better person. I have had too many wake up calls that have gone unnoticed. Have you ever known that something is bad, but you’ve done it so much that it just becomes normal to you? 

I don’t want to feel this way anymore. I truly believe that being a good person will do more than just give you a peace of mind. It improves all the aspects of life. 

Someone has been looking out for me. I am not very religious at all, but I know some things that have happened it my life cannot be sheer coincidence. It’s time for me to listen to what the universe is telling me. "
I just had my first panic attack. I don't know how to feel,"I feel scared, relieved that i got through it, worried if it will happen again. I was listening to music and dancing and it just jumped into me. Like a presence. I felt the panic surging and i started to shake

I felt heavy and my stomach was making loud noise and had slight pain. I checked my heart to see if it was still beating. Im sitting here taking deep breathes

I'm happy i got through it. But im about to break my diet to calm down. It seems as though food helps me in a way"
I was in a car accident that should’ve killed me,"I’m coming to terms with the fact that I was able to limp away. The other driver blew a stop sign and sped across the intersection. There was literally nothing I could’ve done to avoid her. My car’s airbags failed, but I had my seatbelt on. I wound up spending most of he night at the hospital, but I left earlier than I should’ve because my family drove out to rescue me and I didn’t want to keep them waiting. 
It could’ve been worse. The car is totaled. The frame is bent and the engine was damaged. 

I just don’t know what to do. I’m scared to drive, but I have to be able to get to work and class. There’s no real public transportation on Long Island. I have a long commute from my house to my school. I’m supposed to graduate in May, but I’m terrified at the thought that I have to make that drive by myself for the rest of the semester. I’m the only person in my class that lives on Long Island and commutes to NJ, so carpooling isn’t an option. It feels stupid to quit now out of a fear of driving, but I can’t talk about it with anyone. I can’t even listen to the song that was playing when the accident happened without feeling sick. I feel like I’m going crazy. "
Never understood why people made throwaways...until now.,"I realized that my ex/old bestfriend has recently found my main account on reddit. I am not ashamed about anything I wrote on it but the issue is that I realized he is actually stalking my account. 

He brought up my comment on someone’s post and told me how it made him quite depressed. Him being sad like this over my comment is bothering me and I wanted to prevent that from happening. 

So I now understand why people use throwaways or alt accounts. Some may be for a different reason than this but I do get it. It sucks. "
I don’t know what I am.,"Hi! I’m a 20y, female with a relationship with a guy. So  a very close friend of mine, opened up to me and told me he was bisexual. I told him that I might be too. I also lightly told my boyfriend that I might be bisexual and he told me that he was - of course - shocked but also he thinks that it cause a bit of a damage to our relationship.

When I was young (like maybe 7-9 years old? i’m honestly not sure), a female cousin of mine about the same age as well we did some sexual stuff. Kissing and masturbating, like touching each other’s private part and that’s it. Both of us of course kept it a secret but when I grew older I realized that what we did is wrong. Now, my cousin is a lesbian and as far as I know I’m straight but when I watch porn I tend to get turned on by the females getting turned on, like I imagine myself in their shoes. I don’t know if it’s considered bisexual but I can’t imagine myself dating a female but I am open to having sex with them. My bf doesn’t know about the cousin thing because I’m sure he’s gonna get awkward with me and stuff. Anyway, am I bisexual? I’m really confused because my whole life, I know I’m straight. Now i don’t even know anymore. Someone help me."
Need to vent,"Today we had an emergency situation at my school (which luckily turned out to be a false alarm). People were panicking and checking social media and getting and making calls to friends and family. I let my parents know as soon as I found out, since I didn't want them to hear about it from somewhere else and start worrying. And then while I was checking different social media sites for more info, I realized: only about 2 people contacted me to see if I was okay, with a 3rd asking later on when it was pretty apparent that it was a false alarm. All of them were close family members. I had always felt alone here, even now while I'm in my final year, but realizing that I literally have no friends here, who couldn't care less whether I was potentially alive or dead, just kind of breaks me. The loneliness, depression, and social isolation is nothing new, I have kind of gotten used to it by now and learned to shove these feelings deep inside, but seeing so clearly, in no uncertain terms, how little the vast majority of people in my life care about my existence... it makes it hard to keep going. 

The only reason I still trudge through every day without ending it all is for those 3 people who do care. But that's all I can do, is just surviving and completing the bare minimum amount of assignments and obligations expected of me. I'm not actually living, I stopped living years ago. I want to hope that some day things might get better and I won't feel like this anymore, but every day and every experience I have is evidence to the contrary. Everytime I try to get out of my comfort zone or try to take a risk, it just blows up in my face, sometimes spectacularly. 

Everyone always says, ""just be yourself"", and that's all I've ever done, society be damned. I don't think I'm socially unaware, I know what things are appropriate and inappropriate in different contexts, and I don't try to be an asshole and try to be tactful in certain situations. In fact, I've been making an honest effort to be the ""good guy"", to not be so judgmental of other and accept them as they are, to try and help others when I can, to try and be friendly, confident, witty, and genuine, all in my own way.  But it never sticks. I keep trying and keep trying and all I ever see is failure. They always say ""successful people fail much more often than they succeed"" but neglect to tell you what to do when all you ever do is fail. 

I'm trying so hard to be strong, to make it to the next day, to make my family proud and make myself happy, but it's too much. I graduate in less than a month and a half. It's too late for me to make friends and to enjoy my stay here. I blew it, and I will never get that time back. Never again, for the rest of my life. Now all I have to look forward to is living at home for the next 2 or 3 years, so I can pay off my student loans. Then, after that's done, *maybe* I can find a good job somewhere, *maybe* I can save up some money for the down payment on a house, and *maybe* I can have one more chance to enjoy my youth before it's gone. But if the past is any indication, I'll squander that chance too. And then what, I just spend my life in solitude, hoping that my life is short and living to work? I don't even know if I can make it through those 2 or 3 years of living at home. I got a taste of what it was like to work at this job last summer, and it was soul crushing. I was the youngest person there by at least 6 years, pretty much all guys except for a few middle-aged, married women in the building next-door. Long hours, short lunch breaks, and I found out that since I'm technically considered ""part-time"" I won't have any paid vacation days for my first year. All of that, combined with the fact that I have next to nothing left to live for, and I predict that it will be a very trying time indeed. 

And the funny thing is, compared to some of the other jobs people are working and what other people go through, I have it good. And what does this knowledge get me? It makes me ashamed. I should be happy where I am, people would kill to have the opportunities I've been given, but I just don't have the strength left to appreciate it, no matter how much I focus on it and try. If I have it good, then how are other people who don't have it as good keep going? Is this what life is all about, dealing with shit 90% of the time just to hopefully enjoy the 10% remaining? If this is what I have to look forward to, I want no part in it. If I'm told that this is the way it is and the way it will always be, I might as well save myself some pointless suffering and just end it now. 

Of course, I can only wait and see. No one knows what's in store for them, and maybe it does get better. Maybe I'm wrong, and that's not what life is all about, and that my situation is not typical. But from what I've seen so far, it doesn't look good. All I can do is hope and wait, and to keep struggling and trying and failing and hoping against hope that something will stick and a new path will open up. Then I will have normal concerns like ""where should I take my wife to eat on Valentine's Day"", versus my current, daily concern of ""do I really want to give in and end my suffering, but at the cost of ruining my parents lives, and significantly impacting the rest of my family's lives?"" Maybe, I guess I'll just have to wait and see.

Phew. All done. Everything's off-my-chest. For now. I don't feel like proof-reading right now, so I'll just post this as-is."
I'm Extremely Attracted To One Of My Straight Friends And I'm Ashamed Of It,"I've been out of closet for years now and anytime I thought a straight friend was attractive, I could easily ignore it and be friends. It especially helps that I'm very picky emotionaly, like you could be the most attractive *(gay)* person in the world, and I'd still not date you. Infact I tend to find people with great personalities extremely more physically attractive. To sum it up, physical appearance means very little to me in comparison to someone's personally. I know this isn't ground breaking discover but I'm a 17 years old guy so... 

Anyways there's this one guy *(for the sake of privacy I'm calling him Dan)* who I've known since middle school, but only really started talking to in high school. He's not a supermodel but I remember thinking he was cute once or twice and that was it. About a quarter way threw this school year I started feeling like Dan was giving off signs that he was gay and maybe even hitting on me a little. I hadn't talked to Dan much before that so I went along with it and just tried to learn more about him. 

After talking and getting to know Dan, I really started to fall for him. Again, I am under the impression Dan's secretly gay. So in a conversation, I get him to tell me wether he is gay or straight *(I didn't outright ask him, I kinda alluded to it or something. I honestly don't remember.)* and Dan tells me he's straight. Now I'm really confused so I try to dig for more info, without making it obvious that I'm digging for info, and he comes to the same conclusion. That was four or five months ago. 

Dan and I are still talking a ton and even getting into personal conversations, and my feeling for him haven't changed. He's just super smart, funny, and genuinely nice and because of how my brain works, that make him ultra physically attractive. I'm just super embarrassed and ashamed to be feeling this way towards a straight guy and not being able to shake it. I really needed to get this off my chest because actually telling Dan would probably ruin our friendship.

Is anyone else out there is going through a similarities situation as me? And does anyone this I should tell Dan how I feel?"
I hate my life and I need to vent. [NAW],"I hate my life. I hate who I am. I hate my body. I hate my mind. I hate that I have driven away all my friends. I hate that I can't retain new ones. I hate that I can't speak to my dad. I hate my brother for what he did to me. I hate how I live. I hate that I have nothing.

I hate the constant sadness. I hate the constant pain of no longer wanting to be alive. I hate my cowardice for not just ending it all. I hate that I can't kill myself because of those I care about. I hate being alone. 

I hate when people try to help me and get it wrong. I hate when people ignore me. I hate that I've been awake 24 hours and I'm still wide awake. I hate that all I want to do is cry but can't. I hate feeling like this. 

I hate my ex. No i don't, I hate that I love my ex. I hate my depression. I hate my job. I hate my life. I hate that I can't write. I hate my crippling social anxiety. I hate my fat lazy arse. I hate that I'm embarrassed of my eating disorder. I hate how I use it as an excuse to eat. I hate how depressed it makes me feel. 

I hate how attention seeking this post seems. I hate that if I don't post it, I'll never get it out. I hate the healthcare professionals who have misdiagnosed and mistreated me for 6 years. I hate that I'm probably responsible for that. 

I hate how much I have to hide from people. I hate how fake I am.I hate that all I can think about is death and how I won't be in pain amymore. I hate that I can't do it. I hate that I am alive. I hate that I feel lostand without hope. I hate the darkness my life has become. I hate myself.

I hate myself.

I really fucking hate myself."
I will never fully get over my best friend abandoning me.,"Growing up, I never had a best friend. I was mostly a loner. I had a few friends but no one I could ever call a \*best friend\*, no one who I could say was my number one and I was their number one.

I met my best friend in college and for the first time in my life, I experienced the kind of best friendship you only read about in books or see in movies. I was her number one. She was my number one. We were incredibly similar. We talked 24/7 and we got along so well. We rarely ever had arguments. We were incredibly real and deep and honest with each other. We were there for each other through so many good times and bad times. We were there for each other during traumas and bouts of depression and lows we never thought we could climb back out of. I loved her like she was my own sister, and I never imagined she would leave my life. We talked about our kids being best friends. We talked about still being best friends when we were old and gray.

We had been best friends for five years---five amazing years!---when she began to withdraw from me. She was going through an incredibly stressful time and I tried my hardest to be there for her. But I was going through the hardest year of my life, and our friendship became all about her: I was there for her, I was her therapist when she needed one, I had a special text tone for her so I would wake up at any hour of the night when she was hysterical and needed someone...but she didn't seem to care about my sinking life.

I tried several times to mend our friendship, and she didn't react well. She sent me a long message full of nasty things about me and we stopped talking. A few months after that, I found out the real reason she stopped talking to me: she'd found a guy and I think she was afraid I would tell him her darkest secrets (though I would rather have died than do that). She assumed the worst of me.

With this month, it has now officially been two years since we were best friends. We haven't spoken in two years. She got married last year and I wasn't invited, of course.

At first, it hurt a lot. Now weeks can go by without me thinking of her---but every now and then, something reminds me of her and I miss her so much and my heart breaks all over again. I hate her for abandoning me the way she did and nothing can ever make up for what she did. Even if we wanted to, we could never go back to the implicit trust we once had in each other. Even if 99% of me is over it...there will always be that small part of me that will never understand, never forget, and never get over the loss of our friendship."

In love with two people,"Throwaway. LTL. FTP. On mobile.

I'm in love with two people. One of them is my spouse. The other is one of my best friends. I have no idea what the f*** to do. 


"
I'm tired of it all. I just want don't want to be sober.,"I hate America and it's fucking useless puritan laws. I've got a month left till the twenty-first, but I cannot wait anymore. It's Saint Patrick's Day, where everyone I know will be shitfaced out of their minds because they can obtain things illegally. Yet I'm here, alone, as I've been for the past fucking year. Alcohol is pretty much the social lubricant for every situation, and almost every event, concert, or comedy show I've wanted to go to is 21+. I've been unbearably lonely for the past year or two and I can't deal with it anymore. I will not spend a single day of my life sober when I turn 21. The past 20 years have been a scam and I want out. I'm gonna spend the next five-or-so years in a completely drunken state. Not because it's cool or anything, I know it's not. I'm not *that* stupid. But because I just don't want to fucking feel anything anymore. I don't care if it kills me, I'm just tired of feeling things. The only time I've been happy in these years has been when I was drunk, so why not just let it happen?"
What is it with us human beings that we like to sabotage our own mental health and go stalk only to find things we know we wouldn’t have wanted to know?,"Like the “yep I was definitely better off 16 seconds ago when I didn’t see this shit”

Maaan i hate it."
I fucking love my girlfriend. I’m kinda drunk right now but I love her so much,"There really are not enough words to express it. She’s so sweet and kind and sincere. She cares so much about people she gets anxious enough to not eat and that’s awful but the fact that she cares that much about people is insane and incredibly endearing. She’s everything I ever wanted in someone and so much more than I ever thought I would get. I always thought I’d be compromising in big ways when I found someone I wanted to marry because so many girls are obsessed with the beach and I’m not a huge fan. Or they’re not into anything I like, really. Not the same movies, games, hobbies, or anything. I figured I’d just find someone I got along with enough to love and we’d go from there. But she and I have so much in common it’s mind blowing. I’m not compromising even a little. She’s my everything and I can’t wait for her to move in. I want to love her and take care of her and make her happy for the rest of eternity. She’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. And we have a healthy relationship. I don’t get upset when she hangs with her friends, we’re not clingy, but we love each other and that shows in every way possible. I got my apartment with her in mind. I bought a mattress she’d be comfortable with, because I’ve slept on the floor for the past year and been fine, but she’s a bit more picky lol. 

She makes my world go round. She’s my home. She’s my everything. I know I’m kinda rambling but I just had to say this to somewhere, I already tell her all the time but it almost felt like my chest my burst unless I told someone else. 

Also I really wanna go down on her. 

But like I said I love her to the moon and back, I love her so much it drives me crazy. I get to see her Tuesday and I can’t wait. I’ll make any sacrifice I need to in order to make her happy. She’s my world, and I can’t wait to marry her. October is it. Probably the 26th. It’ll be the best day of our lives. I can’t wait. 

Thank you so much for reading my drunk ramblings. You guys are great. "
My girlfriends depression is starting to irritate me and I dont know what to do,"My girlfriend and I have been together for 3 years. Shes had a pretty rough life before me. Her ex boyfriend's dad violated her, and her life and home sucks. Her dad treats her like garbage and she cant be around him without him bullying her. 

I've always been supportive of her. I'm always there to listen to her and be by her side when she needs me. Always there to hold her head up when she feels down and cheer her on. But as of late, I cant stand it anymore. Everyday shes feeling down and it's taking a toll on me. I love her to death but I cant take it anymore. Everyday its ""I'm sad, I dont feel good, I'm glum"". Whenever we go out to have a nice time, she'll randomly start to cry and I feel so helpless. 

I feel like I cant do anything about it and I feel like I'm in a pit. No matter what I do, what I try, she sucks out the life out me. I'm not happy anymore. I used to care, but it's become a chore now. I love her so much, but I've became sour. I've offered to take her to see a shrink, and she refuses. At this point I just dont know what to do or where to turn. 

I dont want to be a dick. I hate that I feel this way. But how am I supposed to feel."
It was a fucking shooting! Not a fucking joke!,"Why the hell do people look at a mass shooting and be like “hey I can make a meme out of this!” People fucking DIED! It’s not a joke, it’s a serious situation that shouldn’t be laughed at! I feel like memes have normalised rape, shootings,  suicide and abuse because there are so many jokes about it. It’s not funny, It’s fucked up! And as soon as someone says “hey that’s not cool” they are just brushed off and told that they are easily offended. No. That’s not right. I have seriously lost faith in humanity if they are finding the death and suffering of innocent people hilarious."
I keep a noose underneath my bed.,"I apologize in advance for the long rant and pity party. There's no one I am comfortable with confiding in and figured that typing out my thoughts would be therapeutic. 


For the majority of my life from high school onward, I've struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts to the point of fantasizing about killing myself or simply dying pretty regularly. These feelings can fluctuate in and out, but for the past two years they've been like a thick blanket suffocating my mind and paralyzing me from making any personal progress. It's almost exciting imagining myself being hit by a car or struck by lighting; really any freak accident would do. That way, I get to die without putting in the legwork. However, I've never tried to kill myself yet. Maybe my depression has never been bad enough to do it. Maybe I'm just a coward. Either way, it's never reached the point of me picking up a gun and seriously putting myself on that line. But I often wish I would. 


Every day is the same. I wake up, go to work, come home, play video games, cook dinner, and browse Reddit and YouTube. Rinse and repeat, even on the weekends minus work. Presently, I'm sitting on my couch, looking out the window and thinking of what normal guys would be doing on a Saturday night. Hitting the bars, just hanging around as a group, maybe even out on a date with a cute girl. It makes me feel utterly pathetic that I haven't been out with a friend in over a year or had any romantic prospects. Hell, I don't even have any friends that live within a 1,000 radius, and even that group is only communicated with through Xbox. I feel myself drifting away from them as well. But that's no one's fault but my own. Most days, I feel that this is all my fault. The anxiety, the isolation, the non-existent self-esteem, the lack of motivation, the painful emptiness, it all comes back on me, and that may be the worst part. Why can't I just put myself out there or be comfortable in my own skin?


A few months ago, I bought a rope and taught myself how to tie a noose. That noose has sat underneath my bed ever since, and to be honest, it's really comforting knowing that there is an escape within reach. If having no friends, being a virgin, being indifferent to a career I really just stumbled into blindly ever drags me down to far, I can simply throw myself into the void and leave it all behind. The thought of the last gasps of air sputtering from my mouth as i hang from my neck should be terrifying, but I find it interesting to think about, especially when the depression is worse. 


I have been better recently. After hating both my first job out of college and the area I lived in, I've since relocated across the country and taken a position that, while greater in responsibility, is slightly less stressful. My social skills are at an all-time high, but that's not saying much. I've been better about food and exercise, and am practicing my instrument again. For the first time in a while, I have hope. But the thoughts still linger. While I'm not completely unattractive or in terrible shape, I often see my reflection and recoil, even when at an age where I should be in peak form. Still no friends, still little hobbies, still romanticizing the idea of having a girlfriend rather than focusing on myself. Sometimes I almost see the walls closing in on me. It's hard not to stare down the tunnel of my life and see fifty or sixty more years of the same thing, day in and day out, and not rush to grab that noose from underneath my bed. But it hasn't happened yet, so in the meantime, I will improve upon myself as I can, and will hopefully not fizzle out like the last few times I've been down this road.


Maybe one day I'll revisit this post and laugh at how stupid I was being. Or maybe I'll see it and scream because nothing has changed. I just with I knew either way instead of constantly bouncing back and forth between the two like a pinball. But this was helpful to write down, so thank to those of you that made it through my whining :)"
"In other news, im finally collaborating with a company that i adore!!! Yay!!","I’m collaborating with a charm company i collect from and I’ve been wanting to do that for years!! Im so excited to be part of their community and share the same vibes as them! They’re called ‘OHM beads’ for people who are interested!

In another story i posted on here I mentioned i was diagnosed with panic disorder, that is accompanied with anxiety and overthinking. I’ve tried so many things to prevent myself for getting anxious or overthinking but the only thing that ever worked for me is collecting things. This habit just kept my life together and helped me feel at peace. Collecting these charms started as a fun activity but it slowly became a form of therapy for me, this company helped me out a lot and I’m so excited to collab with them ahhh."
Life Story ~2.7k words,"I'm 23/M Australian. Growing up was good. I was shy kid, but enjoyed sport and school. I come from a large family, 2 older brothers and 2 younger brothers. I can still remember the day my younger brother got diagnosed with autism. I was just starting primary school, he was about 18 months old. In hindsight I also remember going to out baby sitter and her commenting that my little bro was slow to start walking, that he would just crawl everywhere. When Mum and Dad told us he had autism, and that he might not be 'normal' I remember vowing that there would be no way he wouldn't be able to have a normal life, not that I knew what autism was. At that stage he wasn't all that different from most babies.

Over the next few years he never learnt how to talk or socialise, or learnt 'appropriate' behaviour. If he needed to take a wee he would just pull his pants down and do it wherever. If we were at church he would just start yelling or crying randomly, and at school I was ""the kid with the ret***ed brother"", and it didn't help that I was shy. I was told that I was a quiet kid, and that maybe I was on the spectrum too. After all, it is genetic. It didn't help that I was good academically. I enjoyed maths and was criticised for that, after all, some autistic people are maths whizzes, maybe I'm on the spectrum? I was absent minded and forgetful, and was socially awkward, maybe I'm on the spectrum? This obviously didn't help me be any less shy. I also enjoyed reading, perhaps because it was something solitary, and even besides my younger autistic brother, I had two older brothers and another youngest one. My parents just didn't have enough time, and I just tried to keep my head down and not stress them out, and tried to make them proud.

When I was 11 one of my best friends, who's parents were divorced, got me into Aussie Rules Football. Being shy and short sighted(not that I discovered I was short sighted until I was 15), I'd never really enjoyed watching or playing it when I was younger, and as it was a team sport, and me being shy, I never called for the ball, and they might not pass it even if I did. 

However, I was very athletic. I would win the 100m, 200m, 800m, Long Jump, High Jump, Cross Country, etc. Even if they didn't pass me the ball, I could get it. And eventually I enjoyed playing it, and my Dad used to play it professionally, and I started having kicks with him when I came back from school, and started working with him on the farm. In hindsight this was one of the best things to happen in my life, as I began to spend more time with my Dad, who was always busy working 70+ hour weeks and splitting his time between 5 children. In grade 6 I made the school team (with 22 players a side and only about 25 boys a year, it wasn't too competitive), and I made more friends and gained some confidence. Because I was still somewhat of an easy target I was still bullied, two instances I remember was the biggest kid in the grade, who was a year older, threatening to break my leg and trying to trip repeatedly whilst ignoring the ball, and the boy School Captain, who was also the Principal's son, lets call him Golden Boy, tackling me to the ground and kicking me, also when I had my back turned. I did cry for the first time in a while when I got home from school that day, but it wasn't that bad, especially seeing most people weren't terrible and I was making friends at this stage, so most people thought he was a dick, and also it spurred me on to be better, especially seeing I had a crush on the girl School Captain, and I was worried Golden Boy had a crush on her too.

High School (2008) was good. I had joined the u14s as an under-ager, and one of my peers asked me whether I was only playing football because my dad, a former pro player, asked me to. I replied that he had never encouraged me one way or the other, I just liked playing. To proove I was doing it because I wanted to, I started training hard, doing 100 pushups and situps and running 2km every morning before school, and made the regional rep side that year, but only because a class mate broke his hand. I dominated athletics, and at school maths and science, getting 1st place in my year out of the 110 students, and by this stage Golden Boy was falling off, and I am no longer a target for bullying, and am confident enough to stand up for myself.

Year 8 rolls around, once again dominate athletics and academics, win the club Best and Fairest in u14. I am still shy at heart, as my younger brother is now 10 but still does the behaviour he was doing at 4, and I'm going from thinking I will be a scientist and figure out how to cure autism, but also realising I will be too late and so instead thinking I will earn money so my parents don't go bankrupt supporting him, as the farm isn't doing well.

I manage to earn a scholarship to boarding school, and I make new friendships, and the ""home-life"" there is a lot less stressful. Year 9 is a learning experience, I go from being the best at everything to being the best at nothing, I can't even make the athletics team, am only slightly above average at football, and am not even in the top class for maths, but by the end of the year I manage to change that. Year 10 starts, and I manage to make the state football team, get in the top 0.1% for maths and science in the country, don't drop a mark in the year 10 mid year maths exam, and feel like I am killing it in life. Even though I live in another state I am talking regularly to my crush through Facebook (this is 2011), and while some of my behaviour is cringeworthy in hindsight (""I did an online IQ test and got 150"", ""Oh did I mention I made the state football team?""), we keep in contact.

When I'd just turned 16, I went a prescription acne drug called Roaccutane, for about 6 weeks, then I stopped because I was getting some back and hip pain . As someone who played sport, and at the time was doing Athletics pretty seriously, I decided to stop for a few weeks for a big meet. The pains didn't go away, but I made a few PBs, jumping 20ft LJ, 43ft TJ, 6'1 HJ, 11.7s 100m, was pretty happy. Then I noticed I couldn't get erections. That stressed me out, because I was a virgin but starting to really think about sex, but now that part of my body and brain was just numb. I started to worry about ever having a gf/children/family, those milestones I just assumed would happen one day no longer seemed possible. Instead of getting hard at a thought, I could have porn (something I'd never needed and barely used) right in front of me and be touching myself and nothing would happen. 

At the same time one of my best friends and I got into a stupid argument about me forgetting to close the door after me (we shared rooms at boarding school in grade 10), and he stopped talking to me except to swear at me and call me names. Keep in mind we lived in the same room. One of the side effects of Roaccutane is that you can get depression and anxiety, although they insist it will go away as soon as you discontinue treatment. Mine stayed. I would stay up half the night wondering how I can repair my friendship with my roommate, and I did apologise and beg for forgiveness, but in hindsight he never considered me a friend and wish I had given up earlier. I lost interest in my subjects, and my grades went from top 5/200 to about 50th, and I guess I floated through the next few years. I would try to make myself do something, but I just couldn't do it. Before if I promised something to myself it would 100% happen, but now I couldn't seem to do the simplest things. I stopped talking to my crush, and no longer felt like I deserved her, and I got tendonitis in my shoulders and knees, and then did my ACL and needed a knee reco, so sport fell off too. It was a good school, so I got into a good uni in a competitive course, but by this stage I was pretty broken. Predictably, I didn't go to lectures or tutorials, and so my GPA is shit, and I failed a few courses. ED never got better, still can't get erections, so any relationships only ever lasted until the first/second/third night together, they can only be disappointed so many times. I got heavily into gaming, I've played 4k hours of Dota and 1.2k hours of CS:GO since Feb 2014. It was a nice escape, the only place I felt I made any sort of achievement.

After two underwhelming years of Uni I decided to take a year off. “If I'm not actually going to lectures or tutorials why get myself into debt?” I decided, as I didn't even know any of my Lecturers faces in 2015. I had gotten back into sport in 2015 and reached a pretty high standard, and being 20 years old thought I might have one last crack.

In 2016 I went to a different city, got a part time job which payed my living expenses and rent, and played semi-pro sport. I tore my meniscus in my knee round 1 and missed 5 weeks, then did my hamstring and missed another 4. I don't regret that year, first time I had to pay rent and earn a living, learnt what it was like to work 8-10 hour days, but the sport itself, the main reason I took the year off, was disappointing. Ended up getting insomnia and couldn't get more than 4 hours sleep the night before the game, was messed in the head. Would go to bed at 10pm and wake up around 2am with my heart racing, dreaming I'd missed the game and everyone hated me, and I couldn't get more sleep after that. Played shit, felt shit, but at least with the new found discipline from working at least when I go back to Uni I'll be sure to actually study, or so I thought.

I went back to Uni, and somehow fell back into old habits within a few weeks. Excessive gaming, not going to Uni, etc. I tried dating a few more times, met a few more amazing girls who liked me, but same old same old downstairs. Perhaps if I had more confidence and liked myself more at the time I could have done something, but at this stage I hated how I had wasted my life, and hated how I was still unable to make any progress with it, and I didn't really want to inflict myself upon any girl that I actually cared about and who cared about me, but sometimes I couldn't help myself, and would hope I would “work” this time. With Uni and sport sometimes I had a few good weeks or months, I would stop spending so much time gaming or quit entirely, and catch up with friends and go to uni more, but when I broke my hand which required surgery, I barely left my room for a month afterwards, then 6 months later I developed Osteomyelitis pubis which kept me bedridden for weeks and out of sport for 16 months (end of 2017 and all of 2018).

At the start of last year I went to a psychologist, as I finally realised that I wasn't all that happy with the way I was living my life, or that happy in general, and over the course of last year, meeting every week, I healed. I reignited old friendships, made new friends, but STILL couldn't avoid failing at Uni, I just couldn't make myself go to class. Despite being so much happier, catching up with friends, kicking my gaming addiction, healing my relationship with sport (as I was relying on it to validate my self-worth, which is why I would wake up having panic attacks 2am the morning of games), I still couldn't make myself actually study. I would be at the Library, at Uni, and I would procrastinate. On a Saturday I might spend 14 hours at the library, and do 2 hours of study. I just couldn't study, I always got distracted. The curse of the internet is that there is always something interesting or entertaining, and I couldn't escape it.

Until I got diagnosed with ADHD. For me, it was like the missing key. Since Jan this year now I can tidy my room. Now I can organise catch-ups with friends. Now I can set up my calander, and follow it up. Now I can go through my tutorial the day before. Now I can actually go to the library and study for a few hours. Now I can be in the lecture and not waste my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, or on some webnovel. Between organisational strategies and meds, this semester I haven't missed a lecture or a tutorial, which feels fucking amazing. I don't take meds everyday, but I don't need to. Learning how to actually be organised, and when on meds planning around me not being on meds, is enough. Still have ED though, but I've accepted that. 

Plenty of people have low-libido, maybe it will change at some point, who knows. Mentally and physically I'm healthier now than I've ever been, maybe if I keep it up I'll heal, but for now I am kinda happy with where I am at and the direction I'm heading. I have goals again. For a long time I thought I didn't deserve goals, because I lacked the ability to commit to anything. I might have a good week here and there, but could never string anything together. While now, I finally feel ready to have a crack at life again. I've got plenty of great, platonic relationships, I learnt how to forgive myself last year but this year I am don't have to do it every day anymore, and can even be a little proud of myself at times. I'm 24, but have more optimism than I've had since I was 16.

For most of my life I wasn't pushing myself for my own sake, I was doing it for Mum and Dad, or for my little bro, or, for most of the last 6 years, so I could feel like I was good at something as I always relied heavily on external validation for my self-esteem, but I am finally doing things for myself.

My main goals at the moment are to finish the uni degree I am doing at the moment. I am actually enjoying it, and hoping to show some of my potential that I have hidden very extemely super well for the last 5 years; and start a regular mediation habit, as it was one of the things that really got me back on track when I strung even just a week or two together, helps me like myself and be kind to past, present and future me, and also more understanding of others as well. Perhaps it will even heal that part of my brain that deal with attraction, but I'm not counting on it, the other reasons are enough.

If you read all this love you, without reddit I likely would never have sought help for my mental illness or for my ADHD, and I would probably still be struggling in a cycle of self-loathing and disappointment, so honestly from the bottom of my heart, thank you!

Edit: Thanks everyone for your support, y'all da BEST! One of the best things my psychologist ever told me was,
""If your best friend was going through what you are going through, how would you treat them? What would you tell them? How would you want them to treat themselves?"" Once I started thinking in that frame of mind I could finally start taking steps in learning self-love and compassion, and start making positive changes in my life.

If you need help, try to love yourself a little and go get help, because sometimes the hardest thing to do is treat yourself as well as you treat everybody else."
We finally broke up.," I was in an 8 month relationship with someone that i loved dearly. However, since about three months ago, it was obvious that things were dying down. I saw that she was losing interest but for some reason i still held on. For three long months i became depressed because i knew i was losing her but i didnt want to let go. She constantly questioned my trust with her. She did a lot of suspicious things and hung out with other guys without telling me. I felt empty and lonely. My friends could tell too. But today, i ended it. i feel free. it wasn't healthy for me to be with her any longer. We are two seperate people and we both have our separate paths.

I don't hate her. I wish her all the best.

But i feel so much better not being with you.

Thanks for everything."
Today I was on campus when my university declared an active shooter emergency and I cannot fucking unwind.,"I'll preface this by saying that it turned out to be a false alarm and everyone is fine, but the fear until we got the all-clear after an hour or two was very much real.


I honestly wasn't even all that close -- I was at the gym, maybe half a mile from the building -- but the atmosphere in the building was so tense.  I listened to some police scanners and decided to go home, but once I stepped outside I couldn't stop thinking of the video of the NZ shooter where he drives away from the scene of his attack and repeatedly stops to shoot at people through his windows.  I walked maybe half a block then headed back.

When we first heard it was like slow motion.  A guy got a call from his girlfriend (who was in the building where it started) and told me, then ran off to tell other people.  A few minutes later the school sent out the official alert and all it said (less the standard template wording) was: 

'Active shooter in Mason Hall.  Run, hide, fight.'  

It was so fucking eerie just seeing those words, like they had to get it out in a hurry and made the message as short as possible.  We weren't close enough to require immediate evacuation but some people ran home right away.  Most people just kept working out and asking each other what they should do.

In the end, I sat myself down and started listening to a police scanner so I could keep up to speed.  I was sitting in a chair next to the staircase from the only entrance so I just kept fidgeting and watching the stairs, not expecting anything but half fearing -- just in a little piece of my mind -- that someone would run down them with a gun in hand and kill me just like that.



What's especially odd is how little fear there was in the moment.  I was scared for sure, but the prevalent emotions in the building were confusion and tension more than anything; as a matter of fact, it seems like people were more familiar in that everyone was sharing what they knew and what they were going to do.  A few people asked the staff if we could lock down the building and discussed what we could use as weapons if we had to.

As I sat and listened I got in touch with friends (to figure out what was happening) and family (because I wanted them to know I was okay if they heard about it via the news).  I really freaked my mom out and feel terrible for doing it, but it's not like I was going to send nothing.

Whatever the case, it's all over now and I'm back home.  The fear really never got too bad but jesus Christ I'm just so tense.  There was never any danger and I've had a wonderful night but I just can't shake how horribly uneasy I feel.  I honestly don't know if I'll ever feel as secure on campus as I did before, or whether I'll ever be able to sit in a classroom again without thinking of how I can get out quickly.  It's weird, what a false alarm does to you.  "
I think I miss my ex who really hurt me.,"Broke up about a year ago, I felt really shitty last summer and completely cut off all contact with her. We used to be such great friends. I ruined it by going out with her because I was/am a lonely highschool student trying to feel love. When we broke up she kept telling me she never loved me, never wanted to date me, dated me out of pity, all that. But we were friends once. And I miss it. I dont have alot of friends, maybe 2-3. So she was a big help in my self esteem. So I was fucked last summer, with me also having a really bad job, medical issues that still arent fixed, and just being a damned hermit. My friends still hate her for breaking up with me like that, so I dont know where else I can say this. I'm just really lonely all the time. And I miss my friend."
i want to kill myself,every day gets worse and i am too overwhelmed to go on. I've been contemplating and daydreaming of my suicide for years and i feel that i might do it soon idk what to do anymore
I really need to say this,"Beware NSFW.


I Don’t self harm or tried to commit suicide. I need to tell my parents that I can’t be around technology anymore I’m 20 and suffered since I was 12. I’m really depressed and have right now. I’m honestly desperate and fear telling my dad of my porn addiction. He’s okay to talk to but I need a break from technology if I work with tech I will maybe end it honestly or become homeless.

I can’t use the internet or phone or tv or social media anymore it’s too much it causes really bad depression. I have gone overboard lately and still struggle with porn addiction or any triggering thoughts. I am seeing a counseller but I haven’t brought it up like this before it’s really bad I want to go blind I don’t want to use this technology anymore I’m sorry but I want to but can’t go blind. It really messes up my dopamine I hate my life."
I fucked up and idk what to do,"Background: I’m a 20 something nursing student married with kids and working full time. I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression a year ago after failing a nursing semester and was put on medication and did some therapy. I’ve been out of therapy for a while and changed my meds to Lexapro. 

I’ve been drinking almost every day since the semester started and my wife doesn’t know. I feel like I can’t cope with the pressure of school and  I failed my last test. Today, I went to my in laws by myself to work on my wife’s car and was drinking before and during that time. I came home absolutely hammered and my wife obviously noticed. I was pretty much blackout and don’t remember much besides bits and pieces of her telling me to sleep it off and thinking it was my meds. I got up to go to work several hours later and somehow talked my way out of her thinking I was drunk and that it had something to do with my meds. I feel like absolute shit and I don’t know what to do. I obviously need to see a psychiatrist and get back into therapy but I don’t know why I drink when the pressure is on. I can stop when I’m not in school easily. I haven’t been taking care of myself and I’m worried I’m going to end up killing myself somehow unintentionally. I’m scared and I feel trapped. If someone knows what to do, please let me know. I’m obviously a slow learner so please walk me through it lol. "
"Does having a thing with someone new mean they’re entirely over you, if up until a couple of weeks ago they told you they loved you more than anyone in the world?","My ex-girlfriend and I of two years (who is also my best friend in the entire world), broke up with me in August of 2018. It hurt a lot, but despite that, I had made a lot of growth on my own. 

She befriended this guy in October, but they’re no longer friends. During that period of time up until the new year, we didn’t talk. I decided it be best I distance myself from her if she was going to have a relationship, especially so soon. My heart just couldn’t handle it. I remember, before I decided to leave; that if she ever got into a relationship to tell me, so I could keep a distance because my heart would probably not be able to handle it. Well it turns out that the guy she was friends with was just her friend, she said she had tried to like him, but couldn’t, and was over that right away but wanted to continue her friendship with him. She told me she was still in love with me and wouldn’t get into a relationship with him even if she wanted to. 

After our long course of not talking, we were so happy to finally be close and it felt like things were falling into place. We weren’t dating or anything like that, we were just happy to be back together and smiling. Her mom, and sister both called me to tell me they were happy to see me around again. It was great, after your ex girlfriend (who you still love deeply) tells you she’s not interested in the guy you really thought had won her heart, and that she’s still in love with you. You kind of feel like there’s not much to worry about. It elevated me and made me feel like I didn’t even have to worry about the fact that we weren’t together anymore, because our friendship alone is the true foundation to everything. 

It was like maybe a month before things took a turn. This other guy who had liked who around the same time we started dating resurfaced, and it was honestly the worst. 

I can’t stand this guy because after she had cut him off, he was an uttermost dick to her over not liking him back. She cried in my arms about how mean he was and how she didn’t wanna go back into the same room as him.

Fast forward two years, and here he is firing up a conversation with me. Only to face his attention towards her and flirt with her the whole time. When I asked her about it she told me she did think it was weird the way he talked, but didn’t think he felt any kind of way for her. After losing my best friend to some guy the first time, I couldn’t really handle much of my emotions and ended up asking her if this was going to happen again, if she was going to abandon me again. That’s when she told me, she had me calm down and she said “you know I love you more than anyone in this entire world”.

I didn’t ask her much about him after a while, because I figured she wasn’t really making much of an effort to talk to him. It turns out, however, that they went out. That time is the only time I officially know, but she says that it wasn’t a date. I guess we kinda got over it and kept our friendship going because she said she wasn’t dating him and got upset with me whenever I asked if she was. 

It wasn’t until a couple of days ago that my friend texted me telling me he saw the guys phone, and he had my ex-girlfriends name saved with a heart next to it. Which sounds kind of childish of anyone to notice, but come on who doesn’t use emojis. Anyways, that made me sad, but it still couldn’t prove that they were anything at all. Until a friend of hers told me that they had a thing. She told me that my ex had told her she didn’t want to get attached to him because he’d be leaving the first of June. 

I was heartbroken, I still am heartbroken. I know it’s not much to say because I was very vague in sake of keeping this post short, because believe me if I could write a book on this, I would. I was heartbroken because during the time we were friends, we both knew we had feelings for each other and we just couldn’t act on them because she said that even though she wants to be with me more than anyone else in the world, it will come naturally if it is meant to be. 

How come if these past couple of weeks she’s had a thing with him. But these past couple of days she’s been holding my hand, caressing my face, telling me she loves me. Not even just that, but we’ve been running errands together, I went to her mothers birthday party full of her family members and we spent the whole day together. Before anyone got there, we walked the dog, and then went out to grab some food. There’s nothing better than driving while the person you’re madly in love with is sitting in your passenger seat. But it’s not even infatuation, it’s not lust, I genuinely feel that when we are together running errands, grabbing food, picking up pizzas for the family party, running to the grocery store to buy coffee. I feel like I could do this with her, for the rest of my life. I feel like there is absolutely no one in the world who I would rather grow old with. I feel like I don’t ever wanna hold the hand of another because no one’s would ever compare to the softness and comfort of hers. I know I can’t speak for her, but someone out there has to hear me when I say that I am almost positive the feeling is mutual. I can see it in her eyes, I can feel it in her touch, I can hear it in her voice when she tells me she loves me. 

Why is she with him? Is it because she wants to get over me? Does she not love me anymore after only a couple of months of spending more time with him? Is she scared of what is to come if we actually give our relationship another go and we don’t end up being meant to be? Is she in love with him already? Why him? Should I move on? Should I tell her how I feel?

We currently aren’t talking because it was too much for me to handle. The thought of her possibly kissing someone else, doing things with someone else, loving someone else. It all brings me to my knees. I cried all day yesterday after I told her I couldn’t talk to her anymore, and I’ve been crying anytime I think about it. I wake up, aching, as though I’ve been cheated on, but we aren’t together. So that is clearly not the case. Is it the end for us? 

If you read this far, thank you so much, I could really use a friend and some advice. I feel so alone. Much love to everyone. "
I got stood up today,I hate dating...in fact I loathe every aspect of it I always have. So I even surprised myself when I  said yes to a date of a friend of a friend. Polite and cute we hit it off as soon as we met and have been texting back and fourth for weeks. He set up a date for this evening and I have been waiting all week. I was soo excited and was ready about 45 minutes before he was supposed to pick me up....then I waited for about 2 hours after our picked time...later I get a text from the friend who introduced us that he had gone out with them. He asked me. Why get my hopes up to only pull this bullshit?
I really need to say this and i have no friends who would like hearing it :),"Me and my boyfriend struggle with seeing each other face to face because of our extremely busy schedules but we spend every night we can on the phone, and we always fall asleep together.
So here i am, around 11:30 and hes fast asleep. He keeps snoring and making little noises and it makes me realize that im absolutely 100% head over heels for this man :( 
I love hearing him peacefully enjoying a nights rest.. it makes me feel at ease with myself.
Some nights he plays video games with his friends while i do homework or draw, and hearing him laugh so happily is exactly what i need in my life. 

Okay soz 
  I just really love him <3"
took a break to find myself and now i’m even more lost,"I feel like my mind is stuck in a loop. Over the past few weeks i’ve been constantly conflicted with my feelings(?) of how things ended in my past relationship with my ex and how it’s affecting me now. I ended things last October after being with him for over a year.

it wasn’t sudden, but the motivation to break up gradually hit me from what seems like out of nowhere.
I think it all started when I stopped seeing a future with him. I started obsessing over things that I didn’t think i’d be able to live with in the long-run. Little things he did or didn’t do started getting to me. I was also paranoid that I might’ve been too focused on being compatible and felt like I was losing focus on bettering myself as an individual. This sounds like the typical “i need to love myself before i can love you” deal, and to some extent it was. But toward the end of our relationship things just didn’t feel right. The things we used to do felt forced/unnatural (at least on my end,) and we started drifting. I’ll admit that I was drifting more than he + I was also the one to initiate the break.

I love hard, and god did i love that boy more than anything at the time. Up until then, our relationship had been one of the healthiest. Our communication was effective and solid, the love and support was always there,, I was wholeheartedly in love with everything that he was. We had it really good for a while. I can’t pin-point the exact moment when things took a turn. I just remember starting to feel wrong about a lot. It got to the point where I was resisting breaking it off for the sole purpose of sparing his feelings. When I did, though, i remember it all hitting me a lot harder than i expected and the first week afterward was absolute hell. I’d never been more of a wreck. 

From then on, i’ve been numb to it and I hadn’t really felt heartbreak-ish in a while.

I know it’s only natural for me to reflect on what our relationship could’ve been, but i also know for a fact that I miss the memories more than I miss him. There’s no way I could get back together with him, but it’s hard missing the feelings and separating them from the person i shared them with.

I keep feeling like i’m doing something wrong. I’m paranoid that everything i’ve done since then has been a step back.

Is this mourning the relationship? Is it regret? Whatever it is, I want it to stop. 

Right now I can’t see myself in a relationship with anyone anymore and I think that alone is damaging me. I feel unlovable

"I feel like I traded my dog for our cat, and it's tearing me apart","Recently my dog had to be put down. She was ill, and for a few days before everything got worse, she was staying at a clinic. During that time, our eldest cat (Butterscotch, 17 years old in May) suddenly stopped eating. Everyone started to get uneasy, but we didn't have the time or the money to take him to the vet, too. I was already stressed because of my dog being ill, I couldn't stand Butter not eating. So, on the night of the second day, I forced him to. I took a little fork and a can of cat food and pried his mouth open and stuck it in. I did it again in the morning, and again the next night. ""He's not allowed to die on us,"" I kept saying. Finally, he began to eat on his own again. It's been over a month, and he's back to his usual self. We're still not sure what the problem was. Maybe he was eating kittens' food? But on the day that he got better, my dog started to get worse.

Now she's dead, and I wonder if this was some kind of test from the universe. Maybe one of them was supposed to die, and the universe asked me to pick who lived, and I picked Butter. I know, I know, its illogical and stupid, but I keep thinking about it anyway. We've had Butter since I was like four. He's as much a part of the family as any person could be. He's been with us practically my whole life, and I can't imagine the house without him launching himself onto the back of the sofa to yell at us as soon as we come in the door. I love Butter, even if he is a pissy old man.

But I loved my dog. She was like my soulmate. And she died so young. I don't know how I'm going to survive without her.

But if I went back in time and could make that choice again and affect the outcome, I don't know what I would do, if I could even pick knowing the other would be gone forever. But I miss my dog so, so much. All that I want is to see her again.

I'm sorry for rambling, but I feel like I'm suffocating in my own existence."
Why do I feel guilty for doing nothing?,"I’ve done nothing wrong and I’m not in a stagnant state of place, but I feel so guilty for doing absolutely nothing.  I feel sad and I’m very depressed. Thank you for reading this :/"
"Got this weird new habbit ,and it’s fucking trees!","omg so yesterday. I decided to whip out my new drill. I got a big drill bit and my climbing booties. I grabbed some KY and a big new 3.5 inch drill bit. I climbed my ponderosa pine. I live on a big property over 400 acres of wildlife and wilderness. It was a sunny day. I forgot sunscreen. Yet my drill worked perfect. I climbed about 50 feet based on the rope not being long enough. I drilled a hole way high. I lubed my 3.5 inch girth hole perfect for me weiner to slide into. Then I watched porn while I fucked the tree hole. It was all filled up so I pissed into the hole. I also took a shit mid stride. It ran down my leg and got my climbing booties all poopy. I then smeared my poopoo all over the tree and marked my territory. I love fucking trees. You should try it. Watch out for tree sap. I think I got some in my pubes. I need to get condoms or I will get more splinters. I just got done removing a sappy tree splinter from my weiner hole. I love fucking trees. Hence the username. My credit score is in the 1000 range now that I purchased my tree fucking tools on my new credit card. I have a picture of my first hole on the card. They probably think it’s a bird hole from a wood pecker but nope, it’s a hole for my pecker haha"
I’m not as good of a person as I thought I was.,"I have always been there when people needed me. Listened and tried to help them with their problems. I’ve found out that I avoid my friends when I’m hurting. They want me to go out and I make excuses not to go. I don’t want to burden them with my issues. I feel my sadness and I keep it in. I never thought that made me a bad person. Then I go back through my messages and realize, I have blown off all of my friends. I lost my mom in February. I’m so angry that she’s gone. I don’t know how to express it. As I realize I’ve definitely made bad choices canceling on my friends. I have also been very hard on myself. Not letting myself feel my pain, not letting myself see the bull I’m pulling on my friends. Never again. I’m going to make plans and keep them. Even if I have to let my pain and anger come out. I know they will be there for me as I have them in the past. "
Im not sure what to do or say here,"About a week ago I met a girl, and we seemed to connect fast. She was really up front about her baggage and I was really happy about it actually. She has some pretty major mental issues, due to the fact that her mother believes things like that are a sin. So she never has gotten proper help for, well a lot of things. Tonight however things turned down a path I never thought I would have to deal with.

&#x200B;

She texts me, and opens up by saying that shes scared. I ask why and she says she doesnt know, but she's just scared. I figure its one of her panic attacks and tell her to try and focus on filling up her lungs. She then says that shes hallucinating and its seriously freaking her out. At this point I start to get worried. She says the floor in her room is gone, and that the walls are screaming at her. I try and tell her to stay on the line with me, and that it'll hopefully pass soon. She says she cant take it and that she is gonna resort to self harm to snap out of it. I tell her to not take things that far, and to not do too much. But about 5 minutes later she says that there's blood everywhere. I try and tell her to cover up the wounds and put pressure on them, but she says there's no point seeing as no one would care. I say that I do. She then starts to act super weird. She says the lights in her room are pretty and sends a bunch of laughing emojis. I keep telling her to cover up her wounds, but she just keeps texting incoherent non sense. I was so scared, so scared. I'm a pretty mentally solid dude, however I was on the verge of tears. I couldn't live with myself if someone killed themselves while I was talking to them. 

&#x200B;

I seriously just don't know what to do. I was so close to calling the cops on her. I told her from the start that I could handle just about any of the problems she threw at me, but this. This is too much isn't it? I really wanna cut ties with her, but what if she gets worse after that? I said I would be there for her, but what now? I'm not even sure how to text her in the morning. My instinct tells me to cut ties with her. But my mind says that I'm a terrible person for doing this. I couldn't sleep and decided to post this here. I just don't know what to do, and I'm scared."
I saved 3 people from suicide,"This is something I've wanted to tell/talk about for a long time but I've been scared of it coming off as braggy and I don't want it taken that way but I do still want to share the stories.

Sorry for the lack of format and any grammatical errors, on mobile

1: the first one is about my current best friend. We knew eachother coming out of highschool but weren't close much at all. I lost all my friends after highschool and had been fairly depressed and lonely for several months and this guy hit me up to go get drinks one night. Met up grabbed a 12 pack between us and found a park bench (late at night) and we just talked for hours. Started hanging out more often from it being ever couple weeks to every week to practically every night. We just drank and talked, Wandering around neighborhoods. I learned that he too lost a lot of friends after highschool because the girl he loved broke up with him and started spreading rumors that he raped her. They had a lot of mutual friends so it didn't go well for him. I should mention that he's bipolar depressive and has had a history of self harm, attempted suicide and drug abuse. After being close friends for over half a year we developed our own friend group that got together where I introduced him to his new girlfriend (as of now they have been together 1 & 1/2 years) one night at a party that was dying down he was pretty messed up while I was DD and he started crying. Said that when we started hanging out he was on the verge of attempting again and if I hadn't been there for him, giving him something to look forward too, giving him a safe place to talk ( not the greatest family situation either) he doesn't think he'd be where he is now. I don't think he remembered anything from that night but I'll never forget it. 

2: the next person I want to share about is a girl I met in a completely random video game lobby (CS:GO for those interested) you late at night when I decided to just play on more game before bed. She seemed cool so we joined up for more games. Learned the she was a small streamer on twitch and we hit it off pretty much instantly. Right away we were talking everyday over discord morning and night about our days, what's going on in our lives and became really close friends for a long time. She's someone who also had been dealing with the end of a long term relationship aswell as having a whole slew of diagnosed disorders from anxiety to PTSD and more but she never once showed weakness in the face of adversity. At least not to me. The One thing she hid from me was that outside of her online life how much she was struggling with from relationships to university. Even though she who is so incredibly talented and wonderful as a person veiwed herself so poorly like her existence was inconsequential. About a year after knowing her having seen her turn her life and viewpoint around into a bit more of a positive outlook. Now she's in a happy relationship with her new girlfriend that she introduced me to her as ""the guy that saved her"" which kinda blew me away. I never thought of anything i did really impacted her that much u til she told me that she like my other friend above; was ready to just give up and end things. She thought it be the best for everyone if she just disappeared. But she started looking forward to gaming and streaming with me and talking all the time. I gave her a reason to keep trying and moving forward and she said that if it wasn't for me she would have ended thing awhile back. She helped me through tough times aswell and always pushed me forward with everything I wanted in life. And not to mention man oh man if she was SUPER lesbian I would have fallen for her 100%

3: last but not least was a super cute younger girl about 16-17 that I got to know at work. The definate popular girl type that had a minor crush on. We were ""break buddies"" (ouch right 😂) so as we talked more at work on breaks and got closer I decided to ask her out and got rejected but we still started going out for brunch every so often. She was in a relationship with her highschool ""sweetheart"" who was not a fan of me spending time with her. He had a history of being controlling and as I found out much later on even slightly abusive. But it ended causing big fights between them. Obviously there were other issues than me spending time with her that came up. They broke up. Her being young and fairly popular in school being as well as a well known couple created all sorts of feuds with friends and rumors. All that highschool BS that I don't miss. But it affected her fairly sevearly and was down for a long time. Then came a couple guy friends of her ex. Invited her over for drinks to hangout. I was with friends when I get her call. She was drunk running home, no shoes, crying on the phone asking for help. I dove to my car to pick her up and she was in bad shape. Now she never told me specifics and she never wanted to talk about the night afterwards but from the bit that she told me the called called her over and a couple guys got real handsy saying they need from her ex that she was an ""easy"" (and other derogatory words that this sub won't let me post with) and wanted action. I don't think that anything criminal charge worthy happened and thankfully she ran out before it happened from what I gather she should be glad she got out of there before it got worse. She came up to me at work the next day and bawled into my shoulder saying thank-you over and over but a week or so later phoned me at 3 am wanting to give up. She was tired of school, her ""friends, just life in general. She couldn't take it any more. Spent the whole night talking her down and got her feeling better. Things improved from then on and we drifted apart but I'm glad I was there for her when she needed someone.

Sorry for the long post but it feels nice writing that all out. I don't feel like I did anything special. Just what anyone would have done in my position but im happy that I was able to help. Thanks for reading 😁"
Currently applying for internships= worst fear talking about myself,I am trying my best here to get an internship for the summer being a Biology major. But I am horrible at talking about myself. I feel like that is what a majority of these applications are is just a billion questions asking you about yourself. But in the family I was raised talking or boasting about oneself was not a think. Even with friends its not something I do when put into those situations. It jsut has begun to feel so unatural applying to these internships.
My great grandma just died,"And i dont really know how to react. I'm 17 and this is my first experience with death of a family member. I'm still kind of in disbelief that she's dead, and my mind physically cannot comprehend the obvious fact that she's dead. I'm extremely upset, but at the same time, it's almost like my brain thinks it didn't really happen. "

Alone with too many thoughts,"    My depression and anxiety have been getting worse lately and while I’m in therapy for them I feel like so many bad things happen and just add to my baggage. But more so everyone is getting tired of me being “that depressed friend” and I feel like I’m drowning in my own chest a lot because I don’t want to be like this. But like tonight I’m alone in my room while I just found out my two close friends are at a party together. And they always say I can reach out to them whenever I’m sad but that’s not the case cause I don’t want to bother them. 
    And I’m sorry for dropping this here, Im not even sure if it belongs here. I just, needed a place to put my thoughts. I’m tired of feeling like I’m drowning and that I have to put on a mask around everyone, that if I don’t that they won’t like me. 
     Even my parents get mad at me for being depressed and its all so tiring and I plan to bring this up to therapy on Tuesday but it doesn’t make this easier and I just want to make it to the days that I don’t feel like I have to hold my breath and bite my tongue "
"My boyfriend's doesn't respect me, but I can't break up with him until after our vacation together.","Title has a typo, should be ""boyfriend"" and not ""boyfriend's"".

We have a vacation scheduled next month. I've already booked the flight for hotel for both of us, which he hasn't paid me back for yet (I'm confident he will, though; no issues with that).

We've been dating for seven years, since high school. In that time, he hasn't grown up much. He's:    
* Said he was going to show up to my apartment, then texted me half an hour later (we live half an hour away from each other) saying he hasn't gotten out of bed yet and canceled his visit   
* Made me wait an hour after I showed up to his apartment because he was hanging out with a friend and didn't check his phone, even though we knew I'd be driving to his place at some point that afternoon    
* Almost never thanked waiters and service-people, though he doesn't treat them badly either   
* Asked angrily why I get so upset over something when I was completely calm but hurt over something he said    
* Made me cry probably a few dozen times and rarely apologizes if he hurts my feelings (I have depression and am super-sensitive, though)    
* Yelled at his computer in frustration when dying or encountering a bug in video games    
* Gotten defensive whenever I mention his poor personal hygiene     
* Stopped inviting me to some of his family events and doesn't talk to my family much when he goes to their gatherings, even though I'd told him my family is really important to me     
* Straight-up told me ""I don't respect you enough""

Some of these seemed like signs of depression, so I've asked him multiple times if he's been depressed and that he can talk to me about that, but he's said he wasn't. He's just immature (we're both in our 20s) and probably not in love with me, even though he says he is. He's still intelligent, a thoughtful conversation partner, faithful, and shares some hobbies with me; I'm also not perfect. But all of this happened slowly and sounds pretty shit when I compile them together, and I've decided I no longer want to date him. The reason we haven't really broken up despite multiple talks (we've decided we're not getting married) is because we both don't really have other friends who live nearby.

So just hanging on for that $500 vacation (which is a decent amount to me) to pass. We'll have an okay time unless he makes me cry, probably a 20% chance. Then I'm finally dumping him."
I'm a coward with no direction,"Hello everyone I'm 18 and I just wanted to say some things because I am sure no one else wants to hear it. I recently started college last August and it isn't too bad. I've made friends and I have done pretty good in my classes. I come from a small town so it was hard to adjust to the bigger scene and the larger amount of people I have to interact with from a day-to-day basis. I was dreading it before I left but now I have gotten used to the daily routine of classes and homework.

&#x200B;

Here is where my issue arises though which is that I low-key hate it. When I'm there I have no issue doing the daily routine but as soon as I get home, I hate having to go back. The three times that I have taken a break (Thanksgiving, Christmas, and now spring break) I dread having to return. It isn't because the work is hard or that I'm homesick I just simply hate being stuck at school.

&#x200B;

I'm never really 100% happy unless I'm playing videogames of some sort or watching someone play them (via Twitch or Youtube). It sounds silly but games just make me happy and especially when I am gaming with friends. I get sad when my schoolwork keeps me from playing because I just love it so much but I do it anyway because ""degree"".

&#x200B;

Truthfully, if I could become a YouTuber/Streamer I would quit college in heartbeat to follow my passion because I'm not happy doing anything else. Being pushed to choose a career at an early age makes me stressed and accumulating debt in a fruitless attempt to become potentially successful early makes me afraid. Spring break relieved some of that stress because all I did was visit my old soccer team, hung out with my SO, and game with some buddies from High School.

I'm just tired of living a life I feel like I don't really want to live anymore. I want to be able to sustain myself after college, but not at the expense of limiting my finances for the sake of paying college debt. I don't really feel that happy being in college.

TL;DR

I feel like I'm at a crossroads between getting a degree and being potentially successful or pursuing my dream of gaming as a content creator."
Dear Manager,"I really dislike you at this point. You give me anxiety at work because you're constantly breathing down my neck and it seems like as of lately you are preying on my failure. You observe me constantly and think I don't notice; literally waiting for me to mess up so you can shamefully correct me and make me feel bad. You do a terrible job at encouraging me and other employees to be/do better when we do make mistakes because it seems like you're more focused on being angry and making us feel bad rather than actually helping us become stronger and better at the areas we may be lacking in. You accuse me of rookie mistakes even though I have been working at the restaurant for close to a year now ( I know I'm not perfect but seriously...) and you do not have faith in me as an employee regardless of my hard work and dedication and you almost completely overlook my good work and only notice and point out the bad that I do. I can see in your eyes that you do not value me as much as I thought you did all along, and definitely not nearly as much as I valued coming to work everyday and doing my best to do good work. I am insulted at your lack of appreciation and lack of acknowledgement of my work and I am really demotivated compared to when I first started out because I know now that I'm just another employee to you. I thought you actually believed in me and had faith in me which was very reassuring at the start and that itself gave me the energy to be the best worker that I could be, and do the best work that I could do. You are not worthy of a worker like me and so I will continue to be a rebel of the workplace and not give af and eat our fresh ingredients when you're not around, and I will give not give you the best of my efforts as I once did and I will continue to pocket tip money when I can get away with it. You had the good me while he was there but now you've spoiled it so enjoy.

Oh and I hope when I end up getting a new job you will have realized what you really lost, please trip and faceplant into a bear trap.

Sincerely,

Your employee who has given up on you like you gave up on me (': "
I live in New Zealand and I’m not coping right now.,"So as most of you know, yesterday Christchurch, New Zealand suffered a terrorist attack. This is where I live. This is my home along with so many others. We are a small country but we have a big heart and a loud voice. We are all so shaken. This has never happened before. Ever. As a nation we are crying.

I feel awful. I want to cry every second. I keep trying to avoid social media because every post is about the attack and I can’t bare to see anything more about it, even if it’s things of support. It’s just really getting to me. What I need to get off my chest is that I just feel so stupid for being this upset. I don’t personally know anyone who was killed or hurt. So I don’t feel like I deserve to feel this way. But words cannot even begin to express the hurt and pain I feel.

I can’t get over this. They should have been safe here. They should have been safe here. This is their home and they should have been safe. I’m fucking crying while writing this I just can’t understand why this happened.

Thanks for listening. I just needed somewhere to vent and get this out of my head.

Epiphany,"Just realized while watching Christopher Robin....My three children are exactly the epitome of my favourite childhood characters. 
My oldest is a clumsy, always hungry, sweet but a little bit oblivious Pooh bear. My middle child is a straight laced, always follow the rules, serious and sarcastic Rabbit. My youngest is absolutely Tigger. She bounces every where and is loud and into everything. 
"
I find it funny I’d accidentally burnt myself and there’s a new scar on my wrist.,"When I was smiling while touching my scar and said “Isn’t this funny?” and started smiling my mom told “You’re crazy, something’s not right with you”, maybe it’s abnormal behavior but I find the whole experience kind of like fun, I think it’s funny and I’m not one bit worried  because  this type of scar it usually heals it’ll leave a mark but I didn’t expect it to have blisters, it looks cute to me my scar ‘cause it’s a thin line and not a serious one I think."
I envy people with depression/anxiety who can get support on social media.,"I have Bipolar 1. I can experience depression, hypomania, full blown mania with hallucinations, and mixed states (depression + hypomania or mania = can be a similar feeling as anxiety).

&#x200B;

I can't just post a meme or status about how I'm hearing beeping noises and that's why I've been getting an average of 4 hrs of sleep a night. People would assume that I'm unstable or scary when that may not necessarily be true.

&#x200B;

People with anxiety can just make a funny meme about how they've been overthinking things and it's been keeping them up at night. Then, tons of people can relate and support them.

&#x200B;

This is just one example, there are many more. Sure, people with anxiety and depression face stigma, but they're much luckier than people with more severe mental health issues. At least people aren't afraid of them when they share their diagnosis or how they're feeling."
Sheldon Cooper is such an unlikable character.,"I've  been forced to watch the Big Bang Theory for the past month or so since  it's constantly playing on the TV of the lounge in my workplace.  Whenever I go take a break and try to sit and relax, I find myself  watching that awful show.

But what  really pissed me off was that little whiny little fruitcake called Sheldon  Cooper. How does he have friends? He is an embodiment of an unsatisfied  ego. Always wanting attention, always wanting to be the center of people  and see himself as a god. Also, the show itself is terrible too.  The jokes are not funny and feel extremely forced. All the characters  are shallow and don't have any depth to them (especially Sheldon  Cooper).

I just want to know why do  people watch this show? Why would anyone like this show? And why would  anyone like Sheldon Cooper and be friends with him?"
Should you ever Google an ex?,"Well I havent had a very good night with memory lane and late at night stoned and alone found out a girl that I dated and was head over heels for died. 2 years ago to the day. Yea her and I havent talked in 4 years or so but damn. I'd love to contact the family but she didnt paint a very good picture of me to her parents and I dont want to stir up any kind of emotions... long story.

I’ve been crushing so hard for three years on a guy I met on a dating app but never in person and I feel so so stupid,"I felt like I just needed to tell somone, anyone who will read this, I know if i tell my friends they will just laugh at me.  So I matched with this guy on the dating app Bumble about three years ago and out of the few guys I swipe right to and never really think much of, this one guy stood out to me and got my attention 100% from the start. He wasnt super hot but he was definitely cute and just seemed genuine. We matched, talked on the app a bit, then exchanged phone numbers. I rarely ever meet with guys I meet on dating apps just because I’m too lazy to but I really felt like I couldnt wait to meet this one dude. 

We were similar in a lot of ways, we both considered ourselves american, but also grew up in south america so spoke both languages fluently, had family in both countries, had a lot of the same experiences, etc. anyway that along with lot of other things that I liked about him. When we matched he told me that he lived in New York (I live in PA) and he was just here for the weekend and had already left to NY, but regardless we still added eachother on insta, facebook and snapchat and got to the point of just sending eachother voice notes through whatsapp instead of texting. We definitely vibed really well and I just really liked the guy, which is weird because i *never* get excited just like that about someone I’ve never even met. Then maybe a few days or weeks later he slowly started taking a while to respond and then sort of stopped all together. I’m not a person who reaches out first or tries hard to make things happen if theyre not reciprocated, so even though I *REALLY* wanted to meet him and at one point i even thought of going to new york for a weekend to my cousins house but mainly so i could meet this guy (lol so stupid), I also stopped reaching out. 

Anyway we stopped texting after that but we still had eachother on social media so he would like a lot of the stuff i posted or we responded to eachothers insta stories very ocassionally, but it never went further. I definitely lurked through his instagram and facebook weekly or a few times a month for the whole three years we didnt talk. He was in NY and I was in PA, so in my head that was the reason he just never made the effort. I know the face people put on social media isnt always how they are in real life but when he posted stories, or his friends and family tagged him on pictures/videos, he always seemed to be the life of the party and the guy everyone loves. The typical dude that is super genuine, cute, very smart, and is always just being himself and radiating happiness. I was SO into it. He is not your typical model-looking guy whos 6’1 and has the body of a god, so i didnt become invested because I thought he was “hot”. Anyone would agree he is definitely really fucking cute though. 

I dont know how to explain this because I already sound ridiculous enough but years have passed, ive been in and out of a relationship of a year and a half, ive watched him (through social media) also get in a relationship and out of one, i have matched with countless of dudes on dating apps while ive been single, gone out with some, studied abroad, had pretty strong feelings for guys ive dated, and literally none, *none* have stuck to me like this dude from freaking three years ago. 

The other day I was telling my friend how I wanted to get out of the area (having just graduated from uni) and move away for work and she said how there are a lot of cool opportunities for my field in NY. I have always loved the city so started digging into job opportunities and getting excited about the posibility of moving there, then I remember thinking “maybe if I do end up going I can message (guys name) and we can finally meet”. Its bizzare to me that that is literally my first thought when thinking about moving to new york, specially since ive never met the kid. He is definitely more open on social media than I am, so I feel like thats why I’ve seen enough for me to become *that* interested in him and know that if we met we could possibly have good chemestry. From his end though, aside from the pictures of myself i post , there is really not much about me on my social media that would make him think “im very intrigued/interested in this girl”. 


Sorry this is so long I just need to get this stupid story off my chest because I feel like a fucking high schooler catching feelings for an almost-stranger. So fast forward to last week and I was bored lurking through different cities on hinge and swiping. I set my location to NYC and after a few swipes I saw him. I obviously immidiately swiped right and got sort of nervous thinking “what if we dont match? thatd really bum me out”. So I woke up the next morning and we HAD matched and he messaged me asking if I moved to NY, I said no and that I was unfortunately back in PA. He didnt say anything to that but i figured it was because there was really no room to say much. So fast forward to a few nights ago I got back on the app, said fuck it, and told him I actually did go to new york pretty often to visit family, so if he was up for it, we could grab a drink. He never responded. This is gonna sound stupid to all of you (and even to myself) but I feel so fucking crushed. Like yeah I might be completly wrong about this dude because social media isnt real life and he could be different but I’ve had him on all platforms for so many years and everytime i see something I always think how big of a catch this guy is. For all these years I have been waiting for the day I visited new york with enough time in advance so I could message him to meet up. Stupidly, I would low key get excited that I did have a chance to meet him one day. I’m like really bummed he didnt respond because im obviously not gonna message him again, even if i do end up visit or moving to new york or whatever, so I feel like this hope or idea i was holding on to for three fucking years has just been completly crushed, he is not interested. I literally took a nap today and had a dream about him rejecting me. I woke up and I was like “okay what the fuck, I need to talk about this because I feel so weird”. Then I realized my friends would probably just try to be nice but also laugh at me because of how childish these feelings are. 

Ive met a lot of attractive dudes on dating apps but no matter how good looking or nice, I will just think about them for maybe a few days and then forget about their existance. Its been three years and I’m still so hooked and crushing extremely hard on a dude from forever ago who I never even met. Im aware its ridiculous and weird, specially since I’m not the type to ever do this shit at all.

Anyway, if you read this far, thank you. If I’m just talking to myself and no one read this, I guess thats fine too I just needed to put these feelings out there somewhere. 
"
confused I guess,Ever tell someone you had a crush on them just because it slipped out and you said. But now they stopped talking to you and you aren't sure if it is because of that.
trigger warning suicide and sad shit (not looking for solutions or pity),"i think i might kill myself. i dont know for sure if i axtually have the guts to do it but i hope i soon get them because i have wanted to since i was in the 6th grade. i dont feel like journaling my saddness and 1st class issues again but i just feel like ive never actually been genuine with anyone about the fact that i might actually commit suicide. like my friends know i have been hospitalized and am currently on antidepressent and whatever but i havent actually told them that suicidr is a valid option i have been considering for too long. really my therapist knows but i dont know if she counts. i am going to be lonely for the rest of my life. lonely and sad. not only lonely romantically, but family - wise, friend wise - and just overall a lonely person. i am not going to live a fulfilling life so why not end it while its still okayish.

BBW Porn Star,I've hidden my naughtiness for long enough.  My dream is to be in a BBW Production Porn.  I have no idea where to even begin.  
I think my fiancée’s mom doesn’t like me,"I come from a very strict family where rules are rules, and you follow them. I don’t follow it too much, just about safety and stuff, like jaywalking, but I am a bit more straight edge than my fiancée. She told her mom one time that I didn’t like jaywalking, and her mom said she’s concerned that I’m controlling because I follow the rules so much. I’ve noticed things have been awkward and tense between me and her mom lately, and I’ve found myself holding my tongue with my fiancée even in somewhat dangerous or uncomfortable situations so I don’t upset her or be too controlling. I also think her mom is mad at me bc I spend too much time with her, but also between school and work I barely see her except during the evening when we’re both tired so of course on weekends we try to see each other on weekends? I’m just so worried and think her mom doesn’t like me and while I love my fiancée I don’t know how I could live with her not liking me at all. What if I am a bad fiancé? What if I am controlling?"
I broke my ex-girlfriend’s heart so bad and I feel terrible,"12 days after the break-up, she still loved me and wanted to be with me again. But she didn’t tell me that. She told me that it would be easier for her if I was with someone. And I did the dumbest thing and told her that there was a girl I liked. She obviously didn’t expect that started to cry awfully and hanged up the phone. We talked again later that night and she told me that she hates me, life sucks for her now and she doesn’t feel any joy. Today I sent her some memes on Instagram, she laughed and told me to go away. I also called her and tried to explain a bit more. She said angrily that I didn’t need to explain, it was none of her business. 

I can’t understand how sad she is. I feel absolutely terrible because of the possibility that she’s in a really awful mood for a while. "
I keep falling farther into depression and I’m losing everyone I love and rely on,"Recently I lost all of my best friends who I’ve been best friends with for the past five years. Originally they ditched me because  I would make fun of how they dressed and other little things like that. I could have gone back to them but they constantly made fun of people of color and the lgbtq+ community and I didn’t want to be with people who would constantly make fun of people who have less privilege (they, and me, are all straight white middle class males) so I am currently friendless and when this happened I immediately went to my girlfriend of 3 years but now it seems that that relationship too is coming to an end. I cut off any relationship to my family years ago and I they would bring and welcome me back without any problems as I was the one who cut the ties but I seem to not be able to let myself do that. I’m failing almost all of my courses and I’ve been suffering from depression for the last 3 years. It finally started to get better but now I’m just spiraling down more. I’m constantly thinking about suicide but I’m always telling myself that I can’t do that because that would be like Romeo and Juliet and I’m constantly telling myself that I can’t be depressed because of who I was born as. So me along with all of the rest of society is pressuring me to be happy and get good grades and live life to the fullest but I can’t and that’s just making everything worse. I’ve resorted drinking and weed and I have been seriously considering harder drugs but knowing that my father was addicted to cocain I am fearful that I will go to that point. Right now I’m just feeling hopeless and desperate for a friend but I don’t have enough energy to do anything. I always told my girlfriend all of this but I don’t want her to feel trapped in our relationship so I had the great idea of going to reddit. Thanks for listening or reading i guess. I needed to share with someone "
I think I finally got a proper goodbye to my friend who passed and found peace.,"I just wanted somewhere to write this. My friend got murdered on New Years and I’ve been in shock since then, not understanding that he’s gone.

Today I went and visited his grave for the first time, and I felt such peace in me while I was looking at the beautiful view where his grave is. My dog started whining because she got anxious as well, so I just sat down with her and petted her till she was okay and we sat there together.

When I was on my way to the car his mom stood there with open arms and we hugged and cried together for several minutes and we where able to laugh some when we talked about memories with him and just talk about our feelings.
And I felt like I could’ve hugged her for so much longer.  Now I’m in the car and I just feel so at peace when the sun was peaking out the clouds and kissing my face trough the forest.

I really felt like I needed this to heal.
It will obviously never be okay, but it feels like it might have gotten easier. My friend was supposed to turn 20 this year and I hope he’s okay wherever he is.

Thank you for reading."
I’m finally understanding my feelings and gosh it feels good,"For so long I’ve been confused about this guy. We have a weird history and at this point it’s irrelevant and all you need to know is we dated 2 years ago. I started having feelings for him again and now I think I finally know why. I know myself and I realize these feelings are just me finding a great friend. And I am very happy with that. I realize he is really not what I want in a bf, rather more of what I need in a friendship. He is definitely an odd person but I like that. I love being around him, he makes me laugh and makes me feel better if I wasn’t before and I enjoy talking to him. I like goofing off with him and honestly most of my other girl friends aren’t like that. I love having him in my life, as a friend. I don’t want things to change and I’m happy with that."
I made brownies for my brothers coworkers,"I wanted to do something nice and since I don't really have any friends on here I thought I'd post so I don't look like a bragger to my friends for doing something nice

My brother is a cashier at a grocery store so I thought making some brownies would be nice since they put up with Alot of people (fan of r/TalesfromRetail here lol)

"Failed a final, tired of failing classes/ having to repeat","I don't even know what to title this honestly.

I failed this final quiz I had not too long ago, which isn't worth as much as a final but it'll definitely make a difference for me in passing or not passing the class. And I've come to the point where I'm just trying to pass my class now. I don't really know how to react.

Here's a bit of a background, I've been at university for 4 years, transferred from a community college after 2, with this being my 4th. So in total I've been in college for 6 years (I must add in that I've always had doubts about doing about going to college, I never really wanted to honestly). All my close friends arounds me have graduated and I'm the only one left. I've been failing and repeating classes a good amount, basically adding up to a year extra (this 4th year). The reason I feel like I was failing and repeating was because my lack of discipline and focus (As of late I think I may have something up with my sense of focus, as in something having to do with my head or something. Idk. I just can't focus as much as other people.) and my lack of seriousness. It also had to do with me figuring out whether or not I actually wanted this degree because I've always wanted to work on a hobby that I've had too big a passion for. This school year I realized things and basically got serious, starting to focus more winter quarter (failed two classes fall quarter, not exactly failed but got D's so I had to repeat but I was still on track to graduate this year) which is this quarter.

Now leading up to today, I worked so hard this quarter like harder than I've ever worked and I overestimated how much I actually knew on this final quiz and I think I failed it. I may still have a chance to save my grade with one more final lab report for the class but I'm stupid bummed out right now. I have a plan I've been trying to follow for the end of this year and it may be thrown off. So if I do good in all 3 of my classes this quarter, I'll only have to take 2 classes next quarter which would free up so much time for me spring quarter for me to be more social and work on my hobby and such. And along with all this I have parental pressure and peer pressure and its a little higher coming from my culture. And like honestly I don't know if college is for me. Things just don't seem to be going right at university. And I don't even want to use my degree in the future as much as want to do other things. I'm just really bummed out right now. My head hurts, Im a little burnt out, I have lab report due this upcoming tuesday, a final on the same day and another final on thursday (one which I have to study for like the few days before). Everything just doesn't feel like it's going right right now. I was actually flowing and doing good during the quarter and then everything just felt like it hit at once. I don't really know how to feel or react right now. I'm scared of the future too and what people are going to see me as. But I know I'm not a failure or disappointment. "
How do you know?,"I am lost. 
I was in a bad relationship. It wasn’t the obvious kind of bad.. it was the kind where you’re not sure if you fucking up or if they’re fucking with you. It was the kind where if he was fucking with me, I couldn’t tell if he was doing it intentionally or not. 
That ended. He broke up with me over text. Refused to explain why we couldn’t have a discussion in person. Basically ghosted me after break up text. I was devastated. I was going out every night, drinking a ton every night. I still took care of my shit, but just enough. 
I met him about 5 months later. He was nice, cute, totally into me. 
Then, I got pregnant. I was super unsure of how he’d take it. I was going to accept if I had to do the whole thing alone, or if it would be as coparents. But he said he was excited, he wanted this. He was happy to be with me and have a baby with me. I reluctantly believed him....
Things were good. He came to every doctor appointment. He was so supportive. We were clicking like... like this was somehow meant to be. 
But little by little he started to act differently. Blowing me off and going out with his friends, not coming home until like 4 am. His friends encourage this kind of behavior, which doesn’t help. 
I confronted him the first time it happened. He was apologetic, said it’d stop there. 
Then it happened again. And again. 
It doesn’t happen every day. Or every week. But every once in awhile, he’ll just blow me off. 
We live together. Now our baby girl is going to be a year old next month. And several times in this last year, he’s gone out, said he’d be home at a decent time.... and then doesn’t come home until 3 or 4 or 5 or even 6 in the morning. 
I don’t think he’s cheating. I believe he loves me and our daughter. But I don’t know how to make him understand that his behavior doesn’t match.
Thursday, a few days ago, he did this again. I was so upset, I couldn’t even be mad. I just didn’t have it in me anymore to even rip him a new one. I just told him I wasn’t ok with this. And then rolled over and went to bed. 
It’s Saturday today, and he just asked/told me he was going out with friends. Idk if I’m tripping balls... but to me, after I’ve dropped the ball, I’m on my best behavior to prove it was just a mistake. I’m not going to try to risk it again and maybe fuck up. Like I get it, you can’t hold someone’s past over their head. But holy fuck. 
Like... I’m not asking him for much. But, as a dad, like I would appreciate it if would actually want to be home. And be around our daughter; we could hang out as a family. 
I told him I wasn’t comfortable with him going out. 
He literally had a fit. Said “fine I’ll just stay home and watch tv and you can go lay down.”
I was like... “I didn’t say I wanted to go to bed... the whole point was to spend time together.”
He legit stormed off. He said, “fine I’m going to go lay down.”
Like ... he had a temper tantrum because he didn’t get his way? Because I asked him to stay home and hang out with me and his daughter?
It makes me feel like he doesn’t even want to be here. Like I should just leave. And he can continue to party and do whatever the fuck he wants and I can at least know what to expect. It is so fucking frustrating dealing with these mixed messages. Some days he’s so sweet. Surprises me with gifts, buys me candies randomly, takes me to dinner. Some days he acts like he can’t even be bothered by me. Like I’m annoying. A burden. Something he’d rather not deal with. 
I try so hard to be positive and encouraging, understand and everything. Obviously I’m not perfect. I have many flaws. But I try to support him the best way I can. Be there when he’s having a rough day. Cut him slack when he snaps at me. 
But it’s like... I get zero of that back. When I make a mistake (for example, forget to tell him I have an appointment that conflicts with plans) he FLIPS. Yells at me, talks to me like I’m stupid. 
When he makes mistakes, I try my best to help him find a solution. 
I’m so sad.
I don’t know how to know what to do. Do I try to fix this? Do I leave? How can I help him to understand how I feel? Do I even bother?
I’m just. Done. 

Ps. He works nights at a restaurant. Usually weekends, and he has random weekdays off. I work days. I’m off weekends. We rarely have a day off together. We almost never get a night in together.
I wanted to have a night together.... and it really fucking blows that he’s acting like this. 


"
I wish I could stop thinking about him and move on :(,"I fell for someone last year. We got close and were playful, but never got intimate. I moved away for a bit, came back and now we don't talk. I guess he has moved on, but i'm still thinking about him all the time. I just want to be close to him and play with him like we did before."
Please respect my personal space,"I’m black and I don’t feel comfortable when a group of white people/any people surround me. I am antisocial. I try to stand as far away from others as I can. But for some reason a group of white teens always crowd around me. When there is ample room. I have no idea why. 

Today, I started to move away, but they got the hint and dispersed. Like this has happened twice today. I live near dc, am a short black girl. Please respect my personal space. It’s a weird pet peeve to have, but it’s mine nonetheless. "
A terrible week in a strange life.,"So I have been for the last few years a live in house guest with a family, I have over the last year started to hate them but at the current time I have no way out of the situation due to crap employment opportunities in the area. But that isn't the worst part, more on that after some background.

After a massive fight I had a falling out with my own family 4 years ago, it cost me everything and took me from having a family that was over 250 people strong in just this city to only 4, well at this point only 2 people are left that I can in any way consider family.

The people I moved in with I had known from before, but I didn't know them well, they where just the only people that replied when I put the word out that I had nowhere else to go. 

The husband is a thief, a liar and an idiot who can't even wash dishes right who has gotten into multiple arguments with me over stupid things that where proven to be false with a 5 second google search but instead he decides to make threats then call the cops when I don't back down. I've never gotten violent with him but damn do I want to so bad it hurts sometimes.

The wife is also an inept control freak, who has on at least 2 occasions has tried to get me to have sex with her and her husband, which ain't happening because I don't find her in any way attractive and because I have zero interest in being naked around another guy. What is worse is that I  have caught her having an affair with a literal homeless alcoholic, one of the ones that is always hanging out at the soup kitchens and homeless shelters, I've seen him out there for years and one day I come home to find her boning this walking bedbug infestation in the living room while her husband was at work... She knew what this guy was about when she brought him home as well, because she volunteers at a soup kitchen.

The son means well, but he's a little slow and extremely inexperienced because his mom helicoptered over him his whole life and had him home schooled.

At the time after the falling out with my family I was kind of checked out from wanting to deal with anyone at all. So I took a solo cross country driving job for a few years, it gave me a new freedom that I had never had before or since. But it also came with deep lows of loneliness after spending up to 6 weeks at a time of 18 hour days where my only human contact was truck stop attendants and dock workers.

During this time on a whim I started trying online dating, I had never done so before and figured it was something to kill time while out on the road. I met a girl from the other side of the planet that actually was a real person, we started video chatting one day and then it became a daily thing, we haven't gone more than 48 hours without talking ever since. I haven't told anyone about her even though I care deeply for her and have considered bringing her here to the US once I get myself reestablished. She kept me sane through so much shit I've been though.

Then there is my other roommate who was only here for 3 weeks ago. She is only 20, I'm 33, she had a similar falling out with her family and ended up here with nowhere to go. We got along just fine from the start, even though I really probably shouldn't have I did end up going down on her the other night, I wasn't even trying to get involved with her, it just kind of happened and I'm still not sure how because she's way out of my league even if I was 20.

Now starts the things that have crushed my soul, made me feel powerless and helpless.

So on Tuesday comes and I get a call from my cousin that my great uncle has died, one of the few people I could still call family, that I could trust, that I could go to for advice had died, that it wasn't going to be in the paper, that there was only going to be a small service before he was cremated. I start mentally prepping myself for the shitshow that I know I'm going to have to endure as his sister had died the year before, so I already knew what bullshit to expect to hear from my relatives about me. Just remembering that it cuts them far deeper to just reply ""that's funny, because I never even think about any of you"", the truth of it is that, no, I really don't.

Fast forward to Thursday, I get a frantic call from the girl I have been talking to from the other side of the planet. She's recently started a job at a massage parlor, one of the clients sexually assaulted her and threatened her. She was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone, not her mother, her sisters, her coworkers, nobody. The sadness I see in her eyes in the video chats and the photos she sends me says it all, he did more than just touch her, she just won't say it. I'm completely devastated by this and can't help but cry, but never in front of her. She keeps apologizing for it happening and I keep telling her that it isn't her fault, that she must talk to someone about it, but she is too afraid.

Friday afternoon I go to the funeral, over 300 people are there, I am constantly getting dirty looks and occasionally here the whispers of obvious lies being told about me between blood relatives, I do my best to ignore them then after the service head out and smoke a bowl for my dead uncle and to calm my nerves that are now shot after having these 2 blows back to back.

But then I go home, only to find that my roommate's kid is the one making dinner, apparently nobody told him till after 8, and what he was trying to make wasn't going to be ready till 11. His mom gets home and goes ballistic, shit talking everyone and everything, then decides that for the stupidest reasons possible is kicking out the 20 year old girl with literally nowhere else to go because she had the audacity to go out for a bit after work instead of coming straight home, I try my best to defend her staying here but it's of no use, she calls her and tells her to pack her shit and never come back. She was too afraid to come right back and had me text her when everyone else had gone to bed to come over and get her things. I told her if she ever needs anything to call me.

At this point I don't know what else I can do, I can't afford to get my own place, even with the 20 year old, our combined income still wouldn't cover rent + bills even on an efficiency apartment. My end goal was to leave this entire region of the country by year's end and build a new life somewhere not this fucked.

So right now I'm just sitting here, typing this out and dropping shots or Bacardi like water trying to figure out what, if anything I can do."
I can’t even get the one thing I actually wanted for my birthday?!?,"Just a heads up this is a rant.

So my birthday was on the 7th and everyone that cared about me who is very few but they thankfully wished me a happy birthday wether it was by text or phone call. Then there is you, granted you did wish me a happy birthday via text but I told you the one thing besides something sentimental from you that I really really wanted was just a phone call and being able to talk for at Leary 45 min to an hour. You had all morning to give me a call before you hung out with your friends for the rest of the day. For the past 3 years I’ve asked you for the same thing just a phone call to talk for a little. I don’t think I’m asking for much or am being unreasonable in my request but you never have given me that 1 phone call which is the only thing that I’ve wanted for my birthday for the past 3 consecutive years. Honestly I’m not mad I’m just disappointed. I go above and beyond for you and your birthday. I always ask what you want and end up getting it for you plus do much more. This year you wanted headphones that cost 200$ and I got you the portable charging case for 25$ to go along with it plus 440$ in other things that I knew you would enjoy and I mean I’ve done this for you for the past 3 years. I always tell you money is not an issue (Im not trying to brag and I apologize if it comes off that way) as I want you to be happy and feel special in your birthday and knowing that you are happy makes me happy but you can’t even give me that one phone call and spare 45 min to an hour for me? I’m just disappointed in that you can’t do that for me."
