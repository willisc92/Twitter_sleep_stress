"I was having lunch with my friends for my birthday, I went to the bathroom and when I came back, everyone had left...","There was a small moment where I thought 'that's okay, they're busy and I really appreciate that they came and had lunch'. That was when I noticed the package with my name on it sitting on my chair. Inside was a ransom note, a blacklight, and some random puzzle pieces. What followed was a four hour epic journey around the city, solving puzzles. This included a trip into a bar where the bartender said 'I've been expecting you', and handed me another set of locked boxes and puzzles as he poured me a whisky. Eventually  it finished at some accommodation they had booked for the weekend, along with the final address of a bar where everyone was waiting for me. They designed everything themselves. I was so utterly overwhelmed and humbled by the extraordinary effort they went to for me. These people are funny, smart, kind, and generous and I always feel lucky that I know them at all, let alone get to call them my friends. The world is a much better place for having them in it. "
The 8 year old girl next door just broke my heart,"Some backstory:

I'm a 24 year old guy, I love tooling around on old cars, something I've done together with my dad since I was a kid, he was all too happy to have me carry it on.

So I work your typical 8 to 4-5 schedule, and quite often I'm in the garage after work fixing up this old mustang I've been on for the last two years or so. (A completely unrestored '65 mustang that my dad has had for years, to take on now that I'm out in the world, that was a special moment). 

So one day, I started leaving the garage door open, and its to the front so pretty much everyone can see what I'm doing, people stop by, chat, say hello, its great, I always love to chat it up, especially older folks that are happy to see a young guy getting his hands dirty working hard on a classic. 

So about a year ago during the summer, the neighbors mom asked if I could look after their little girl Rachel, a quiet little girl that always seemed well behaved. I didn't mind, but I said I'm really committed to working on this car, if you feel good enough to let her over here while I'm working on the car, not a problem. 

Turns out they're going through a divorce, the dad works the 3rd shift, the mom's got a part time gig, evening hours just aren't good for em. Ok, so this starts, and it goes fine. She's quiet, usually reading books or watching the TV I brought out so she would be around me. I always made sure to be courteous, firm, and try out dad humor every now and then. Well, she starts to come out of her shell after a while and it was a joy.

I still remember when she first asked about why I was working on the car:

""Why are you working on that car when you have one thats newer and works?""

""Well, this car is about 45 years older than the other one, its a classic. She'll be much prettier when I'm done with her. I've been sitting in the garage helping my pop since I was younger than you! I always wanted to be like him and so I'd sit and learn and eventually he let me help.""

""Oh. Whenever I see dad he's always sleeping.""

""Well, he's working hard to provide for you, he's working a tough job."" 

She just kind of was quiet after that. But after two or three months, she started being cheerful when she came over, always asking questions about what I was doing specifically. This part and that, why it needed to be done, what made it work. I was glad to impart knowledge, I think everyone likes teaching a bit, especially something you're passionate about. 

I started teaching her about tools, how to recognize which ones you need, what they can do on a car or around the house. She started to light up, I got the sense that besides school.. she didn't have much of a parental figure. Or anyone to teach her anything about life, or anything. 

One time my dad visited in his '66 GT convertible, and I took her for a ride in it. 

I'll always remember how she smiled, saying, ""Is this what yours is going to be like?"" 

""Should be, but mines a coupe so it won't be quite as nice.""

""Nooo, yours will be much better! Cause we've been doing it!""

My chin started to wobble and I just smiled and said you're right, it will be. 

She'd really started to grow on me, I mean, it would be impossible not to let her into your heart. A bright eyed smart little girl that just soaks up everything you teach her, wants to learn, and looks up to you like that.

It made me sad, because the times I saw her parents interact they were always snide or yelling at each other, when they were around that is. This spring I started noticing the mother leaving without a uniform, sometimes dressed to go out. I came to the conclusion she quit or wasn't working, but still taking advantage of me babysitting. Which I didn't mind in the slightest. 

Sometimes Rachel would be quiet more when she came over, but I always waited until she would open up. She'd let out tidbits like, ""Mommy woke me up late at night, she was acting funny."" Or, ""She came home with someone that wasn't daddy"" or the like. It would pierce my heart, but I didn't know what to do except keep being a safe harbor for her of sorts. She started hugging me more often, squeezing me as hard as she could. I'd always get a lump in my throat. 

She's just wormed her way into my heart, how when I take a break and sit down, she'll climb all over me until I give her the proper attention, every now and then when she does some mannerism or phrase she picked up from me.. even just when I ask her to hand me a tool and she picks the proper one no problem.

We had some of the best times I can remember, just tinkering under my car, her with a raggedy old sweater of mine on with safety glasses so old dirt wouldn't fall in her eyes, watching me work, asking away. One time she nicked herself on the edge of the radiator support and I picked her up and went to bandage it up. 

I told her, ""Most girls your age would cry if they got that little cut."" 

She said brightly, ""Now my hands are gonna get all beat up like yours!""

I didn't even know what to say so I burst out laughing (plus another lump in the throat) and hugged her and said, ""You're the best little girl in the world you know that?"" 

Then a few weeks ago, her mom came over and said they were going to get a divorce, and if I could still keep watching her during the week. I told her I was sorry and absolutely, she's a delight to have around. 

Yesterday she was morose, and quiet unlike she had been in a long time. Turns out her parents will be separating and they'll have to move soon. She started crying and hugged me, asking if it meant she won't be able to come over anymore. I started tearing up a bit and choked out, I don't know Rachel, I don't know. I hope you can. I love you, you know that? You're the smartest, cutest, best little girl in the world and I love you.""

She just cried all the harder and said I love you too. 

She even asked if she could stay with me. Again I said I don't know, but I don't think it's in the cards. 

When she left yesterday I just sat down with a bottle of jack and started crying. I just can't take it. That sweet beautiful little girl that wants to be just like me, giggles when she gets grease on her, tosses on my old dirty sweater when she comes over cause she wants to help. I just want to take her up in my arms and take away that pain. She doesn't deserve to have a shitty childhood growing up with a nonexistant father or a shitty mother. Fuck I just can't deal with it. It fucking tears my heart apart.

TL;DR : Start babysitting a little neighbor girl with shitty parents, we have the best time together over the past year, parents are divorcing, will move away soon. Fuckin hell "
Yesterday I took a shower. The first since 9.30.17,"No one gives you awards for taking a shower. But for me it was like climbing a god damn mountain.

&#x200B;

Almost a full year ago, I was raped and left bleeding outside a BDSM club in San Francisco. I was a sophomore in college, a band kid, an amazing job, and had a good life set for me on the west coast. Until this happened.

I thought I had gotten my period the next morning- I would find out it was actually tears and open cuts inside me when I decided to go to the hospital. My chest was bruised so badly the mark didn't go away for almost 2 months. I had been badly hurt, and was put on anti-HIV pills. My mom flew from across the country to stay with me. After a few days, it was decided that I would move back home to heal, and reconsider school in the spring.

I was quiet, I slept until 3 in the afternoon, and my nightmares were horrible but the medication for the nightmares made me suicidal. Most of all, I **hated** my body. I would wear the same outfit 3 days in a row to avoid changing, or change in the dark. The first time I washed my hair was in January, in the sink, crying in the Adult Psych unit. The nurses washed my hair with buckets over the sink and I felt like I was drowning.

&#x200B;

I wash my body under my clothes with bath wipes, a product meant for the elderly. I manage to wash my hair once a week, or I aim for once a week. The shower is scary.

&#x200B;

But yesterday I did it. I stood half-in, and let the water hit my back, and the top of my head, and it felt like acid at first but I stayed in there for a minute and a half. I covered myself fully in the towel and put my back against the mirror. I put clothes on.

&#x200B;

**I finally fucking showered.**

&#x200B;

Will I do it again? I don't know, because the day it happened is coming up and I can already feel myself sinking down into the anxiety, the fear, and the depression of my PTSD. I climbed up one mountain but there's an entire range I have to get through.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: Wow, I am blown away by everyone's kindness. I understand rip inbox now. And thank you, anonymous stranger, for the gold. I've been trying to talk more often about what happened, because if it stays in my head I go mad about it, and my PTSD goes into bad places. And as a woman, I need to tell my story, or the rapists win. I just started therapy again, which I'm fearing but going into with my head up. There is.....so much I want to say but It's near midnight. I hope to respond to as many people as I can in the morning :)


EDIT 2 (Nov 26 2018) : I am blown away by your support, reddit. I still receive PMs and they help me through the days when its even harder to get up and live. I have been able to shower three times since, thanks to Float Therapy. I cannot believe how amazing it is- and how much it has helped with regular therapy. I go every other week due to the cost but when I go I can shower afterwards for some reason? My guess is that the sensory deprivation in the floating chamber helps separate me from my mind and my body and I can allow myself to feel nice things, like warm water and lemongrass soap. Happy holidays, heres to recovery for all <3"
I got a 98% on my exam for nursing school and have nobody to tell who actually cares.,"I got a 98% on my exam yesterday and I still can’t believe it. Nobody really cares enough for me to tell them so I’m telling you guys. The exam was ridiculously hard and the majority of my class failed it. I still have another exam coming up and test outs but my confidence in my abilities has sky rocketed.

Edit: okay, you guys are all seriously awesome. This has made my week. I did share my grade with my husband after posting and he was pretty excited for me. Sorry to not really respond, I’m still studying for my last exam. I love all of you for this though. I needed this after this ridiculously long semester. 

Second edit: this post is super old on Reddit time but if anyone is still following I got my score back for my last exam. 96%!!!! "
"My 95 Year old Mom died this past week. She's from Europe, lived during WWII time and loved to tell her story. I'm her only living child left and hardly anyone left for her. No big funeral. So I'm telling her story for her now. I think she would have loved that.","My mom just died. She was 95. She had such an incrediible life. But she had a small family, is from Europe and has out lived most everyone in her life. I and my family is all she has left. She used to love to tell her story, especially of WWII days. If you started her talking about that she would light up. So here's her story, her sort of funeral. She would have loved to know so many people were listening. Thanks for listening.

My Mom was born in 1923 in Saporoahje, Ukraine. Her Dad was a professor and her mom had come from Latvia to work near the University. Mom had an older sister and a younger brother. She attended University for one year and wanted to be a doctor. But times were getting very hard. They had to turn over everything in their house and used to have to wait in line for a whole day for a baked potato ration. Communism was taking over. Mom's Dad refused to become a communist. The soldiers were moving in and her parents, her and her sister fled. First to Poland for a year and then onto Germany. Her brother was sent to Latvia to be safe from being forced to be a soldier. She never found him again. My Mom was the only sibling that had attended University and the only family member that also spoke German fluently and Polish. She got a job in Erding Germany at an Air force base to support her family  when it was still the Luftwaffe Training airfield. She was 18 or 19. She spoke such fluent German, the only one in her family to do so, and her father's parents were Swedish so she had fair skin, very blond hair and blue eyes and they never suspected she was Ukraine. My Mom lived with a German family and they had taken her in as their very own. She had her family living at another location. She had made friends with other German women and one in particular was her best friend who had black hair and everyone called them salt and pepper. In 1945 the Air Force base was seized by the U.S. Airforce and used as an Air Depot, Air Base and Air Station. She said her and her friends all thought Americans would be very distinguished but when the they came, they would call out ""Hey Blondie"" and were not at all what they expected. At that time she met my Dad who was an American Air force soldier stationed there during WWII. For him it was love at first site. For her it wasn't bad but she didn't think anything of it. At one point she had agreed to meet him to get him off her back to and never planned to keep the date and hours later he was still waiting outside. From then on they were together. They attended lots of Military dances together and she has often said that although it was war time, it was some of the best times of their lives. I'm told of a story where my Dad had hitchhiked into some other town all day to buy my Mom her very first Christmas present. It didn't go without some nervous times. Her and her girlfriends used to walk and often have to take cover when enemy planes flew over. One day she happened to be wearing a red dress when it happened so she was taken away from a table my Mom and Dad were at together, to be questioned if she was signaling the planes. Their common language they both spoke was German and that's what they spoke to each other their first 5 years together. When she married him at 23 years old, her white dress was sewn out of white silk parachute. They married on Christmas Eve but by some old paperwork I found, states he wanted to be married on Christmas day. My dad often bragged about how there was a bar made out ice that you could skate up to and their Honeymoon was in Garmisch and when it came time to settle the bill, the Air force said it was on them. Sometime during this whole time, her sister fell in love with a Jewish man. They had 2 girls. He was killed in camp so my Mom helped to hide those girls who were half Jewish. Those girls were never told their Dad Jewish was until they were old themselves as their mom had always been afraid people may be against Jewish people again someday. Mom was never clear to us the timeline on when this happened or where. When my Dad's time in the Military was done and he was honorable discharged, they were to leave on a ship to America with others. My Mom was to leave ahead with other European wives, but friends bought her champagne the night before, that she had never drank before and thought it tasted good so drank quite a bit and was so sick the next day she missed the boat. Literally. So my Dad got her on the one he was on. They rode the ship for three weeks and the whole time my Mom was sea sick. My Dad couldn't stop eating.

They arrived in New York and then Chicago and my Mom couldn't believe how you could just buy things at the store. They were to make their final destination in Japan as my Dad was offered a civilian job on a Military base there. But they stopped off in Marshfield, WI, which was a small farming community, to see my Dad's dad and his dad begged him not to leave and they never did. For years I grew up hearing how my Mom never liked Marshfield. She liked cities better. But to dad it was home and that's where he would like to stay.  My Mom studied and took her Citizenship test and became an American citizen in 1951. She was often quoted as saying America is the best place on earth. She just said it again to me last week. My mom, having seen how you could buy things at stores, wanted to get a job as soon as she arrived in Marshfield. She got a job at a shoe factory that was piece work. Meaning you got paid for every piece sewn. She had told me she was very fast and their top worker and she worked there right up until her first child was born 7 years later. They had waited so long as they could not afford children before that. During that time, my dad took out a loan and brought my Mom's family to America as well even though the first five years of their marriage they couldn't afford to own a car or refrigeration. Her family chose to settle in Chicago in the Ukraine section as they still spoke no other language and felt more at home there. I'm told her father was one of those men you would see sitting in the park playing chess and one day while doing that, had a massive heart attack and died.

My mom was pregnant with a second child that ended up dying while in the womb and she had to give birth to her. She didn't want any more children after that but after time my Dad convinced her it could be different and she had another healthy son. When she became pregnant with me she started to hemorrhage and the doctors put her to bed rest. It wasn't stopping and the doctors told her I would never be born and if I was there would be so many things wrong with me so she might as well get up. She wouldn't listen and wouldn't give up and stayed in bed for 6 months. She also wouldn't take Thalidomide even though they wanted her to. She wanted to take nothing to take the chance of harming me. The last 2 months she stopped bleeding and was able to go on to have a normal pregnancy. When I was born she said my Dad cried because I was a girl. I suspect it was also because I was born healthy.

When I was in school, they needed a new car. So my Mom got a part time job at a new store that had come to town called Shopko. Eventually it led to a full time job and she was head of her department for 18 years until her retirement. Between the 2 of them they never in their lives made over 20,000 a year. But the house I grew up in, which was their second house, was paid off as long as I can remember even in my childhood. They never had a car loan. Only paid cash. We would take driving vacations once a year and I felt spoiled at Christmas. Always had plenty of food. My Mom was the one who paid the bills and budgeted and I remember her having a special envelope that she would put money in and once a month, fill the freezer with meat on sale from the money in that envelope.

During those 18 years my second oldest brother started showing signs of alcoholism and although they did everything in their power to help and support him, years later it took his life.

When my Mom retired they traveled around to every state. Many of them more than once. They mostly took tour buses and had a ball. Their house was filled with souvenir coffee cups, so many coffee cups, from every place and Mom would get souvenir sun visors, the kind with no top to it. Their favorite place was Vegas. I'm not sure if it was Dad's favorite but he just loved seeing Mom have so much fun. She loved the buffets and playing the slots, One time she called me at 11:00 p.m. because she had won $110 on the nickel machine. Dad thought that wasn't enough to warrant a call but she didn't care she was so excited. Another story they had told that makes me chuckle every time I think of it was how they went to an all girls dance show only to have the girls in the end pull off their bottoms to reveal they were actually men. I'm sure that was a huge shock to someone of their generation. But they laughed about it. During one of those trips my dad was on and escalator that suddenly stopped and he fell and hit his head. A week later he had a seizure and from then on there was a steady decline. My Mom took care of him as long as she could. Even after breaking a hip, after I had taken him in for a period while she recovered. I don't know how she did that. I lived 2.5 hours away and my oldest brother lived in the same town but she did it mostly all on her own. I suspect now to keep a secret just how bad it was so no one would say to put him in a nursing home. When it finally got so bad he had to go to a nursing home, she would take a taxi ( she never drove since coming to America) every day to be with him and towards the end feed him at least one meal a day.

Some years later she had a house fire. After everything was fixed she moved back in but I started noticing some looping of sentences and questions and I started having to pay her bills and such. Looking back I think she had a small stroke during that house fire time. She was incredibly fiercely, adamant about staying in her home. You have no idea how much, so we tried to allow that for as long as possible. She also said she would never, ever live with one of her kids as she tried to do that with her mom after her Dad passed and it didn't work. But when she was 90 it was getting worse. At this time I was living 2.5 hours away. She was supposed to go for a physical one day so I asked her friend to help get her there. That morning her friend found her laying in the bath tub. She had been there for a few hours. She had fallen and although she brought a phone in it was out of reach. Her friend helped her to bed but she was sick and wouldn't eat so she called an ambulance. There they found scar tissue that should she had had a stroke at some point. I'm wondering if another minor one during that time as her memory seemed worse. They had her in rehab there and when she was to be released I brought her to live near me in assisted living. It was a beautiful place and I thought she was going to love it. But once there she would have no part of it. It I wasn't there she would call me literally non-stop 24 hours a day. She called the police. She kept on insisting on going back to Marshfield. The assisted living said she actually needed much more care than assisted living and needed long term care. Dementia had settled in much more during that time. My oldest brother who still lived in Marshfield said to bring her back. He became legally in charge of her and found long term care for her. She fought it hard at first but then settled in. During that time my oldest brother died of pancreatic cancer. I was her only child left now. She could remember other things but that. That she just wouldn't let herself remember. At first they told me to lie about it but he had told her about it before he died so she kept asking how he was and being agitated. The nurse said it wasn't working to protect her. So I would have to tell her over and over again. Sometimes within a 5 minute period. And every time it was like the first time she was hearing it. Eventually when I told her she wouldn't get so upset but rather wonder why she didn't remember. I said her brain just didn't want to. Not long after his death, my husband I were transferred to Austin, TX. I worked on getting her moved here, which proved to be much harder and much more red tape than I thought. The day before we picked her up she said she was scared but said she would trust us. The morning we picked her up and had a 3 hour drive to the airport, she didn't remember what we were doing. I held her hand while my husband drove and had her talk about Germany. I was slightly panicked because you have no idea how feisty she can be and fight back. I literally made sure child safety locks were on. But As the hours passed she hadstarted remembering what we were doing and while on the plane she said she never thought at her age she would be on a plane again. Surprisingly for the most part she took the move here well. But I came to see her nearly every day and she kept saying how nice it was that we lived so close to each other now. She has had several health problems in the past, arthritis in her hands and very,very bad in her shoulders, a broken hip, hiatal hernia, and advancing dementia, etc, etc, But she was still walking in a walker. But in January she started complaining of a sore hip area that ran down her leg. X-rays revealed very advanced osteoporosis and a fractured pelvis. It showed she had old fractures there in the past but this was a bad one. It also revealed a fractured arm just below her horribly arthritic shoulders that she had never said anything about. Doctors don't know if it was an unreported fall or that her osteoporosis is so advanced just sitting too hard could have caused it. She used say she had aches and pains but that went with growing old. After days 3 in the hospital, at 95, they didn't want to do surgery. Especially since it showed some heart irregularities. She went to a rehab and skilled nursing place just down the road from me and since the hospital and all through that time I spent all day, every day with her and I'm so glad I did. For a while she was doing better but then a decline started happening. I think she knew it was getting close because even before the hospital she couldn't tell me often enough how much she loved me and often asked about the family and how everyone was doing. She knew my son was trying to get his post college graduate job here ( he moved with us) and kept asking if he got it and when he got his dream job she would say there, now all your family is set. She had started refusing to eat. Would spit it out and cover her mouth. Saying I don't eat anymore. One time I said "" Mom if you don't eat, you won't survive"". She shrugged and said I've lived a good long life. Then a week ago she started refusing her meds. She would spit them out even if they were crushed and put into something for her. She would wave her arm and say NO! So now she was getting nothing for pain. When my Dad was failing she had a DNR put into place and no feeding tubes etc. She said he wouldn't want to be kept alive that way. So when she moved here I found in her papers she had made one out for herself as well. I was legally her guardian but respected her wishes. She had kept saying no food, only drink. So I could at least get nutritional drinks in her. She'd have some not so bad days and one day while laying in bed and we were looking out the window, she said I wish we could do something together. My thought went to the fact that she was pretty weak and was in a wheel chair now if she did get up and how would I take her somewhere. So I said what should we go do? But then she said that's okay, just being here together is all I need. I did take her walking outside in the wheelchair another day and was going to go on an adventure but she just wanted to go back in. I think she wanted something she knew her body couldn't handle anymore. One day she wouldn't drink any more. And that went into the next day. They ordered hospice and that would have involved morphine for pain. They felt she had some time yet as she was still having plenty of output but I had a feeling. I crawled in bed with her and held her hand and stoked her hair and forehead. If I stopped at all she would gesture to continue. She would kiss my hand. And reached for us to give a kiss. I started to talk about some happy memories but she gestured me to stop. So I just kept telling her how much I loved her. The nurse had come in at one point and checked her oxygen and such and said she was okay but I felt a panic that hospice should be starting. It was evening now and hospice was starting in the morning. But then we were all alone, and suddenly her breathing changed and she got a look in her eyes. I knew, so I stayed by her side and kissed her hand and told her how much I loved her and that would we would all be great and happy and that dad was waiting for her. Her hands turned blue and she took several more breaths and was gone. It happened so fast. It was just her and I. And a part of me is glad that even though she as in pain, she went the way she wanted. Taking nothing.

I know this was very long winded. But I felt such an incredible woman like that with such a long life, deserved to be told about at her death. She used to love to tell her story. Especially her European days and she would have thought it was cool to have so many people listen. And there was no one to tell anymore. Thank you for listening. I miss her already. Per her wishes she is being cremated. As a memorial, I am thinking of mixing Mom and Dad's ashes into one container, and anyone who wants to go with us, go with their ashes to Vegas. Go to the buffets, play the slots, buy the souvenir visors and coffee mugs. Go do something together.

EDITED:  I made a comment below but wanted to make sure all saw it.  I saw some comments asking for pictures so I put together a few of my favorite and some documents with a link. I hope it works. I cannot even begin to put into words how much all your kind words have meant to me. And to her. I just know she's reading them with me. And I'm eading each and every one. And I am ready others sharing loss and grief and worry of their own parents and grandparents. I'm so sorry you are going through that. But I'm so grateful there is a place that we can share kind words for eachother. Some times, when you are out in every day life, at the grocery store, getting gas, you encounter people that may be feeling loss, or about to have loss. And they are going about their every day life and no one to share this with.  It has helped to share her story. When I think back, I wish I had taken even more time and heard even more stories but I'm so grateful for the ones I have.  And she would have LOVED it more than I can tell you that so many people have read her story. You have helped my heart. And I cannot thank you enough.

A letter to my son,"You came home this weekend, visiting from college. We’d texted asking what we could get at the store for you, and you’d replied Chicken in a Biscuit crackers and peaches. I bought a few more things because that’s what moms do. There were yogurts in the fridge, along with milk. Crispex, your favorite cereal. Some fruit roll ups. I forgot to tell you about the chocolate pie.

&#x200B;

We had friends over for board games Saturday. They hadn’t met you yet. I happily told them about how you were doing in school, and your pride in your luxurious and lengthy locks. About how you’d told me your hair was softer than mine. I had made peanut butter fingers for dessert, and told them how I’d send the rest of them back to college with you. I thought you were out visiting your friends, but then you got up from a nap, and came in to say hi, and meet our friends for the first time. We smiled and introduced you. I’m glad they met you.

&#x200B;

You didn’t stay for dinner. You were snowed in last weekend when you came down to visit, and had a lot of friends you wanted to hang out with this weekend. I said something, I don’t remember. Was it “cya!” or “have fun!”? I almost told you to text if you’d be out late, but you’re 18, so I was trying to treat you like a grown up. You took the car out.

&#x200B;

You struggled the first quarter, last quarter. You failed the first math midterm, since your high school teachers had left you woefully unprepared. Your math teacher had a policy though, where you could get the grade in the class of either your midterms, or of your final. You decided to learn everything you should have in high school, then started relearning everything in the book from the start. You pulled off a great grade. I was so proud of you. You bragged about being a mother fucking prodigy in your CS class (you were too old to be a prodigy at 18, but I let that slide), but I was so much more proud of what you accomplished in math than of how you did in CS.

&#x200B;

You struggled with some other things too. Things you opened up about. Some addictions, anxiety, depression. After your friend killed himself last summer, you got your first tattoo. It was a semicolon with a heart at the top of it. Mental health awareness. You got it huge- most semicolon tattoos are tiny little things, but yours was a good three inches or more. You took my advice and had it done by a professional, rather than your friend with the tattoo gun, even though you had to wait a few more weeks. You had it before you left for college.

&#x200B;

After your friend died, we made appointments with a counselor. You told me you liked her, and that she was helping. She hadn’t been taking new clients, but made an exception for you. At first I drove you to the appointments, and waited in the room outside. Then you started driving yourself to them. You started seeing someone else up at college, and they gave you the medicine you needed, and we had our first bipolar diagnosis. I warned you that it can take a while and multiple tries to find the right medication.

&#x200B;

I gave you advice a lot. And I worried a lot. I told you it was my prerogative as a mom to do both. You were planning on moving out from the dorms, and I had started searching for some dump crockpot recipes to help you feed yourself. We had always talked about having me give you cooking lessons, but hadn’t yet found the time. You told me about the duplex you would rent, but never sent the link. My sister and I started filling it with imaginary furniture anyway. You’d need a bed, a dresser, a couch. Maybe, we didn’t know if it would be furnished. You knew I worried, and once you joked that I always expected the worst things to happen. About defensive driving because of other drivers on the road. About providing your own condoms instead of using ones girls provided.

&#x200B;

I didn’t worry about guns. You had promised me you would tell me if you ever felt like ending it. You told me how mad you were your friend killed himself. How mad you were he acted like everything was fine, how he said he was grabbing his headphones from the car, but instead drove off.

&#x200B;

You won’t read this note. It’s Monday. I saw you last on Saturday, going to visit your friends. According to your best friend, you had a great time. You told her your usual goodbye “te amo” and left to come back home. She said you even drove parallel to each other before taking your usual turn off. But instead you went to the beach. I went there for the first time 2am Sunday. You’d sent her a suicide note. She called the police and had her sister drive you to our house. You wouldn’t answer your phone, but she had the find my friend with your location.

&#x200B;

I got to the beach, but we weren’t allowed to leave the car. It was cold out, but that wasn’t why I was shivering. Your friend was crying, but your father and I were just holding hands. I knew it was bad when the officer asked for the back window to be rolled down. It was to talk to us first. I couldn’t find the button, someone else rolled it down.

&#x200B;

I miss you. So so much. I have the leftover peanut butter fingers, and that chocolate pie I hadn’t told you about. Those are only two of the many things around the house telling me about how I’ll never see you again. There will be more. I had ordered some stress reliever toys from ebay. I didn’t know if they’d make it in time for your care package this month, or if it would be next quarter. I ran out of time first quarter and used a preassembled amazon snack pack for first quarter care package, and I wanted to do a better job this time. Your best friend told me you had liked it.

&#x200B;

I didn’t sleep yesterday. I took a benadryl last night, and woke up this morning feeling almost human. Until I remembered. I’ve already started on the Kleenex. There will be more family visiting today. They keep asking if they can do anything. There are no words I need, no tasks I need done. I don’t know what to do. I can’t take back any of my previous actions, my previous words. I can try and help your father know he was a good dad, the best. You won’t get my future words. I never told you I was considering writing you a manual for how to live life. A little presumptuous I know, I never had it all figured out either. But, here’s a letter. I love you. I tried to tell you every time I dropped you off, even in college. I love you kid.

&#x200B;

Edit: I can't tell you how much it has meant to read these replies. Thank you. Thank you. I may reply to more, but here's what I really wanted to say right now.

Nobody came to my son's party last night WTF,"So, yesterday my son turned 10. Awesome, he loves avengers so his dad &amp; I decide to throw him a party at the house. We invited family and friends who most of them RSVP'd. Great, we make enough food to feed 40+ people. The place looks awesome, avengers decorations everywhere, ballons, cupcakes, the whole nine yards. Only to have me &amp; my husband's immediate family be the only ones present. I'm talking 6 people max. Not another single kid at the birthday party. It broke my heart. My son kept looking out the window &amp; door for guests, asking when his friends will get here, but nobody ever came. I have a bag full of goodybags, a piñata still in tact, &amp; unopened games. People suck! Sucks we have a small family &amp; made my son feel like a loner on his freaking birthday!! He's a great kid &amp; has been looking forward to his birthday all year. But come on, how are you going to RSVP &amp; not come to a freaking kid's birthday party. 



UPDATE: Just wanted to give everyone a mini update. Omg I am overwhelmed by the Love &amp; wishes from the Reddit community, You guys are awesome!! I apologize if I wasn't able to respond to you individually but wow I came to this subreddit to vent &amp; all I got was a vast amount of support! You guys managed to make me cry again, hearing my son is not the only one &amp; there are many others who had similar experiences. I know it's just a birthday party but I try to do everything to see my son happy so when something like this happens I do feel helpless, it truly broke my heart. But you guys are willing to go above &amp; beyond &amp; make my little man's day special THANK YOU SO MUCH! You don't understand how much you are going to make some little kid's birthday the most memorable one by receiving cards from all around the world!! I know there are a lot of people who have asked, we are in Boston, MASS &amp; Monday morning I will go first thing to get a PO Box as I do not have one. His favorite characters are Iron Man &amp; Captain America. Thank you everybody. Will keep you updated. 




UPDATE: I promise I haven't been ignoring you guys. My husband &amp; I spent the whole day yesterday with my son to lift his spirits, so I haven't had a chance to reply to most of you but will try to today. So I finally got a PO Box, thank you to all those who have made cards for my son. The amount of support is just unreal, me &amp; my husband can't thank you enough. 



God bless you guys, honestly I can't thank you enough. I'm way too excited for him. We will explain to my son what is Reddit today when he gets home from school &amp; scroll through some comments. But we will leave the cards as a surprise. 


FINAL UPDATE: 
Hi all! So I did try posting an update, &amp; it got deleted. So I'm posting it here. So to update you all on whats going on. We were finally able to go the post office, and I was in tears! You guys really outdid yourselves. Abe got so many cards &amp; packages. It was unreal. We are deeply moved by the love &amp; support you all have for a random little boy. That in itself speaks volumes. We sat down yesterday with Abe &amp; read 
every single card. My son loved everythingg! He is so excited to have cards from all over the world, awesome comic books, &amp; toys. His mood has definitely changed, he's so much happier. &amp; This will definitely rewrite the bad birthday party he had. And we simply cannot thank you all enough for what you have done for me &amp; my family. This has turned out to be one of his best birthdays ever. &amp; it's all thanks to you Reddit! &lt;3

My girlfriend washed my hair today,"It felt so good. We don't normally shower together, but today we did, nothing sexual happened or anything but I just feel so on cloud nine right now.

When I reached for the shampoo she said ""wait,"" and  grabbed it herself and started running it through my hair, lathering it over my scalp and massaging my head. I swear it felt so good I just shut my eyes and felt like I was floating. Then she took the soap and started sudsing me up, and used her body to spread it all over me, and rinsed me clean, using her hands to splash me and running her fingers through my hair and spending like a good five minutes just rinsing my hair and kissing my back and chest. It was almost surreal.

I just feel so incredibly loved right now, I almost got overwhelmed and started crying from being so happy while she was doing it. I've never had a girlfriend be so gentle and make me feel like this, I've always been with people who were very cold and I'm not used to this feeling. And I've got no one I can really express things like this to. Which, when I think of it, is really pretty screwed up.

I love her so much.

&#x200B;

EDIT: Wow, thank you for the gold and silver, kind strangers! I had no idea this would blow up, but I guess it speaks to a lot of people. I'll be sure to do my best to reciprocate the intimacy, and I wish you all the same feelings I got. 

Take care of each other"
I found my wife's body in the closet yesterday,"Pretty self explanatory. I'd left for work at 9 the night before, got off early since it was my weekend, and went upstairs to find she'd hung herself from our closet door. She suffered from mental health issues most of her life and I guess I knew this might happen one day, but I didn't think it would be yesterday.

The police came and went. ""We're sorry for your loss."" 

Some friends came and picked me up, I'll be staying in the guest room for a bit I guess. My family came to pick up my son, he'll be 3 in April. My sister in law is going to look after him so at least he'll have his cousins to play with him. I had to comfort her mother, who blames herself. I had to call my job to tell them I needed some time. I had to call estranged friends, having them disseminate to others I couldn't reach. Got drunk. Took an Ambien. Slept. Went to the carwash with a friend. Stayed there until 3am. Watched Space Jam when I got back. Talked to my dead wife in the rain. 

It's been a rollercoaster of tears and laughter and silence and I have so my questions that can wait.

 The weirdest thing is though, I'm feeling intensely aroused and I'm having trouble falling asleep. Normally I masturbate to help myself drift off and believe me, I want to. But I don't think I can. Looking at porn seems... disrespectful? And I can't close my eyes without seeing her so... Here I am. Wide awake. Spilling my guts into the void.

Yesterday was the worst day of my life, and I'm worried about masturbation. God help me.

Edit: Just wanted to say how grateful I am for everyone who reached out this morning. I want to say so much more, but everything I type looks wrong. My son and I will be okay. My wife is no more pain. I have the most wonderful group of people sitting in this room with me now. I'm not angry. Not with my wife anyhow. I'm angry with her disease, but I couldn't have asked the girl I married to go on hurting anymore. 

If you or someone you know is suffering from mental health problems, let someone know. Let someone try. Fight like hell. Kiss your wife when you leave for work."
I just went on a date with a guy who tried to rob me.,"I can't possibly tell anyone I know about this story, so here it goes:

Two years ago, I returned home from my father's funeral. As soon as I opened the door to my apartment, a guy holding a crowbar came out from my kitchen holding my TV. I live in the city, so robberies are common. 

The guy began shouting at me and he clumsily dropped my TV and began holding the crowbar like it was a baseball bat. I was so stunned at what was happening that I didn't move. 

The guy screamed at me to empty my pockets. From the stress of the last few days with my father passing away, I simply started crying. Not out of fear at what was happening, but because this was literally the worst time of my life. The worst moment. The worst minute and second. 

While crying hysterically, I gave the guy my wallet. I just sat on my floor and hugged my knees and told him, through my tears, to ""take whatever you want."" He hesitated, looked down at me. He dropped my wallet and sat down beside me. Immediately, he began to comfort me. He began to apologize. He put my TV back on the table and told me it wasn't damaged. He told me that he lost his job and that his mom needed medicine that he couldn't afford and that they were homeless. 

He told me all of this while I just wailed; I cried for my father, who was lost, I cried for my future, for it was uncertain, and I cried because my home had been intruded on in the most violent way. 

For a good 10 minutes I sat in the floor with a guy who had every intent to rob me, telling me that it would be okay and that he was sorry. He begged me not to call the police. I just started screaming at him to get out. 

He ran away so fast that he left the crowbar. I threw it after him as he ran down the street. 

Two days later, I came home from work and he was sitting in front of my door. I was so terrified that I pulled out my phone, but he had this look on his face of--I'm not sure how to describe it--remorse, regret? He told me that he told his mom what he did, and his mom made me some soup. He handed me this tiny bowl wrapped in tin foil. Again, I was stunned and overwhelmed and angry that I slapped the bowl out of his hands and it shattered on the floor. I told him to leave or I was calling the police. He left. I remember he looked upset. I left the soup and shattered bowl outside my door, almost as a warning for him to not come back. 

About three months after that, I got a note in my mail slot from the guy. He told me his mother had passed away and that he was no longer homeless and that he had a job. He wanted to repay me for breaking into my apartment. He wrote down his address and told me that I was welcome to break into his place if I wanted, but he didn't have much stuff. 

This all overwhelmed me. I threw away the letter, but I remembered his address. I remember walking by there one day, out of curiosity. It was a ratty apartment building across the city. He was walking up to his room and he saw me. He waved. I turned away and left. He ran after me, apologized again. Told me that he never meant to do what he did. He showed me the program from his mother's funeral that he kept in his wallet. He wasn't lying, she was real. He was real. He was a real person. 

I don't know what it was, but I believed him. We slowly began to grow together as people? I can't describe it. 

After a year of maintaining communication and learning about who he was, he enrolled in a local community college and began taking courses to earn credits before applying to university. I helped him study for his history class a lot. He's great at math and science, though. 

I never invited him over to my apartment, however. No matter how much I got to know him, I was still afraid of him. And he knew that. He knew that I couldn't trust him. 

But tonight, we went out for coffee because he said he had an exam in his world civ class. When I got there, he said he forgot his book. We just talked for a bit, we laughed, and then he told me he wanted to cook for me. On a whim, I decided to invite him to my apartment. After picking up some things from the grocery store, he came over. I was so nervous that I was shaking. He noticed, he squeezed my hand, and then he made dinner. 

It was amazing. We talked, we laughed, we sat in the floor and watched a movie on the TV he tried to steal. We made jokes about it. 

And then he told me that he missed his mom. I gave him a hug. Then he left. 

I don't know what I feel, but I do know that I can't give up on people anymore.

Some people just have the shit end of life. Maybe things have a way of working themselves out?  

And I miss my dad, too. 

**EDIT/UPDATE** I am...beside myself to log on this morning and see this at the top of this page. I have been a redditor for a few years, but never thought this would happen. Also, to those of you who are messaging/commenting to confirm the validity of this--I guess it never occurred to me when I wrote this that it sounded so... ridiculous? It really does, I don't blame you for saying it's false, but it's real. He's real. I'm real. It all happened/is happening currently. Thank you all who have messaged me and commented! And thank you to the two people that gave me gold--this is just insane to me. I'm so grateful, so very grateful.

**EDIT 2** Sorry for neglecting this; today has been insane with work and hosting a friend's bridal shower. I want to clarify a few things about this, because I am getting a *LOT* of messages about a lot of different things. 

* People are saying that I am being too ""trusting"" of him after what happened. You're right, I suppose. I mean, I live in the heart of one of the most dangerous cities. My friend was robbed just a few years ago and was actually physically injured as a result of it, so me ""trusting"" him did not constitute me giving him a hug after he broke in. It was much, much more than that. 

* My dad died of a brain aneurysm in March 2013. He passed away peacefully in his sleep. The thing about my dad, though, was that he was the most generous, most kindest man in this world. I know people like to say that about their parents, but it's true about my dad. When I was 4, I remember him giving these guys a ride from prison--they were released after serving their sentence, but had to walk to get to where they were going. My dad picked them up, had them hop in the back of his pick-up truck, and took them home. He put his life, and basically mine, at the hands of these people who could have hurt us. They didn't, thank God. My dad taught me to be selfless and understanding of the world, and of people, and I loved him for that. But when I lost him, it shattered me and turned me into an entirely different person. 

* After my dad died, I became severely depressed and angry. I was angry at everything. I had to take a leave from my job (I teach second grade). All day, I would lay in bed and think about how much I hated God--or whatever higher power--for taking my dad away. Nothing seemed worth it. After the guy--my *friend*--broke into my apartment, I hated him for a while. I hated my dad for making me so trusting (because I didn't call the cops on the guy). I hated my dad for dying, I hated him for being so incredibly compassionate and better than me. I hated myself for being vulnerable. I just hated everything. 

* The guy who tried to rob me is a person. And of course, I constantly ask myself when I'm with him, ""What happens if he tries to hurt me? Or rob me again?"" But the thing about him is that--he *knows* I'm thinking this, and he constantly tries to reassure me. We have grown together as people, as I said. There's a whole two years that I didn't post in this recounting because it would be like a novel-length post. Do I ""like"" him? I don't think so. I don't think he ""likes"" me. I think we both understand, respect and honor the other for our mutual struggles. We're proud of each other, and we're both guilty of things. Me for shutting out my friends, family and students and becoming an awful person after I lost my dad, and him for going to incredible lengths to try and save his mother from experiencing incredible agony in her final moments. 

* I intend to show him this post. I want him to know. He doesn't have a computer or internet, but I think he'll find this humorous. His story is not mine to tell; how his mother died is not my story to tell; what exactly drove him to pry open my front door with a crowbar is not for me to tell; what happened to his family is not for me to tell. But what is for me to tell is that he is a human; he is flawed; God, he's so flawed. But after knowing him, and learning about his life--about his childhood and the tiny little child who used to be so passionate about school and learning as he was, as he told me, I know that he has his story. I have my story. You have yours.  

* And although I think it is irrelevant, the thought of even dating after the last few years hasn't crossed my mind. Was I involved in relationships prior to my dad's passing? Yes. One was long-term and had a foreseeable end with an engagement, but things happen. Life happens. 

I'm meeting with him tomorrow at his work, while he's on break, to give him some old study materials that I have from a literature class I took in college. It's all so normal, and I'm not afraid. My dad was never afraid, so I shouldn't have to be. I choose not to be. "
"My Father, Filmmaker Rob Cohen, is a Rapist and Child Molester","My name is Valkyrie Weather, born Kyle Cohen, the oldest child and trans daughter of film producer/director Rob Cohen (The fast and the Furious, xXx, and The Hurricane Heist among many others). When I was very young, Rob used my body for his own sexual gratification. My mother witnessed one of the assaults when I was between two and two and a half years old, and has since confirmed what she saw. This fact has cost me more than I could ever convey here. Rob has also raped at least one other woman, in her sleep. I know this because he would occasionally tell the story as an anecdote.  Presumably in an effort to turn me into the straight son that he wanted me to be, Rob took me to see sex workers and establishments in Thailand and The Czech Republic starting when I was as young as 13/14 years old. Through therapy and support from loved ones, I no longer feel that I owe this man any loyalty. And thanks to the #metoo movement, I have found the will to speak out. While Rob will in all likelihood escape criminal justice, I demand that my story be heard. I am not seeking financial restitution, nor do I have a career to promote. My greatest hope is that others who have been hurt by Rob Cohen feel that they are able to come forward as well.


EDIT: Thank you for the silver and gold, it's truly humbling. However, instead of giving me more please send a donation to Trans Lifeline or the Joyful Heart Foundation. Thank you again. "
I was raped by a woman and it ruined my life,"I expect this will get downvoted into oblivion but I want to share this, and for the last time. Being open about my experience has caused me nothing but pain and loss.

I'm a father and recently divorced, dating again... or was. After a failed loveless marriage was clearly dead end, I took steps to lose weight and get healthy. My love life prior had been sparse and I dated what I could get, including a short empty marriage and a the aforementioned loveless one. I was not longer morbidly obese and for the first time seen as genuinely attractive by a lot of women.

A small piece of background detail, I was physically abused as a child viciously. Yeah, I know a lot of people were. I was also molested by my mother, a very toxic and damaged person. This is also something I won't be sharing again either as most have attacked me over their need to never believe a mother could do such a thing. Obviously, my ability to feel trust and comfortable around women was damaged. This becomes key later.

I dated a lot of women, even went to therapy again. I had a couple short term relationships, and had finally reached a point when I was truly able to open my heart, trust and love freely. I felt strong and secure. 

Then I met her.

We had amazing chemistry from the start and kissing her was amazing on our second date. The third date was fun too, and we fooled around a little, but something felt off so not much more. We made plans to meet the next night.

I came over and we talked. I opened up about some of my past issues, hoping that being completely open would ease my own last lingering doubts. She became cold, and tore me apart, emotionally, emasculating and humiliating me until I was to the point of tears. I never felt so small and worthless in my life. 

She then climbed on top of me and raped me. I did not consent to it. I said no. She didn't care, I was a piece of meat to her. My body betrayed me and responded, but I was dying inside, repulsed and violated. Afterwards, she was done with me, and I left. I vomited outside of her apartment, went home. I cried that whole night and didn't sleep until dawn.

I reached out to friends, but was thought to be lying, or a loser. A couple of female friends became furious with me as they had really been raped, but men can't be. Obviously I was unstable as why hadn't I enjoyed it? One by one I watched most of my relationships crumble or be damaged. Last night, my best friend and I parted ways. Things haven't been the same since that happened to me, after all I was supposed to be the strong friend she replied on.

Men aren't allowed to be raped or molested and talk about it. We are laughed at and derided. Just stop being a wimp and get over it.

I'm writing this because I'm tired of having to explain myself anymore, having to validate that it really happened to me. I'm tired of the jokes, the loss of respect. I don't date anymore, as I see every woman as another possible predator. I'm also tired of trembling when I hug a new woman for the first time.

It's time to bury this all down deep, along with the heart I feel I can no longer share. I'm just damaged goods now.

EDIT: I really didn't expect anyone to read this. Thank you for the very positive (mostly) responses and messages. Thank you so much for the gold and silver.

I am in therapy and ""doing the work"". I'm just not going to share this with others. What my mother did was something neither wife could accept, and judging on some comments here and some ""lovely"" PMs, many can't understand how what happened to to me was possible a few months back.

I looked into prosecution, but despite living in a liberal state, I live in a conservative town, and they would do nothing. She also has a friend on the force. Getting ridiculed by the police isn't going to help me.

I do have an ex girlfriend that is there for me. She is literally the only woman that I can be touched by. She knows and is supportive. It helps on the rare occasions our schedules cooperate. We aren't compatible as partners, but being held sometimes by someone I do trust really helps.

I'm just going it one day at a time, putting on the fake smile and living as best as I can. I'm working to be able to trust again, but it will be a long time.

EDIT 2: I am overwhelmed. My whole life has been rejection and pain, to pull myself up and get knocked down again by this event I wrote about. Thank for the platinum, golds and silvers. Thank you for seeing me. Thank you each and every one of you. I don't feel brave, just honest. Over 5000 people see me, and hundreds have reached out.

Thank you doesn't even cover it. The world feels a little less cold today.

FINAL EDIT (2019-02-19): Thank you for all the support. I wrote this post to just put it out there one last time, and then pretend it never happened and try to move on. I am pleased that it meant so much to so many people, and so many reached out. I'm going to do my best to heal from this and move on in a positive way. I never thought more that 7500 people would care, as I didn't think anyone would, or even see my post.

To answer a couple last questions in comments.

I did freeze, which is why I didn't throw her off. In the back of my head I still had the notion of not wanting to hurt a woman. Obviously, I would have acted differently if I realized what was happening. I was raped. I don't really care if you believe it, but it happened.

Also, to the ugly and hateful comments that have started appearing in my inbox. I couldn't care less about karma or attention. I didn't do this for that. I did that to cry out one last time and then remain silent. I didn't expect this response and it's given me a sense of validation I never expected. I'm sorry that a few of you want me to kill myself and delete this post. I'm sorry that a few of you call me insulting and degrading terms. I have given out all the Reddit coins to people who posted elsewhere for people like me. I'm not letting you bring me down, nor am I deleting this post. I want what I went through to be known for the next guy that has the same thing happen, and all of the wonderful, supportive and even loving comments I received to be shared.

To prove I don't care about my karma, I'm deleting my account, to silence those ugly, cowardly voices that lurk in hateful private messages.

Thank you again, to the vast majority of you. I will never forget how whole and seen you helped a broken man feel."
"My brother and I are adults and we still have our own ""secret Christmas"" in his bedroom every Christmas morning.","I just had to tell someone because this is so fucking cute and nobody cares.

My brother and I are several years apart.  Growing up, we would wake up on Christmas morning before our parents and eagerly lie awake in bed waiting for it to be ""okay"" for us to come downstairs for presents.  So at one point we remedied this by giving each other our presents for one another as soon as we woke up (usually at like 7 AM) so we could enjoy Christmas early.  We started doing this at like elementary school age.

I am thirty years old and super excited for my Early Christmas with my brother.  Last time we did it, my husband stayed in bed while my brother and I exchanged gifts like little kids at 7 AM.

I hope that we both live long lives and continue to do this when we're 80.  It's so cute and makes me cry just thinking about it because it's so adorable.  (also I have my period rn so everything makes me cry)"
Today I am 365 days self harm free. Merry Christmas everyone.,"Take your mental health one day at a time

Edit: holy smokes! Thank you everyone for your kind words. I’m always blown away by the support I get from reddit. I have read every single comment. Thank you for the outpouring of love and support everyone ☺️"
Gillette commercial ad,"What the fuck.  So I've (21M) been hearing a lot of things about the ""controversial"" gillette ad these past few days.  I usually don't pay attention to this kind of thing but the video popped up while I was browsing youtube.  1.1 million dislikes over ~600 K likes.  Now seeing this I thought to myself ""wow, how controversial can an ad get to have more dislikes than likes?"".  So naturally I watched the thing.

It's a video telling you to behave like a decent fucking human being.  Why the fuck are people so mad about this?  If you're mad over this fucking ad, that tells me a lot about your shit personality.  If this ad personally offended you, I can tell what kind fucked up shit you probably did to your peers.  There is NOTHING controversial about this.  In the video there's a father stopping a child from getting bullied.  There's a man stopping his friend from cat-calling a woman.  There's a man de-escalating a situation.  

The only people that would find this controversial are the misogynistic neck beards that are going to have to ""find"" another razor company to tame their filthy facial fecal hairs due to all the bullshit they're sprouting.

So Gillette, as a college male I still find your razors pretty over-priced, but I really hope you don't apologize for that ad, because I think it was great fucking message.

*Note: sorry for all the swearing"
My son called me “Mom” today,"My son is four and has autism. For the most part, he’s nonverbal. In therapy for the last week or so they’ve been working on “mom” and “dad”  with him, by showing him photographs of myself and my husband. 


This evening when I went to go pick him up, his therapist brought him out to the truck. She pointed to me and asked him “Who’s that?” He enthusiastically replied “Mom!” It’s the first time I’ve ever heard him say it. 


I beat myself up a lot of days and always wonder if I’m doing the right things for him. Small victories like today make me feel a bit better. 


Edit: Thank you for the gold


Edit 2: Thank you for the platinum!"
My 17 year old brother still talks about (from time to time) about a compliment a girl in his class gave him. It’s been 3 months...,"3 months ago I was laying in the bed that was once mine at my parents house when my brother barges in, sits down at the foot of my bed. I dont spend much time around my parents house, nor do I see him very often. But as soon as he walked in I was able to tell by the glow in his confidence and the smile on his face that he was extremely happy. 

My brother is a handsome boi, he has a good social life and has girlfriends in the past. 

So, naturally I asked him what was up, asked what he wanted? 

He smiled, and asked, “What do you think about my smile?” I shrugged and told him that I thought it was  fine. “Well” he said, with a smirk, “This cute girl in my class told me that she thought I had a very attractive smile!” 
I didn’t really understand why he was so excited..... (really I’m not trying to brag in this next sentence) I thought to myself “big whoop, I get complimented fairly regularly.”

That got me thinking a little bit.

Later that night I knocked on his bedroom door. “Charlie?” I asked “when was the last time you were complimented besides today and from a family member?”
There was a little bit of a hesitant pause, but then he admitted that he couldn’t even remember the last time he was complimented by someone other than our mother or aunt! 
This got me thinking a little bit more, so I asked my male cousins, my male friends etc etc the same question. Most of the responses I got were the same, “I dont know” or “ I cant remember”.

Still today, every now and then, he talks about how that girl in his one of his classes complimented him on his smile, and it melts my heart how happy that has made him and how much it boosted his confidence.


Since then, and after seeing how happy it has made my little brother, I’ve made it my mission to compliment at least 4 guys a day. Whether its on their shoes, their smile, their shirt, their haircut or eyes. 
Yes, this has gotten me in some awkward situations where they think I’m hitting on them, but most of the time I see them taken back a little with a smile on their face.  

I think we, as women, take compliments for granted, as it happens to us on a daily basis!!
The message I want to send to people in this post is to just throw a compliment out there from time to time to a guy! It absolutely takes next to zero effort for you, but it may make a HUGE impact on their day, their week, or month! 


Thank you for coming to my TED talk."
I just got promoted at work and I can't tell anyone in my family because they'll sneer at me. But I'm so proud of myself.,"I grew up in severe poverty, with a side of domestic violence. I worked hard and now I have my Masters and a good job. I'm 24 and I've only been at my job for 6.5 months. Today, I found out that I'm being given an important position on my team, bypassing more senior coworkers, because I am efficient and very good at what I do.

My family kind of glorifies their poverty. They see themselves as tough survivors. They aren't proud of what I've achieved. In their eyes, I've betrayed my past. I'm forgetting where I come from.

But I haven't forgotten. I got out, but I'll never forget. And I'm so fucking proud of myself. I did it. I make good money and I enjoy what I do.

To add another layer of feelings, my ex dumped me about a week and a half ago. He told me that my family issues are too much. My childhood trauma has, of course, affected me as an adult. I'm dealing with it, but he didn't like that I'd talk about it. He didn't like how I chose to deal with it. So now I can't even tell him, my best friend, about my promotion.

But fuck it. I did it. I *finally* feel like I made it out. And my family didn't help me. I did it on my own.

Edit: Thanks for the outpouring of positivity, everyone! I'm so happy that I've managed to officially defy my family's dream of me settling down and being a stay at home mom, like every other woman in my family. The  support from y'all means a lot. "
I'm turning 90 in October and I'm truly and earnestly terrified to die.,"I'm not ready. I don't want to die. I feel like i'm the only person my age that wants to live. I have my health, my independence and am in great shape. All my elderly friends are all prepared to die. They say once you hit 90 it's anyday....anyday. I like seeing my great grand-kids, I like drinking, I like being retired and doing whatever I fucking want. I want to spend the next decade living life to the fullest. I've only just retired recently after working myself to death for 89 years. 

I think about it constant. Every ache, ever pain I feel is this going to kill me? I fear everyday I'll die in a Hospital in a vegetative state shitting my self or worse live as a senile old man. I want to die as a Man should, free. But, most importantly i want to live long. I want to see my great great grandkids, I want to see the future. I love living in this day and age. I've always been tech savvy and theres so much going on it's truly exciting. 

Nobody understands my desire to live. People just assume once you get old you're ready but, it's not true. Death is final, death is scary. "
"I fucking love people who encourage you to take your time when you're doing something difficult, new, or uncomfortable.","The phrase ""take your time"" is one of the most instantly reassuring and motivating things I've ever heard in my life. It's so simple, but so beautiful; it instantly removes any expectation that you're supposed to know what the fuck you're doing. And it tells you that the person watching you trusts you and sees your struggle for what it is: natural. 

So thank you, people who say that. The world is better with you in it."
My fiance committed suicide and I can't bring myself to tell our loved ones how everything went down so I'm posting it here.,"In May of 2018 my fiance committed suicide. We were together ten years and over the last month or so of his life I had noticed a change in his behavior. He had become more aggressive and hadn't been sleeping very well. I combined the two and figured he was just grumpy from not sleeping. His aggression wasn't physical, he would just pick fights and get extremely drunk like 6 nights a week.

My final straw was one night he came home 5 hours late from work in a complete blackout and screamed at our dog for no reason. He loved our dog and thought he could do no wrong and let him get away with everything so this was way out of the ordinary. The next day when he was sober I talked to him and basically just told him the drinking had to stop because it was affecting his personality, his health, and our relationship. We had a long and, I thought, productive talk. He agreed to stop drinking and he did for about a week.

The day he died he came home early from work, which I thought was strange, and he told me he was going to a coworkers birthday party and he'd be drinking. He didn't even pretend I was invited to come along knowing this particular coworker and I weren't the best of friends. I was irritated and kind of flew off the handle about him drinking again, he took the whole fight as me being pissed he was going out without me. Which was not the case.

I told him I wasn't going to sit around and wait for him to come home hammered, that I was going to go out with my friends and I'd see him later, but I was still pissed. Before he left he kissed my forehead and said ""I love you."" I replied ""Uh huh."" I'll regret that for the rest of my life as it was the last time I saw him alive.

I texted him throughout the afternoon, apologizing for having an attitude and said I hoped he was having a good time and getting to relax with his friends. He never responded. Finally at about 1130 I called him and didn't get answer. I called a few more times and finally he picked up. 

I asked him where he was, he said he was at home. I asked him why he hadn't responded to me all day, again annoyed, and all he said was ""I'm at home"". I told him I'd be home in an hour or two and he hung up. When I got off the phone it occurred to me he sounded sober, which I thought was strange considering he was at a party all day and he's never said no to offered booze in his life.

I texted him and asked him if he was going to be up for a bit. His response was ""why did you drink all my beer?"" Which I didn't and I told him so. He responded ""nvm idc"". That was the last thing he ever said to me.

I came home about 2 hours later and he had hanged himself. I couldn't get all the way in the door because his body was blocking it. I was able to get my head in and the first thing I saw was our dog cowering in the corner at the end of the hallway. I turned my head to the right and saw his feet, and then his face. The image of the love of my life, hanged, will never leave me. Ever. 

I shut the door and stood there for what felt like hours but probably wasn't more than 30 seconds. I called 911 and it seemed like before I could give all the information needed the police were there. A nice officer stood outside with me and gave me water. Another officer came down as the medical examiner pulled up and asked me for my dogs name because he had to bring the dog down since he wouldn't let them near the body. 

Even though I saw my fiance, and the officer said ""body"" and I saw the medical examiner my brain still thought he'd be ok. It wasn't until I was sitting on the bench outside our apartments, holding my dog, and saw the flash from the ME's camera taking pictures of my fiance bouncing off the building across the street that it hit me. That's another image that will never leave me. I looked at the officer that was with me and asked if it was really happening. He nodded sadly and my whole existence exploded. My brain shattered into a billion pieces and I sobbed.

While the officer comforted me the ME came out and explained to me that they were bringing his body out now. She recommended I take the dog on a walk around the block so I didn't have to see it.

I turned my back and walked about 5 feet before I heard the stretcher come out. I froze. I didn't turn around, I just stood there holding my dog. When I heard the van door close its like my brain instantly pulled as many pieces as it could back together. I turned around and the ME asked me for a lot of information, which I gave cooly and calmly. I then asked her if I was supposed to notify his parents. She said someone from her office could do it but if I felt I could inform them it was always best coming from a loved one. 

I called a friend who came and picked me up. I sat on her couch in a daze for about 20 minutes. Then I called my mom. At this point I think shock set in. I was very monotone. I told her what happened and she lost it. I told her calmly I had to let her go because I had to call his parents. It was about 430 am at this point so I had to call repeatedly to wake them up. Obviously they were hysterical and I just kept apologizing over and over in a flat monotone voice. His mom asked me where I was and if I needed her to come get me. I told her I was with a friend and I didn't know what I needed right then. 

We hung up so she could call his sister and that's when I shattered again. I lost my entire mind in my friends kitchen.

I went home again to try to sleep but it was nothing but nightmares. For the next 4 months I slept little and ate less. My mind exploded, pulled itself back together, and exploded again over and over and over, intimately rearranging who I was as a person each time. 

9 months later and I've stabilized for the most part. I'm still in the apartment, which became a museum to him for months after his death, but I'm working on putting his stuff away and moving out and moving on with my life. It's not easy. Today I found an old hat he had lost years ago wedged way down in his chair and sobbed for about an hour before angrily throwing it away. That's what made me decide to post here, with the hope that just getting it out there will heal me further.

I know leaving the home I shared with the love of my life for ten years will be a new trauma I have to endure, and I can't find hope or happiness right now but I still have curiosity about what's next for me and who I will become when the dust has settled in my heart and I get used to the hole he left.


Edit: I wanted to edit this to address some of the comments from people talking about their own suicidal thoughts. I want it to be known I am not angry with him. I was, but I've come to realize that he didn't mean to hurt me or anyone else. He genuinely thought our lives would be better without him. He was incredibly wrong. His thought process and his inability to ask for the help he needed, through no fault of his own, leveled many people. For my part what breaks my heart the most is actually the good things that have happened since he left. Those good things break me more than that one night because he isnt around to experience them with me. We spread his ashes where he used to camp with his family when he was little. The area is beautiful and he and I never went. He didn't get to see the look of awe on my face at the mountains and rivers we saw. He didn't get to hold my hand next to one of the most beautiful scenic spots imaginable. Knowing that I will have beautiful moments in my life but cannot share them with him is heartbreaking on an indescribable scale. 

The people around you love you, and want you around. You make their lives better. The problem with addiction and depression is that they are twin liars who convince you of all the negative things you think about yourself. Don't listen to them. There's always something new coming, always a new chance to thrive.

Edit 2: u/spectralhues pointed something out and I want it to be visible as well. If you or someone you know is struggling with alcoholism do not attempt to quit cold turkey. The withdrawls can kill you. My fiance struggled with alcohol abuse throughout his life and our relationship. While I know for a fact he was able to go a day or two he could have, and probably did, lie to me about consuming alcohol when I was not around. If you feel you have this issue I encourage you to seek professional, supervised help. Again, do not try to quit cold turkey.

After what he did I am going to marry this man even if I have to ask,"3 nights ago a human being changed my world forever. This is a little long but please read it's heartwarming. His name is Shane and I can't believe I found him. We've been dating for about 4 months now and every day seems to be better then the last. From his sense of humor, to his amazing interests to his warm smile he's wonderful and quite sexy IMO lol.But it wasn't until 3 nights ago that I realized how in love with him I am because of a single act of kindness. 

We were having date night and he's trying to suprise me with a salsa class. He heard me say on our first date I always found dancing amazing and wanted to be a ballet dancer when I was young but I never got the chance. Now at 29 I figure salsa or something would be more fun. So he decided to sign us up and we would begin classes. On our walk we were about to get on the subway until it happened.

Now another thing I love is Shane listens so well and really gives a crap and after 4 months most guys would stop fully trying especially after some sexy time but not him. Anyway I was talking and I kept noticing he was looking over at someone not listening. Finally he said I'm sorry babe can u give me a second I need to check something.

He walks over to a young girl maybe 19-20 years old who was crying on a bench in the subway. I didn't hear him at first but I could see in his body language he was trying to calm her and help as 100 other people walked by and I would of done the same. As I approached I realized she was homeless for some time and all she had was a single bag. She said to him all I want to do is go home. He asked where she lived and it wasnt even in the city. She'd broken up with her BF who was gone and I am sure she was on drugs at some point but she also looked down on her luck. Either way she was I need and looked scared.

So in this moment many would either hand some money over or wish her luck or maybe let her make a call. Shane did much more. He pulls me aside looks me right in the eyes and says ""Kelly I can't leave her here like this. I know it's weird but I've been really down before to and sometimes people just need someone to not only help but believe they're telling the truth. He said would u mind if postponed and help her?I said of course n so the journey began. 

We went to 2 women's shelters with her and to no avail they weren't taking anymore people. It was a bit cold and well we're not the richest people with our student loans so we really couldn't afford to pay for a hotel room in the city. So Shane with his trusting heart of gold says would I mind spending the night at his place and asking her to stay with us. He figured she would feel comfortable with a girl asking her if she'd like to spend the night and we'd figure it out in the morning. 

I mean here I am with a guy I'm starting to fall for and he's willing to bring a stranger in for the night out of the cold. When I asked her she truly weeped and thanked me a million times but little did she know it wasn't my idea and honestly I'd of never of done this. But he has this gravity about him that just pulls you in. 

We get to Shane's house and I have some clothes there so I gave her some stuff the would fit and let her get a shower. In the meantime Shane ordered pizza and when she came out he made her feel so cozy like he'd known her for 100 years. We ate pizza, we played a board game, we laughed and then he made her hot tea and we watched his favorite movie The Big Lebowski lol. He made the couch up for her and we went to bed.

In the morning he made us all breakfast and then told us he'd be right back. He said he was getting us good coffee lol. He comes back and she was finally able to get a hold of her sister on someone's phone in her home town and she had a place to go. Shane drives her to the bus station and buys her a ticket and hands her an envelope. Here I found out, when asking where it was today, he'd gone down to the pawn shop and pawned his iPad to give her 120 bucks to get home 

This man gave his home, his time, his care, his money and his food to a complete stranger. He trusted her that she wanted to go home and just needed help. He changed how i view the world and in that moment I fell so deeply in love with him. I don't even know how to show him what this meant to me but I know I will become more like him. I love you Shane with all my heart and one day I am gonna marry you, give you babies and grow old with you. Knights in shining armor still exist and I am lucky enough to get to kiss one whenever I want.

I tipped a waiter,"Throwaway 

I just need to tell someone about this. I don't want to tell anyone in my personal life. 

Back story 

I am a surgeon. I make one million dollars annually pre tax, after tax I make around 550k ( almost 46k a month ). I grew up poor, I'm a daughter of refugee/immigrant parents who came to Canada for a better life for me. All my life I was taught that education was the number one thing. I love my job and I am living the most comfortable life. I am debt free, my parents were able to retire when I paid all their debt and now they are living comfortably just outside the city. 

Now the story:

I always come to this family owned restaurant and over the years I have gotten to know the family very well. They are a family that escaped from North Korea and came to Canada for better life for their son. They have one son named Jin. I've known Jin since he was 15 years old because he worked at the restaurant to help out his family. Jin is a very outgoing boy, when I come to the restaurant and no one was there we would talk about anything, he loved physics. I'd eat at that restaurant around 5 times a week and every time Jin was there working. Most times he would have his textbook and notebook there doing his homework when he had the chance. So fast forward 3 years. Jin is in university, still at the restaurant working after his classes. We were talking one day and he said that he might drop out of university because he needs work full time and help out his parents, money was tight for them. This was very troubling for me because Jin loved the stuff he was studying. 

Then I decided that I needed to help Jin out. 

I went to the restaurant a few days later when they were closing. His parents and him were cleaning up. I offered to pay his tuition for all 4 years of university. Jin and his family at first didn't accept out of respect, I'm assuming. After a couple minutes of them refusing and me begging them to take it, the father started to cry, then the mother, then Jin. I told them that the only contingency is that Jin had to keep an average of 80% on his classes. 



Fast forward to 3 months ago

Jin graduated from university with honours. 4.0 gpa. I was there at his graduation and I couldn't have been prouder 


Fast forward to last week

Jin called me and said that he got accepted into University of Toronto's medical school. 


EDIT: thank you all for the kind words. to answer some of your questions. I am in Ontario. I don't make all of my 1 million/y salary from my job, i have investments too. I make about 700k from my job (i do a lot of overtime) and 300k from investments (pre tax). Also to clear up the medical school acceptance, Jin is going into MS1 this month. Jin didn't tell me when he got accepted into medical school (December 2016), he told me now (September 2017) that he is going to medical school this month. "
I saw my dead husband in a dream and I’m so happy right now,"He died of suicide in 2002. He had become addicted to opioids after a work related accident that required 2 surgeries. During the last one, the surgeon accidentally severed an area near his spine which resulted in a near fatal infection. He was left with the grim prognosis that he’d never work again and he’d probably always have pain. He was prescribed pain killers and began abusing them when he had to double up to get relief. He doctor shopped and had 2 doctors prescribing him meds. After 5 years, they decided to wean him, but the damage was done. He started buying them off the street, stealing money from our bank account, stealing from the kids, pawning our things, nearly bankrupting us. He killed himself after I kicked him out of our home, telling him he couldn’t come back unless he went to rehab. BUT THIS DREAM!! He was young and energetic. He was happy. He was laughing. He had no physical limitations. He was smiling and joyful. He was absolutely gorgeous. He was the man I had fallen in love with. I was young too, and we were back in our courtship days. He kept smiling at me and holding my hand. He came up behind me and wrapped his arms around me. He bent his head and kissed the side of my neck, the way he used to. In the dream, I was elated. In the dream, I kept thinking to myself, “Look at him! He’s gorgeous!” His face was right up next to mine and he was staring at me, and in the blink of an eye, he was gone. I jolted awake saying his name out loud. I looked around to make sure my present husband hadn’t heard me, but luckily he was still at the gym. I spent the next 30 minutes sitting on the side of the couch hugging myself, rocking back and forth, with an idiotic grin on my face. I’m agnostic - I don’t believe our souls go someplace (heaven) when we die. I believe we just end. But I have to admit, I kept thinking, “I hope I’m wrong. I hope we DO go someplace, and I hope he’s in the place where I just saw him.”

If you’ve gotten this far, thank you for reading and letting me get this out. I rarely remember a dream for very long and I wanted to always remember this one, so I decided to write it down. I just can’t get over the happiness it left in me - it felt like I actually saw him again after all these years - the way he was in the beginning, not in the end.

UPDATE: It’s been a little over 12 hours since I posted this, and I want to say that I am absolutely blown away and overwhelmed by the response from you incredible people of Reddit. All these comments and private messages and not a single negative one. Think about that. This entire thread is a veritable lovefest! I wanted to respond to each of you individually, because I felt it was the least I could do after you took the time to write such nice things, and I especially wanted to respond to the comments that crushed my heart, but there were so many. Let me just say that I thank you all from the bottom of my heart for your sincere well-wishes and your heartfelt outpouring of love! You guys rock and are the reason I love Reddit! Thank you to those who shared similar stories of visitation dreams. After reading them, I’m more inclined to believe that maybe there IS a place we go to when we die, and maybe our loved ones CAN visit to let us know they’re doing ok and are watching over us. What a feeling! What a comfort! So, to all of you - thank you so very much, I love you all, and keep dreaming! "
Im getting fucking married,"Yesterday was a normal Tuesday. I got back from traveling. He was already home. We had sex since we haven't seen each other in a few days. It was so passionate and amazing. We got into PJs and made dinner together. Steak, asparagus and salt potatoes. We played Mario Kart Wii and he was kicking my ass as usual. He got up to get a drink but came back with a blue velvet box. I stared at it like it was something from another planet. He went down on one knee and I immediately started bawling my freaking eyes out. He asked me to marry him and I was somehow able to somehow say yes cry at the same tome. I held him so tight I didn't want to let go. He had no idea which finger to put it on he was shaking so much. 


I'm marrying the man of my dreams. "
Employee requested a payroll advance. I could not bring myself to do it.,"His family is behind on rent. For the first time ever, they're looking at no Christmas as well. He wanted to borrow half of his next paycheck to pay rent, late, this month.

This is a classic snowball. There's no way out. He'd be late in January, setting up the same situation moving forward, lather/rinse/repeat. His family shouldn't sign up for that. I'm not signing up for that.

I told him no. I told him why. I told him that I valued him as a person and an employee. Then I paid his outstanding December rent, with a little left over for holiday gifts. I called it a Christmas Bonus.

I'm taking a chance on this guy. I'm investing in his well-being. I want him here for a few years at least. It was a risky, but pragmatic decision - and it also happened to feel like the right thing to do. I hope it's the right thing to do.

I don't know his family. He's a bright guy, six kids, a wife he's been with for 20 years. I have a good feeling about this.

Let's be brave this year. Let's choose risk, strength and investment. Let's be kind to one another where we can and how it matters. Maybe we can build a better reality.

Edit: thanks y'all. This turned out to be really uplifting. I don't feel right talking about this kind of thing irl, so I came here to get it omc.

Keep the love alive, folks. "
I knew a kid in highschool that never spoke.,"I knew a kid in highschool that never spoke. I was kinda a loner myself but it easy necessarily by choice. 
He sat alone at lunch , and I didn't have anyone to sit with so I just quietly ate with him every day. 

I soon noticed he was in a lot of my classes and I started just sitting with him. 
When he thought no one was looking he would smile at jokes or start to doodle , but as soon as he knew someone was watching he would go blank. 

Naturally kids started picking on him a little, trying to get him to talk or asking him why he never spoke. None of it seemed to phase him and he would just shrug or smile. 

But what really got me mad was when the teachers would draw attention to him . when they would call roll they would pause at him sometimes and poke fun at how he wasn't going to answer. He would go really numb and still when this happened. 

One day I snapped at a teacher to ""leave him the fuck alone"" and ""if you feel the need to look cool in front of a bunch of high schoolers by making fun of a child than your a pathetic person""

I'll never forget the way he looked at me when I was sent to the office. He had his mouth open like he *wanted* to say something. 

At the office a councilor sat with me and explained that his father died in Afghanistan and he hasn't spoken to anyone but his mom since. 

I learned a lot about people from him. I leaned how cruel they can be , I leaned how kind and compassionate they can be. But then thing I learned from him that was most valuable was the power of listening. 

I tried to take my life in November of that year, and I was gone for a few weeks. The entire school totally new because of my brother .  I was a stupid teenager who didn't realize the value of her own life.

When I got back he was waiting by my locker. 

He said hi. 

I thought it was someone else but he gave me a hug and said hi again. 

It was the most meaningful thing anyone had said to me during that time. 

I cried a little and after that he began to speak to me really quietly . it was little things at first like hello and good bye but soon he was asking how my day was and before I knew it he was rolling in laughter at my dumb jokes. 

He knew more about me than anyone because he listened.

After I graduated I moved , I still wonder about him almost every day. 

Just wanted to share this with someone.

Edit: A lot of people are saying I should find him on Facebook and such. I have tried recently but he still doesn't have one, and he's not one for phone calls due to him not speaking much. Its hard for him , and I didn't want to push contact like others did.
I get updates from friends in my hometown and they show him picture of me and tell him how I'm doing. 

He's currently living with his boyfriend who is a psychology Major , I plan to try to reach out more and may be back in town for a visit. 

Thanks for the kind words and encouragement :) 

Edit 2: this has blown up more than I expected, I'll try to reply to all that I can ! Thanks to you awesome redditors I am contacting his boyfriend and will hopefully soon write him a letter :) 

UPDATE: last night I contacted his boyfriend who was very happy to hear from me. Apparently my quite friend had tried to find me in the past but didn't know how to spell my current last name since I got married. I got his address and I'm writing him a letter today :) I'll let you guys know what I put :) 



I also woke up this morning to so many kind words and amazing stories,( AND MY FIRST GOLD!!!) I'll be sure to reply to all that I can . thank you so much!!! 
"
My wife’s grandma finally called me “mijo”,"Alright so first of all I’m white as hell. Like total cracker. 195% Saltine American. My wife is so Mexican that she can lob her chancla from the kitchen and hit me upside the head no matter where I am in the house. Because of this, my wife’s family has always been very suspicious of me and concerned for my wife for marrying a white boy. Fair enough, i understand Mexican culture pretty well enough to know how important family is to them and for a while I thought i was contaminating their family because of all the dirty looks they would give me for being so white. Well, a few weeks ago my wife’s grandma drove up from San Antonio to Dallas where we live and we spent the whole day together. It was a lot of fun besides the fact that they spoke Spanish to each other most of the time and I couldn’t understand any of it. When the day was over and it was time to go home, we were saying goodbyes when my grandma Maria hugs me, kisses my cheek and says, “Thank you for taking care of my grand daughter. I love you Mijo.” For those who don’t know what mijo is in Spanish, it technically means “son” but it’s so much more than that. It’s a term of pure endearment. To her, to my wife, and to me it was accepting me into the family with open arms. Needless to say I cried that whole day. It was one of the greatest days of my life and I have never felt so accepted and loved than in that moment. 

Edit: The support I’m receiving from this post has been overwhelming. I never would have expected to see so many people in the same position as my wife and me. Thank you so much to all who support us!"
The first in my family and I fucking did it. I fucking graduated!,"Molested when I was 10. Dad died when I was 13. Raped at 14. Started drinking and doing drugs at 15. First in my family to graduate from high school at 17. Dropped out of college at 19. Got sober at 22. Escaped and survived an emotionally abusive relationship at 25. Graduating just 3 days before my 26th birthday.


I hope my list of heartbreaking hiccups helps at least one person believe in themselves because you can be the best version of yourself if you want to be. I'm trying hard not to cry, but this feels so good!

**Edit: Holy shucks! I know everyone says this, but I did not expect this to get remotely noticed. I will try my best to respond to all of you once my family goes home. Thank you, thank you, thank you!**

**Second edit: Wowza! This exploded and I haven't had the chance to respond to everyone. Thank you all so, so much for your kindness. It fills me with so much joy to know that this post actually made some of y'all smile. How nice is that? Please take care and love yourselves and others.**"
SHE'S PREGNANT,"I know it's early, I know you shouldn't get too excited until after the first trimester, I know you can't tell anyone yet. But after 2 1/2 years of trying with no luck AND finding out the odds of getting pregnant were under half of one percent, it HAPPENED. MULTIPLE tests confirmed it, the first doctor appointment is scheduled.

I'm going to be a dad.

Edit: You know sometimes Reddit can be a pretty toxic place. Not today. Thank you all, from the bottom of our hearts. ❤️"
In two days I will start a job making $80k,"Growing up was not fun.  I didn’t know what being a kid meant.  I did know how to differentiate between the different screams my mother would make as to whether or not it was a typical beating or her life was actually endanger.  

My parents were not well off, at 16 I witnessed my first eviction.  Twelve police cars were parked outside and men came in with shotguns and side arms drawn.  I saw all of my favorite belongings get placed into a large rental truck and told that I’d be able to get them back, not to worry.  

From 16-18 I lived with my two parents in a single hotel room out of a suitcase.  Dishes were done in the bathtub and there was no stove.  

From 18-19 I go to community college in the morning and work graveyard shift at McDonald’s.  I save enough money to buy my first car.  I painstakingly learn how to drive manual and scream when I can’t understand it.  Eventually I learn.  

After my first year of community college I transfer to a private university.  Judging by the title you think you know how this is going to go but you’d be wrong.  

At 21 I am expelled from the private university for having too low of a GPA.  I am accepted back into the program, and have about $40k in debt racked up.   I have one chance to get it right.  

At 22 my father strangles me on Christmas Eve, places bruises upon my neck for weeks, then kicks me out of the house.  

At 23 my gf of six years kills herself.  The only thing stopping me from killing myself is that my co-signer will inherit all of my debt.  

At 24 I am one semester from graduating with no job in sight.  10 weeks before graduating I am seriously considering suicide as an option if I can’t find a job after I graduate.  

At 25 I have graduated college with a BS in the most sought after field today and landed a job making $80k starting with plenty of room to grow.  It allows me to live anywhere.  

In two days I will start that job.  In two days my life begins.  

I fucking survived.  

Edit 1: Holy shit, this blew up.  Thank you for the silver, and gold, and platinum.  They are my first.  Thank you for all of the wonderful posts, thoughts and wishes!  I am trying to get to all or most of them.  

Edit 2:  I knew there would be a second one.  Thank you again for the currencies.  It’s also really cool hearing how my story is encouraging all of you.  It’s also neat to have this experience and feel a bit special.  When I woke up this morning I had over 150 notifications.  I may have even walked by you today, which is neat to think that someone browsing reddit might be reading my post, nudging their friend and telling them to read it, something I wrote.  That’s just so cool.  

Edit 3: the field...  I haven’t seen anyone get it right but it’s definitely grouped into some of the guesses I’ve seen in some programs.  Remember degree seekers, school is an investment.  "
I matched with my crush on tinder!!!,"I have the biggest crush on one of my co workers. I feel like we would be super compatible together and I just adore him as a person. Today, I found myself feeling really down about this crush because I felt like he probably had no interest in me and it wouldn't ever go anywhere. I decided to make a tinder to distract myself. I had been avoiding making a tinder because I've heard nothing good really ever comes of it, but I caved because I was sad. Lo and behold that very same night, I found his profile and swiped right and it was an immediate match!!! And he messaged me!!! I am just completely floored and SO HAPPY AAAAAHHHH"
To the father who walked into my work with his three kids.,"You ordered large fruit punches all around. The kids were so happy. You asked about our adobo pizza, said the kids were interested, I told you you wouldn't regret it. The little one asked for a mini adobo fried rice omelette. You said whatever she wants.

I asked if anyone wanted anything else. The big kid wanted the lechon sisig cheese fries. You said before anything else, what was my total at. I told you you about $34. You politely said no, that would be it. I noticed the two $20s you had crumpled in your hand. 

My father, raised me and my brother pretty much by himself and even though we struggled, he always made sure we ate. I lost him last year. Now I don't know if these kids' mother was not in the picture, or just at work or something, but it was just so nice to see a father being good to his kids.

I wish I could have given you those lechon sisig cheese fries. But all I could do was keep those fruit punches coming to your kids, who were chugging them down enthusiastically, but being so polite. I wanted to just take those fruit punches off your tab; I would have paid for them myself (I wouldn't steal from work lol) but the owner was right there. I then wanted to give you big jumbo cups to go so your kids could take home all the fruit punch they wanted (something we offer to those who ask,) but I was rushed to cash you out.

All I could do was give you the best service I could, despite it being busy and other customers being demanding, and say, ""Happy Early Father's day"" when I cashed you out. I hope that was enough to show you how much just you and your three angels' presence made my day. 

But the look in your eye when you said, ""Thank you, I really appreciate it,"" told me that you sincerely did.

Edit: Wow! My first gold!"
My boyfriend (25) thought I was asleep...,"The other morning I was really sick. It was my time of the month and (due to PCOS) I was in a lot of pain. I stayed home from work and spent the night using my boyfriend as a heating pad. He babied me all night and did whatever he could to take care of me. I ended up falling asleep in his lap. He moved me to my spot in the bed, which woke me up, but I was enjoying him doing this that I shamelessly faked being asleep.  He laid down behind me, wrapped his arm around me, kissed my forehead, and said, “baby I love you so much. You mean the world to me. Thank you for making me so happy. I hope you feel better. I love you.” I had to fight back tears. I didn’t mention to him that I heard it because I’m afraid he’ll stop doing it. I’ve been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts my whole life but hearing this made me feel at peace for once.

Edit: I know there’s some of you that don’t want to believe this because the title is “clickbait” and “this has been posted before.” I understand that and I hate that people have become so numb to this stuff that they don’t believe it can happen commonly. Admittedly, I didn’t even look through the sub before posting. I was swooning and caught up in my feels and wanted to share. I figured that with all the negativity going on in the world, along with all the mental health struggles I have endured myself, posting something happy and positive would be a good thing. Obviously I can’t force anyone to believe me but I wish people would try.

But for those that do, thank you for all the nice comments! I wish I could show him but I’m not ready to scare him away from doing this just yet ;)"
"I met my brother that was ""missing""!","Here’s an update for you all: 

The day after I made my last post, I woke up and called into work. I told my wife (who is essentially my confidant and I tell her everything) the whole story. She wasn’t really surprised; she’s not a fan of my parents much. But like many of you, she told me to call the number I was given for my brother immediately. She insisted on it. She took herself and my son out for a day together so I could be alone to talk with him. 

I dialed the number about seven times before I actually pressed the “call” button. It started ringing and I hung up. Then I got frustrated at myself and called the number back. It rang and rang and I got a voicemail, but it was the automated voice, not anyone else’s. I didn’t leave a voicemail. I thought the whole thing was ridiculous. I called my wife and told her to come home and she refused until I had talked to *someone* on the other end of the phone. 

About an hour of pacing and drinking two glasses of scotch at 1 o’clock in the afternoon, I called the number again. It rang three times. I panicked. I hung up. But this time, the number was calling me back. I swear to whatever God(s) above, I thought my heart was going to stop. I almost threw up right there. I answered the call. 

The first thing I heard on the other end of the line was a guy laughing in the background. There was wind on the phone. The person on the other end was outside and it was windy. “Who is this?”

It was his voice. I knew that voice. It was my fucking brother. My brother! Who had been gone for my entire life! I covered my mouth with my shaking hands and just sat there. He kept asking me who it was. The guy in the background was trying to talk over him. He hung up on me. I called him back right away. He answered again. 

Me being a creepy ass, the first thing I said after decades of not seeing him and thinking he was dead, I blurted: “I got your number.” 

He asked me who I was and what I wanted. I said, “It’s me.” There was a really long pause. I thought the call had dropped. Then I heard him tell someone to turn the radio down and roll the window up. The sound of wind stopped… and then he asked me my name. I told him and he said that I was lying. I told him I got his number from the missing children’s network and detectives. I heard him gasp. He asked me what color shoelaces he wore to a picnic when we were kids, and I remember my mom getting mad at his orange laces with blue shoes. It was the last time we were together as a family. 

I could tell he was crying. The first thing he asked me was: “Where are you?” and I told him I lived a few hours away from home. Without hesitating, he told me, “I’m coming.” 

He went straight to the airport without any luggage, bought a plane ticket, and flew straight to me. We stayed on the phone with each other the whole time. When he was walking through the gate, I knew who he was right away. He is middle-aged; salt and pepper hair, muscular. He looks just like our dad, only better. I know if I told him that, that would make him mad. 

I literally pushed an old lady out of the way and I just hugged him. He’s about two inches taller than me. He was able to pick me up. He was crying, I was crying. I was having a breakdown. We went to a bar at the airport. He wouldn’t let me out of his sight. He kept holding onto my arm. He kept telling me how unreal it all was. He apologized to me. He kept crying, telling me he felt horrible. I told him to forget everything and tell me about his life.

He’s married. His husband is a doctor—a pediatric oncologist. They live in the Pacific Northwest. They have two children—girls, 12 and 8. He works as a legal consultant and has his own firm. He has an amazing life. He told me that he thought I hated him and wanted nothing to do with him. We sat at the bar for hours. Literal hours. I think we sat for about six hours before I begged him to come home and meet my wife. 

We got home, and my wife was a mess. She hugged him and insisted he stay with us. At this point, his husband was going insane and kept calling him. He had no idea what was going on. He thought he had eloped or something. It was crazy for a couple of days until everything was explained and out in the open. 

My son and my brother were like two peas in a pod. Honestly, I never wanted children. My son was an amazing accident, but I’m not good with kids. I’m always afraid I’m going to break them. But my brother is a pro. Kids love him. 

He stayed with us for two weeks. And in two weeks, everything about my life changed. His husband and two daughters flew in to stay with us. My brother-in-law and my two nieces. My family. They were my family. They are my family. 

My brother wants my wife and I to move to be closer to him. My wife is on board. I work as a professor at a university and have already started to send out feelers to see if there are any open positions, and I’ve found one that is actually tenured and higher pay. 

I do not plan on forgiving my parents, but my brother still loves them. He went by their house and knocked on the door. My father shut the door in his face. My mother gave him a hug and told him to take care of himself. Then she shut him out. I can’t forgive them for that. I have no reason to stay close to them. I want to be with my family. I want to make up for all the lost time. 

It’s 2am right now and I’m drinking a tall glass of scotch and grading papers. My beautiful, wonderful, smart, amazing wife is asleep on the couch. She likes to watch me grade papers. My son is asleep in his room cuddled up with all the stuffed animals his uncle brought him. And I’m here, so happy, so fulfilled knowing that my family has grown and doubled in size so suddenly. My heart is happy. I am so happy right now, Reddit. I am so happy. "
For the Past 5 Years I've Been Living a Different Life and Nobody Knows [Long]," I grew up in Nebraska, living with my dad because my mom took off when I was 2 and we never saw her again. My dad was extremely physically abusive and would spend all his money on drugs, which meant unless I could stay with a friend I most likely didn't eat that day. My dad didn't keep tabs on me, so as soon as I was old enough to work I was supplying my own food secretly, because if he knew I had money he'd take it. I bought an old car off a friend, fixed it up, saved up a couple grand and took off when I was 17. I didn't tell anyone. I didn't even really plan it. I just packed up my stuff one night and left. I worked odd jobs over the next few years, working long enough to make a paycheck and taking off again. My goal was California, and by the time I was 19 I had made it there. I changed my name, started going to college and after a few months got a decent job. I have a pretty nice apartment, friends who like me and even a girlfriend I've been seeing for a few months now. None of them know who I used to be. I tell everyone my parents are dead, and answer personal questions about my past and the scars my dad left on my body with vague responses. To my knowledge, nobody suspects a thing. Every single thing I am I have made myself, and that's how I want people to know me. The stuff I went through with my father growing up deeply affected me, and still does. But I am done being scared of him and I am done letting him control me. 

Edit: Wow. Just...damn. I'm floored. Honestly I didn't post this with the intention of thousands of people reading it; to be honest, this secret has been eating at me lately. I wanted to make this post just to see what it would feel like to have it out there, so that maybe I would be more comfortable telling someone. And...just, holy shit. Thank you so much for the kind words. Upon reflection I believe that in part, distancing myself so much from my past gives me an excuse not to deal with it. I never had anyone supporting me when I was young, but I do now. I have friends that have done so much for me emotionally, and of course my girlfriend. I don't know if we're going to last but I'm serious about her, and I think everyone was right in saying that she deserves to know. I know everyone in my life will be supportive if I tell them, and I will. I'm not sure if I'm 'ready', but if I keep waiting I never will be. Thank you again everyone for the kind words and encouragement. You've all done so much for my self esteem and confidence regarding my situation, and I can't thank you enough. Thanks for reading, and sorry for the long edit. "
I laugh when I think about my best friend’s funeral.,"My best friend lost her battle with cancer about 15 years ago. She fought strong and hard for most of her life and she was 25 years old when she passed away. 

The service was at a Baha’i temple and it was HOURS long. I remember thinking she would have been so pissed if she had to sit through something like this. But, it was lovely, nonetheless.

At the burial site, a fucking crane, carrying her coffin on a small, loud-ass bulldozer (she was a very big girl) was reversing while its back-up-beeper is just blaring, and echoing throughout this tiny corner in the cemetery. The person speaking was literally yelling over this truck/crane/fucking back-up-beeper.

Then... the crane starts swinging and her coffin hits and breaks a nearby headstone. All the cemetery guys have been called over. They’re on their walkie-talkies, frolicking through our funeral and shit. Meanwhile, the god damned fuckin tractor is still running.

The step-mom, overcome with emotion, faints. Upon seeing this, the mom pretends to faint, so the step couldn’t one-up her.

Now come the fire department and the police, with their sirens blaring.

Now, the women refuse to leave the scene until their daughter is buried in the ground, so the emt guys stuck around and kinda awkwardly  joined our funeral.

It was a scene from one of the most amazing movies I had ever witnessed in real life. Every time I think about it, I fucking crack up.

I sometimes feel guilty when I am telling other people about it and legit can’t breathe because I’m laughing so hard.

My friend was one of the most inappropriately hilarious people I had ever met in my life. I know she’s laughing with me."
My daughter will pretend to fall asleep wherever she is before bedtime so I will carry her to her bed.,"She doesn’t know that I’m aware of what she is doing, and I have no plans of ever telling her. It’s just one of the privileges of being a father, I suppose. "
I love you,"To whoever is reading this, I love you. You’ve got no fucking idea how much I love you, even if I don’t know you I fucking love you. I’m drunk right now so don’t judge but to whoever is reading this I really fucking love you and you really fucking matter."
I overheard my boyfriend asking my Dad for his blessing.,"On Christmas! I had gone to bed, and they were chatting by the fire in the room next to mine. Unbeknownst to them, I could clearly hear their conversation as my dad gave my partner his enthusiastic permission to marry me. 
A few moments later, my boyfriend came in and I pretended to be asleep. He kissed me sweetly on the forehead and held me for a few minutes as I snuggled up to him. He seemed to be extremely relieved. Merry Christmas, indeed! :-) 

Edit: wow!!!! I went to sleep and woke up to so many sweet messages and comments! Thank you all so very much- it’s so awesome to be reminded to hold gratitude during this time. 

Edit 2: this is coming up in the comments a lot, so I thought I would address it! My father was not at all expecting or requesting to be asked, as we are a pretty liberal and non-traditional California family. Asking the father’s permission is not common in my boyfriend’s culture either. One day I offhandedly mentioned to my SO that if we were to get engaged, I thought giving my dad a heads up and asking for his blessing (more like ‘hey, are you cool with this?’) would be an awesome way for them to connect without me, and would make my dad feel comfortable and respected. It makes me feel so loved that he made that extra effort :-) 

Thank you for the gold!!!!! 

"
A drug dealer saved my life,"I know it's a hated area. So many drug dealers are the worst people in the entire world but some of them are just people evolved from their surroundings. My dealer was a 35-40 year old black dude named B. And B sold me things for a long time about 3 years. Well one day I call B and ask for stuff and he tells me that he concerned on what's out there right now and his last batch wasn't safe. He told me he's known me too long and as he put it he ain't gonna let his young bull go out like that. 

So I make another call to a friend of his named Curtis and met him bc I really wanted shit as I am an addict. Well I show up and as I am about to do shit none other then B walks through the door. He slaps the shit outta my hand and scares the shit out of me. Not even 3 min later Curtis gets a call that someone was found dead and it's probably his shit. This is fetenyl it kills. 

B didn't stop there. He brought me outside and I dunno if it was the day he was having or what but he never looked like this before. He told me that he's done given me shit and that I need to.open my eyes and this isn't a lifestyle. He told me I'm too good for Kensington Ave and it's deaths and I need to move on. He said he was stuck but not me. And then I left.

B kept his word. No one would answer my calls. The few other guys near his block would tell me keep fuckin walking bc they knew me. This led me to really think and go get help I needed especially from withdrawl

Today I am 1 year and 7 months clean. I got a good job and and clear head. So when you hate a drug dealer it's understandable but just know they are human too and some of them wish they weren't trapped by drugs whether they use or not. I can tell you by the look in B's eyes that day, he would do anything to have not made his early mistakes and been in jail and be out of the drug scene.

UPDATE: WOW is all I can say almost. This is crazy I never thought this would blow up like this. Thank you all so much for the support your an amazing group of people. I thought for sure people would hate this because of the topic but I am blown away. Obviously maybe I was the closed minded one thinking people wouldn't like it bc 1. It's another drug addict post and 2. That story about B and people tend to hate dealers. 

But really thank you all so much. As for anyone wondering about B from what I have heard is he might be back in jail. He refused my calls so I never got to talk to him again but I am going to try and maybe write him a letter if he is in jail. He really did save me and maybe he's done a million things wrong but he saved me from a sure death. Again thank you all and please anyone trying to get clean seek help. Also in my own personal philosophy look out for signs. When u buy that bag of dope if there's a rehab billboard in front of you maybe the universe is telling you something? Good luck to all of you!"
"""You have no room to complain. I take 18 credit hours, work full-time, have an internship, get straight-A's...""","I don't care.

Good for you, but I really do not care.

Stop assuming everyone can handle that work-load and stop discounting the struggles of others or write them off as *""lazy""* because you feel your struggles are greater.

Edit: Matter of fact, this whole thing reminds me of a guy I used to work with. I would yawn and go, ""Whew, man, I'm beat this morning.""

""Maaaan, don't even fucking start. I get up at 4 AM every day, have since I was in the Navy, and...""

Jesus, can't I just say that I'm tired without the ear-beating?"
Dear recipe blogger people. We don’t give a fuck about your anecdotal stories or anything else you want to blather on about. Just give us the fucking recipe already.,"This is common knowledge yet these people don’t get the only thing they are doing is annoying people. 

Edit: I was just talking about this to my family and my daughter freaked out! She concurs.

Edit: hear that food bloggers? "
"Next week I will go from making $180 a week to $43,000 a year","Secretly, I was/am terrified of success, and so, I only emailed out two resumes in the 2.5 months following graduation (I told everyone else I was applying everywhere).

 Turns out one of those places was an excellent company that loves to give unexperienced graduates a chance, while mentoring them into the role. Most of their staff end up staying on for 20+ years. 

Next week my life changes, 10 years ago I was hopitalized for multiple suicide attempts, and while I never thought this could be possible, I'm not scared for my future. I can't believe that I believe this, but I earned this. I deserve this.

Edit: wow this got bigger than I expected! Thank you everyone! Anyone who is getting discouraged applying, hang in there! It took months for this place to give me an interview after I applied, sometimes these things take a long time 😁

Edit: I really appreciate all the response, but I'm not going to giving out the name of the company I work at. I work in law so you need certifications. The best advice I can give to break into the professional (office) world is to take a administrative course and seek a entry level position as an assistant and work your way up 😊"
My parents expect me to give birth to their grandchildren after raising me to be the opposite sex of what I was born.,"Due to the government policy of the country I was born in, they were only allowed to have one child, and my father was disappointed that I was a female. My mother was too scared to get an abortion so instead they decided to raise me to be a male. They gave me a male name and dressed me as one and got me into masculine interests.

During my late teenage years, my mother seemed to want to go back on that and told me what female name she would have given me and started to call me that. She tried to get me into feminine hobbies too and asked me to grow my hair out and try wearing female clothing. She told me that as an adult I won't be able to handle a male role in society by my own biology. My father is passive about this but still calls me by my male name.

Anyhow, I got a career in commercial piloting. I was successful enough to immigrate to Canada and bring my mother and father with me, and they both are unemployed and ""too old to work"". While I have lived here, I have had the opportunity to obtain transitional hormones and surgically remove my breasts as I felt it suited me.

Now they tell me I need to find a Chinese male here and make children. My mother can't reproduce anymore as she is menopausal and she asks me to continue the bloodline. They want me to give up my career, which is paying for their lives, and stop the use of testosterone therapy, to get pregnant and raise a child? You raised me to be a male, you can't expect this of me too therefore. I feel like my parents are being wholly ungrateful of me. There is nothing I can do to fulfill their contradictory expectations."
To the person who walked out on their 700 tab last night,"You spent 700 USD and ditched your bill on a busy Saturday night.Thanks. Thanks for not only putting my job in jeopardy, not only making the last 2 hours of my 12 hour shift a complete waste of time, but also for making me feel like an idiot. Who goes to a restaurant, orders the nicest things possible, has someone wait on them hand and foot, and then walks out on their bill? I hope you enjoyed the meal you can’t afford asshole. Not only did I almost lose my job last night but now I have to go into work for another 12 hour shift today, and all I can think about now is that if something goes wrong, I’m going to lose my job. So thank you for that as well man.

Edit: Thank you all for reaching out. Thank you from the bottom of my heart to those of you guys that offered to help cover the tip, that means more then the money itself. Seriously life’s been hard lately and it feels really good to be on the receiving end of some positivity!! So don’t worry you all have done enough.  The guy ended up leaving his real name and number under the reservation... So hopefully something will come of it. Your all awesome thanks again. Also I feel like I should clarify I’m a dude haha"
"Just want to give a quick shout out to all the mail carriers, truck drivers, mail/package handlers and dock workers working this holiday season.","Christmas is almost here! I (USPS mail carrier) have to be in at 6am for another 12 hour day of mail carrying on Christmas Eve. The last rush before the lull. This year has been worse than any years past, according to the old heads at my Post Office. Still, despite all the hardship, the light is starting to appear at the end of the tunnel. 

Shoutout to all the Carriers, truck drivers, handlers, dock workers, maintenance employees and clerks who have been keeping this holiday season rolling along. Weather you’re a fellow USPS worker, UPS, FedEx or apart another delivery company, I see and appreciate you! 

Don’t let ANYONE tell you your job ain’t difficult or worthwhile enough to keep around. You’re worth it. Hold your head high and keep right onto the end of the road my fellow workers. Happy Holidays ❤️

Solidarity Forever ✊

Today is the first day in years that I woke up and didn't immediately think about killing myself. I feel great.,"I've had severe depression for almost 5 years, and I've been suicidal for about as long. When I woke up this morning, instead of having to fight the urge to kill myself, instead I lay awake and couldn't stop smiling. It felt amazing.

I put on an outfit I haven't worn in years, and I felt so good about myself walking through the city listening to music on my phone. It was like I could all of a sudden see everything I've been missing for the last 5 years. I saw beauty in the trees on the side of the road, seeing kids playing at a park made me genuinely happy, the weather was gorgeous. Everything felt wonderful.

I put fresh strings on my guitar and played it for the first time in months. It felt so nice to finally be able to feel joy from something that I used to love.

I just finished watching some favourite movies of mine and I'm sitting here browsing reddit and my guinea pig is eating lettuce next to me.

This might not seem like much to anyone else, and there's a chance that no one will ever see this, or even care, but I just feel like I need to shout it from the roof tops!

The world is a beautiful place and I can't wait to wake up again tomorrow."
"I just spent 3 hours with the newly arrived refugees from syria, and they made me cry.","Excuse any spelling mistakes, I'm on mobile.

Yesterday 78 refugees arrived in my small town in germany. Many people have already been talking about how dangerous they will be and women will be disrespected by them and they'll kill us. That type of ignorant bullshit.

My friend went yesterday to the encampment, inside what once was a small shopping center. She said the men were so nice to her and her daughter that she wanted to go again today to see if they needed help with anything else. I asked if I could go as well to help.

We arrived there at around 9:30 and most of the men were still sleeping. I thought it would be rude to take pictures so I didn't get any of the inside... but just imagine a place where the walls are white and inmates are put 4 to a cell in bunk beds, and each ""cell"" was sectioned off with metal fences they use for construction sites, with some white plastic attached to it so the men had privacy from anyone walking in.

My friend had brought cigarette lighters for the men since all of them smoke (except the youngest, 16). The people in charge didn't really know what to do with us, but then I told them my first language is English, and they right away brought us to a syrian doctor who could speak excellent English. 

He told me what the refugees needed and I translated that to the boss running the encampment. At one point some men told him they needed shoes, because theirs were falling apart (literally). We split the people into groups because others wanted to go get groceries, and others wanted to take the bus into town for other stuff. We went with the group to get shoes and jackets.

5 men came with us. They all had thin jackets on and no umbrella,  and it was raining like cats and dogs as we were walking.  They got completely soaked on the way over. I had an umbrella and didn't use it because I felt shitty that I could stay dry and yet they would get soaked. However, one of the guys (a 16 year old) told me in hand gestures that he would hold the umbrella for me, and he held it over us the whole way to the store.  And I'm supposed to believe now that all Muslim men disrespect women? No. Never again. 

In the store my friend bought them umbrellas, because their money that they had (200 euros for one month) could be spent on better things. She doesn't earn much either, and I thought that was really kind of her to do.

On the way back i was trying to learn some Arabic words, and I asked about mama and papa. One guy said his mom and dad are in Syria still. Then he said brothers, showed me two fingers, and then made a shooting gesture and said IS. He said freedom as he showed me the gesture for handcuffs, and said ""gone"". I cried. I looked at him and the brother that is still living (the 16 year old) and I fucking could not stop crying. These poor fucking men. They have nothing but broken shoes and a few clothes, had a third of their family fucking killed by IS, and then they get stared at by fucking Germans with looks of disgust on their faces. 

I apologized to the two brothers. It made them sad to see me sad,  they said. They called me ""sadiq"", which means friend in Arabic, and that touched me. They showed me pictures of their mom and dad and little sister and asked if they could take pictures with me so they could send them to their families. I'm glad that they and their families know there is someone here that wants to help them.

Fuck stereotypes. These people want to be happy just like everyone else in this fucking world. And even though I only helped them by showing them where the store was, I hope that they know now that there are people here in germany that want them here. I want these men to be safe, to be able to go back home one day to their families and be fucking happy.

I wish with all my heart that everyone in this world would want the same for everyone else.


Edit: I just would like to also say that there are *so* many people in germany who want to help the refugees. Just today alone I picked up 10 bags of men's clothes from different people for me to donate to their living place. I mentioned they needed electric kettles to my son's Oma, who isn't a fan of refugees, and she offered the two that were in the cellar for me to take. The people here are overall good people, but some buy in to what the media or hate groups say about the refugees. If they'd just take the time to help their minds would be changed. At least, I hope they would be..."
It took 7 hours to brush my hair out,"I’m not lying when I say it took 7 hours for my friend to brush through my hair. I’ve been suffering from severe bipolar depression since childhood. My hair had gotten so matted it was in clumps to my scalp. I hid this everyday by throwing it into a bun. With persistence my friend saturated my hair in coconut oil and tediously picked through the wreckage. I filled an entire Walmart bag of matted and broken hair. This is the first time in months that I can run my fingers through my hair and I cried at home with tears of joy. I made a doctors appointment to get back on my medication. Depression won’t win. There is hope for me.

Edit: I didn’t expect this thread to get as much attention as it did. Thank you for all the kind words and encouragement. It’s amazing to have such a supportive community here on Reddit. I never speak about sensitive subjects like this and it’s great to have an outlet, even if it is online. It feels nice to feel. "
I’ve gone 2 full days with no fast food or regular soda!!,"I know it seems stupid but I’ve been addicted to fast food and soda since I was very little. I grew up in a household where I was given soda at 6 months and fast food as soon as I could eat. I’m finally over 300lbs and a single mom. I’m doing this for us. I won’t have my daughter feel the way I’ve felt my entire life. Small changes first! This is the hardest change for me but I’m ready. I just wanted to tell someone. Thanks for letting me get it off my chest!

EDIT: I never expected this to blow up the way it did! Thank you strangers for all the support and encouragement! I’ve never had this kind of support in my life. I’m so grateful for everyone who read my post and left me tips and nice words. Today is day three. If I feel like eating bad or drinking soda I will come back to this post and read all these comments. 
Also a thanks to the strangers for my first gold and silver!! Thank you everyone for the support!"
I experienced my first kiss last night,"I'm a 19 year old male who went on a date last night. This is the first time I've hung out with this girl outside of work. We basically spent the whole date talking and getting to know each other. The last 15 minutes were the highlight though. We were sitting in my car listening to music and we started to share really personal stuff with each other to which I brought up the fact that I've never kissed a girl. She originally thought I was kidding but I reassured her I wasn't. She wrapped her arms around my arm and rested her head on my shoulder saying she didn't want to go home yet. I was terrified, I didn't know if I should make a move but I knew deep down I would hate myself if I didn't at least try. I asked if I could kiss her, She sat up and asked if I really wanted her to be my first kiss. She was surprised but in a good way. I said I was positive. We kinda stared at each other for a minute and then I just went for it, I leaned in and kissed her for about 3 or 4 seconds. She smiled afterwards and then went back to laying her head on my shoulder with one arm wrapped around my arm while she held my hand with the other. Some of the best 15 minutes of my life.

tl;dr - I experienced my first kiss with a girl."

I never knew one sentence could end a marriage so abruptly.,"I (31f) have been married for 5 years. I love my husband very much, but lately hes been really mean and disrespectful. I can't talk to him about anything concerning us without him flipping out and getting mad. We haven't shared a bed in 3 years and our sex life is next to nonexistent. We don't communicate well and its just getting toxic. We have two children together, and I have an older son with my ex. 


When my husband and I argue it escalates quickly so I always try to remain calm. If it gets bad enough, I take my kids to my moms house until things smooth over. Tonight, my husband pushed it too far and I'm seeking a divorce asap. We got into an argument because I was wiping down the counters and his phone went off. So I picked it up, took it over to him and said ""your mom just texted"". He FLIPPED and immediately assumed I went through his phone. I didn't. I happened to see a text come in because he has his notifactions turned on (oops my mistake). 

I asked him why it was a big deal, and he said ""cause I pay the fuckin bill. stay out of my shit"". I'm spent at this point so I just walk away. I hear him mumbling under his breath and slamming things around so I go back. I asked him if its ok if I take the kids to my moms for awhile and he said fine. I let my daughter play with my phone on the way to my moms. By the time we get there, hes texted me going off and calling me names. Unfortunately I'm used to that part so I just brushed it off. 

My oldest son from my previous relationship is autistic. I meant to mention that sooner. Anyways, brushing off his earlier comments pissed him off so his texts started getting worse. Then he sends me the worst sentence I've ever read. 

""have fun changing your sons diapers when hes 30"". My son is 11 and is still in diapers at night. I literally gasped when he sent that. I haven't responded. I can't. I have kids with my husband. I can handle him calling me names and shit, (handle, not like lol) but he crossed a line. I'm done.

"So, I just started reading a book to my girlfriend...","My (long distance) girlfriend has always liked going to sleep to the sound of my voice. Every night, even when she’s about ready to collapse from exhaustion, she’ll call me up, crawl in bed, set up her camera so we can see each other, and wait for me to start talking. She says it’s comforting and that she doesn’t like being/feeling alone when she drifts off. I don’t mind, she’s so sweet and watching her slowly fall asleep is the goddamn cutest thing ever. 

And so, for the past year, I’ve tried a lot of different things; sometimes I’ll make up a story as I go, other times I’ll just tell her about my day or what’s on my mind. You name it, I’ve probably done it. Recently however, she told me that she wanted me to read her a story. I can’t believe I didn’t ever think of that! Of course I said yes, I even drove all the way to her place to pick up a book of her choosing from her sizable collection.

Last night we started reading The Tale of Despereaux together and I’ve never been more happy. It’s small things like this that remind me of how much I love her. She relished every second of it; sometimes she’d ask me to give certain characters goofy voices, other times she’d sit there in a tense silence waiting to hear what happened next as I flipped the page. In the end, when she was only about half awake and only occasionally murmuring, I whispered my normal good night.

“Good night, I love you so much!! Have good dreams and a nice day tomorrow, I’ll talk to you later.”

After barely managing to mumble out the sweetest “I love you to,” I’ve ever heard she went to sleep. It was so perfect, it was as if we were living out a charming love story of our own. Now all I can think about is tomorrow night, I just want to spend more time with her. I want to hear her giggle at my bad French accent, I want to see the particular face she makes when a character she doesn’t like does something, most of all I just want her to wake up so I can tell her how much I love her. She really is a blessing, I’m lucky to have someone so kind and pure.

TL;DR: My girlfriend wanted me to read a book to her, it went very well. I love her to bits.

EDIT: I took a brief nap and damn did I reach a helluva lot of people. Thanks for all the lovely vibes, recommendations, and even my first ever Reddit Gold this’ll only make our story time that little bit sweeter when we do it again tonight. I’m glad this post was able to touch so many people; love is contagious and anything I can do to spread it around a little bit is good by me. Love y’all so much!!"
My dog saved me from making a bad decision last night.,"Sorry in advance for any rambling. I’m not sure who to talk to about this, or if I’m just making it a bigger deal then it is. Also on mobile. 

I went to hang out with my friend last night, just a girls night with some wine. I brought my dog with me because I hate leaving her alone and with wine night there was a chance I would be staying over anyways.

Thing did get crazy pretty quickly last night and her boyfriend invited his friends over after dinner. It wasn’t a big deal, we all had a merry time drinking, playing games etc. 

I don’t remember going to bed, I just remember being in the guest room with my pants off falling asleep, just me and my dog. And then there was a moment when one of his friends opened the door. He kept trying to get into bed with me and I remember saying no, get out. He kept pushing though and walked to the bed and that’s when my dog lost it. Barking, snarling, showing teeth. He got out of there quick and I fell asleep. 

The whole night she was a total love bug, playing with everyone, letting everyone pet her. She’s never had issues with anyone else in my bed before, not that it happens all the time, but generally she just wants to be the center of attention. 

I can’t help but to feel like she saved me last night. I don’t think she slept a wink because when I came home this morning she went directly to bed and has slept since we got home. 

She’ll be getting lots of love and treats today. 


Edit: 
I finally had a chance to sit down and talk with my friend about what happened. She told me that her boyfriend tried to convince his friend to not come into my room since the dog was there, and she said that the guy claimed it had “worked for him before” so he was determined. He came back stating that all he saw was teeth so that’s why he didn’t go in, but when my friend heard about the incident the next morning she was furious and told her boyfriend that this guy is not welcome over anymore and when she’s hanging with myself (or any of her any friends) he is not welcome to join us. 

Overall I’m glad she and I talked, I’m glad my puppy was there to stop him and I hope he learned his lesson, although I doubt it. "
Mentally healthy people put too much hope in suicide prevention hotlines.,"So these people think that Tony's wife never listened to him?  That Tony didn't have a therapist, or that he didn't take medication?  That he didn't have thousands of hardcore fans, each of them willing to listen to every problem or concern that crossed his mind?  They must think that none of these things were true to suggest that calling some random person who knew nothing about his issues or personal struggles could have magically talked him out of something he has probably been contemplating for a good majority of his life.

Imagine if you had a car that broke down.  Imagine further that your significant other is handy with a car took a look at it, but was unable to fix the issue.  So then you go to a real mechanic and they look at your car and do what they can to get it running, but it is still having issues despite taking it back to them weekly and paying out the ass.  Then imagine that someone tells you not to sell the car but to instead call a mechanic hotline and that they will fix all your problems over the phone by asking you minimal questions and telling you that everything is ok with your car. 

What that analogy doesn't capture though is the absolute weight of that car being broken down, or how long that car has been causing problems.  I am 36 this week; I have had suicidal thoughts since I was 7 or 8.  That is 28-29 YEARS of baggage.  Baggage that stuck with me when I had a lot of friends, baggage that I carry to a therapist, baggage that I carried through a happy marriage, baggage that I carry when I am with my daughter, baggage that I medicate.  Baggage that is so heavy and integral to my being to expect a random person to somehow come along and pick it up for me would be absurd.

This isn't me saying don't call the number if you are hurting.  I am not saying that it is a useless thing that shouldn't exist.  What I am saying is that just quoting it willy nilly to people who are hurting is a kin to trying to save someone who fell off a boat by just tossing the life saver ring out into the water and not holding onto the rope to pull the person back on deck.  Maybe you gave them a little more time or a little break, but you sure as shit didn't rescue them.  "
I GOT ACCEPTED INTO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL!!!!,"I am so shocked. I’m finally accepted into Cornell University. I never thought I’d make it to an Ivy. Since freshman year of high school I have worked my ass off in and out of the classroom, even going to Cornell during the summers of the past to meet with professors and admissions counselors so often to where they know me on a first name basis. Everyone told me to aim lower but I really reached for this and I made it. Considering that I am from a really small town in Upstate New York where no one moves farther than an hour away and almost always goes to a Community College I am astounded. This feels great especially as a half Native American boy off of the reservation I can proudly say I made it out of the little dead end town that consumes everyone in it. This is truly a miracle. God Bless. "
Two women changed my life and they don't even know I exist,"These two ladies profoundly impacted my life and I will never be able to thank them personally, so I will do it here.

First, to the random teenage girl on the train:

You were talking with your friend. She seemed really depressed because she could not get a boyfriend. I was half listening to the conversation while dozing off and heard you say:

""WHY do you want a boyfriend so much? What do you think will change in your life after getting a boyfriend?""

That woke me up. At the time, I was obsessing over getting a particular ""dream job"". I was depressed and anxious about it, I was crying over it. I was feeling like such a failure. It was all I could think or talk (and complain) about.

As soon as I got home, I made a list: ""Things that I think will change if I get my dream job"".

It ended up being such a long list. I was basically blaming all of life's problems, big and small on not having this particular job. Not only that, but I was also putting things ""on hold""' until after I got this job for no good reason. Like I needed a particular job title to join a gym or practice my hobby.

So I took that list and started DOING everything I wrote down. I started addressing the problems directly and finding outlets for the things I was not satisfied with. I still wanted the job, but my happiness did not depend on it. Since then, when I find myself obsessing over a particular thing, I always take the time to think if I'm using it as an excuse to not work on other problems I might have.

Thank you, teenage girl on the train. You were trying to help your friend and changed a stranger's life instead.

Second, to the woman that lives in an apartment somewhere above me:

You moved to the building shortly after I did. I heard some people move what sounded like a very heavy object up the stairs and you thanking them with such happiness in your voice. And then I heard music. You almost didn't wait for the movers to leave before you started playing that piano. And you kept playing. Every day.

Every day I heard the piano and I remember thinking ""She plays beautifully, I wish I was that good at my hobby"". And then I felt like an idiot. Because I was hearing you play every day while I was wasting time online. So I closed my laptop and got practicing.

I'm trying to build that habit now. Sometimes it's hard to find that motivation, sometimes I forget. But every day I hear you play, and every time I stop what I'm doing and practice for a little bit. I'm still not great, but I'm getting better.

Thank you, lady who lives in my building. You are just practicing a skill you enjoy and you inspired a stranger to do the same."
"Just had sex for the first time, twice!","I (27f) recently left a strict religion and decided to make decisions for myself. After talking to a guy for a few weeks, I decided to have sex! 

He was great and patient and made sure I had a good time, but most importantly it was my decision and I feel so damn free. Had sex twice, in several positions, and have never felt more confident in my own skin. 

At 27, I finally had sex and I don’t feel clingy, or as though I’ve lost my value, or anything negative at all.

Now to catch up on 10 years worth of sex. Woo! "
My girlfriend turns me down for sex,"..and I couldn't be more happy about it. We've only been dating for a few months, and she comes from a background with some sexual abuse. She made it clear to me that most of what she had done in the past was done out of feeling obligated to, and not actually enjoying it. With me, she'll initiate sex when she wants it, but she also will turn me down. 

Her feeling comfortable enough with me to tell me she doesn't want to do anything makes me so happy. I'm ecstatic that she doesn't feel as though our relationship is sex dependent, and that she's confident enough with me to tell me what she wants.

We haven't been dating for all that long, but this coupled with other factors makes me feel like this is the strongest basis for a relationship I've ever had, and the future of it excites me like nothing else."
"Every aurora borealis, every soldier coming home to their overjoyed dog, every beautifully old school cool photo...","...might be the last beautiful thing I see. I have stage 4 cancer and an uncertain amount of time left, with a constant possibility of complications . I don’t know if this is in the right place to post this but Reddit has got me crying tears of joy right now and I just need to get a big “thank you” off my chest. Thank you, Reddit community, for everything you do and are. I love you. You’ve made my life better. 

Edit: thanks for the gold, silver, and platinum, kind strangers!"
I (14M) think I just had the cutest brother sister (17F) moment in school today.,"So me and my sister have the same lunch and me and my friends had a big fight earlier that day so i didn't want to sit with them so I went and just sat a table that didn't have anyone there then my sister came over and said ""hey bud want to come sit with me and my friends"" i told her no I'm fine so instead of leaving and going back with her friends she just sat there with me i thought it was cute so i wanted to share it."
Vaccinate your fucking kids,Seriously. 
My boyfriend asked me to marry him and I haven't stopped crying since,"I have never met anyone funnier, or more caring, than my boyfriend. I am so, so excited to be sharing this man's last name, household, future. 

I can't believe this is happening! Every time I catch myself just having normal thoughts or doing day-to-day things, I start crying because I can't believe how lucky I am to be marrying my best friend soon. 

I can't believe he's choosing to spend the rest of his life with me. So, so blessed. ❤️"
"I let a man come over tonight. He didn't have a condom, so I told him we could still hook up, just no PIV stuff. He wasn't gracious.","He brought it back up at every turn. Saying he wanted to be inside me, asking me to let him, etc. Probably about 6 times and i kept saying ""yeah dude, you don't have a condom. not happening."" I was going down on him trying to finish him when he pulled me on him and tried to put himself in me unprotected and I finally just jumped off of him and told him to get the fuck out of my place. 

He got really fucking defensive. he was like don't be like this, blah blah. and i was like dude i had to tell you at least 5 times that penetration was off the table completely and you literally just tried to penetrate me. and he was just like "" I DIDN'T PENETRATE U THO. U SAID NO AND I STOPPED"" and i was like yeah i also said no more than enough times before having to fucking YELL that for you to know. as a grown ass man that shit is unacceptable . that's more than enough for me to not want you in my fucking house.  

i hate this. i can't stop crying. 

EDIT: Wow, I can't thank you guys enough for your kindness and support. After I made this post I calmed down a bit and went to sleep and waking up to this was so wonderful. Thank you so, so much. I hate how many of us have had experiences just like this. Sometimes we kick him out, sometimes we don't, and in either case it isn't our fucking fault it happened. I am so proud of each of you and your resilience in the face of such awful circumstances. Keep fighting, and remember you deserve just as much support from yourself as you've offered me. I love you guys <3

"I have been living in poverty for years now. I almost committed suicide a few months ago. I just got an inheritance from my grandmother of nearly 800,000 dollars."," 

I  made a lot of mistakes growing up. My parents were drug addicts, and I  did a lot of drugs (not heroin like they did) and alcohol growing up. I  also grew up in a horrendous, violent neighborhood. I struggled with  PTSD from being exposed to so much violence there at a young age,  shootings, beatings, everything imaginable.

At  17, I got a girl pregnant. I tried to be a good father, I really did,  but as the years went by it was just so difficult to provide for them  financially. I spent my entire 20s literally up my ass in bills, paying  for healthcare, rent, childcare etc. Me and Chelsea (my kids mom) never  got married but we lived in the same apartment building so we basically  were still mom and dad, even though we never actually really were in a  relationship, we still were together, a lot. Then she got pregnant  again, by me, when I was 27 years old. I was sort of able to provide  before then, we were poor but not too poor, but after the second kid? It  was just too much. I was scrapping by for literally any money I could  possibly find. I was working 70+ hours a week at low wage jobs. I was  content with my first child, I loved him, but at the same time I wanted  my life to actually BEGIN when he turned 18 and went to college and  such. Now a second child? Another 18 years of me working to death to  support them? I love my daughter more than anything but I was  distraught, basically suicidal for years after she was born. I was 27  years old, I would be 'free' and finally be able to live my own life and  go to college and get a good career... by 45 years old. The thought of  it was so horrible to even imagine, it felt like I was in a prison.

When  I was 29 years old, I ended up nearly killing myself because of the  stress. Not just the work, but everything, I was mentally destroyed.  Every single day was like torment. I recovered, but not really by much.

A  year has passed by since I almost committed suicide. My grandmother  died. I never knew her, at all. I knew that she lived in NYC and that  she was a Russian jewish immigrant. My mom ran away from her when she  was 19 years old so I never really met her except twice in my life.

Turns  out my grandmother left me 773,000 dollars, and she also left me  countless items of inheritance. Her apartment in the upper west side of  Manhattan, a ton of gold and silver jewelry. When I found out, I just  could not stop crying.

I didn't even tell  my Chelsea right away, instead I took our family to a surprise dinner  at a fancy restaurant. She was upset and confused as to how we were  getting the money to afford this, and then I told her and she just  couldn't even contain how happy she was.

Its  been 3 months. Dealing with the legal process of the apartment and the  inheritance is difficult, but we are dealing with it. We plan on taking  150k and putting it for the college fund of each of our kids, then  taking another 250k and putting it in savings, then we have the rest to  decide what to do with. Buy a home most likely. Then once we sell the  apartment (worth 1.5 million\~)... then I really don't know what the hell  is gonna happen. Its so much money i almost don't even know what the  hell to do.

I am just blown away at this.  Everything. It feels like I died and went to heaven. Every time I think  about it I just start crying in happiness."
I let an abused child go home with her abuser,"I’m a teacher and I love my job. It’s the best job but sometimes it takes a toll. Yesterday one of my students came back for the first time since the week prior. She has spotty attendance. She also has lice that has been untreated since the start of the school year.  I was excited she was back but annoyed at her constant absences. 

When she came in, she had ink on her hand. I didn’t think much of it. Later I realized it was bruising and not ink. I took her to the nurse where she said she had extensive bruising on both thighs as well. She said she was beaten by her mother. It took everything in me not to fall apart in front of her. Just watching her curl into a ball while telling us and admitting she was afraid to tell because she didn’t want to get taken away again. She said she was worried she would be in trouble for telling. 

I called CPS and waited on hold for 45 minutes. When I finally got through, the woman taking the report didn’t know what lice was and wasn’t familiar with the common household item that was used to hit her. After an hour and a half of hold time and reporting, they said they weren’t going to come out today! How?

They must have called the family to say they wanted to see the kid because the mom came to pick her up early. I asked my admin if there was anything we could do and the answer was no. We had done the most we could without committing kidnapping. It broke a little bit of my soul to send her home. 

I’m waiting for my kids to come in right now. They will be at my door in 2 minutes and hope that she’s here today. I am not confident she will be. I know they’ve run away with the kids to other states before to avoid charges of neglect. I also hope that if she comes back she will still trust me and the other staff. 

Update: she isn’t here nor is the other child. I had not considered calling the police but will on my lunch and will update! Thank you for the advice. It’s hard to consider the other options when you are told there aren’t any. 

Update 2: I called CPS again and requested a call back for an update but couldn’t get through to a real person. Hopefully I’ll here back soon. I also called the police and asked to check on the welfare. The problem is that the address we have on file is incorrect and I know they live in another city but have this one on record for the school. I don’t know their other address. The police are going to her address on file and then will proceed from there. Alas, nothing is simple or speedy. 

Update 3: I just heard from the school nurse. A social worker was in touch but they deferred to the police. The police caught them trying to flee. They did end up getting them and the student is being evaluated at the hospital and she is being removed from the home!!!!!!!  I’m so happy they found her before they got away. The family is trying all sorts of things to try and confuse the police about what happened, but it will work out.

Minor update 4: I told my assistant principal about the call I made just so she wasn’t blind sided by it and she was happy I called. I was worried she would be mad that I went around the system but she wasn’t. Also, she can stay at our school technically. Being removed from her house means she is homeless and she is allowed to remain at our school even though she is out of district. It’s a little victory that I hope her temporary housing family will help to maintain for her. "
My boyfriend cried in my arms,"My Boyfriends is pretty masculine, wears a Beard and is pretty Buff and not the kind of guy that is super into cozy stuff. 

So one night we took a bath together and I sat behind him and started washing him. He was  a bit  defensive at first but started to relax after some time. I massaged his Head and washed his hair, kissed his neck. We didn't had Sex or something I just felt that he needed some love and some body contact. After the Bath we didn't talk we just kind of communicated without words. We went to the Bedroom and we laid down. He laid his head on my chest and i put my arm around him. After sometime I grabbed a Book from my Nightstand and started reading to him while stroking his hair with my fingers. After some time i noticed that he was crying. I didn't say anything just put the book aside and hugged him really tight and kissed his forehead. He just said a really quite ""Thank you"" and fell asleep on my chest. 

I just wanted to share and tell you guys because I think that doesn't matter how ""Manly"" a guy is or how thug he acts they are all just Humans after all and need love and care too. We do this now at least once every 2 weeks and he really loves it and our relationship was never so intimit and loving. 

Edit : 

sorry for using ""After some time"" so often. English is my second language and pretty much self thought.


Edit 2:

HOLY GUACAMOLE
I am so overwhelmed by all the absolute sweet comments and the feedback I've been given.

Also i got my first Reddit Gold. Thank you sooo much kind Stranger, much appreciated. 

I'm trying my best to answer asap i can. I wish you all only the best in the world and I hope you have a wonderful Week. God bless ur souls. "
I finally signed up for college today. At the age of 32 I’m actually going to make something of myself.,"My mom was neglectful and my dad was always telling me I would never amount to anything. Calling me stupid and dumb always making fun of my weight and anything else he could point out that he thought was a flaw. I never thought I would actually make it to this point. My PTSD and anxiety has held me back for so many years...But I did it guys. Some day I’m going to be able to help children that are going through what I went through. I’ll be able to let them know that it’s going to be OK and that they have someone looking out for them. 

EDIT: Wow! thank you all so much for the kind words you have no idea just how grateful I am for every single one of you. "
So guys...my boyfriend lied to me again and I am jumping with joy!,"So. 
He has lied and cheated multiples times. I was trying to trust him ...he said he wants to build my trust but I have been suspicious. Then after many suspicious events, today he lied again. 100% lied. He had someone at his place and he wouldn't video call me for 19 minutes after a whispering call. 
So the reason I am joyful is that I am done ...I am free. No more him. 
I don't have time try and save a relationship in so much pain. He is a deceiver. And I can go back to my life. Which is simple beautiful and just ok. 
He would be an amazing husband but what would I do with his pampering and affection and fun, if I never feel safe?

So I was sad and heartbroken 
Then I realized I shd be joyful

The universe decided for me

To the ulta employee who called my acne horrible,"It’s been four days and I’m still not over it. I went to you to get a facial for my acne and instead you called it horrible and treated it like it’s contagious. Guess what, this is the clearest my skin has been in MONTHS. I’ll continue working towards my skin and will no longer seek your opinion. I’ve found another facial person who is much nicer than you. "
"I am a convicted felon, recovery from 6 years of stimulant abuse & I start back to college next week for the first time in 8 years. I just bought a backpack :)","I went to college when I was 18 but they didn't offer a degree in.....hallucinogens.

I am 28 years old. My background is going to prevent me from going into a lot of fields.

If anyone has advice about a good field for a felon, please let me know.

I'm worried that everyone will be able to tell that I've been to prison, or that i've been deeply involved in my past with drugs. I’ve been clean for over 3 years now.

\*\*Edit: thanks for all the positive messages! Everyone has been great, I’m really surprised at the high response!

\*\* Edit #2.  Thanks again everyone. I’m driving all day but I will go through and read each reply this evening along with replying to many of you. Thank you for the encouragement. It’s really heart warming!!

***\*\*FINAL EDIT:***   I am more optimistic about the future having interacted and spoken with many of you. I have read each of your comments (More than 300), I have saved many of your replies and words of encouragement so I can refer to them later. I feel that I have experienced the very best of the internet today. Most people are so quick to brush past those with a background like mine. Several of you sent me Reddit ""Gold"", and nearly all of you have touched my heart in a way that I needed right here at the start of my journey.

Some of you are in my position, many of you have family and friends that have been in my position. People from every field of study and practice gave me advice in addition to others who sought out information just so they could share it in the comments.

Reading your replies have kept me smiling all day long and will keep me motivated long into the future. Never underestimate how even a short phrase of encouragement can impact even a total stranger. I've learned something from this post that I didn't intend. It doesn't matter what I do with my college education. The world has enough successful people. If I can muster an ounce of the compassion that was expressed towards me here for the benefit of others thats where the real ""gold"" is found.

Thank you everyone.

My boyfriend is fucking terrible at being secretive,"I overheard him on the phone today talking to his mom about how I’m the one and that he’s been looking for the perfect ring. I love him so much. I am truly blessed to have met the most kind, sweet hearted man "
To the girl who was horribly bullied and abused in high school. I still think about you and I am so sorry.,"This was back in the mid 80s, my high school years were straight out of a John Hughes movie. I have so many happy memories but every once in a while I am plagued by memories of Sarah. This will be very long, I have a lot to get out. **The TL;DR is that I had a friend who vicariously lived her life through me because she was being abused in every way at home and at school. I am wracked by guilt still decades later about what more I could have done.**

Abuse, sexual assault and suicidal trigger warnings.

I met Sarah on the first day of freshman year. She was the tallest girl I had ever seen.  She was slim, freckled and had a head full of corkscrew curls, bright orange-red, that fell down passed her shoulders. Everyone snickered and whispered. But I said ""Wow, I love your hair, so pretty!"" and went up and touched one of the springy curls. Sarah slightly recoiled and blushed bright red but then burst into a huge smile and said ""thanks."" I said ""very choice"" and sat down. She took the seat behind me, that was how I met the girl who I haven't been able to stop thinking about 31 years later.

Sarah didn't dress like my friends and I. Or like any of the cliques in school. I was this post punk pre goth who was lucky enough to be alive when that music was in its heyday. My basic ""uniform"" was docs, knee socks, short skirt, band shirt and a bomber jacket. Sarah always thought everything I wore was the most amazingly cool article of clothing she had ever seen. When in reality I looked like every one of my girl friends and actually my guy friends too, just exchange the skirt for some tight black pants. 

She was bullied for her clothes, height, hair, shyness - but I liked her. As she opened up she was a really sweet, cool girl. 

I started to wonder why Sarah never dressed like us since she seemed to love it so much. Then I started to notice that *she too* almost wore the same thing everyday. The same khaki pants or acid washed jeans. The same three shirts. Same penny loafers. Same windbreaker, no makeup or nail polish. The same earrings that were used to pierce her ears. I realized her family must not have much money. My little group got a lot of our things at thrift stores so I invited her to go with us one day after school. She said she couldn't and I said okay maybe some other time and she said yea maybe ... pretty unconvincingly. When I walked back over to my friends they had a lot of rude things say about her. I was a teenage girl ... so I am pretty ashamed to admit that I said ""Yea she is pretty weird.""

She loved looking at my brother's picture, handsome in his uniform. She asked me all about him. I think she developed a safe little crush on him. One day she asked who ""Bauhaus"" was because the name was artfully scribbled on my pee chee folder. I gave her a mixtape of all my favorite bands and songs and a walkman. She wore those headphones everywhere. Bauhaus became her favorite.

I never ever saw her during lunch or any school events or at the mall where basically the entire school went every weekend. She never went to any parties. She always had an excuse when I asked her to do something outside of school. I only ever saw her in our shared classes or the halls with those headphones on. So sophomore year when she asked me to her birthday sleepover I was shocked but let her know that of course I would be there. I finally learned why she was ""pretty weird"". 

She lived in a very typical split level 80s house. Nice car in the driveway. Her typical 80s mom answered the door. Sarah introduced me to her step dad, a short and plump soft looking man who appeared much older than her mother. She had two half siblings. Adorable little spoiled brats. Her dad looked me up and down like I was dangerous, but there was something foreign and equally as dangerous in his slight smile.

""You have your ears pierced ... twice."" and then he gave a knowing look to Sarah's mom. 

She said to me, ""Your parents allowed that?"" 

""Yes, Mrs. Duncan my mom helped me do it."" 

""Don't call me that, that is *her dads* name"" 

""Oh I'm so ..."" 

Her step dad cut me off.""You did them yourself?"" Before I could answer he stepped forward and slipped his hands in my jacket looking at my t-shirt, ""What does your shirt say?"" 

""The Cure uh Mr....""

""Randall"" 

""The Cure, Mr. Randall, its a band"" 

""Hmmm, we don't listen to that nonsense music here."" 

I realized then that to Sarah's parents I *was* dangerous. I was a typical 80's teenager. 

Sarah's birthday party was just her family and myself. Which included her mentally disabled aunt that Sarah shared a room with. Her aunt rocked and stared and made a low moaning sound until she would point and grunt at something she wanted. Later that evening she pointed at a button on my jacket that was hanging on a chair, Sarah's mom removed it and handed it to her and never said a word to me.

During dinner her little siblings treated Sarah horribly. Her parents treated her like she wasn't there. I did my best to be polite, talk to Sarah and wonder if I could get out of sleeping over. I wish I had. I was expected to share a queen size canopy bed with Sarah and her aunt. 

During the night I got up, grabbed my makeup bag, my clothes and Sarah's hand. We went downstairs to a bathroom and she was both giddy and terrified when I started putting makeup on her. She began asking me ALL the questions. Had I ever kissed a boy? How far had I gone? What did my bedroom look like? Could I use my car outside of school? What was my mom like? On and on. I had never heard her talk so much.

I answered all her questions, dressed her head to toe and then turned her towards the mirror. She actually gasped. I think for a moment she didn't believe she was seeing herself. I told her again how pretty her hair was and how I wished I had red hair like hers. I said ""You must look like your dad"" since she looked nothing like her family. She teared up and said that she didn't know she had never seen him. I didn't know what to say with my foot in my mouth and all but then the dam broke.

She told me how her mother hated her and would always tell her she was just like her father. How her siblings got everything and she had to beg for anything. How when she got home from school she had to sit at the dining room table so they could keep an eye on her until bed time. She was never ever allowed to go anywhere without a parent. Sarah was born when her mother was 15 and she was being punished for it. I just listened. It was horrible, mentally, physically and emotionally abusive. I hugged Sarah for a really long time and she cried like she had never been allowed to cry before.

I told her she could keep my clothes and my makeup bag. She looked like she wanted to say yes but she reluctantly took it all off. We started to sneak back upstairs when her stepdad stopped us. Sarah was paralyzed with fear and I was scared too but I tried to play it off. I said ""Oh hey Mr Randall, just heading back up to bed."" I took Sarah's hand but he grabbed my other. He then told her to go upstairs. She looked at me for a second then did as she was told. 

He watched her go then pulled me tight to him. He put his hand up my nightgown and cupped my bare breast. He rubbed his hard crotch against my hip. 
He said in my ear ""I can be persuaded to not tell Mrs Randall about this ... if you pay the sweet tax."" 

I was furious and terrified but I had been raised differently. I looked him right in the eye and with all the false bravado I could muster said, ""My brother is a marine, my uncle is a sheriff and both he and my dad are vietnam vets. So if I were you I wouldn't say a thing to Mrs Randall."" 

He stared at me for the longest few seconds of my life, he looked a little scared and a little stunned and a little like ""sweet tax"" might be worth it anyway. In the end he smiled and let go. He did a very creepy overly exaggerated courtly bow and waved me upstairs. 

Sarah seemed surprised to see me so soon. I asked her if she had ever had to pay the sweet tax before. She started to cry again and kept saying ""I'm sorry, I'm sorry."" I got dressed and got my things. I noticed when I said sweet tax her aunt became agitated, I wondered how many times she had paid it. Finally when I heard footsteps pass us and a door open and close I left that house of horrors. 

When I got home I woke my parents and told them, it took everything my mom had to convince my dad not to go back there with a shotgun. Part of me wanted him to. My uncle was called and he came over right away. He agreed with my mom, that this could all go very badly for Sarah. He said it would be ""he said, she said"" and even though I am his niece Sarah would have to admit to sexual abuse for services to step in. He said he would go and take care of him right now if I wanted him to. I didn't know what that meant and I didn't ask. I just said no.

Sarah avoided me at school for weeks and I was glad. Finally we came face to face in a bathroom and she made to leave quickly. I grabbed her arm and said ""talk to me"".

She shook her head and said ""I can't.""

I had never been so angry in my life and shouted, ""Really? *Now* you can't talk to me?""

She lifted up her shirt and there were three curling iron burns, that looked infected on her side. ""No I can't and I can't ever talk to you again."" She looked down biting her lip and pitifully said ""I'm so sorry, I know you wish you had never met me.""

""That isn't true."" 

She smiled, the saddest smile and said ""I wish I had never met me"" and left.

We didn't speak again until the following year. Before classes started one of my friends told me she saw *Big Red Bag Lady* (her school wide nickname) crying in the bathroom. I found her and her hair had been chopped off. It looked like a raggedy fuzzy orange pyramid. I didn't say a word I just took her hand. She let me lead her to one of my favorite teachers. He was so kind. Looking back now as an adult I realize he was a closeted gay man and I wonder what struggles he himself was facing. Sarah told us her mother in a fit of rage had cut her hair off. I told Sarah that my cousin was a hairdresser and I would take her right now to get it fixed. My teacher said he would cover for us. She refused. She said it would only make it worse and it would grow back. She was hollow, she was frail and she was defeated. After she left I told my teacher about how her step dad had touched me. He looked disgusted and like he wanted to cry. He put his hand on my shoulder and said ""Just be her friend. She won't be in that house forever."" And he was right.

Seven weeks later, Sarah slit her wrists while she was in the bed she shared with her aunt.

People came to our school and we had an assembly. Afterwards we all had to talk to someone and prove we weren't suicidal. I couldn't eat or sleep and I was wracked with sadness and guilt.  But I had a good and loving family who got me through it.

I went to Sarah's funeral. My brother took leave and he, my dad and uncle went with me. We sat in the back and watched as Sarah's mom became a poster child for grieving mothers. She even buckled at the knees and wailed at Sarah's casket. She cried out for everyone to hear. 
""Her hair, her beautiful hair, we knew she had *the sickness* when she cut off all her beautiful hair.""
My brother had his arm around me so tightly because I was shaking so badly that my arm started to go numb. 

At the graveside her stepfather gave us a flourished hand wave and almost sounded jovial as he said ""salutations"". My uncle had a vice grip on my dad but my brother went up to her stepfather and hugged him while whispering in his ear. I don't know what he said, I never asked, but Sarah's step dad looked like he had just seen her ghost.

When it was all mercifully over I saw a man who looked familiar. I walked over to where he was watching from a distance.

""Are you Sarah's dad?"" 

He looked at me for a moment with tear rimmed haunted eyes ""Yes, I am."" 

""You have her hair""

I started to cry as I put my arms around him. He tensed up for a moment, then breathed out and hugged me, so tight, so fatherly. I like to think that for one brief moment he felt he was hugging his own daughter for the first time. I noticed a woman in the car with two boys - both looked just like Sarah.


I think about you Sarah. I wonder who you would have become. I know you wanted to open a cafe and serve sweets and sandwiches. I wonder if we could have been friends once you were free from that hell. I think of you when I look at my three daughters. Who are the very light of my heart. I especially think of you when I look at my oldest who is 15 but still looks 8 years old through my mom goggles. My daughter with her pink hair and her father's eyes. When I tell her that she lights up, because she is the light of his heart too. I think about you when my only son, who I probably spoil too much, rolls his eyes at the fact that his father and I are ""still goth"". 

I think about you whenever I hear bauhaus.

And I am so so sorry. Sorry that every adult failed you. Sorry that I failed you. Sorry that some adults take their own baggage out on their children. Sorry that some adults are disgusting and cross boundaries. Sorry that you never got that feeling of rushing home to make curfew, sharing one beer between 10 friends, that feeling of first kissing a boy. I am so sorry that I wasn't a better friend for you. 

But it is different now, Sarah. Teachers step in. People believe. Bullies are confronted. Different isn't seen as so bad now. 

You are still with me, Sarah, and you always will be. "
My gf held my hands while argument,"So basically I told her that we need to talk about us (didn't get enough affection from her but this doesn't matter )

She sat in front of me grabbed my hands , held them tightly  and told me (with very sweet and gentle voice)that I have to remember that no matter what I say she is my ally and the only winner of this talk should be our relationship 

Then I dropped some tears  because how beautiful she said that and she hugged me very tightly then I told her about my problem and it and we figured out that she just didn't know that I needed it (stupid guys don't need affection stereotype) 

She said that she will make sure I will be the most loved boyfriend in the universe and then we  fallen asleep me on her chest and she stroking my head and kissing my forehead 

I love her soooooooo much 

 EDIT : Holy shit 42 k views and 4k upvotes I Did not expect that
 love you all guys "
Had an encounter with a police officer as a Black man that I thought would end my life,"I'm posting this aware of the hate I will receive. I am going to post this and not come back to it, because I just need to get it out. I am not reading your hate comments or comments invalidating this experience I had. 

On Monday afternoon, I was working late at my job. I was supposed to be working with a professor in the lab that evening (I'm a medical student). I told my professor that I wouldn't be able to meet with him as promised, but I would make it to the lab after it closes if he thought it okay. He said it was fine and said he would speak to security to let them know I would be in after hours. (Note: It is NOT uncommon to have students working in labs at all hours of the night. I go to an Ivy League institution and went to an Ivy League for my undergraduate education, too. Many of my friends have slept in labs.) 

I go to the lab, the security person working at the front desk says I have been cleared by my professor, but she was on her way out and would let the incoming security guard know I'd be in the lab. I said thanks and went on with my evening. 

About four hours later--it's almost 10 PM at that point--I'm immersed in my assignment, trying to get done, because I need to be in bed before midnight. Without warning, the door to the lab opened and a security guard I hadn't seen before (a white man) asked me what I was doing. I looked at my white lab coat, stared at him through my thick goggles, and raised the tongs I had in my right hand. ""I'm working on homework,"" I said. My heart was already at about 110 BPM, and I average about 65 BPM. 

The guard asked if I had permission, and I said yes. I told him the earlier guard said they'd let the new guard know I'm in the office. I gave him my professor's info and a business card. The guard didn't care; he immediately asked if I was a student. I said yes. I reached for my campus ID and the guard reached for his taser. I started shaking violently and I thought I was going to throw up. I told him I was going to get my ID. He told me to stand up and leave the lab and that he was calling campus safety (basically campus police). 

I didn't want to contaminate my sample (I had been working on it for almost five hours), so I tried to cover it gently, but the security guard walked up and pulled my arm away and everything fell off the table. I didn't make a sound. I just followed him as he called campus safety. 

Campus safety arrived as I sat in the lobby and I just knew it would all be resolved. *I'm a nice, soft-spoken Black guy. I don't have dreads or muscles or anything like that. I'm average height. They won't shoot me. My hands are in my lap.* All of these thoughts were eradicated when a (white) campus safety officer walked through the door and began speaking to the security guard. It was like I wasn't even there. 

""He said he was given permission to be here,"" the guard said. 

""Yeah, probably just a punk trying to cheat or steal something,"" the campus safety guy shot back. 

I went against every Black person's safety guidelines when police are present: I spoke up. I advocated for myself. 

I jumped in and said, ""No, my professor said I could be here. You can call him."" The campus safety officer walked over to me and asked me to search and frisk me for any ""stolen property."" I said I didn't feel comfortable. He said I didn't have a choice or I can be detained. I let him. As he was searching me, his hand roaming down and up my shaking legs, he asked me what I was studying. I told him, with precision, what I was studying, where I had done my undergrad, where my parents lived. Basically my entire resume. I think I even regurgitated a project I had received global recognition for. 

I just wanted him to see me as a person in case he shot me. 

He finished up and told me to leave the building. I asked if I could go back and get my backpack. We went to the lab, the campus safety officer searched my backpack, then told me to clean up the mess I had made when my materials fell on the floor. I got down on my hands and knees and scrubbed the tile while the guard and the officer watched. They made small talk. Apparently the guard had just transitioned to nights. They watched me the whole time. 

When I was done, I left and was told to only be in the lab during business hours. As I left the building, I could see other lights on with students in the windows. Each hunched over their homework, concentrating, unaware that I was leaving -- devastated, humiliated, and exposed. 

The next day, I expected my professor to completely fail me for not getting my assignment done on time. When I went to his office, he told me he had received a report from campus safety about me and asked what had happened. I told him what I said here. He began to cry. He's an American Muslim. He told me in the report I was caught stealing and vandalizing equipment and that nothing I said to him was reflected in that report. I was shocked. 

He said he knew something was wrong with the report the moment he read it, because he knew I wasn't that type of person. Even if I was--even if I had vandalized and stolen something--why go to such extremes to reprimand instead of having a conversation with the student? He told me about his experiences of being bullied and targeted for being Muslim. He told me he knew what I was feeling and to take some time off. He gave me a full pass on the assignment and a chance to re-do it. 

I sat in my car and cried. My professor asked if I wanted to file a report and make it known. He told me that since I go to an Ivy League, it would easily gain traction in the media. They could pull security footage and see that I was telling the truth. It could be a big deal. I said no. 

I just want to be a student, not an activist or another person that's taking social media by storm via hashtags. 

I sat in my car and cried my eyes out. It's really not fair. I don't want this. I love police officers. I do. I respect them. I could never do their work. But why... God, why am I--and millions of others--treated like this? I have only ever had positive experiences with police up until now. When I see hashtags about police violence, I always say to myself, ""Well, at least it's not me."" But now it *is* me. 

The only things I want for myself: I want to get my MD, be a doctor, make people better, and just live my life. 

Things I don't want for myself: to get shot for being Black. 

Thank you. 

**Edit:** While I didn't read any of your comments intentionally, I did feel immense guilt for not reporting this adequately. I reached out to my faculty person and he actually did report it anyway. It was anonymous, of course, but he is scheduled to meet with the dean of the department and I am invited to that meeting. It's next week. 

But I do want to say one thing: I gave in and read a few comments, and I see a lot of you saying it is my responsibility to report this or else someone could die or it could be worse. Yes, it can be. It could be. It *will* be, but don't you see how fucked up that is? That it's still my responsibility to bring this up to the very people that don't give a fuck? Don't you see how devastating this is for me? I want to be angry at you all telling me to tell people and speak up. I do, but I know you're only telling me because it's what's best. In this situation, I don't get a choice and I'm recognizing that now. I think my choices were taken from me when I was born Black. 

This is so frustrating and horrifying. 

Another clarification: I wrote in this post that I'm non-threatening and that I don't have dreads or muscles. In no way did I mean those as bad or ugly things to have while being Black; on the contrary, I think all Black is beautiful. But not everyone thinks that, and I just wanted to add it for sake of showing how absurd it all is. 

To all of my Black friends who have read this: thank you for surviving this far, even if you don't experience or racism or bigotry on the levels that others do. Your courage to still be Black and alive is inspiring to me, and I have to do something. "
My wife is blind and I wouldn't have it any other way,"I got married to my girlfriend of six years last month, shes has no sight whatsoever, and I wouldn't have it any other way. 

You see. There are things about her blindness that are so adorable, funny and cute. Every time we are in the same room I gently reach for her hand or touch her shoulders so she knows I'm in the same room and I see her face brighten up every single time. 

Supporting her blindness, and serving her as a partner and now husband makes me so happy. It's become such a pleasure and joy that if she became a sighted person, While I would be happy for her, part of me would wish to go back.


"
I am so incredibly happy I cleaned my flat and I can't tell anyone!,"So, I am chronically depressed and have real issues to keep my flat clean. And I do not mean ""forgets to vacuum"" oh boy no. I mean "" stacking garbage that high that some rooms become uninhabitable"".

Of course that is not a thing you tell people. I am far too much ashamed to let anyone know.

Three full days of intense work went into ordering my things, collecting garbage off the floor, stuffing all in all 12 giant blue garbage bags with everything plastic, stacking eight crates with old paper and bringing everything to a collection point, then cleaning everything, **EVERYTHING**, and fighting the smell and the flies.

Now I am done. You could eat off of the floor right now. Everything smells great and looks even better. My kitchen sink is gleaming and has no dirty dishes in it and everything looks just so inviting. No flies anywhere and have I mentioned how great and clean it smells?

I was not able to have friends over for a year now. A YEAR! But now I'm inviting everyone. Still can't tell them why I never invited them though. So I am telling you Reddit. Because I just have to tell someone how great and accomplished I feel right now.

Edit: My inbox is overflowing from all the support and cheers I'm getting. You people are the best! This means so much to me!

Edit2: There are so many of you! Wow people I can not reply to everyone but I'll upvote each and everyone of you loveable Redditors. Thank you for the incredible support!

Edit3: Holy crap people! I've been gilded and this is now my top post of all time. So many people have said that my post inspires them to clean up themselves and this makes me even happier than my own clean flat. Having a positive influence on cleanlyness is the last thing **I** would have **ever** expected XD

Please do feel encouraged. It is hard work, but it's **WAY LESS** work than it seems when you stand there and stare at the chaos. Just power through and open your eyes to the improvements. Feel encouraged by your own progress and believe me when I tell you it feels absolutely positively **AMAZING** when you are done. It's like the shutters have opened to let light in, like a big weight has been lifted off your chest and you have such a good and valid reason to be proud of yourself. Heck I've made videos on my phone to remind myself how it feels and I will definetly use them to keep my power level up.

I love you all you wonderful people!"
What my sister will never know,"Tonight was probably the worst St. Patrick’s day I’ve had yet. I was the DD for my younger sister [21F] and her friends. We had plans to go to this club in Detroit. Before we went to the club we stopped at her friends apartment so they could pre-game. My sister was driving at the time because she was sober still and ended up parking in someone’s reserved spot.

Fast forward an hour or so one of her friends gets sloppy drunk and is throwing up outside. I go to check on him and notice my sisters car wasnt there, so I go inside and tell her. Turns out her car had gotten towed by the people who the parking space belonged to. So we all pile into one of her friends car and drive to the tow lot. 

They ended up charging her 380 dollars for her to get her car back. The whole time she is sobbing in the back because she didn’t have the money. By this time the night was pretty much ruined so we asked her friend to give us a ride home. 

On the Way home she is trying to figure out how to pay the money to get her car, and one of her friends dad (who is trying to sleep with her btw) tells her he’ll pay for it, in exchange for a date. Once we get home she tells me she is going to do it and I finally talked her out of it because that’s... well that’s something I never want my little sister to have to ever resort to. 

We moved some money around and finally figured out what to do, so I drove her back to get her car. We split ways and are going to meet at McDonald’s to get some food to make us feel better. While I’m sitting in the McDonald’s parking lot waiting for her I get a phone call from her that she was pulled over and blew a ,074 which is .006 below the legal limit. So she luckily doesn’t get a DUI, but I have to come pick her up because the cop wasn’t going to let her drive her car home.

We had to ditch her car in a liquor store parking lot, and the cop tells us that if we don’t move the car before 7 am the owner will tow it. He gives her a ticket for speeding and then send us on our Way. 

By this point my sister has probably had the worst night of her life and hits a low that I havent seen her hit in a long time. She used to cut herself and I knew it was on her mind. I assured her that I would get her car back and not to worry. She didn’t want to tell our mom because she’d flip, so I told her I’d figure it out. 

I sat up with her until she fell asleep to make sure she didn’t cut, and then bundled up and walked around 8 miles to get her car from the liquor store. She will never know that i walked that far to get her car back. And I don’t want her to. Tonight was horrible for her and I just couldn’t bare it getting any worse. Sorry this is such a long post, but I just needed to get tonight off my chest. 


Edit: thank you so much for the support! Family always comes first in my eyes, and I’d do anything for them. I’m sure she would have done the same for me. And I’m her brother, I forgot to identify my gender in there. Oops ! 

Edit: Also as some of you pointed out she was driving under the influence, which I feel like was partly my fault because I let her take her car home, we had to get it that night tho or the price was going to keep going up. Still inexcusable and I don’t have much sympathy for her receiving a ticket or anything either. But I couldn’t let her get her car towed twice 🤷🏼‍♂️"
I FUCKING DID IT,"i just came out to my mom as gay, and she said she was gonna support me no matter what... i must be dreaming

EDIT: thank y'all soooooo much for all these great and supportive responses, thanks a lot for a gold n' silver too!
if you're struggling with the same problem, don't lose hope, everything is possible! i'm always here to talk and help ya guys, so don't be afraid to hit me up!"
Can't tell family so I'm telling you internet stranger.,"My 17 year old brother was killed about 3 years ago in a vehicle collision. He was stopped for road work and was rear ended by a semi. Semi driver was found at fault and convicted.

I think about him constantly. The happiest part my day is that split second after waking up. Because in that moment I forget he's dead. 

I regularly dream he's still alive and the whole thing was a crazy misunderstanding. We laugh, we hug and I tell him I'm so relieved. Then I wake up and he's still dead.

Just now I was browsing Netflix and saw a show I know he watched. So I thought I'd call him and ask if he recommends it. And then I remembered, he's dead.

He was my identity. We didn't grow up with the best parents. So I did everything I could to be an ideal role model. Everything I did was to set an example. And now he's dead, and I don't know what the fucking point is anymore. 

I just fucking miss him so much it's unbearable. "
I think ask Reddit just saved my life,I was ready to do it I’d said my goodbyes and completely given up. Then I saw that ask Reddit about suicide notes. I swear I read every reply and cried for about an hour and I really thought about the impact my death will have on my mother and my sister and my friends. I’m a selfish piece of shit but I can’t fuck up everyone who cares for me for the rest of their lives. I wouldn’t want my worst enemy to feel how I feel now. I can’t do that to my family and friends. So many people truly care for me even if I don’t understand why I know they do. 
"I'll be calling CPS on my ""friend"" in a few hours ....","If it wasn't enough witnessing her And her friend smoke LITERAL.CRACK. with the baby in the car with the Windows up, ""forgetting"" or choosing not to feed her for HOURS-sometimes a while day at a time, then I showed up to her house. A mutual friend told me it was a mess - but she failed to mention that there are no appliances or heat- furthermore there is also no furniture and bags upon bags upon bags of their ""things"" as well as literal garbage EVERYWHERE. I took pictures of the house but not sure how to post them. I have continued the friendship through the drug use and filth strictly so I could keep an eye on the 19 month old baby girl. This is just really really a shame. The baby deserves so much better. I'm putting my foot down at 8am. She brings her to me to watch (THANKFULLY) quite often and brings a diaper bag with mayyyyyyybe a dirty pair or pants Or a too small sleeper, tampons, & hairties. No diapes,wipes,formula,food. Nothing for a baby. Then completely forgets I have her. She will call the next day to see if she can come shower at my house or hide in my bathroom and do drugs, and tell me her grandma has her baby. Or she will forget to come pick her up for 2 or 3 days .... And THIS NEXT PART IS TOTAL SPECULATION-but I am a bit concerned her boyfriend was recently inappropriate with her. She SQUEELED when I finally got her to let me change her poop-butt diaper- and was SOOOOOO constipated that the turds came out as gumball sized ROCK-ASS-HARD marbles. And the BF just constantly makes sick fucking jokes about child rape and pedophilia. IT STOPS TODAY!! Honestly she will probably be happy she doesn't have to care for her anymore. I will update if anyone cares to hear what happens .... Sigh .... I wish she could see what a gift she had SMH

EDIT: pardon me I'm still learning how to use reddit, but I've seen others update here. First things first. Call has been made and is high priority considering its below freezing. That's all I know right now.
2ndly THANK YOU kind stranger for the medal-I accept only on behalf on this baby girl, it almost feels wrong to be awarded ://// "
My wife of 6 years died in a car crash.,"Stupid fucking drunk drivers. Don't drive if you're going to drink ffs. I'm so fucking devastated and lost without you. You were my better half, you made me the man I am today. I'll never forget your beautiful smile gorgeous. I'm in anguish. I'm also conflicted whether I'm angry that the other driver didn't die or I'm sorry that he didn't die. I don't know what to do anymore. 

I miss you Jess. 

Love Tim. 


Edit: 

Thanks everyone for the kind messages. I posted here because I don't really know how to deal with all these emotions at the moment. I've never been depressed as such before but I'm at an all time low because of this unnecessary accident. The other driver didn't make it and died in hospital. I've ultimately made my piece with that driver and I hope he and my wife are in a better place. It's going to be a tough few days but I look forward to reading these messages when I'm feeling down. It comforts me knowing so many of you guys have empathy for me and for that I'm forever grateful. I love this community. Stay safe on the road, boys and girls. 

Also thanks to the anonymous user that gave me silver. No idea what it does but I really appreciate the support. "
"I pretended to be asleep when I heard my fiancé waking up, and I would have never expected what happened next...","Whenever my fiancé wakes up, I tend to stir a little bit. Not enough to wake up fully, but enough to be somewhat coherent.

Well, recently, I have been staying awake longer before falling back to sleep, but not really wanting to notify my other half that I’m awake - and I’m so happy I have. 

Last week I was coherent enough to realize he had his head rested in front of mine, and was kissing my forehead, stroking my hair and cheek, and softly humming a love song (one that is particularly my favorite and we always listen to it while driving together). I don’t know what I did to deserve this man.

This morning, I felt him pull me closer to him, while whispering “You’re the one I’ve always wanted. I don’t know how I got so lucky to be with you. You are the woman of my dreams. I promise to do whatever I can to make you the happiest woman in the whole world.” *BOY IF I DIDN’T ALMOST SNAP OUT OF MY DAZE AND START MAKING OUT WITH HIM RIGHT THEN!!* Instead, I nuzzled myself deeper into my crevasse (my head on his shoulder, while my arm is nestled next to me and my leg over his thigh), to which he pulled me in tighter and I fell right back to sleep.

Oh, and he rubs my butt while I’m asleep too apparently, but I’m not going to complain. ;) 

Don’t just settle for anyone. Shoot for the man that’s going to tell you how much he loves you - even when he thinks you can’t hear him. Oh, and someone who loves rubbing your booty. Everyone loves a good booty rub. :)

I don’t know how long he has been doing this, but given the fact that I’ve found out about it at least twice in 2 weeks, it makes me feel that this is not his first time. Lawdddd, I can’t wait to marry this man. 

EDIT: I just wanted to be clear in the fact that, while some of the comments were negative, I believe I stated that I was coherent enough to be awake. Now, that may be a different coherentness for some, but I’m almost to the point of being fully awake. He’s also received my consent to rub my booty, and it’s not in a creepy stalker “this ass is all mine” kind of way, it’s more of as him tracing my figure “gently while trying to remember each curve” kind of way. He’s done it to my while I’m awake lol. If you find that creepy, to each their own. But I’m happy I was able to express my love for someone, through Reddit and get such an overwhelming response! Also, **I have never read any of the Notebook related books, or ever seen any of the movies. Nicholas Sparks is just not my genre. But again, to each their own.** ☺️

EDIT: What he whispered to me has been something he's said to me when I was awake. I come from an abusive (mentally and verbally) relationship, and he knows that I need reassuring sometimes. So that's how I was able to capture it all. But thanks for the doubt. :)"
My wife abandoned me and my two small children two months ago. I thought I had lost everything...but I realized I had lost nothing.,"Six years of marriage unraveled overnight. 

She told me she loved somebody else and she left. Took all of her belongings. Left behind me and two boys. Haven’t heard from her since. 

A two year old boy and a four year old boy found themselves suddenly without a mother. Me, without a wife and someone I had envisioned myself with until I grew too old to remember. 

Alone. 

It hurt. God damn did it hurt. 

My world had fallen apart. Dreams and hopes and aspirations all of a sudden out the window. 

I thought I had lost everything. I broke down crying. Why did this happen? What did I do? I had tried my hardest...why would she leave us all? 

And then my boys heard me. They came into my room and they hugged me. Told me itd be okay. And that’s when I realized it would be.

It’s funny. 

While I was mourning the loss of her and thinking there was nothing left in the world...I forgot that the only thing that mattered in the world was right there in front of me. My sons. 

You know what? Single dad life can work. It will work. 

As long as I have these two wonderful people, I will be happy.

Moving on from the lies and deception has been a very enlightening experience. 

I don’t know where I’m going with this...but I just needed to vent a little bit.

If it helps anyone going through something similar...please know that you are not alone. It does get better. Focus on what matters. Don’t fight for something or someone who doesn’t care.

Stay strong.

When you think you’ve lost everything...realign yourself and see that the things that truly matter are right there in front of you.

Edit - wow! Thank you ALL for the outpouring of love and support! I am slowly going through all of these messages. My little ones say good morning! Today will be another good day :)

Edit dos - thank you all again :) I love reading the comments. It’s good to see how many others can relate to what I am going through, and offer advice. I am also glad that this has helped others in a similar situation! If you PMd me, I will respond! Slowly but surely!!  

Thank you, Reddit ❤️ "
Girl who knocked on my door and gave me churros,"Earlier I had a break down and I was crying really hard and writing my thoughts in a diary. I settled down to watch some YouTube to calm down and the girl who lives across from me knocked on my door and said that she ordered takeaway but they gave her an extra box of churros by accident. I hadn't met her before but she so kindly let me have them. She seemed so friendly and smiley. I feel so incredibly shit and depressed tonight, but this cheered me up and made my day!"
"I found out I was pregnant at 31 weeks, and I lost her at 38 weeks.","I am writing my story on a throw away account, because I don’t want to explain myself or explain how I didn’t know. It is tiring. Please just understand that while this may be hard for some of you to believe, it’s okay if you don’t believe it. Because it happened to ME. I am living the reality and the pain of it’s wrath, so don’t worry. It is no sweat off your back to believe me. I just want someone to listen.


On June 28, 2018 I found out that I was 31 weeks pregnant. I have always had an irregular period, often going 7-10 months without menstruating. I didn’t have any noticeable symptoms, and I didn’t feel tempted to buy a test until a line developed on my stomach and I started to feel movement in my belly. 

The father is not a good man, and based on the timeline of my pregnancy, I conceived right at the end of our tumultuous relationship, which ended with police reports and him physically assaulting me. When I found out, I didn’t tell him that I was pregnant for obvious reasons... as I knew was dangerous. What kind of mother would I be if I allowed an unfit man into my child’s life? He was the kind of man who would become frustrated hearing a baby cry and end up smothering them. I would have visuals of his face on the 9’o clock news when I would even consider telling him. So I didn’t. 

At the time, I was in a new relationship with a man that I felt deeply for, but I fell in love with a facade. I was honest about the possibility that I was 7 months pregnant before I found out how far along I was, as I knew my sexual history and I hadn’t been sexually active since my previous relationship. He did not want the baby and I (regrettably) mirrored his desire and we made the decision, together, to terminate the pregnancy. Well, after finding out that I was 31 weeks pregnant and giving birth in 9 weeks, everything changed. He shamed me for my pregnancy and told me that he felt betrayed, even though this has happened prior to meeting him. I’ll get back to this.

I’m not going to sugar coat anything. I’m a 25 year old college drop out making minimum wage in one of the richest counties in the Country. I knew that I couldn’t raise this child that I just found out would be here in a matter of weeks. I am not fit to provide them with what they need financially, economically, mentally, emotionally. And at this point, I was on my own. My boyfriend at the time became a part time boyfriend who strategically used the phrase “I’m sorry that YOU have to go through this”. Ladies, don’t stick with a guy who ostracizes you when you are going through something. Big red flag. I should have listened to myself.

Considering where I am in my life and how sudden this pregnancy came about, I made the hardest decision I have ever made. I decided to place my child with an adoptive family. I went through the process alone, as I was now a single parent. Over the weeks, my belly began to grow bigger and bigger. You really start to pop in your third trimester. My relationship with my boyfriend at the time deteriorated. As I became more pregnant, he became increasingly distant. My hormones were raging, so when he would mistreat me, I would freak myself into anxiety attacks and the amount of stress that he put me through is something that NO ONE should do to another person. It’s as if he wanted to ignore the fact that I was pregnant. He would intentionally make me feel bad, and I just took it. I was vulnerable and I thought I was in love.

The weeks between finding out I was pregnant and delivering were the hardest weeks of my life. Sometimes I still can’t believe that I made it out alive. I would go to bed every night in tears. There is no pain like an internal conflict, when your moral compass is spinning out of control. I now know that I was doing everything wrong. I was giving away the greatest gift that I was ever given, and that was being a mother. I was staying with a man who treated me like shit. I didn’t rub my belly or sing to my baby, because I didn’t want to get attached. I didn’t even find out the gender until two weeks before. It was a girl.

At 37 weeks, I lost my job. I had planned on working until I went into labor, but I was laid off due to “reduction in staffing”. Two days after that, my boyfriend broke up with me. I later found out he had been cheating the entire time anyway. He’s married now. (There is a lot that I could say about this man and the way he treated me during and long after our relationship, but I have made peace with the pain, and when I think about him now, I am only ashamed of myself for putting him above my child. I called him from my hospital bed after I lost my baby, and all he said was “that sucks, good luck with the stillbirth.”)

At 38 weeks, 2 days I went in to the hospital because I had stopped feeling my baby move and I wasn’t having anymore contractions. The nurses hooked me up to a heart monitor, but they couldn’t get anything. So, a doctor brought in an ultrasound and tried to scan for her heart, but it wasn’t moving. She brought in a second doctor, and they just stood there without saying a word, moving the device over and over again. I can’t explain the feeling I had. I knew before I walked into the hospital that something was wrong, and something just told me I wasn’t going home with my baby. When I saw the look on their faces, I said “you can’t find her heartbeat, can you?” And they just didn’t say anything. So I said, “it’s okay.” I don’t know why I said that, I think I was still trying to be courteous, even on my hospital bed. Because I knew they were trying so hard, but even I could see on the screen that her heart was not moving. One of the doctors shut off the machine and said, “I’m sorry, but there is no heartbeat.” 

You know what’s crazy is that when I found out I was 7 months pregnant, I thought that was the worst day of my life. But losing my child was the worst day of my fucking life. The sound that came out of my mouth was like a wail that I’ve never made before. I remember lifting my arm up to cry, and one of the nurses grabbed my hand and she just squeezed it. Everyone in the room remained silent and let me cry. They cried with me. 

I stayed in the hospital to be induced for labor. In my distraught state, I requested a c-section. The doctor and nurses were adamant on convincing me otherwise, as it is a major surgery and there are numerous complications and negatives. I understood that, but I didn’t care. They brought in a grief nurse and a social worker to talk to me and they asked me why I wanted a c-section. I tried to explain to them that I didn’t want to deliver my dead child. And that I just wanted it over as soon as possible. The grief nurse told me that a natural birth will be a quicker recovery and a c-section will take much longer. She also noted that I could have complications in future pregnancies. So, I decided to have a natural birth.

I was in labor for fifteen hours. I was fortunate enough to have my mother and my best friends by my side. The health providing staff was absolutely amazing. I couldn’t have asked for better. They held my hand, cried with me, and took care of me every step of the way. They made a horrible situation a little less horrible and a bit more comfortable. Your hospital staff really can have a lasting effect on you and how you perceive an event in your life, and I am so thankful for the care that I received. I still receive cards and notes in the mail from the hospital and it’s staff.

I delivered my daughter on August 25, 2018 at 12:21PM. I was blessed enough to hold her one time. She was the most beautiful being I had ever seen in my life. I know that my situation is very different from everyone else’s, but I still felt an overwhelming amount of pride that I made her. ME. I made that baby. She had thick, black, curly hair, chubby cheeks and the smallest button nose. Her face was angelic. I stared at her for what seemed like hours, just soaking up a moment that I would never have with her again. And then I had to let her go, and that was again, one of the hardest things I have had to do in my life.

The hospital made me a memory box with a cast of her feet, her hospital bracelet and other small things. I requested a lock of her hair, and my nurse went down to the morgue just for me for a clipping of her hair. That is true devotion. I am forever grateful for how above and beyond they went to make sure I was as content as I could possibly be, considering the circumstance.  A professional photographer came in and took pictures of my daughter as a condolence. At the end of it all, all I had left of her was a memory box, photographs, and later, her ashes. It will never be enough.

The first night home was the hardest. I held my belly, and it’s such a fucked up feeling, because she was gone. My belly was soft, and I just felt empty. 


It has been four and a half months since I lost my daughter, and it never gets easier. Grief truly is a rollercoaster that you have to ride. Some days it’s harder than others. But I am so proud for how far I have come. I have gone back to school, and last semester I earned A’s and B’s. I am finally at a place, mentally, where I feel fit to return to work. I’m interviewing and trying to get back out there. But everything is different now. I am different now. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t miss the person I was before this happened, because she was naive and so innocent. She didn’t know true pain. But at the same time, I don’t think she could have survived this. I am so much stronger now, and if I can get through this, I can get through anything. 

If I could go back in time and change everything, the only thing that I would change is disposing of that man sooner, and celebrating the life I was growing in my belly. Even if things had still unfolded the way they have, I would only wish for the short time that I had with her to be spent peacefully. I was just scared and vulnerable. I will never be that weak again. I talk to my daughter every day and tell her how much I love her.
I believe that everything happens for a reason, and the universe gave me this gift to teach me compassion and true love. Without her, I wouldn’t know either.

Sometimes I am still amazed that I made it out of this trauma alive. I am making it and I don’t know how, but I am. I think back to what my life was like then and I truly didn’t think I would make it. But here I am to tell this story. 

Give your babies an extra kiss for me. 

And if you’re wondering, I named her Annali.

Don't even think about it, just do it, it doesn't matter what may stop you, ""I don't have the resources"", fuck that man it's yours! 

Feel the fear inside, and laugh, it ain't worth your time, what do you want to do with your life?

My girlfriend of 3 years passed away today and I’ve never been more relieved.,"Before you downvote me into oblivion, let me explain what happened. We were together for 3 years and 2 months. She was the love of my life. About 4 months ago, she began to change. She began having seizures which had never ever happened in the past, I assumed maybe she developed epilepsy (not sure if that’s even possible, but I hoped it was) but there was also really bad headaches at times and some personality change. I knew something wasn’t right, but couldn’t figure out what. We instantly called her doctor and got in the next day, she feared the worst and told us to go to ER right after, calling to make sure we got in right when we got there. We arrived and the doctor ordered a CT scan and an MRI, they showed a large mass in her brain. Cancer. Terminal cancer. She was given 3 months to live. It was possible she could’ve lived longer with treatment, but we simply didn’t have the money and she decided that she’d die sooner rather than later. Over the next four months I just watched as her health deteriorated, I wouldn’t ever wish that upon anyone, it’s scarred me forever. Once she had gotten past the 3 month mark, I was prepared for the worst, she had lasted longer than she was given but she looked awful, she wasn’t living or thriving or anything, she was just existing. I knew her final moments were ahead. I had to take so much time off work to be with her, which I’m not upset about, I loved her and was willing to do it but I’m just struggling to make ends meet with rent and car payments for a bit. I spent every possible last moment I could with her. I fell asleep by her side yesterday night, when I woke up this morning, I couldn’t wake her. She had ended her battle. I’ve never cried so much, she was the love of my life, I have endless amounts of respect for people that survive cancer and the families with them every step of the way. I’m relieved because we both knew she was suffering, in endless pain and just surviving, she wasn’t living. I never wanted to say goodbye to her, but I know that in the end letting go of her was for the best, she was in too much pain to continue on. I’m starting work again Monday, my boss isn’t very happy that I missed so much time, I don’t know if I’ll have the strength to carry on. Everyday from here on out is an uphill battle, but I’m going to come out on top, for her, I know her final wishes were for me to be successful and live the best life that I ever could. Thank you for all the memories and amazing times Jessica, I love you more than anything. 


Edit: spelling mistake 

Edit 2: Thank you for all the kind support everyone, I’m truly speechless, it means more than you could ever imagine. I received a couple DMs offering financial support, which I refuse. All I ask is make maybe a small donation to a cancer research or buy a gift for one you love, whether it’s a partner, parent, sibling, friend or whoever, show your loved ones you love them and tell them too.  I’ll try to reply to comments throughout the day but it’s going to be a busy day, Jessica’s family is driving up here and we’re planning the funeral and all that. Thank you for all the support everyone. 

Edit 3: I doubt anyone still checks this post, but if you do, I’ve got good news. I quit my old job and started a new one with a better boss and better salary and more flexible hours. I’m still having trouble accepting that all of this happened, but I’m slowly getting there. Starting next month I’m seeing a grievance counselor, it’s a bit of a far drive but he’s very highly rated from what I’ve read. Thank you for all the kind words and support. Heres to a new chapter of my life and I hope one day I can make someone as happy as she made me."
"Moments before I (24F) commited suicide on Sunday, my neighbor unknowingly stopped me. Today I found out I'm pregnant after struggling with infertility for three years.","UPDATE 2: I went to my OB this morning and unfortunately no ultrasound until Wednesday, but all of my vitals were great! I got a referral to a therapist that specializes in women who are pregnant/mothers/struggling with infertility. I see her for the first time on Monday! So excited to start this new chapter of my life! For those of who who were asking about my boyfriend, he is doing much better! Still bruised a little, but no permanent damage. He's a tough one! Thank you wonderful people of Reddit! Will update again on Wednesday! 

UPDATE: I want to say thank you to everyone who commented and reached out to me. Your words are so beautiful and very appreciated. My whole perspective has changed and I'm on cloud nine. I never expected this post to take off, and I'm trying to respond to all of you, but I'll probably take the next day or so easy. I will update Friday after my first appointment, and post pictures if they decide to do an ultrasound! Again, thank you beautiful people of Reddit. My heart is overwhelmed with love. ❤

I know the Holidays are stressful for everyone, but for some reason December got to me. I gained 15 lbs, my depression sank lower than ever before, and I started to loathe myself. I don't ever remember being that stressed. Then, last week, I watched in horror from our parked car as my boyfriend was robbed and beaten. I had a breakdown the next day. Sunday rolls around and I was home alone. I was pacing the house and anytime I heard a noise I was terrified. My mind was racing, I started crying and felt like puking. I decided to put it all to an end.

I had every muscle relaxer, sleeping pill, antidepressant, and pain medication I could hold in one hand and shoved them all in my mouth. I was about to wash them down with some water when I heard my neighbor (an older lady who lives alone) knocking and screaming for help.

Without hesitation, I spat the pills into the sink and ran to the door. She told me that a large dog was attacking her cat. I followed her to her to her yard and quickly assessed that the dog was simply playing (maybe a little too rough) with the cat. I got the cat back inside and walked the dog back to its owner down the street. After assuring my neighbor that her cat was fine, but recommending she take him to the vet just in case, I went back inside my house. I then realized that I'd just been about to commit suicide. Strangely, the urge I'd felt to end my life was gone.

Today, after a brief conversation with my boyfriend about my feelings and bodily changes, he suggested I was pregnant. Even swore it. I, of course, doubted him. I have PCOS, Endometriosis, and on top of all that, I was only born with one partial ovary. The chances were astronomical without surgery or hormone therapy, and they would only help a little.

He went and got a pregnancy test, and sure enough, it was positive. We bought two more. Both positive. Honestly, it explains so much of why my body and mind have been behaving differently. I go to the doctor on Friday. 

I don't believe in God, and I don't think fate is real, either. But something in my bones is starting to tell me different. One day I'll thank my neighbor for saving mine and my child's life, because even though that wasn't her intention, that's exactly what she did. "
Reddit your search engine fucking sucks,I search for the EXACT title of a post my wife just showed me and it comes up with zero results. Fuck your shitty search engine.
Your mom and I found your stash of heroin last night,"She left your room intact, even the wrinkles on the bed from the last time you lay there.  The only thing she added was the urn that contains your ashes.  

But she's moving and I was helping her pack.  I knew about the secret compartment in your desk.  It was my desk when I was your age.  It was my mom's desk when she was your age.  

I kept weed in there when I was your age.

It was the first time your mom and I had ever seen heroin.  I gave you nine wrinkled dollars on the day you died.  The coroner gave us your wallet with those nine dollars in it.  I was glad to know that I didn't pay for the heroin that killed you.  

But it was hard looking at those little bags.  

Three or four times a day, I think about something that would interest you, or something I'd like to ask your opinion about.  Sometimes I even pick up the phone.

Anyway, I miss you.  I wish things had worked out differently.

I wish that we had had more time."
I used to be a Neo-Nazi who should have been punched in the face.,"The 'Punch Nazis' trend, and people saying 'no don't do that', lately has brought up one of the most shameful aspects of my life. 

Once upon a time, many years ago, I was a neo-Nazi. As a teenager, I got involved with a guy who also considered himself a neo-nazi and I wound up with a swastika scratched into my leg that fortunately has left virtually no scar. Unsurprisingly, this was a horribly unhealthy relationship for 17yr old me to be in and it didn't last long. A few years later I dated another guy, and his girlfriend. He was a neo-nazi, and his girlfriend was Jewish, and he got off on having a Jewish girl willing to basically pull a 'Night Porter' with him. That too, unsurprisingly, was a very unhealthy relationship and was over very fast.

But how, why did I get sucked into that life? Quite simply, I was raised by racist parents. Parents who, though they've much improved in their views since my younger years, instilled in me the same racism and prejudices they held, all with the classic phrase of 'but we're not raicst.' No matter how rebellious I was in everything from religion to sub-culture to music to w/e, I never felt a need to rebel against that because it had been a part of my life on such a passive, natural level. As I became an adult and became more aware of the world around me and actually STUDIED (after some help) and educated myself, I began to see that what I was buying into, or at that point at least NOT rebelling against, was fucked up. Yet it was still hard to overcome, because hatred and pride are so, so easy to get sucked into. 'Misery loves company' and there is a lot of misery in the world of white supremacists, so there's plenty of people to pull you down while making it seem like they're holding you up. 

Ultimately I met someone who was willing to challenge me on absolutely everything and force me to think for myself. Every view I presented was questioned harshly, meanly, and time and time again my views that aligned with racism and nazism were demolished with logic. Soon this logic enabled me to realize 'Holy fuck, I have been a huge idiot, this is wrong' (to say the least) and the same cognitive dissonance that set in with my 'religious epiphany' began regarding human compassion. In that moment I swore I would not be party to those views again.

Looking back on it, were it not for the fact that I am A: Rebellious, B: Open to learning new things, and C: had someone willing to be a patient asshole with my stubborn bigotry, there is a chance that even now (I'm 28) I would not have overcome those viewpoints. Shy of someone literally punching me in the face, of someone blatantly and rudely standing up to me, I'd have carried on like I was right to hold those prejudices and ideologies. 

And from what I knew/know of people who identify as 'nazis' or 'alt-right' or 'fascists' or whatever fucking label they're trying to put on their idiocy... they're terrible people. The vast majority of whom are completely unwilling to entertain the idea they're wrong. It doesn't matter how eloquent you are, how patient you are, how peaceful you are, probably 98% of them will not listen and will not change their minds. There is something about the comradery of that hatred and pride that is more addictive than heroine. And that 2% that might be willing? They'll branch out on their own, secretly, and entertain those ideas. But that 2% isn't worth holding back. 

Now we have the trend of punching nazis. And I love it. I love the fact that I love it, because a decade ago, I'd have been offended because I'd be a target. And yeah, punching their lights out may only serve to close their minds further, but, it does in fact teach them to keep their nonsense to themselves and not spout it publicly, and that they aren't safe if they do. So, I just can't get behind the idea of 'no, you can't do that, it's just more violence!' because I've been there and know that's the language they speak, that I once spoke; it was the language I best understood at the time.

If I met 17 year old nazi-me today, I'd punch myself in the face. And I'd have deserved it. 

Thanks for reading, reddit. And also, to everyone who has ever been persecuted by fascists, neo-nazi's and the 'altright' or straight up racists... I'm sorry. I can't apologize for them, but I still apologize for anything and everything I ever did to add to that grief. 


**EDIT** Well. This got a bit popular. I'm trying my best to answer questions and messages! The biggest question I've gotten in messages has been about how to address people who are racist/involved in white supremacy to help turn them around (without just punching them in the face.) 

My advice on this, and what worked with me, was knowing logical fallacies as my 'mentor' who guided me out of the cave did. And he was a relentless asshole Granted, I was already open to new things and to learning, and without that it would have been a futile effort. One has to be open to and aware of the notion of cognitive dissonance for it to have a positive impact, otherwise they will just run further into the cave out of fear. However, if they are open to it, ask what their views are. Do this several times without criticizing or affirming, just do it to understand. Then go back and each time you speak with them, point out their lapses in logic: ""But that's post hoc... you're basing that on false equivalence... don't strawman' and explain what those are. This took months and also my mentor convinced me to travel a bit with him on his dime. Like, he went above and beyond what most people could ever do. He helped to physically remove me from that life for a short time, but while someone is immersed in it... it's daunting, and it's going to take a very long time. I wish I could give you a more positive, instant-gratification answer, but that's been my experience and that's what I can convey best. 


**EDIT EDIT** I understand many of you don't advocate violence/are against the notion of punching people in the face even though they are literal nazis/think violence isn't the answer... and you're welcome to that view. However, I was met with those views time and time again, and they didn't work. Being a woman, I seldom was the one attacked (sexism is a thing everywhere and in many directions... but that's another issue) but my male counterparts were, and they deserved it. That's what shut them up, that's what pushed them back into the shadows. Yes, I am living proof that you can crawl out of that hole without that physical violence, but I also know how much of an anomaly that is (also that the verbal skirmishes with my mentor were far more painful and filled with far more rage than a fist to the face). You can accept the testimony of myself, and others who have posted here who've dealt with this lifestyle first hand, and consider it, or don't. That's up to you. I've posted this to simply express my experience and how I'll choose to deal with it if needed. 

**EDIT EDIT EDIT** Holy gilding batman! Thank you! And regardless of the mixed responses, even the harassing ones, I appreciate the conversation this has started and the insights that have been shared here. 

**EDIT EDIT EDIT EDIT** This post got far bigger than expected. I'm doing my best to answer questions and messages but I didn't expect to front page (apparently this did? I didn't see it but a few people mentioned that) and I can only tackle so much but I'll try to get to all of it in time! "
In the eyes of a less fortunate homeless person. It hurts how people treat and view them in such a way like their less then human.,"As I was pulling out of a gas station, I saw a homeless man carrying black contractor bags, dropping them, and going back for the others. 3 guys came up to him and started kicking his bags around and making fun of him. It was raining, he looked helpless and defeated, so I drove right up to him, picked up his bags, and told him to get in the car. I started driving and asked him where he wanted to go. He said somewhere in Maryland, we were in Virginia, so I told him I could drive him to the metro and pay for his fare. As we were driving, I asked him what kind of music he listened to. I can't remember what it was, but it was very bluesy. As the music was playing, the sky cleared a bit and a rainbow began to show. I saw him out of the corner of my eye gently crying, and my heart wept for him. We got to the metro when everyone was getting back from work. I grabbed his bags and began walking, and it felt like the longest walk of my life. Everyone was looking at us like we were pieces of dirt. I wanted to fight every single person that gave us that stupid look. We eventually got to the station, I paid his fare , and we parted ways. When I got to my car I shed a few tears because I realized this is the abuse this man goes through on a daily basis. It wasn't right, it wasn't fair. Some people are down on their luck, while some people are in the streets due to addictions or other circumstances. At the end of the day, they're all human. Don't treat them like they're any less than that. A lot of the people who treat them as sub-humans are a paycheck away from being homeless themselves. Be humble and have compassion for your fellow human beings, please.

EDIT: wow my first platinum! Thank you sir for this really made my day

EDIT: Thank you for all the kind words and support you guys have given. Remember to give back to those less fortunate. A small act you give can be huge to that person."
"Today I did my laundry, cleaned my car, room, and bathroom, and bought groceries for the first time in months.","Those seem like the most basic, mundane tasks, but as I’ve come to find out over the past few months, it’s extremely easy to slip into an overwhelming sense of, just— blah. I don’t know how or when that feeling took over me, but today something changed. I decided I was tired of my personal life reflecting what my brain felt like. There was no clarity, there was no joy it seemed, and waking up every day felt like a chore. I have no idea what clicked in my brain or why it did, but today I woke up and decided I was tired of the clutter. I was tired of everything in my life looking and feeling so messy. I bought healthy food after pretty much exclusively eating fast food, and I’m planning on going back to the gym this week. Getting emotional and excited about these tiny accomplishments seems so weird, but I am and I wanted to let everyone know! 

edit: I’m going to respond to every one of your wonderful comments as soon as I can, but as a blanket appreciation— THANK YOU. Reddit is fucking awesome. 

Also— to anyone who is inspired by music and feeling down like this, listen to “Turn It Around” by The Head and the Heart. They have helped me through some rough shit, and this song has been my savior during this. Sending everyone in this situation all of my love. "
"I love you, mom.","My mom can’t drive, so its either me or my dad who drives her around. She likes to watch random videos on her phone while I’m driving. It was always on speaker because she disliked earphones. 

This passed few weeks, she’s been playing this video over and over again on the car. I’m talking every time on the car, about 6-7 times consecutively. I didn’t know what the video was (I was always driving), I just knew that the music was very upbeat. It gets really annoying to be honest, but she always laughed and smiled while watching the video, so I did’t say anything.

Today at home, she left her phone unlocked and I saw a video with our family photos as a cover. I got curious and played it. 

And guess what, the annoying little song started playing.  

The video was a slide show of our family photos. Pictures of the four of us, pictures of my graduation, pictures from when my sister went to prom, pictures of her with dad, and so many more. 

My mom has been watching a self-compiled slide show of our family photos over and over again, laughing and smiling every time. And God knows how many times she has watched the video. 

Somehow, this makes me so emotional. hahaha

Mom, you are the sweetest person I have ever met. You always make me feel so loved. I am so proud of you. My only goal in life is to do you and dad proud. I love you. 

EDIT: Wow guys! I don’t know what to say! Thank you for your kind words and positivity. I will give my mom lots of hugs from all of you."
My boyfriend and bacterial vaginitis saved my life.,"A few months ago I started seeing my current boyfriend. Everything was great, we have so many shared interests and he really has his life together. About a month into our relationship he made a comment on the smell of my vagina. This is where the story gets really embarrassing and why I need to post it anonymously online. He commented that I may have bacterial vaginitis and asked if I’d had a Pap smear yet. 

Being the big immature baby I can be sometime I went full embarrassed panic mode and told him I need a break. Well we got back together and he told me I should see a doctor for real. I schedule an appointment and wow I do have bacterial vaginitis but also a really abnormal Pap smear. 

I’ve been going to see the doctor almost weekly until 3 days ago my biopsy results came back and I have stage one cervical cancer that can likely be cured with cryosis and has not spread to my lymph nodes. I caught it so early. Had it not been for him I could’ve had this tumor growing in me for years. 

The day I was diagnosed I was also fired from my job because someone came in with a fake ID and I served them. This is the most terrified and depressed I’ve ever been in my life but I guess I just have to get off my chest how supported I feel by him and my group of friends and family. Also that getting bacterial vaginitis saved my life which is kind of funny. 

EDIT: everyone that’s been supportive thank you so much! To everyone asking why we broke up and why i didn’t go to the doctor initially it was a brand new relationship and I had had no vaginal issues previous to us having unprotected sex (on birth control) sometimes semen can throw your ph out of wack and give you bacterial vaginitis. I only had abnormal smell during sex. I was embarrassed to face a very intimate issue with a new partner and was unsure if I could feel sexy in front of him again. I’m aware of my own immaturity and have owned up to it. In addition I had no insurance and just got back on my parents. 

REGARDLESS, the internet has trolls and I will feed you so SUCK MY CANCER RIDDLED VAGINA ASS HATS thank u!"
Something amazing happened,"EDIT: OH my gosh, I didn't expect this to get so many upvotes omg, thank you all so much <3333

After I went into the mental hospital, I bought some of my favorite plants to grow. However, I was depressed to the point of not even leaving my bed again.

My life took a downturn for a while and all of my plants started to wilt and die. My lemonbalm turned black, and my only tomato that had grown had a hole in it. Even though they were plants, I was crushed.

I gave up on them up until today. Today I finally got a job after searching for one for so long, I went out there to see how they were, and...

They're coming around. 5 tiny baby tomatoes have popped up, a jalapeno has, and my lemonbalm has bright new sprouts.

I repotted them all and gave them some plant food.

I know they're just plants, but I'm glad they're okay.

Maybe things are getting better."
I'm Not Getting Paid,"I'm one of 400,000 federal government employees not getting paid. It breaks my heart when I hear people sneer at my branch and say that ""I'm not a real member of the military."" I went to boot camp. I am the same rank as someone in the Navy. I have saved lives. Yet people don't understand that I can't wait for back pay when I have a car payment, rent, insurance amongst others. I've got bills that are literally piling up because of this furlough. I'm up to my eyeballs in stress and worry because our government wants to fund a bullshit wall. 

I haven't been this anxious in months. I literally wake up every morning with my stomach in knots. I don't sleep very well, and when I do, I have awful nightmares of getting my car taken away or getting evicted. People don't understand how much this hurts me, a little E-4 who is just making enough to get by. I am scared, honestly. I have a dollar fifty to my name right now because of this shutdown and it frightens me. 

I'm terrified right now and I just want this nightmare to be over. I'm tired of all this. 

*EDIT* I am completely and utterly humbled by the support and the kind words that people have offered me. I am sitting here with tears in my eyes because I am so grateful to each and every one of you who have whispered positive things from your corners of the internet. 

I should also mention that I don't care if you're a Republican, Democrat or nestled somewhere in between. Right now, the blame falls on our government as a whole. A lot of you have been asking what you can do to help. Write to your Congress representative and tell them that your friendly neighborhood Nordy is struggling to make ends meet. The Coast Guard also has food pantries set up around the country right now and they need non-perishables, pet food and other amenities right now. Please let me know if you want to donate to these causes. I am not here looking for a handout, but to make my voice heard for those who are voiceless in this situation. 

Thank you all so much. I am forever honored by your words of encouragement. 

*DOUBLE UPDATE* I don't know how many people are still reading this, but this is our Coast Guard Mutual Assistance website since some people are asking. Thank you all so much for your support in this time of troubles.

Please be wary of people asking for donations. We have a scammer that makes their rounds every so often and she's duped a few of you.,"A day or two ago a post popped up by a girl claiming she was incredibly ill, bedridden, and that her boyfriend had tampered with her birth control. She claimed she needed an abortion. 

You wonderful, helpful people tried to direct her to abortion funds, hotlines, anything that could help. She said she wasn't eligible for any of it... so people started offering money and asked her to set up a gofundme.

While this is all very sweet, if any of you gave her money, you got scammed hard. There is at least one (maybe more) user that goes around posting variations of this story to /r/twoxchromosomes, /r/childfree, /r/assistance and offmychest to get money out of nice people. The mods of these 4 subreddits exchange info and warn each other when she's active so we can be on the lookout. She had posted a different sob story to /r/TwoXChromosomes two weeks before her offmychest post and I just happened to catch it. 

So I'm asking you all to please report any kind of soliciting for donations directly to the mod team for review. There have been cases where I'm able to verify that the person is telling the truth and is not requesting cash, we'll allow their requests. 


#**Do not offer people money. If they are hungry, direct them to /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza. If they need money or any other assistance, /r/assistance is the way to go. We do not allow crowdfunding in /r/offmychest.**"
I cannot believe that this actually happened. I am beside myself.,"She actually did it. After being in her life, for five years, my soon to be college freshman stepdaughter called me, “her stepdad.”  
Holy fucking balls I cannot believe it!!  Seriously, this entire week I have thought to myself, “do she and her older sister ever refer to me as ‘their stepdad’?”  I have heard their  little brother call me is stepdad before. But never, not even once, did I honestly believe that they called me anything other than, my first name, or “my mom’s new husband.”  I am going to be in an incredibly fantastic mood for the next two years because of this and their is nothing that anyone can do about it!!  I love you kiddos like you are my own and there is no doubt that I would give my life if it meant that you could have a better day. 
Thank you. Teary eyes out! "
Cuddling for the first time,"So last night my guy friend stayed over with me. We gamed most of the night. Chatting back and fourth. After a short while I moved a pillow to the middle of the couch and leaned on his arm. For the next few hours we gamed and bullshitted. Well he got tired decided to go to bed. I went out and was watching my phone. About twenty minutes later he comes out and talks about how he can't sleep. We chat. He goes back to the bed and calls me in, we look at memes and shit. Well my hand brushes his arm and he tells me how I'm like an ice cube and he proceeded to give me the blankets. Slowly getting closer. I moved my leg on top of his and he eventually wrapped around my waist and we laid there. Switching positions every so often.

I never really paid attention to his little comments before and I don't exactly know what this means. But it was my first time cuddling with someone. And I wanted it off my chest
(Edited typo)


Update: he is attracted to me, he wants to meet up and talk about soon.

Update No. 2: Were gonna go on a dinner date this week, talk about it then. We both want to cuddle more"
A letter to Donald Trump from a combat vet. I just need to vent. Thank you for reading.,"Donald Trump, if I take away the misogyny and the utter contempt you have towards women, especially women of color, I would hate you. If I take away you openly admitting, multiple times to sexually assaulting many women, I would hate you. If you take away your blatant disregard for the struggling and the poor, I would hate you. All of your lies, deceit, false religious advocacy, turning Americans against one another…..Take all of that away, I would still hate you. 

Donald Trump, you are a coward. While members of my family and millions of others were torn apart by war and the draft, you used your wealth and your influence to get out of that draft. Not once, not even twice, but five times. Five times you coward. While those of less means fought and died and struggled. You sat in your palaces and laughed at how clever you were. Miraculous how after the war you had no more “bone spurs”. Praise god…….

Donald Trump, I am a combat Vet with the 82nd Airborne division. Arguably the most highly trained and deadly fighting force the world has ever seen. We can be deployed anywhere in the world in less than 18 hours, boots on the ground, fighting. And so we were. And so I was. The amount of destruction we, as mostly 18-22 year old kids caused was nothing short of holy hell. The bodies. So many bodies. Ripped and torn and blown to pieces. Some burned to nothing more than charred husks. Smoking ruins of buildings and vehicles spread across the desert like macabre effigies. You cannot imagine what it is like causing and seeing this. We did what we were supposed to do. It was a hostile force and they needed to be stopped. We stopped them. Quickly. We spent a year over there.. A year of nonstop hypervigilance, Of always being on edge, always looking over your shoulder. 

Now, we come home. Now the adrenaline fades and the chaos fades and things slow down to normal. Now, we remember those bodies. Now, we remember the terror and fear that those people felt. Now we remember the terror and fear that we felt. Now the memories and visions start. Now, we remember friends dying. Now we remember those bullets and IEDs. Now, we are unsure of how to handle these things. We are called “pu**ies” and told to “get over it” by those who were not there when we ask for help with it. Now we don’t sleep as well as we used to. Or, at all some nights. Now, my friends that “can’t handle it”, as you said Donald Trump, start taking their own lives. So many of my friends are gone and I weep for them. And you, in your round about way, called them cowards. How could you. How dare you. Robby was a good boy, just turned 20. I had to watch as he was pulled out of a vehicle after we got home, in the motor pool after he had shot himself in the head. Because as you say, Donald Trump, he “couldn’t handle it”. I buried that laughing, smiling boy. I will never forget him. He was the first of too many who “couldn’t handle it”.

How dare you not visit the graves of our fallen military because you didn’t want to mess up your fucking hair. You are a coward. How dare you, after two years not once visit the troops. You are the worst kind of coward. How any vet could vote or support you on this one subject alone is beyond my ability to understand.

I know why you are the way that you are Donald Trump. You don’t know what it is to be human. You are a bully and a coward. You are the worst part of America. I love this country so much and you have tried to tear it to pieces. You are going to fail because you are a failure at everything you do. Fuck you Donald Trump. You weak pathetic coward.

Day two sober,Nobody knows I'm an addict. Hope to make it to day 3. 
My neighbours who I have never met picked up on signs of domestic abuse. Here's how they saved my life last night.,"I'll save you the details, but my boyfriend treats me and has behaviours that would wake up anyone in close proximity. In a condo building, this isn't hard. 

Last night things came to a serious emergency. I feared for my life - truly to my core. I thought I was going to die that night. My boyfriend left, drunk and in a rage, trying to steal my cell phone and car keys so I couldn't call the police or leave my building. After screaming in the hallway, I got my keys and phone back and he left. 

10 minutes later after calming myself, changing my clothes etc, I opened my front door to leave and drive myself to the hospital for my broken wrist, only to see my across the hall neighbour standing guard outside my door. 

He quickly told me my neighbour beside me woke up as well and was guarding the lobby door and was waiting for the police.

He explained to me my surrounding neighbours had suspected domestic abuse for months. They all came together, strangers who had never met each other. They started recording times, fights they had heard, how they saw me in the elevator 3 weeks ago with a black eye. How Saturday morning I returned home with a punched out back window of my car. They took pictures of the blood all over it, before I could get it fixed on Monday. They knew what vehicle he drove. They suspected the illegal activity he is involved in. 

These men had never met me before. They didn't know my name. They didn't even know his. But they picked up on things over the past few months. 

Hours later when my boyfriend returned, still in a rage... they were there for me. 


These are the types of people people like me need. These are the types of people who restore my faith in humanity. "
"I’m a single, childless woman in her mid-30s who had cats. I should be pathetic, right? But I got to do something today that I’d never be able to do with husband and children, and fuck it feels good.","A good friend of mine was randomly widowed a couple years ago. She hit a bad spot recently, so I wired her a few hundred dollars. 

And you know what? I didn’t have to ask anyone before I did it. I just did. It’s my money, so it affects no one but me. 

I’ve been married before, so I know what it’s like to have to constantly run money decisions past a spouse. 

But I’m single, so no one gives a damn. I can help my friend without justifying it to anyone. 

I’m definitely a “career gal.” I’m on the local board of directors for our professional organization, and I teach night classes for my field at the local college. I’m employed at one of the more prestigious companies in the area for my field. 

I’ve been able to throw myself into my career because husband and children have not been a thing. 

And I can throw money at a friend who’s hurting and think nothing of it. 

Goddamn, that feels good. "
What it's like to lose your child unexpectedly...,"My 18-year-old daughter died in a car accident on her way to school a few weeks ago.  I'm going to try to convey what it's like.  

Police officer shows up at the door:  This will haunt me for the rest of my life.  My fiancee and I were sleeping, as we work 3rd shift.  The beating on the door was loud... I'm not sure how long he was there before it woke me up.  It did not wake my fiance up.  I looked out the window and saw an unmarked SUV but I could tell it was the police.  I answered the door and he said my name.  I answered ""yes"".  He said my daughter's name and I said ""yes"".  He said that she was in an accident (I knew what was coming next) and that she had expired.  I went to my knees and made noises I've never heard myself make before.  He got me inside to the couch and asked if anyone else was there.  I told him my fiance's name as I was crying uncontrollably.  He yelled her name a number of times and she came out.  He started talking to her and she started yelling ""Oh my God"" and came to hold me.  She and my daughter were very close. 

Telling family:  About a half hour later I started making phone calls.  This part is crucial.  If this happens to you, make these calls as soon as possible or have someone go tell them quickly.  Word spreads like wildfire... especially with social media.  You do not want loved ones finding out this way.  Someone posted about this on my wall only a few hours after this happened.  I made the calls and cried as I listened to them wail.  It is aweful.  

Seeing her after the accident:  At first I did not want to see her.  I kept saying ""That's not her.""  Later in the day I changed my mind.  This was extremely surreal and heartbreaking.  She was transported to the funeral home the same day.  We all stood there in the hallway until a man asked if we were ready.  He opened a door to a room, I walked in and saw her all by herself at the far end of the room in a casket.  This was my daughter in front of me... my beautiful girl that was full of life that very morning.  I kissed her forehead repeatedly and told her how much I love her. 

People and planning:  Besides the grief, I never realized how overwhelming something like this was.  While I was still in shock, people were reaching out from everywhere... many of which I hadn't heard from in years.  I was on the phone for the majority of each day for over a week straight... not to mention all the people visiting.  All of these people were sincerely caring and I appreciate them all, but I can't exactly describe what it does to your emotional state other than saying it's overwhelming and draining.  The planning is another thing that I did not expect and it begins almost immediately.  There are countless things that needed to be taken care of and I had to do all of these things while grieving.  I'm still not done with everything, actually. 

Her funeral: It was six days after her death and I thought I had no tears left.  I was very wrong.  I still could not completely wrap my mind around the fact that I was at my own daughter's funeral.  I've known other people who have lost children... but this had actually happened to mine.

Grieving:  The first two days after her accident were filled with non-stop crying and disbelief.  I'm a grown man who rarely cries.  The third day was off and on crying all day and now it's about 2 to 3 times a day.  For the first week it hit me especially hard in the mornings when I woke up.  I'm now in a state of constant sadness and still some disbelief that she is not coming home... but not as much crying.  The most accurate and heartbreaking word I can use to describe this whole thing is ""permanent"".  It's the most permanent thing I've ever experienced in my life.  No matter how much my mind tries to find a way around it at times, she's not coming back.

Guilt and Regret:  I wish I had done things different.  I wish I had spent more time with her than what I did.  I wish I had protected her more than what I did from those who were unkind and even emotionally abusive to her.  I wish I had been awake that morning to see her off to school... maybe I could have changed something and maybe she wouldn't have wrecked.  I wish I could have been there to hold her during her last minutes of life.  I wish it would have been me instead.  I feel guilty doing things... like going out to eat (haven't felt like cooking) and taking my other two children to the movies last night.  

Her accident:  I'm still obsessing over it and still finding out details from those who were there.  She knew she was dying and was asking those around her to pray with her.  She always wore her seatbelt but she didn't have it on this time.  Did she drop something and take it off?  She had food in the car that she got from the nearby gas station that morning.  I checked her phone and my Verizon log and she wasn't texting or talking to anyone.  Why did she over-correct her steering?  These are the questions I'm trying to answer.  I know it won't change anything but for some reason I need to know.  

I'm only 2 weeks and 3 days in to this and I know I have a long way to go... but so far this is the best way I can describe what it's like to lose your child.  She was extremely smart, talented, beautiful and kind... she had an amazing life waiting on her.  I love her to no end and I miss her every minute of the day. 

I have to remain strong for those who need me... so I think telling my story and pouring my heart out here helps in a way. "
I just broke an 8 year old girl’s heart.,"I’m a 26 year old male. 

I teach Sunday school at my church and several years ago I had my first class of 5 year olds. My day job is as a construction worker so I don’t get to interact with kids much, but as a kid at heart, I enjoyed being their teacher. I can match their energy and enthusiasm while keeping us on topic and interested. This particular class really meshed well since we didn’t have any major disruptors in the group. 

One of the ones that really connected with me was Lucy. A tiny little blonde girl who was super quiet until I started asking her about her day and her interests. She would go on and on about her brothers and friends and always had the cutest positive energy. 

Even after she moved up to other classes, she would still run up to me after church every week and give me a hug and tell me all about her week. In all honesty, it was adorable! One day she even went on and on how her brothers and her were drawing blueprints for a hedgehog farm I was to build for them.... oh the minds of kids are so amusing! 

Fast forward to last week when I was sitting at a church gathering eating some amazing potluck food and she runs over to sit with me. My fiancé happened to be there too so I turned to Lucy and said, “Hey Lucy! Have you met my fiancé Maggie yet?” She looked confused, (especially cute with her face scrunched up behind her new glasses) and asked, “what’s a fiancé?” 

I said, “it means we are getting married soon!” 

Well. Right then is when I found out Lucy had a crush on me. Her lips started trembling, her shoulders quaking, her eyes welling up and tears falling down.... she grabbed her food and ran to her parents table and started sobbing into her mother’s arms uncontrollably. 

The mom looked at me with a sad smile and they ended up taking her home because she was so heartbroken. 

I felt awful. 

And that’s how I broke an 8 year old’s heart. 

TL;DR: 8 year old girl I taught had a huge crush on me I had never considered until I introduced her to my fiancé and her entire future crumbled before her eyes. "
I am proud of my son,My middle son (11) is a complete social butterfly and has a lot of friends in school. This has caused a few problems as he sees school as a place to socialise rather then learn. A few days ago he had a female friend confide in him that her dad hits her a lot. He went and spoke to his head teacher about this. The school rang the right people   and he was arrested.  Today he came home and told me he got a big hug of his friend as she has been told that this man is not allowed near her or her family. I am proud that he knew this was wrong and had to protect his friend by speaking to an adult he felt at that time could help. I really hope she and her family can have a lovely future without that piece of shit in it. 
"6 hours ago, I stopped myself from committing suicide.","I walked to a park near my neighborhood around 10 at night, swung on the swings, then sat in an empty field with my pocket knife in my hands. I cried. A lot. I thought about my life and all the things going wrong, and cried some more. I thought about my daughter, and how I would be putting her through the pain I went through not having a father. I thought about her growing up without a father like me. I thought about how she would move on and pick herself up, and be better than I ever was. I thought about how her life would be better without me. I thought about my mom and how she would hate me, and rightfully so. I thought about how she'd take in my daughter and give her an amazing life like she gave me and my sister. Then I thought about my sister and how strong she is. How she would pick up the pieces of my family after I'm gone and save everyone else. I thought about my best friend and how he would lose a part of himself, but fill it with something better than me. How he would do everything in his power to pick up my slack. I thought about my boyfriend and how he would wonder what happened. Would he ever figure out that I'm dead? I thought about how he would be better off not being around someone who is nothing but issues. How he would move on and find something more fulfilling.

Then, I got 2 texts at the same time. One was from my sister telling me she loves me and to be safe walking at night, the other was from my boyfriend saying something goofy like always. Those texts made me think about all of the good things I have, everything I take for granted. All of the people who would be hurt if I continued. Those texts made me laugh, even with tears streaming down my face. Then I thought about who would find my body, and how scarring that would be for them. I thought about my family, wondering where the hell I am at 3 in the morning after being gone for hours. Them calling the police, crying, and thinking the worst. Then I thought about how weak I am. How I keep tearing myself down, reopening healed wounds. How selfish I would be, taking the easy way out and leaving my problems to fall on my loved ones. Those damned texts saved my life.

I was weak, and that's the truth. In that moment of pure selfishness, I almost did the thing I told myself I would never do. So I cut, but not deep. Just to remind myself how alive I am, how things may hurt, it may feel like I'm dying, but they can heal. They may not heal perfectly, but a scar is better than an infected wound. I shall carry these scars until I am old, because I will get old. I'll live, just to spite the weakness in me. I'll say ""fuck you"" to the darkness and the coldness and that urge to give up. No more. I'm done, but not done living. I'm done with this cold, dark, deep ocean. It's my time to swim to the surface and stay afloat no matter how tired my legs may get. I'm ready to stay alive."
"I have something to share, it would mean alot if you read it","Last year, something bad and unjust happened to me, it triggered my depression and suicidal thoughts and somehow my parents came to know about it. I really didn't want it to happen because I've always been emotionally numb to my parents and wanted to keep it that way but after my father found out that I was depressed and had suicidal thoughts, he told me his story.

&#x200B;

When I was one year old, my father got into a fight with a subordinate. He had been a supervisor for many years and had a subordinate (Let's call him Jim) who kept pushing for a promotion but my father couldn't recommend him because he had very poor work ethic. Jim got really aggravated and started taunting my father on a daily basis, taunting and cursing him every single day until my dad scolded him back.

&#x200B;

Jim then picked a fight with my dad and got my dad fought back and got badly injured. My dad lost his job that day and found out that Jim did it on purpose because Jim had secured a job in another country and wanted them both to get fired - since Jim basically wanted to leave the company. It was the lowest point in my dad's life not only because of how unfair it was, he had to get stitches, he lost his job, and he had to go back home to his wife and one year old son to tell them the bad news.

&#x200B;

My dad's friend (Let's call him Timothy), offered my dad a partnership to start up a new company and fast forward a few decades, the business became really successful.

&#x200B;

My dad told me, you can't win all the time and one day you WILL lose, its about what you learn and how you pick yourself up. He said tragedies are sometimes a blessing in disguise and we all become a bit wiser after each trial. Hate is like a gift, if you refuse it, the other person has to take it back. He said he wanted to find Jim and thank him for causing him to lose his job because of how much more he accomplished compared to if he had stayed in that job as a supervisor.

&#x200B;

I'm typing this story here for a few reasons:

1. I want to record his story so that I have something to look at when I'm down.
2. Maybe it will help someone out there.
3. I needed a place to process my thoughts.

Thank you for reading this. I hope it brightens up your day a little.

I'm sleeping on the couch tonight.,"Next to my old, blind dog on the very last night of his life. He's so old. He hurts. He can't see and can barely walk and poops on everything because he isn't good at holding it anymore. He doesn't know where he is at all now. 

It's time. 

The vet is coming tomorrow to give him a much needed rest. So I'm sleeping on the couch with him because he can't get in bed anymore. 

I think he's ready. 

I'm not. But it's the right thing to do. And I promised him I would always do right by him. 

I love you, my goodest boy. You are by far the best dog I will ever have. I hope you sleep well.

Thank you all again. I never expected this when I posted last night. You are all amazing people. I am reading all your posts and am just overwhelmed by the support and love. Thank you thank you thank you."
"I spent my 23rd today completely alone, after a few years of being let down when my friends/others weren’t around after I expected them to be.

I got a hit. I collected a sample that got a child removed from the care of her rapist.,"Thank you so much for all the kind, encouraging replies, I got teary again reading from the survivors, the other professionals, and those seeking to support people they know and love.

Thank you to the people who commented with understanding of the uncertainty of unfolding case, and the deep, complex trauma of the little girl.

The case is not closed, although I said the the evidence could not be ""explained away,"" this was a gross simplification of the role that forensic evidence plays in criminal justice, and referred only to the simplest kinds of cross contamination. If this case ever goes to trial (as opposed to a plea, or a simple termination of parental rights,) there is the possibility that a jury will decide that there is an innocent explanation. And in the absence of a clear disclosure, they may be right to do so.

So right now I am just hoping the little girl is safe. I hope she is with safe, good family members, or in a stable, loving foster home, or even in a facility with caring, professional, well trained staff who can help her feel a little bit more normal and relaxed.

I hope so much that she never needs to be removed from a home again.

Giving birth to my daughter changed the way I love my foster children.,"My daughter was born 2 months ago. Throughout my entire pregnancy many people told me that the way I felt about my foster children would change when my birth child was born.  

""It's different with your *own* kid."" 

""Your world will change when you hold your baby for the first time."" 

""You don't know love, until you've had a child."" 

Although I wasn't fostering while I was pregnant, I still had a close relationship with my foster children and their birth families. I'd fostered 10 children total. Two sibling groups of 3. One sibling group of 4. All ended up back with their birth families at the end of their stays with me. But I've told my foster children a thousand times they will always be my ""family by heart"". I'm always there for them. I'll always love them. And that's the arguement I made to the many people who told me that things would change when my birth child arrived. People kept telling me I wouldn't love my foster children as much once she was here. ""Things would just be different."" And I continually argued that that was not the case.

Then, on February 10th 2018, my little girl arrived. And as I transitioned into the role of ""birth parent"", I realized they were right... sort of. The people who told me that I'd love my foster kids differently after the arrival of my daughter, were right. Things were different. *Everything* was different. From the moment my daughter was born she had someone there to love her. She was coddled, cuddled, loved, adored, and cherished. Her diaper is always changed right away. When she's hungry, she's fed immediately. If she's cold, there's a body ready to warm her up. And if she's lonely, there's a mother just a few steps away who is ready to hold her- for hours upon relentless hours. My daughter is loved- not just in my heart, but through my actions. 

And the more I cared for my daughter, the more my heart ached for my foster children. I would sit at night, holding my newborn, and I would cry over the fact that my foster kids were not always loved in the way my birth daughter was (and always will be). I know that their cries were not always answered. They were not always fed. Their clothes were not always clean and they were not always shown unconditional love through the actions of the adults around them. And I hurt so terribly for them. I wish with everything that I could go back in time and find a way to get to them and love them- the same way I love my birth daughter. I wish that they never would have had to have been through a day where they were not cared for.  

I didn't think it was possible, but giving birth to my daughter has made me love my foster children even more. It's made my heart break for them further. It's made me wish that I could do something -anything- to ensure they had as privilaged of a life as my birth daughter will have. If someone told me that if I cut off my own leg, each of my foster kids would instanteously be offered a good life- I'd grab a knife without hesitation. But life isn't fair, and their lives (in brutal honesty) are not fair- and will not be fair. And that's what hurts most of all. I can't give them the life I can give my daughter. I have no legal or biological right to do so. But I have the emotional right to care about them, and I sure as hell will- for the rest of their lives.

 I want to be a snob, and go up to the people who told me ""things would change"" and tell them that I love my foster children even MORE now that my birth daughter has entered this world. But I don't think they'd understand. There are so many people out there who simply believe that the only way to have a true connection with a child is to share their genetics. And perhaps, for them, that's true. But for me- it isn't. Not one bit. 

 ""It's different with your *own* kid."" - Foster children are my *own* children. Perhaps not in a traditional sense, but in my heart they were my *own* kids from the day they arrived on my doorstep- with their tattered clothes shoved into garbage bags. The memories I have with them are ones that bless my heart each and every day. They always cross my mind. And I hope they never stop crossing my mind- as they deserve to be there.

""Your world will change when you hold your baby for the first time."" - It did, in a lot of ways. I had never thought about the privilage of children who came from good homes before having my daughter. I'd always fostered and just kind of accepted the fact that sometimes life is shitty- and good kids get really shitty upbringings. It wasn't until my daughter was born that I began to contemplate the fact that life doesn't *have* to be shitty. And it's not okay that any child has to start out life in a shitty situation. (I really don't like cursing, but for the sake of getting my point across I think it's fair. ""Shit"" is really the only accurate way to describe this all). Having my daughter has made me even more empathetic. My world did change- in a way that has only reassured me that fostering is my calling. And, now, fostering to adopt is- because if I can give children a better life, I will. 

""You don't know love, until you've had a child."" - I knew love the second I fostered my first sibling group. They were my ""first child(ren)"". And I knew love again and again- with my second sibling group, my third sibling group, and the birth of my daughter. But the love each of those kids has recieved from me is no more special or deep than the love any of the other's are given. They are all loved equally. Each kid is loved differently- a unique love tailored to their needs and the absolutely wonderful relationship I hold with them. And although I love each child in a different way, they are all loved with the same hopeless tenacity. 

I don't know how to end this rant, other than simply saying that if you've ever wondered about fostering- do it. I could tell you 1,000 stories of ways my foster children impacted my life dramatically. They taught me so many lessons and gave me so many amazing memories. I've never laughed harder than I did with them. I've also never cried harder- and I've never been taught so much patience. It's hard, but so is catering to my birth child. The stereotypes you've heard about foster kids aren't true. Each of my children were brilliant- smart, funny, kind, HELPFUL individuals. Sure- they had some issues from time to time (show me a single kid who doesn't throw tantrums, struggle with something in school, or have some wild emotions sometimes). But they were- they ARE- amazing. Fostering will change your life, people. And we need more good foster parents out there. I did it single. I did it on a $30k a year salary. You don't need to be straight, married, a homeowner, or rich to foster. I'm not religious. I had no ""spiritual calling"" to foster. I just love kids- so freaking much. And if you do, please please please consider it.  And if you have no yearning to bring a non-biological child into your home and heart, don't underestimate someone else's ability to love a child they didn't give birth to. I have had a birth child, and I have had foster children. And I know, for a fact, they can both be loved whole-heartedly."
"If you’re in line behind me, back the fuck up.","I am so sick of people who stand so close and move up the instant I do. Please, back the fuck up. Gain some awareness. People will respect you more."
Comfronted a creep at the gym,"Something happened earlier this week that I wanted to share; I can’t stop replaying it in my mind and the whole situation just has me feeling like I need a shower. 

I work out a gym at a small university in eastern Canada. It’s a small community and lots of residents take advantage of the facility to exercise. 

Monday I spotted an older man, roughly 60, not-so-subtly filming a girl doing bentover rows from about 15-20 feet behind her. 

I didn’t act immediately in case I was wrong (pretty big accusation if he was actually just texting), but did a bit more recon and when he pulled his phone out again, I circled around him to make sure I was right. Lo and behold, he’s zoomed in right on her. 

I fucking lost it

Grabbed his phone, stiff-armed him while I deleted the videos (also deleted them from the trash bin folder), and loudly informed the girl of what she’d been subjected to. Literally everybody in the gym was looking at this, which I’m happy about because he was sufficiently embarrassed and ashamed, but in retrospect, I probably could’ve gone about this more subtly for the girls’ sake. 

I keep replaying it in my head and I know there are a million things I could do differently, but it was a heat of the moment type of thing. Just feels good to get off my chest. I legit felt dirty afterwards. 

Fuck that guy, man. 

Edit: thank you all for reassuring me that I did the right thing. That made me feel all warm and fuzzy

Edit 2: thanks for the gold and platinum!!! Made my week"
I used to purposely wake up my daughter when she was a baby because I felt lonely.,"I stopped doing this when she was about a year old and got a few cats, which helped. 

My husband died during the pregnancy and I had no immediate family members or friends that I could talk to and it was such a low point in my life that she was the only source of social interaction outside of shopping going to the doctors, I worked from home so I had no coworkers to talk to.

I’d go up to her crib and cough, laugh, or sneeze loud enough to wake her. Sometimes I’d even turn the tv  volume up if my other tactics didn’t work. I was emotionally dependent on her, she was my everything and only will to live.

Luckily I’m not like this anymore but I just felt like I needed to say this out loud somewhere.

Edit) Thanks everyone for your kind words. This has been eating away at me for a while and I’m glad I could get it off my chest.

Edit 2) I need to add this, it wasn’t a constant thing I did. I only did this when I was feeling really down.

Edit 3) Thanks for the gold, I didn’t notice until now."
I’m glad my Grandpa left my mother only $1 in his will and gave the rest to his grandchildren.,"Back in 2004, he told me he was going to do it. He said he changed his will and was going to leave my Grandma [his ex wife] $2 and his kids [my uncle & mother] $1 each while he left the rest to me and my sisters. 12 year old me thought “yeah right, okay I’ll believe it when I see it”. 

Well what do ya know, he passed away in 2014 and during the reading of his will, jaws were dropping, tears were flowing, shock was setting in. My mother called me because I was living out of state at the time and broke the news. At first, I couldn’t believe it but I remember what he told me ten years before that. You son of a gun. I felt bad for my uncle but my mother, people a kick out of that every time I tell the story, here’s why. 

Here’s a little back story about my mother. She’s crazy, refuses to get help and made our entire family’s life a living hell my entire childhood. We were subject to physical and emotional abuse, alcoholism, homelessness, going evenings without meals, living in poverty, domestic violence, leaving me and my sisters home alone for hours while she worked. She never got caught for anything she did to us. I moved out as soon as I graduated and moved out of state. The tipping point for her finally came when she was arrested for third degree child abuse, lost custody of her kids, lost her job at a school, got a felony. 

I have no remorse for this woman. I do not talk to her anymore because it’s a toxic relationship and I will not subject myself, my husband or my children to that. I’m glad she only got $1. That’s all she deserves. Thank you Grandpa for helping us get out of debt and a new vehicle. I love you and miss you always. "
To the stranger at the coffee shop this morning: thank you.,"I was sitting in a coffee shop this morning before work looking rather mangey - no makeup, 4-day old hair in a braid, not my cutest clothes, red, puffy eyes from crying, etc. I've been going through a rough patch of anxiety and depression and have been pretty fed up with social media and technology in general as of late, so I didn't have my phone, a computer, or anything with me. I just wanted to sit, have a cup of coffee, and watch the world go by out the window for a while.

After about 10 minutes, a guy walked past my table and complimented my hair. A little while after that, the same guy came back and asked if he could speak with me for a few minutes. He told me he was intrigued that I was the only one in the place not glued to any sort of technology, he thought I was ""very pretty,"" and that he couldn't help but notice I looked sad and/or I had a lot on my mind. He said he didn't want to pry, but he hoped things started looking up for me soon, wished me well, and left. I don't necessarily believe in angels, but it's almost as if this person was some sign from the universe to keep my chin up.

Hopefully by sharing this interaction, it can be a reminder to someone that even at your lowest and darkest, there's at least one person out there who sees beauty and light in you, even if you can't see it yourself. 

(...Also to put the damn phone away once in a while. You might be surprised at what could happen or who you could meet.)

Edit: Thank you to the kind guilder for the gold. I’m happy that this post has resonated with a lot of you, and I hope it was one of just a few or many things that brightened your day."
I'm not poor because of iced coffee.,"Oh my sweet lord am I sick of this “advice”. Everywhere I go – Internet, real life, everywhere – the same trite nonsense. I’m talking, of course, about the following:

“If you want to save money, you should stop buying that coffee everyday!”

“LPT: If you make your own coffee at home, you can save $1.9B per annum.”

“DAE stop buying the coffee?”

My God, even the financial aid director of my graduate school gave us this advice. Newsflash, my friend, I’m not poor because I buy an iced coffee everyday. I’m poor because of the opaque and inflated tuition that American universities charge in order for people to accomplish their lifelong dreams.

But that’s very much beside the point. Why? *Because life is not just about accumulating money.*

“Do you realize how much you spend per year on coffee?”

Yes. I spent $2.12 most weekdays.

“But do you know how much that adds up to?”

Yeah. It’s like $12 per week, $48 per month, $576 per year.

“Do you realize that you are a bad person for having done this?”

NO. Because it BRINGS ME JOY. Yes, I know exactly how much money it costs. I pay my rent and bills on time. I also buy this, because it makes me happy and gives me something little to look forward to everyday. When I die I won’t be celebrating the infinitesimal difference in my bank account that I could have achieved by nobly giving up one of my daily pleasures. I *will* celebrate the joy that comes with the human experience.

Alright, I’m off to buy an iced coffee.

"Dying from cancer, manage to accomplish things I can say I'm proud of, but wasn't able to find someone who loves me.","I have lung cancer and Stage 4 NHL. Non-smoker by the way, just lost the lottery, that's all. Considering the damage found from early on during the initial diagnosis, I am not expected to live for too long. I don't want to get into details in case some friends recognize this.

I'm roughly 27 years old. I've been trying out new things, I have had so much fun with new hobbies, instruments I've learned over the last year, and have developed a routine for the gym since high school. I didn't manage to go into what I wanted, entering college, but I'm happy with the jobs I managed to pick up from connections. I'm very happy with what I've done so far.

But the one thing I've tried to do, and have failed at, is to find a girl who likes me. I don't bring up what I have and my outlook, but as of dozens of approaches and some new friendships kindled, there has been no one attracted to me. Apart from my physique, I'm not physically attractive up in the face, to say the least. Been trying different things since high school, nothing has changed as of yet.

I don't want a hookup, not that I have one so far, or a pity fuck since I don't want to bring up my cancer as I don't want it to be the reason or my identity, but honestly this is the one thing that keeps me up at night. I'm still waiting for someone and I likely won't find this person.

My lungs are starting to deteriorate, I've started exhibiting symptoms of where things will start to go downhill from here on out. I've seen the specialists and it's not looking so good. 2019 might be my last year.

I don't know why I'm writing this. I have lots of friends who love me, parents that I'm blessed to have in my life, and have done things I'm proud of. But something as selfish as wanting someone to love me and be attracted to me, I can't achieve that.

I just needed to get this out there. Sorry, it's probably a bunch of nonsense, I'm not that eloquent in getting my words out.

I know I'm going to expect some pity responses and the same old phrases, and I'd rather not, but fuck it really hurts today.

EDIT: Thank you for words, I couldn't get through reading most of them since I didn't expect to get this kind of reaction, and also went to bed. I'll try to respond to those who reached out if I can, but there's a lot so my apologies if I don't get back to you! I'm speechless right now!

"""Old"" disgraced ballerina here...","When I was 4 years old, I was immediately enrolled at a ballet academy. Due to my body not being a proper ballet body, I was put on a strict diet (at 5, yes 5 years old). No junk food, no carbs, lots of gym. This cycle haunted me well into adulthood. When I got older, girls would bring in cigarettes and use them behind the building, I couldn't smoke, I play the trumpet! Nevertheless I found myself inhaling second hand smoke, feeling like a million bucks when I danced, even though nothing really changed. My performances were outstanding, but this horrible diet left me clawing for some chocolate and a Seinfeld marathon, even though I only ever had chocolate once. Soon these two girls came. They were good and the instructor was so nice to them. I'm not saying anything against being a pet of the instructor and I guess we all have our favourites, but I remember standing on point shoes for two hours waiting to do something while these girls were drowning in attention. I was so furious that I got other girls standing around to help me confront the instructor. After 22 years of this nightmare, the body shaming, the abuse, the climax came up during The Nutcracker, my last performance. I was originally a principal role but I was put in the chorus line in favour of the two girls. Sure, I can accept that they could perform the role better, but a week before we open? I was doing my best when my overworked body caught up with me. I collapsed onstage. I was put in care and was taught that eating well was more important than looking good. It's been a year since I have last touched my ballet shoes and I've tried different things. I now carry the title of a disgraced ballerina. I went to my last day and my instructor shamed me, my short hair, highlights glistening in the sun, my new diet, ruining the work she put in, my face pale without makeup, the new me. Big shoutout to her: I hope no-one else suffers in your grotesque hands. Fuck you for making me read Thinspo blogs and share what I've learnt, fuck you for making me feel like shit when I saw naturally thin people and crying that I'll never be attractive. Kiss my full round ass. I am a disgraced ballerina and I could not be happier.

I really did it! I ran a 12 minute mile!,"I know it isn’t that fast, but I’m so damn proud of myself. 

A few months ago I joined a gym. I was fat, coming out of depression and ashamed at how out of shape I was. I had never run or lifted weights in my life. I started on the lowest possible settings/weights for everything and had to take constant breaks so I didn’t throw up. But I kept doing it, three times a week, a run on the treadmill and a cardio/weight circuit. The weight isn’t coming off the way I hoped, the pants aren’t really fitting much differently and I was getting so frustrated, I didn’t want to go today. But I did. 

And today, today I am a still fat, in somewhat better shape, runner. I did it. I ran the whole damn time and I did that whole mile in 12! freaking! minutes! 

And I didn’t want to throw up once.

Edit:
Holy Moly! A Gold! Thank you so much! 

Thank you everyone for the support and encouragement!  I am blown away by the love! My new goal will be a 5K by the fall, I really think I can get there! 

And for anyone who is thinking of (and intimidated by) starting to exercise or go to the gym, do it! I’m fat, was practically sedentary and in my late 30s. If I can do it, you can definitely do it!

To my son; 8:29pm,"Its 8:29pm and we’ve been cuddling for an hour in the rocking chair. Your mother is at work, and soon, I’ll have to put you in your crib so I can get ready for my midnight shift right as she gets home. Your goofy mannerisms and your smile made it difficult to get you ready for bed; but that’s okay, I was goofy with you. We giggled and played before you laid in my arms. I watched your eyes grow heavy as you drank your milk. It’s 8:29pm and you’ve been asleep for a long while now. I can see your subconscious smile in the soft glow of the nightlight as it melts my heart. I can see you growing before me, getting older. I’m excited to see you become a boy, a young man, all with bright hopes and dreams... but tonight, I want you to stay as my little baby, my little guy safe and sound. I beg any higher power to let this one minute last a little while longer. I’ve never experienced a pain like this; my heart is broken to know that the older you get, the more independent you’ll become -yet at the same time, my heart is full and whole with you around, happy and healthy. At least at this moment, in this minute, you’re in my arms as a happy baby.  God, don’t let 8:30 come. I’m not ready yet. "
I won. I fucking won. It's over.,"I want to get all of this out. I want everyone to fucking know what I did and know that *I WON*. 

What did I win? **Freedom.**

I'm from a small town in TN. When I say ""small,"" I mean roughly around 500 people with a small grocery store that closed at 6 PM every day and a graduating class with 30. That small. In this small town, there were never any opportunities to succeed. My dad was a farmer and my mom was a housewife. Grew up dirt poor. How the story usually goes in places like this. 

I have two brothers and a sister (I'm a guy), and I'm also the youngest. I was the ""accident."" Mom wanted a girl, and she finally got my sister at the third try, but I just happened and I was reminded of this every single day of my life. I was told, constantly, that I would never amount to anything. 

My oldest brother grew up to be a mechanic with a wife he cheats on regularly, my second brother committed suicide ten years ago, and my sister is addicted to pain pills and has three kids of her own and lives with my parents. 

But me? I fucking graduated high school, got a scholarship to Stanford (STANFORD!), and I got the *fuck* away from there. I got out of TN and I won. I fucking won. 

I'm currently back home in TN attending the funeral of my aunt that passed away, and my family began arguing over money. Everything was left to my father (it was his sister), but there's a huge argument going on over it. Everyone treats me with hostility, and I was never welcomed in this family. But you know what? I won. I don't fucking care how much I'm disliked simply for existing. 

I made it. I succeeded in life. I was able to conquer all of the shit that was thrown at me. 

While my parents and siblings were arguing over the money today, I watched them from the background. Quietly, I slipped out of the front door without even saying a word. I'm never coming back here. There's nothing to come back to. Besides, I have my own life. 

And you may think this is arrogant or awful of me to say, but I was shit on -- constantly -- for 18 years of my life. Growing up unwanted is an awful thing to bear witness to. But I did it. *I fucking did it.*

I have no family, but I have ""family"" back in California who have loved me more than my parents ever have. So, I'm not sad or upset. I'm fucking happy to be rid of this burden. 

I won. I wasn't another ""victim"" of small town life. I beat the odds, distanced myself, and I fucking DEFEATED my own demons. 

I'm fucking proud of myself, and no one can take that away from me. 

**EDIT:** I am... beyond surprised that this post exploded. I made this while sitting at the airport and waiting for my delayed flight. I just thought it would be lost, but I just sat and read SO MANY messages of support, encouragement and amazing perseverance from you guys. You are all wonderful, amazing human beings. I want to thank you for sharing your own stories and making yourselves vulnerable to me. I will do everything I can to reply to each and every single one of them. But there are a few things I think I made unclear from my post:

* I am 24. I graduated from Stanford in 2012 with my Bachelor of Science in CEE (Civil and Environmental Engineering). [Side note: I'm currently working as a TA at Stanford and going to grad school for Construction Engineering and Management.]
* The reason why I made this post was because, ever since I graduated high school and moved away from TN, my parents never made an effort to contact me, nor did my siblings -- except my oldest brother, who told me that my aunt had died. The summer after I finished my undergraduate degree, I decided to visit my family (I had not seen them since I left home at 18 and they did not come to my graduation, nor did they even send a card/phone call). When I got there, no one even knew who I was. Seriously. I showed up with my luggage and my mom said, and I quote, ""Who the fuck are you?"" When I told her, she asked where I was staying -- I wasn't even welcome in the home. After staying there for a few weeks, my parents decided to ask me for $2000, saying that they needed it for bills/stop their home from being foreclosed on. I gave them the money. My mom ended up giving half of it to my sister for a new car and my dad used it to buy wheels for his truck. His fucking truck. That's really what made me understand that I was nothing more than a stranger to them and they were strangers to me. So, essentially, two years ago is when I ""separated"" myself from them. No one even asked about college, my life or even how I was doing. *I was just there.* So after about a month of being back in TN, I decided to move back to CA -- permanently -- and live with my boyfriend. And that's what I did. I left then, but I was angry and upset and hurt. I was enraged, but I thought in the back of my mind, ""Maybe they'll come around one day?"" Before I left, my oldest brother shook my hand and said that he wishes things would have been different for me. I'm not sure what he meant by that, but that was the most intimate we had ever been. 

* I came back for my aunt's funeral in hopes of reconciling with my family. And, as I told you all in my post, it didn't happen that way. When I got into town, I was burning up with rage and anger and resentment. I was so ready to lay into my family and tell them off. But after I sat through the funeral and after my pilled-up sister pissed in the flower pot at the funeral home (I'm not even kidding) and after my father forgot who I was (again), I just realized I have to let it all go. I had to let them all go. So when I walked out through the front door, that was the last time I was ever coming back. No more. I renounced my relationship with them. And all that anger and bitterness and resentment I was feeling just melted away, and I felt the weight lift off my shoulders. Even my older brother who, in the past, had shown me some humanity, seemed distant. He didn't even look at me while I was there. And several of you have told me that I am still ""suffering"" or ""not over it,"" but truth be told... family just isn't something you *have* to love. I was never ""cared"" for. Every piece of clothing I got until I was 15 came from my older brother. I made my own food. I taught myself how to fucking write by watching my sister do her homework! I was abandoned, essentially, and that does hurt. It hurts more than anything I will probably ever experience. 

But it's over, and I am done with that part of my life. I have an amazing boyfriend that (I hope) will propose to me soon, we're moving to New York at the end of this year, and we have two cats (Malala and Nelly) who are our children. I have amazing friends, I teach amazing students, and I have an amazing career that I love waking up and going to every single day. When people ask me where I'm from, I tell them I'm from a small town in TN. When I'm asked about my family, I tell them that I don't speak with them any more, but that they're nice people. They really are nice; my mom loves to decorate the house and my dad knows everything about agriculture like it's second nature. My oldest brother may not be the most morally-conscious man, but he's a nice man. My other brother that killed himself was really good at drawing -- he would have made it, too, if he had only been given help. My sister is... well, she's something. She can cook great food, probably giving Gordon Ramsay a run for his money! 

I don't deny the humanity that my family has; they are people who got the shit end of life, I don't ignore that. But when it comes down to it, I simply don't factor into their lives and I never will. And that's okay, because life has taken me all over this world. I wish I had a father to walk me down the aisle and a mother I could hug, but I don't. But do you know what I do have? 

My life. 

Thank you guys so much for listening to me gripe and whine. It has been extremely cathartic to get it all out. "
I mean this in the most serious way possible,"Peanut m&ms are my absolute fucking favorite m&ms. I know a lot of people think that’s wrong but I feel that shit in my heart

Edit: Sorry. I was high"
"You are the worst, slimiest types of people and I absolutely hate you","I posted a thing recently on legaladvice about my brother and it got a lot of attention. i reported my brother for him spying on me and putting a camera in my room and then violating a temporary restraining order and my religious catholic parents took his side and disowned. they burnt my shit and cursed me out. I'm very alone right now and its really been one of the worst times in my life.

i got so many messages, like hundreds upon hundreds of messages. i only responded to like three or four and had a really long phone conversation with this incredibly nice university professor across the country who was one of the nicest people i've ever met, she just put my mind at total ease. but man. 

So many people, like about fifty or sixty messages worth, all from catholics and christians, who just want to add in these little defenses, have to get the PR team in, make sure i'm not mad at jesus, that i know that REAL christians don't do this.

""that wasn't christianity, they aren't real catholics.""

""However, I want you to know that there are a lot of Christians out there who love you. They would love for you to reach out to them. Don't let someone else's atrocities keep you from happiness, family, and salvation."" (low key saying i deserve to go to hell)

""You can't let the sins of others doom you. It isn't what Christ wants for you.""

""Your parents are not acting even remotely Catholic.""

""i've found peace and truth within the church, you can too.""

""This isn't representative of Christians, I promise.""

all real quotes, copy and pasted.

what a load of crap. the only person who has EVER hurt or betrayed me in a way worse than my family is doing now was a priest. I haven't actively tried to think about this for years but i'm just so angry at this attitude. don't bullshit me. It's perfectly representative of catholicism and you know it. Its a religion that encourages ultimate deference to authority and instituinal power and that everyone is a total piece of shit who deserves horrible things to happen to them.

Why is your first instinct when someone has these problems to make sure that the church isn't in trouble. it's the church we need to worry about, right? the church? always the church. can't make the church look bad, can't let jesus look bad, can't make god look bad nope nope nope. sorry you had a problem but whats important is that you remember that the church doesnt encourage this.

this is the only thing that makes me mad like this. Look at the news with Pennsylvania. My parents defended that stuff just like they defended my pious good catholic brother, i'm sure all these people did too. you don't give a crap about other people. you don't give a crap about ANYTHING except protecting religions image so you don't have to think about the fact that it might not be real and that REAL people might be suffering real abuses because of your support. 

never listening to this crap again. i really tried having a more positive attitude about this and people in general in the last few years but i don't care anymore. i'm so goddamn mad.

"Sneaking around behind my fiancee's back, literally...","It's been going on for nearly two years, and it happens multiple times per week. But you've gotta understand, my fiancee loves to cook dinner and she'll often spend days planning and preparing fun meals for us both to enjoy. It's adorable, actually. And appreciated. But early on in our cohabitating relationship I began questioning our future together because everything she made would look so mouthwatering, but would mysteriously taste totally flat, or worse, unedible. After creeping in on a few of her cooking sessions, I eventually came to the realization that she NEVER added salt while preparing ANYTHING. She always adds a fair amount of shakes to her plate, so it can't be a dietary concern. So I tried subtly dropping a suggestion here and there without being condescending (I hope). But like a complete coward, too weak to have one difficult conversation with the woman I love, I started salting right behind her back. Every meal she cooks. All the necessary steps requiring salt. And she's even in the kitchen when I do it. And I really can't believe I'm admitting this, but I actually ordered a secret salt shaker on Amazon and had it delivered TO MY OFFICE. To think, if a few inches taller, she'd be able see the two-year-long lie we've been living, hidden right among the travel mugs."
Found out I’m HIV-positive on my 21st birthday,"I went back home at 11pm after a small birthday party with my close friends. I had my first legal drink.

My parents called me while I was checking my social networks and emails to see if anyone remember my birthday. 

I opened an email from my school’s laboratory where I had a free blood test some weeks ago.

The results says I’m HIV positive.

I told my parents that I’m tired and drunk and need to go to bed. 

I checked the results one more time, went to bed, couldn’t sleep. 

I can’t tell my parents at least for now. We are catholic. I’m gay.

About a year ago, I had my first sex. Unprotected. My partner who is a friend of my friend told me he’s clean. We enjoyed it. After that day, we’ve never talked again.  

Some weeks after my first sex. I noticed some weird problems in my body. I got effected by a small cut on my leg. I had swollen lymph nodes. I know I could have HIV already. But I was not brave to confront it. I didn’t go testing my blood.

After that, I felt healthy again.

I prayed a lot.

Never had sex since then.

Last month I decided to test my blood. I was so scared.

And I got the result last night on my 21st birthday. 


UPDATED: 
I just got home from school and feel so grateful for the love you’ve shared. 

Just to clarify: To see the test result, I had to log in and go through several confirmations such as my info, ID, etc. they also provide me information and support or so. Btw I live in the US.

I feel a little better now. I don’t think I will tell my parents. So I need a job to afford the medication. I will go to see a doctor next week.  My life will change from this point for sure. 
"
I'm a man and I just realized I was raped.,"It's 4 am. I just woke from a dream that I was upset about my ex even though we broke up 7 years ago. I still sometimes get angry because she was physically abusive. Anyways, in the dream, I talked to my mom about it, and she told me the reason I was upset was because Diana was raping me. And I woke up so quickly because  then it clicked. 


She used to hit me most if I didn't have sex with her. She would cry, yell at me, and hit me until my ""no"" became a ""yes."" And it happened all the time. I've told people it was an abusive relationship before, I just never connected the dots. What she did was rape. And I think if I were a woman, I would have connected the dots sooner because someone would have picked up on it right away. But most people don't think of a man being raped and might be more dismissive of subtler things. 


But it's true. I'm lying in bed next to my wife and I'm saying it here, and I'm saying it out loud: I was raped."
If you still support Trump you’re ruining my country,"I’ve never let politics be divisive. I have great debates on policy with friends over beers and that’s a debate every American should be having. I don’t even care if you voted for Trump, Hillary wasn’t a great candidate either. 2 years after the election though there’s something SERIOUSLY wrong if you still support him.

When it comes to this asshat now it’s so much more than just policy, it’s the meta stuff he’s doing to my country. The play book he’s using is the exact playbook every fascist has used before him and it’s insane to me how many people just turn a blind eye to this.

The biggest thing is his promotion of, “you’re either with me or against me.” He attacks anyone that doesn’t follow him in an easy, repeatable way that is so obviously a form of brain washing. 

Fake news was the first one. Every news is fake except Fox, unless NYT posts something good about the economy. The constant repetition of fake news this fake news that leads to more and more people denouncing what our eyes are seeing and instead blindly following whatever Trump says. Even yesterday he tweeted he wants a state run media to tell us all the good things about America, and people liked that idea! Hitler did it with Lugenpresse, Stalin denounced the media as “enemy of the people, and now Trump is doing the exact same thing.

Now that he knows Mueller’s coming he’s tweeting more and more about angry mueller and his gang of dems, using that exact same phrasing every single time. He’ll also actively attack his political opponents. “The liberals will open your borders and Comey is ruining the lives of great people.”

How more blatantly obvious does he have to be than saying the CIA, FBI, Cable News, and the opposing political party are the lying enemies but Russia, Saudi Arabia and anyone who spews his propaganda are allies we should take their word for? 

He’s also utilizes bigotry fear and hatred for political gain. “Be scared of the caravan 900 miles away!” You know what happened to it the day after the election. Vanished. It’s not our problem anymore. “We also have to build a wall or else the lying dems will let all of the Mexican rapists in.” 

He’s even putting his family in positions of power! Kushner and Ivanka have no place being anywhere near the Whitehouse, BUT THATS WHAT FASCISTS DO.

He’s even stacking the courts, rapidly filling appeals seats with partisan judges at a quicker rate than any president before him. He just appointed a stooge as the top cop in the country, and even if Kavanaugh isn’t a rapist just hearing how he speaks and acts shows he’s not qualified to be a fucking Supreme Court lifer.

It’s so blatantly obvious what he’s doing. He’s purposefully dividing us more than any president in history. He’s playing on our innate fears and chipping away at our political infrastructure that helps keep us a democracy. It doesn’t matter if you’re a Democrat or Republican, if you still support this man you’re either dumb or hate America."
I’m tired of “I don’t care” culture.,"Shutting people down for making progress or being empathetic about issues important to them isn’t nice. Being apathetic/staying jaded isn’t cool. Making no effort to care for the well-being of yourself, of others, of the planet, is not something that should be glorified or normalised. 

I’m tired of seeing people being shut down when talking about their passions or growth. I’m tired of seeing this “I don’t care, no one cares” culture being perpetuated in this generation as edgy or cool. I’m tired of people using mental illness as an excuse to stay apathetic and excuse their detrimental behaviours. 

As someone who’s struggled and is still struggling with depression, I mean in no way to belittle those who struggle with apathy as a symptom of mental illness, but I don’t see it as a valid excuse to normalise it because it shouldn’t be normal to feel this way. And it shouldn’t be okay to tell others that it’s okay to stay depressed because everyone else is depressed. 

It shouldn’t be okay to encourage extreme nihilism and belittle other’s passions and hobbies because of a “nothing matters we all die” mantra. This is the shit that makes people feel suicidal cause every time they try to bring up something that’s important to them it get shut down for “having no meaning”. This isn’t behaviour that should be normalised or taught to the newer generation.

Strive for empathy. Be kind. Be passionate. Be attentive. Show empathy for other people’s passions, no matter how trivial it may seem to you. Encourage growth, in yourself and others, however small. 

I know it’s difficult to stay positive and passionate when so much terrible shit is happening around the world, but that’s what makes it even more important. There’s a lot of good that’s happening in the world too, and there’s a lot of good that can be done by addressing the bad, rather than just giving up and accepting reality as it is.

I’m tired of “I don’t care” culture, and my resolution is to start by addressing it first. In myself and those around me."
Thank you to those who donate to thrift stores,"For context, I’m a college student in an extremely rural area (Vermont USA) without a car or drivers license.  I have a job on campus but I only make $40 a week. I also don’t have a family to help support me or buy necessities. 

I have been super gluing and duct taping my winter boots together, because I simply don’t have $40+ to buy a new pair. I’ve been extremely stressed about how I’m going to make it through the rest of the winter, because these boots are in tatters and there’s still 3-4 months left of winter. 

Today I went to a goodwill with low expectations since I wear a size 11 women’s shoe. When I got there I managed to find a post-Christmas miracle of practically brand new, nice quality, winter boots for $5. I don’t know who donated them, but I wish I could thank them. They’re donation is going to get me through this winter, and probably next years too. 

I buy most of my clothes in general from goodwill and other thrift stores. I don’t know what I would do without them honestly. So thank you to everyone who donates, because I don’t think you always realize how much you’re helping your community. 


Edit:  I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who’s reached out to me. This really does mean the world to me as I’ve been struggling lately and I’m so very grateful for how kind everyone has been. <3"
I'm dying and I don't know how to feel about it,"When they first told me that I had cancer I thought that I would make it. I did make it for a while. Things went alright and I went into remission when I was 18.

 Things looked good and I started college as a film student in a 4 year University but by the age of 21 it came back and had was progressing rapidly. I ended up quitting school because It didn't seem like it was worth planning for a future that I wouldn't have. 

 I'm 22 now and recently was given an estimate of 4-6 months. I've been trying to stay strong for my family, but I'm so fucking scared.

 I'll be 23 years old when I die. There were so many things that I wanted to do that I'll never get the chance to do. 

 I feel like I should be trying to find some rhyme or reason, or rationalizing some sort of after life or a god, but I just want to stay in my room and play videogames.

 I love my family but I am tired of being around them, I see that they are trying to stay strong but I feel like I have to comfort them. They are also extremely religious and have tried to use this to make me a believer.

 I don't want to comfort people, or explain what I feel to people who won't get it, or be fucking preached to. 


 I pre-ordered Red Dead Redemption two and my current goal is to stay healthy enough to beat it.  That's the one good thing about dying, I don't have to save my money or worry about my future. It my sound selfish but at this point I'm just trying to play as many videogames as possible and try not to think about any of it.

 Times like this are rough though, it's 5 in the morning and I'm too tired to do anything. So I have a lot of thoughts popping up in my mind that I want to avoid.

 I'd like to say something inspiring to close my post out with, but I don't have anything like that unfortunately. I'm sorry for this long drawn out post, but typing it out made me feel a little better. Besides, if you didn't care for my post what are you going to do? Kill me. I'd like to see you try.

**EDIT:** Holy shit you guys, I'm shocked by how much this blew up, thanks for all the support. You've all made me feel a lot better today than I did last night.

 I'm really sorry because I am trying to reply to as much as possible, but even if I don't reply I am reading everything that you guys send me.

**Edit 2:** Thanks for the gold, that's like a lifetime supply for me! Love you"
My Friends Dad feels like the first adult who’s ever given a shit about my mental health,"My friend Katie has a fucking great family, they’re very sweet and they’ve always welcomed me. When things would get bad at home, they’d let me come over, no matter how late or early. 

I’m sleeping over right now and her dad was in the kitchen (I was getting some water), and we had a really fucking nice conversation. He mentioned a few programs I should look into about children of alcoholic parents, he just let me talk and fucking listened and didn’t brush me off or ignore me like my family does. 

This is the first time an adult has ever taken my mental health seriously and it means the fucking world. 

Edit: Oh my god I just woke up and this blew the hell up holy cow !! Thank you for the gold! You guys are too sweet a w h

I told my 6-year-old daughter how rain actually works.,"I overheard my very Christian wife answering to her question, ""Mommy, how does it rain?"" My wife said, ""God does it."" That's it. That's all she said. This made me angry.

Shortly after, when my daughter and I were alone, I took her into the kitchen. ""I'll show you how rain works,"" I said. I poured water in the kettle and put it on the counter under the cupboards. ""Dad, why are you boiling the water?""

""When water boils, it turns into steam. Watch what happens when the steam goes on the cupboard."" Eventually, there were little rain droplets on the cupboard above the kettle. ""Come look,"" I said. She hurried over.

""Is that rain?"" she asked. ""Yes, that's rain. The water boiled and turned into steam. Then it turned back into water on the cupboard. Now it's dripping, like rain. Outside, rain from the ocean boils and comes back down as rain.""

""But then what does the rain stick to when it boils in an ocean?""

""The rain sticks to the clouds.""

""Why does the rain in the ocean boil?""

""The Sun heats up the ocean.""

""Oh I see. That's why puddles disappear, right?""

""Yes.""

""I get it now. Thanks Dad,"" she said and hugged me.

It just pisses me off how my wife is trying to teach her ""God did it"" for everything. I don't want my daughter to be ignorant. Sure, she can be a Christian, but you can't just answer everything with that. She needs to learn.

Thanks for reading."
I’m in love with my best friend. An update.,"Follow up to [this post here. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/9dkxxd/im_in_love_with_my_best_friend/?st=JNJ2MLOF&sh=fdf0f992)

I took your guys’ advice and waited a while to tell her. A week ago, I did. The result was unexpected. 

She told me she’s had feelings for me for a while too. My heart jumped. I couldn’t believe it. She was so incredibly happy that I said something. The way she smiled and tapped her feet (r/humantippytaps) made my heart melt. It was so cute. 

I kissed my best friend. I had sex with my best friend. I’m spending quality time with my best friend. 

I’m so unbelievably blessed to know someone like her, let alone have mutual feelings. Sometimes, life just falls into place even in the darkest of times. 

To all those waiting to say something to someone, don’t. You never know what the other side is thinking. I know I didn’t. 

I will, down the road, continue updates of our journey together. 

EDIT: I am so fucking overwhelmed by the positivity on this post. I did not expect it to blow up this big, I was just so happy and had to share it somewhere (my friends are tired of me rambling about it). I love you all, seriously. This feels like a fairytale. I’m so glad I was able to shed some positive light into a world where it is scarce. <3"
To you,"Dear you,
To clarify, yes, I mean you, the person reading this. I don't know who you are, but instead of that being weird, I think that's a good thing. Let me tell you a little something.

Things happen, all the time. People come, people go, you say things you wish you hadn't and you regret things you never said. You do thing, you don't do things, and sometimes you wish you'd do more, while at other times you achieve the unachievable, we all do.

And let me tell you one thing. You are good. Like really, genuinely good. Whether you're struggling or not, up or down, you. Are. Good. Life happens, sometimes it even feels like it passed you by, but you are here, you're walking among us and you, even if only sometimes, improve people's lives. 

Whether you are someone I see everyday, my best friend even, or if I only saw a meme you posted once in my life, you matter to me, and to everybody else. 

Stay strong, stay positive, but mostly, stay you.

Love,
Thorvals

I let him touch me.,"Sometimes the most intimate touch isn’t necessarily sexual in nature. 
Years ago, I was in an abusive relationship. The guy I was with broke into my home, and threw my hair straightener (at full force) into my bathtub (while it was hot) in an attempt to intimidate me. When that didn’t work he proceeded to physically abuse me. He didn’t “want” to punch or slap me, because that would leave black eyes and bruises (he left massive bruises anyway). Instead, he grabbed me by my arms and wrists and drug me through the house calling me every insult known to man while doing it. 

He got me into my bedroom.

He locked the door.

He threw me on the bed.

He towered over me, and he proceeded to straddle me. Once he had the full weight of his body securing me in place, he pinned my elbows down with his knees. 

Then he hurt my soul.

He squeezed my face by my jaw. He left dents in my cheeks. He brought my face impossibly close to his as I struggled against him, and validated every single one of my insecurities with screams. He suddenly stopped, looked down at my defenseless body, and smiled. His eyes went cold. I could feel his erection on my abdomen.

“I could do anything I want to you right now.”

I still shudder when I think about it. Luckily, my parents chose that particular day to visit me, so when he heard the car doors, he got startled enough to get off of me. I exhaled the breath I didn’t know I’d been holding and ran for the door. I later learned he’d fled through the window.

*I cannot bear to let anyone touch my face because of this*

Last night was the first time in a long time that I let someone touch my face. It was the most sincere, gentle form of affection I’d ever experienced. I was so exposed.... I felt beautifully vulnerable. It was so intimate, and that moment was ours and ours alone. He tamed that suffocating fear in a way I never thought possible, and answered the prayer I didn’t know I’d prayed.
Thank you for letting me share. ❤️"
My office gave me a Christmas miracle.,"I have been struggling as a single mom for a while. I got sober almost two years ago after a short relapse following 5 years of sobriety. I got a new job as an office manager for a real estate office almost 7 months ago and I love my job. I go there and give 110% every day. 

Things had been going well until a couple months ago. My kids’ dad disappeared. Ended up going down a bad path of drugs with already compromised mental health. He barely gave me any child support before but there has been nothing lately. 

Then my youngest daughter’s daycare raised their prices. Then I had some medical issues that racked up some hefty bills. Then my car died and I had no choice but to get a loan and buy a new one. Payments have been deferred until February and I’ve been constantly worrying how I’m going to make it work. 

Long story short, Christmas has been stressing me out. I just want my two girls (ages 3 and 6) to have a good Christmas. I have been constantly worrying how I’m going to afford it. It’s been keeping me up at night. They have been through a lot lately and I want nothing more than to not worry about getting supplies to make cookies, put some presents under the tree (well afford a tree as well) and see them smile when they open their gifts from Santa. 

I have been working extra lately to make it all work. 

Then on Thursday we had an office holiday party. I had a hellish week. I had to onboard 5 new agents, plan the party, and deal will all my normal responsibilities and year end reports. I am the entire office staff. Me. Taking care of 85 agents. 

Well I set up the party and they were all having a blast, I had to stay downstairs to watch the front desk as we were still open. One of the agents called me upstairs and had someone else come down to cover for me. 

They clinked a glass and made everyone be quiet. They handed me a card and wished me a Merry Christmas and said the most amazing things about how much they appreciated me and how much I do for the office. 

They have no idea what is going on in my personal life and how much I have been struggling lately. 

I open the card and it’s full of hundred dollar bills. I couldn’t believe it. It won’t solve all my problems but it will certainly help so much to help me have a wonderful Christmas and get back on track with bills. 

I am so appreciative and can’t believe they would do something so thoughtful for me. I cried my eyes out on the way home from work that day. 

Just needed to get that out. I have only been able to see the negative in the world lately and this has really helped me turn that around and see there is plenty of positive. There are people out there that care! 

Happy Holidays everyone! 

Edit: Wow thank you everyone for the support! Was not expecting to come back and have this many comments! I read each one and thank you for some very helpful advice as well!! 

Once again! Merry Christmas! 

Edit 2: Seriously, thank you to everyone and your kind words! It’s amazing how so many people I don’t know can helps so much to make me feel supported! I haven’t had much time to respond to comments but I have read them all!! Thank you!! "
Today is my birthday,"December birthdays are tricky, with Xmas parties and financial strains, and people getting older. I get that. 
But I arranged for my best and closest friends to come to my house, and I bought all the food, and some drinks, just to chill out and celebrate with me, with no financial burden to anyone at all. And I told them about it a month a go too. 
Two of the 15 people I invited is actually coming. 
And I’m so sad that some are ‘too tired’ or ‘not feeling it’ when it’s their birthday I always try and show face, even for a drink or half hour, and now I’ll sit at home like I do every other day, nothings new. 
But I have 150 cheese bites to eat with my two friends now so that’s cool. 
Just needed a vent. 
I’ll be fine tomorrow.


EDIT: I mean, wow, just wow. I dont do a lot on here, massive lurker, but wow. You guys have been incredible', and I dont know what do say. wow, thank you for brightening up a darkened day, I hope i get the opportunity to do the same. 
this birthdays been crazy but the birthday, has, i hope made it worth it. 

"
Please just give me the damn recipe,Every time I google a recipe I gotta scroll through someone’s fuckin life story and 15 pictures of the food before I can even get the damn recipe?  How did this happen?!
Please be gentle with him.,"I just dropped my dad off at the airport. It's his first plane ride in forever, his first vacation without my mom (she died more than a decade ago). I am so worried for him. I feel like the world is a more fast paced, impatient place. I am terrified of him needing help and some shit head making fun of him on social media. 

My dad is an easy going guy that wanted to have a short birthday trip. Please, please please, universe, let things go smoothly. 



Update: It's about 11 pm where I am. Thank you to everyone for the kind messages. I definitely teared up at some of your comments. 

My dad sent me a few texts throughout the day and he's currently getting settled in for the night. I am at his house with his dogs and they are confused as to why he's not coming through the door. 

He seems to be having a good time so far. He's excited that he beat his step goal for the first time in a long time. He's in Vegas so hopefully he won't get into too much trouble. 

If you run into a sixty something dad that talks your ear off about Texas sports teams, the fall tv lineups, or his stint in the Navy, then it's probably him. 

My brother and I are looking forward to seeing his pictures and hearing all about his trip when he gets back on Thursday. 

Have a good night, reddit. You are good people. "
Finally saw the ex that smashed my heart three years ago. He asked me if I was happy.,"And I didn’t even have to lie. I didn’t even have to pretend. 

He wanted “closure”. So he had me over and we talked. He asked me if I still thought of him. He had a look in his eyes that said he wanted to hear yes. And I said no. Again, I didn’t even lie. 

We dated for a year. We were friends when we were little and the relationship, to me, seemed perfect. Until he demanded to know where I was all the time, making me share my location with him and would ask me why I wasn’t going to the gym anymore. He didn’t realize he had flung me into a depression and I just thought he REALLY REALLY loved me. I was clueless. 

He broke up with me a week after I got my long hair cut above my shoulders, citing that as a reason. Oh and it was Christmas Eve. Oh and we had just had sex. Like. Pillow talk “do you love me? I don’t think I love you.”

Ruined me. I remember two months later I was still crying any moment I got alone with myself. I remember thinking “holy shit it’s February and the first thing I do when I come home is collapse and cry.” I took a lot of baths and drank a six pack of beer a night. I started treating it like a hobby and got a new craft beer each night. I was pathetic. 

Then in May, I asked a guy I had known for years prior if he wanted to hang out. 100% booty call. I was done crying about a month prior and ready for some human contact. Little did I know this tall dark and handsome dude I was REACHING for had a crush on my homely self the entire time I’ve known him. 

He treated me the exact opposite. Loved my short hair. Never looked through my phone. Never asked how long I was out the night prior and so on. He treated me better than anyone who ever claimed to love me has. We constantly laughed and he held me extra tight when I cried.

I’m still so in love. So much that my ex never crosses my mind. Sure if I see him and his new girl on fb I’ll do the whole “poor girl” thing under my breath but that’s because that manipulation I went through fucked me up. I realized the stark contrast when he said if his girl found out I was there she’d flip, when the entire time I just wanted to tell my boyfriend about it. 

Then today, I get asked for lunch. He tells me he shouldn’t have hurt me. He tells me his new girl is even more controlling that he was to me and he had been thinking about me and how I must have felt. He told me I was the best sex he’s ever had and that he never has sex with her. He divulged a lot. I just wanted to leave and not breathe the same air as him or be in his stale/sexless house. 

So when he asked if I was happy, I told him that I spent months thinking about him after he hurt me and that I eventually got sick of thinking about him. I said that breaking my heart was the catalyst to the happiest I have ever been. 

I don’t think he got the closure he wanted. But I did. 

Thanks <3"
Too embarrassed to celebrate,Today I hit my weight loss goal of losing 50lbs which perfectly aligns with my BMI lowering to 29.9. So I’m not obese anymore! I worked my ass off. Exercising an hour and a half everyday and drastically changing my diet. But I can’t bring myself to tell anyone bc it’s embarrassing that I was 50lbs into obesity. Maybe y’all can celebrate with me!
My (now ex) boyfriend thought my business was going nowhere. I’ve made over 12k a month these past 3 months. I have no degree.,"TLDR: My (thankfully ex) boyfriend and his mother made me feel absolutely worthless in the two years I was with him. Made me feel like shit for not having a degree or having a more “prestigious” career path. I worked blood sweat and tears to build a salon with him discouraging me and nickel-and-diming me every chance he could even though he made more than I did at his civil servant job. 

I broke up with him, opened my business (in October) and now make more in a month than he makes in almost 4. 

DETAILS: 

His mom came from ridiculous amounts of money and had everything paid for including her degree, which she NEVER used because her husband she met in college had a great job and took care of her. She also has massive inheritance and oil money residuals every month rolling in.

She shit on me not having a college degree, even though I had no one to help me and also was alone in taking care of my disabled grandmother. I had to pick up a trade (cosmetologist esthetician) just to take care of us and earn above minimum wage to survive. 

My ex also had his fancy degree and everything paid for, and he doesn’t even have gratitude for this. He doesn’t even use it, as he chose to be a firefighter (not a bad thing, just emphasizing the irony).

Glossing over 2 years of serial cheating, lying, inviting exes over to his apartment while I was working, gaslighting, and constant verbal and emotional abuse, this piece of work would nickel and dime me as much as he could.  

$20 bill at a breakfast place? Itemizing everything. Won’t let me even have toast off his plate unless I contributed to the meal (it was a form of “stealing from him”). Even if he ate or drank more than I did? 50/50 split in all bills. Refused to take almost any day trip or vacation because he didn’t want to pay his half.  Conveniently forgot his wallet several times when it was time to pay.

All this time he is staying in my house rent utility and expense free. 

His reasoning? Women take jobs from men now that we are in the workforce, so I should be paying more than half...wish I was making this shit up.

He would always shit on me about how my business wasn’t a real job, how it took too much time from him, how it wasn’t exactly prestigious and that it wasn’t impressive.

His mother constantly made plans and events for the family and invited the other two girlfriends and would never invite me because I seemed “fake” (her reasoning? Having a lip piercing, long nails, and at the time blonde hair. WTF). I just couldn’t measure up to the 22 year old girlfriend of her youngest with aspirations to be a doctor.

This was especially hurtful because I really wanted a good relationship with her. My mother is a train wreck, I’m an only child, and my grandmother has severe dementia. I have no good female role models or functional parents in my life. She never gave me the fucking chance and it killed me. I had to hear second hand everything she said about me and how my boyfriend never stuck up for me.

Anyway, I finally got wise, realized there was better quality men out there who would be supportive of me. There was.

Lost 220 pounds in the form of a narcissistic loser who was at best a 6/10 and focused on my business. In 6 months my business has exploded. I am extremely grateful, tentatively excited, and I’ll admit, slightly smug. I am happier than I have been in a long time and after a lifetime of a beans and rice budget I still can’t believe what’s happening.

Fuck the haters, look out for yourself, and go be a bad ass."
"To the professor who didn’t ask me for a doctor’s excuse after I missed his class twice, thank you.","I am struggling deeply with depression and could not get out of bed this week. It wasn’t until day three that I could take a shower. And it wasn’t until day five, today, that I could get out of bed and make it to class again. Even then, I dreaded going in. I worried over it all week. I felt like such a slacker. I thought I’d be in trouble, or worse, dropped from the class. In fact, I was so terrified, I even contemplated dropping the class myself before facing the humiliation of being dropped. I’d sent you an email that I wasn’t feeling well when I missed your first class. You said you hoped I felt better soon. But then, I missed a second class. This time, no email was sent. I was too down. And they don’t exactly give out doctor’s excuses for being depressed. I didn’t know what I was going to tell you. I am just now coming to terms with my condition and wasn’t ready to open up to anyone about it, least of all my professor. Then today came. I walked into class expecting a lecture or a disapproving look, but instead, you smiled and class went on like normal. When I left, I asked you about the possibility of make up work and you told me you’d already taken care of it. You didn’t ask me for a note. You weren’t angry with me. Instead, you were very kind. And I don’t know how, but it felt like some part of you knew, or at least understood. Maybe that’s just me being silly. Still, I was so relieved I almost started crying. It made me so hopeful that I had enough energy to come home and clean my room for the first time in two weeks. I dropped off documents for a job opportunity. I even made a to-do list. Which is crazy, considering a few days ago I didn’t think I’d be around to do that. Anyway, you won’t see this, but I just wanted to say thank you for seeing me as a human being before you saw me as your student. You’ll never know how much it meant to me."
"Screw you radio ads that use honks, sirens, and crash noises","No seriously fuck you,

Hardly anyone listens to radio stations outside of their vehicles, and you should already know that a majority of your audience is driving their car. So when I hear honks and sirens, I immediately freak. It blows my mind that this isn’t illegal.

TLDR; radio ads suck."
My parents adopted my siblings and I just so they could rape and molest us.,"I've never told anyone this before, ever, in my life, except for the legal authorities after it all came out. I guess this is the perfect place to finally do so, for the anonymity. 

My parents are pedophiles. I'm not entirely sure how they met; us kids got a story growing up, but I don't think it's true, because how big of a coincidence is it that two people with the same awful and taboo fetish hooked up? They were always active as swingers, apparently, so maybe they met in the fetish world. They decided to adopt kids together to sexually abuse, because it wouldn't be as messed up considering we weren't biologically their children. (I'm not saying that. That was their logic.) They adopted my sister and I when I was 2 and she was a baby first, we had the same crack addicted bio mom who lost both of us to the state. When I was 4 and 7 they adopted my two brothers, and when I was 10 they adopted my youngest sister. 

I know all of this because when I was 19 my dad bragged about all of this to the other couple they were swinging with, who I guess seemed like they were pedophiles as well. They weren't, and turned my parents in to the police. They are both in prison for life. 

I don't want to get into the gory details of everything, except that by the time I was ten I had lost my virginity to my dad and had basically done every sex act under the sun. I thought it was completely normal, and what all little girls did with their fathers. I was a daddy's girl through and through. My father molested my sisters as well, and my mother molested my brothers; everything was hetero. Looking back we were the stereotypically abused kids in school, way too knowledgeable about sex/sexually forward for our ages, and my brothers both got in trouble for playing with their own poop. My parents were never suspected, however, because of our traumatic beginnings as the kids of drug addicts.  

By the time I was a teenager my dad pretty much lost interest in me because I was too grown up and was instead molesting my youngest sister. I basically had free reign to do whatever I wanted from the time I was 12. I became hugely promiscuous with older boys at school, which ended with me getting pregnant at 15. The father was my first boyfriend who wasn't one of the scummy guys at school, and his family had shown me that my home life was hugely abnormal. I worried that if my baby was a girl it would be molested by my dad (at the time, I didn't know my mom was abusing my brothers as well) and asked if I could move in with my boyfriend's family. I used the story that my parents were angry about my pregnancy and kicking me out. As for my parents, they didn't care much about me at that point and I suppose they guessed correctly that abusing their grandchild would not work as well since it was also attached to this very loving and functional family. They let me go. 

In a way getting pregnant and moving out so young saved me. All of my younger siblings struggle with drug addiction in some shape or form, be it heroin, meth, alcohol, or multiple substances. One of my brothers shows sociopathic tendencies likely due to the abuse. My youngest sister has been diagnosed with Reactive Attachment Disorder. After my parents were arrested, they all went back into the foster care system, which did not help at all. I am 26 today and while I still have a lot of problems with depression and suicidal thoughts I feel like having my son to live for is the only way I have avoided being addicted to drugs. He is 11 now and a great kid. 

The worst thing for me wasn't the abuse, shockingly. I grew up with it and never felt victimized during it, though I would never EVER do what my mom did to my son. It was the fact that during their trial it came out that my parents never thought of us as their ""real"" kids. We were just adopted kids that they took in to use as their playthings. All the love they showed us was just for show. I think that is what will haunt me for the rest of my life. 
 
Thank you for reading."
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT!,"My wife has irregular periods and she wasn't feeling well for the past few weeks. She was feeling weaker after work and started getting nauseous. This weekend on a whim she decided to just do a pregnancy test before seeing a doctor with her symptoms. 

Turns out shes pregnant. We went to the doctor right away to confirm and see next steps. 

Welp turns out she is indeed pregnant and will be doing the dating ultrasound tomorrow.

We both wanted a kid and had the mentality of it happens it happens kind of thing. We are truly ecstatic and I can't wait. 

I'm gonna be a dad. "
I just realized how much my mom loves me.,"I was sitting in my room just now, and my mom came in. Started talking and I said, ""I'm hungry"". Not even asking her to get me anything nor expecting her to, just making conversation. We talk for a few minutes more then she leaves, and a couple minutes later she comes back with a big plate of food for me despite me not even asking her to. I say thanks then after a while I stop to think like...who else would do this? I tell anyone else I know that I'm hungry they're just gonna say, ""what do ya want me to do about it"" ""so?"" ""okay, and?"" or some variant. And you might think, ""oh big deal it's not like she donated a kidney or anything!"" but that's just the thing: I feel like all of my loved ones would donate a kidney for me if they had to. No question. Cause I'd do it for them. but I don't think any of them besides my mom would be willing or even think to do such a small gesture like that. I feel like it says a lot. I really don't appreciate her enough."
I wish I didn't have kids...,"Yeah I said it!

I have two boys, 6 and 3.

I love my boys and would risk my life to save theirs without hesitation. 

But they drive me fucking bat shit crazy.

Sometimes I think about all of the time my wife and I would have if not for these bastard children. 

We can't go on vacation for more than a few days, dates are very few, I gotta deal with shit, literally, at 6am some mornings. 

Don't have kids. If you have any respect for your time at all, don't fucking do it. 

You have been warned. 

Sincerely, 
A loving father

Edit #1: I love my kids to death. But that doesn't mean they're not shitheads. =D

Edit #2: Thanks for the gold and for the messages of support. Clearly I am not alone in thinking this.

Edit #3: While reading and responding to all of your comments, my 3 year old son crapped his pants, shot me in the eye with a nerf gun, and demanded food. But he also gave me hugs and kisses and made me laugh a few times too :)

Edit #4: I still wish sometimes I didn't have kids. "
Finally got my 1.5 miles under 15 minutes and those close to me don't seem to care.,"I've been trying to lose weight all year so that I can join the military. I started at 270lbs and am now 200lbs. I was stuck at 220lbs for several months and wasn't making any progress. I finally got over the hump and am lifting more and running faster than ever. I have to get my run time down another 3 minutes, but I've proven to myself that I can do it. My family and most friends don't seem to care but screw them I'm proud of myself!"
My (33 F) best friend (30 M) is getting married today,"I just want to say congratulations to my friend for finally getting out of the friendzone. He has been pining for ""the girl next door"" since he was 19, supporting her from afar and letting her know he'd always be there for her. Nearly twelve years later, she finally saw him for what he really is - the perfect man for her - and they're eloping today and I couldn't be happier. 

I love you, Chris. I'm so grateful you were patient with me and kept loving me despite my issues. I'm looking forward to this life with you.

My son used this account to write his last words before he took his own life.,"I was advised to post this here, as it was removed from another page. I apologize if this is also the wrong place for this.

My son, who would have been 21 this month, hanged himself on December 24 2016. Christmas Eve. My baby boy. Gone. There are no words to describe what it did to me, and what it did to the family. I went into his room midday expecting to find him still in bed. I found him hanging in the closet. Two lives were destroyed that day. The neighbors called the police when they heard my screams. I could not leave my house for months and lost my job. My older children had to move back in to support me because I refused to go out or clean the house or even eat food. My life had lost all purpose and for a while it was over. With time and extensive therapy I am just barely functional again, but life has never felt so empty. Not a moment goes by that I don't think of him. I spend countless hours every day thinking of how I could have changed it. I know I could have. 

My son was enrolled in a general health studies program at the local university. He didn't have an interest in health and didn't know what career he wanted to pursue, but I pushed him into it thinking it had the most potential for a successful career path and that he could develop an interest over time. He didn't do very well in his first year but he made it through with a few failed courses. In April 2016 he had finished the winter term of his second year. I asked him about his final grades. He kept telling me that he hadn't received them yet. I knew he had but I didn't push. The summer term was starting and we had agreed that he would take summer courses for the courses he had failed in first year. He told me that he had applied to them, and he also told me he had finally received his second term grades and that he had passed them all. I didn't know at the time that neither of those were true. It was all online so I never checked. If I did, I would have known that he had failed all five of his winter courses because he had stopped showing up to classes due to depression and he never applied to any summer courses. I found this out later in August when he broke down and admitted it all. I did not take it well. I was so upset that he had failed his program, that he lied to me so many times, and that he spent the entire summer pretending to go to class while doing other things. I called the school immediately and arranged an appointment with the faculty. I explained the situation to them and they agreed to let him reapply in the fall as a special student, and that if he did well in his remedial classes he would have a chance to continue his program where he left off. He didn't want to do it. He wanted to take a break from school and apply to a different program later. I refused. I forced him to go back. I knew he hated it and I made him do it anyway. I didn't do anything to treat his depression despite knowing about it. Instead I used it as an excuse to get him back in the program he never wanted to be in. I made him feel trapped enough to take his own life and I can never forgive myself for that. 

Going back into his room was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. One step inside and I had a breakdown. Months passed. I tried again. Breakdown. We had to keep it locked until we hired a cleaner to pack his things because I could not bare to look at anything that belonged to him. I was only able to enter once the room was completely empty with just a few boxes stacked in the corner. Months later when I was home alone, I mustered the strength to open one of the boxes. Sitting on top was his laptop. I opened it and found it unlocked. I told myself I shouldn't look through it. It would only ruin me again. But I had to. I had to know. Maybe he saw something that made him want to do it. Maybe he had messaged one of his friends, and maybe they said something to him. I just wanted to understand why. Why he would feel so hopeless that he had to take his own life. I found mostly things that would be normal to find in a young person's browsing history. People's Facebook profiles, assorted Youtube videos, a whole world I never knew. There was a file folder compiling images from what I could tell was shows/comics/games that he liked. I've never seen any of it before. I never cared. Another folder with images of my son with his friends from his high school. I didn't recognize any of them. I never bothered to ask. I found a video in his Youtube history showcasing how to tie a noose. I had to stop there and weep until I had a migraine. Then I went back. I found entries on Kijiji. He was trying to sell his game consoles and games, which I later found out he spent his tuition to buy. I found a site called Liveleak, where there were a lot of entries on videos of people dying on camera. I believe he was trying to prepare himself for what he was going to do to himself. Then I found this site, Reddit, and I noticed his account still logged in. This one. Nothing could have prepared me for what I was about to find. Months of grief counseling undone in an instant. I had the worst breakdown of my life. Reading through everything he wrote in his last days tore my already scarred heart into a million shreds. He had reached out for help so many times. He felt so alone. He wrote that if he died I would only care about the money I wasted raising him. I thought I had felt the worst pain a person could feel until I read that. It was my fault. He felt so alone and hopeless in his last days. And I made him feel that way. I knew he wasn't happy but I made him go back. I killed him.

If only I could tell him now that it doesn't matter to me. That no school or degree was worth his life. That no matter what he did, I would love him no matter what. Oh how I miss my sweet boy. My baby is gone and I will never be okay again."
My Dad died last week and it was perfect,"My father died last week.  He was 54 years old and the healthiest he had been in decades.  To say this was unexpected is an understatement of insane proportions.  My parents were 3 to 5 years away from retirement and had been making plans to travel.  I had also been about to quit my job, sell my car and move to a different state in hopes of finding out what I want to do with my life.  Now everything has just stopped.  All plans have been blown up.  Everything is so uncertain and scary.  The only peace I have found, has oddly been in the way my Father died.  
My parents were snorkeling on the last day of their two week Hawaiian vacation.  Snorkeling is my fathers favorite thing to do anywhere it is warm enough.  He will stay in he water for hours.  He loves to dive really deep, touch the bottom, come back up, and then dare us to do the same.  He is always so proud of everyone's accomplishments (his included) no matter how small they may seem.  On this particular day, my parents were snorkeling in a popular spot in Oahu.  They had been in the water for over an hour and decided to head back to shore.  My dad began to feel tired, so they stopped to float on their backs while my Dad caught his breath.   After a few minutes, he told my Mom that he didn't think he would be able to make it back to shore.  He is a great swimmer, but a big guy, and my Mom wouldn't be able to get him back to shore on her own so she asked nearby swimmers for their help in pulling him back to shore.  By the time they made it to the shore, he was already dead.
My father had a massive heart attack and died in minutes.  He had no pain.  My father passed away, floating on his back in the warm waters of Hawaii, staring at the blue sky.  The last image he had in his head was beautiful, his last smell was the ocean, his last thoughts were peaceful and the last voice he heard was my mother.
Is there a better way to go?
  "
I'm sad I found this in my little sisters bag...,"When I was younger, we where a poor family. So free school lunch was kinda of a luxury too us. We even brought home when we could. But I am older now, and things are better off.

I was in my car, and needed a paper and pencil, my baby sisters bag, and I had noticed that her bag was heavy. When looked inside, there where cartons of school chocolate milk, muffins, and grilled cheese sandwiches. See, growing up, my family saw those as unneeded, and never bought them.

It broke my heart to see my younger sister going through the same thing. Picking up what people are leaving behind. And honestly, today, it crushed my soul that she thinks in that matter. It's 3 AM, but tomorrow, I am going grocery shopping, picking up chocolate milk gallons, muffins, snacks, pigging out basically. I do not ever want her to ever feel the need to pick up peoples left overs. Or ever ask someone for a treat. I always begged the kids around me for snacks when it came to snack time, cause, well, my parents never packed me one. It hurts, it fucking hurts. I'm ending the cycle here and now.

Edit: I cannot thank you all for what you are saying. There are beautiful stories of humans down below. We, Us, Me and You, are beautiful. We want to love and give love.

Also something I should mention, me and my family immigrated from a 3rd world country. It is embedded in my parents logic, anything that is bare needed to survive is luxury. Despite now we are so much financially better, they still hold it true. And it hurts to see that my sister still believes that we are poor, despite well, not being be. 

Thank You again for all the love"
"please, just read.","i've been in a really bad place for a while now and seeing the positivity on here makes me the slightest bit more happy. it's as if people can *see* me, even though there are so many users behind screens. just wanted to **get that off my chest**"
"Went to visit my Grandma one day, went into wrong room, been visiting elderly lady ever since.","So this is probably the wrong place to post this but I’m new to posting, here’s what took place..

This was 11 months ago. My husbands grandma (i call her grandma because we’re extremely close and she’s one of the best people I know) lives in an assisted living place, the rooms have the same layout in each one and same decor unless the occupant has changed it. My grandma had been there about two months by this time and I had been to see her each week but she had been in hospital for the past few weeks and was having her room decorated whilst she was there. 
Me and my daughter also have the same routine, we go in using my door fob, we wait for the lift and she’s presses the button to my grandmas floor. This day I was on a call to work and wasn’t paying enough attention, so we get out of the lift and the decor in the hallway is different, it’s been painted pink and me and my kid are like WOW it looks so good here, we trot along down the hall to my grandmas room and knock, a lady answers and we say hi and go in, I thought it must be my grandmas friend (she has a lot) so we take our shoes off and go into the living area.
This is when I realise that shit! We’re in the wrong room. What happened is my kid had pressed floor 2 in the lift rather than 1. It hadnt been decorated, but had always been that way, I just hadn’t visited that floor before. 
I was just about to explain my mistake when the lady ushers us to sit down and says how great it is us to see us as it had been so long and she had been lonely. My kid has started playing with her fridge magnets by this time so when she asked if I wanted a cup of tea I agreed. We chatted about a lot, and I ended up staying for 40 minutes and helping her set some things to record. She loved us being there and adored my kid so I didn’t want to break her heart and tell her we had never actually met. We hugged as we left and I went down to speak to the staff and let them know what had happened, in case the lady told them or her family she’d had visitors and gotten confused.
They proceeded to tell me that she doesn’t get many visitors, her family live the other side of the country, she’s widowed, has dementia and the only person who regularly visits is her husbands brother. Turns out she was a hospital matron until she was 61. She is now 82.
To this day, I still visit the friend I made accidentally that day. Her and my grandma fast became friends afterwards, and we all eat lunch together once a week. She provides me with wisdom, lots of laughs and hugs and a lot of cake. I fix things for her. Help with whatever she needs doing in her place and accompany her to doctors appointments.
My daughter adores her, and we take her to get her hair set every few weeks. She spends family time with us, we cook, we watch antiques roadshow and she’s teaching me to knit. 
She does believe I am family, and I’m ok with that because she feels like family to me. 

I’m so glad I was being a shitty parent that day and my kid pressed the wrong button.

Edit; thank you so much for all of the replies, and whoever gave me gold/silver. I didn’t expect it.
For all the people saying they wish they could befriend an elder, I say go for it! Yes, I have provided my friend with company and happiness but honestly she’s given me so much too, she’s unbelievably wise and she listens intently. You don’t find that with many people anymore! She cares deeply about me and my kid. I honestly believe that some things are supposed to happen to lead us in a certain direction and this day is one of those times! It’s her birthday this weekend so we are going to the restaurant where her husband used to take her.
Really appreciate all the love, thank you!!! 

Edit 2; just wanted to again say thank you to all of you. Makes me so happy people are so kind. Thank you for all the love/ responses, it means a lot! "
I stopped and picked up a man and his pregnant wife on a rainy night in Seattle in 1977,"I just figured out that I may be able to find out how this story ended after all these years. I was southbound on I5 on a week night in the early autumn of 1977. Rain was pouring down and the interstate was awash. I was driving an orange, 1973 BMW tii when I saw a crazy man in the MIDDLE of I5 jumping up and down and waving his arms. I slowed down and stopped about 300 yards away from his stalled car. He ran up to my window and shouted ""my wife and I were going to the hospital, she is in labor and I ran out of gas can you take us the rest of the way!!!?"" He jumped in the back seat and I BACKED up along I5 in the DARK, in the RAIN about 300 yards. I got out and helped his wife into the car. Boy was she pissed! She was so pregnant that she could no longer bend at the waist. She put down her pillow and slowly got in. The guy sat in the back and fucking YAMMERED the whole way to the hospital. We got to the hospital and the women of the family closed around her and, in the arms and the care of other women, she vanished into the sliding doors of the hospital.
I was left alone and forgotten under the porte-cochère with the rain still falling in sheets.
So if you were born on a rainy week night in the early fall of 1977 in Seattle and your idiot father ran out of gas on I5 taking your mom to the hospital I am the dashing stranger who got you the last few miles into the care of your family. You are 38 now and I am nearly 70. I have wondered about you a lot over the years. I almost feel like you are, in a small way, one of my own. I would love to know how this story ended."
"If you threaten to kill yourself/others, or harm yourself/others to keep someone in a relationship with you, you’re a piece of shit.","The title says it all.

I absolutely cannot stand people who threaten to kill themselves or harm themselves or others to keep people in a relationship with them. It stresses the person out as they don’t wanna be with you but are scared because they don’t wanna be responsible for your death. Fuck you.

Also I can’t stand emotionally draining friendships. I get it. It’s okay to be sad or angry or depressed. Hell yeah im gonna help you out but for fuck sake don’t make every conversation about how you’re depressed or upset or angry. Let’s have a lighter conversation about something we like. Shit doesn’t even have to be something **I** like but let’s have a happy conversation once in awhile. It gets to the point where people don’t wanna continue to talk to you when all you are is depressed.

I’m not trying to be mean or insensitive here. I know depression isn’t something you can just get rid of. I know that. But one way to help work through it is to try and think more of the happy little things around you. 

I’m sorry if this is all jumbled, I’m just really needing this off my chest right now.

**Edit:** holy shit this blew up. Thank you so much reddit for showing me I’m not the only one who’s been through this.

Also to clarify, I’d never cut contact with someone because they were truly depressed and self harming. I would stay and help them out unless it did turn into an abusive move on their part. I have no problem helping people out and making them happy. Just don’t abuse that part of me.

**Edit** **2:** For those of you truly going through depression, get help. There are plenty of online therapists and hotlines to call to help you out. Just please please please never let it turn you into a monster where you hurt others and bring them down with you. Please get help. It will get better.

**Edit** **3:** thank you guys for all the support and all the stories of your guys’ experiences with this. For those of you going through this type of relationship, get out as soon as possible. Don’t stick around with these abusive fucksticks who threaten you and manipulate you. Also please know the difference between “My depressions really getting to me, I’m having suicidal thoughts” and “if you leave me I’m going to kill myself and it’s your fault”"
Dear coworker: I want to fuck the conservative out of you.,"Dear coworker: I want to fuck the conservative out of you. I can't help myself. Every time you come into my office with your low cut shirt and cross necklace subtly splayed across your immaculate breasts I think about taking you, right there, as a man (with your consent, of course, rape culture is not okay). I want to pull off your panties and eat your pussy until your juices trickle down to the lower classes. I want you to moan so hard and so loud that you can't form coherent words, let alone talk about what Rush Limbaugh said about immigrants the other day. 

Each time 'those people' crosses your lips I think about your mouth wrapped around my prodigious cock as my little people spill out of it. I want to make an anchor baby with you. I want to throw all the papers off my desk and ride you until gay marriage is legal in a majority of States or until you've come enough times to admit that maybe universal health care makes sense. And I mean all this respectfully, of course. I'm a feminist. 

Why do you do this to me. Why. Do you know what you're doing? Every time you come into my office and sit across from me and cross and recross your legs and talk about the weather and then (somehow) about how unemployment insurance is actually bad for poor people do you know that I'm wondering if your panties are equally as conservative? That I'm curious what you'd look like on top of me, my hands tweaking your nipples like doing so would be tweaking taxes on the top one percent? That I'm thinking about you looking back at me as I fuck you from behind, your Jesus necklace swaying back and forth as you scream ""Drill, baby, drill!""

You're not crazy, just politically hypocritical. Social conservatism is selfish and untenable. Your adherence to laws written when people owned slaves and the largest city was 1/10th of what it is now is ruining this god damn country. And I want you so bad. I want you so so bad. 

Ugh. Be my Monica Lewinsky. I'll be your Bill Clinton. Let's reach across the aisle... and into each other's pants. "
Why do I keep getting downvoted every time I encourage someone to work on their marriage before deciding to get a divorce?,"I know that most people on Reddit are under 30 and I’m probably old school but come on!! All I see is people saying “get a divorce” as if it’s some mundane task to do. Divorce has the psychological equivalent of having a death in the family especially when children are involved. Do we as a society not see the value anymore in working hard for something that will benefit all the people around us? When did we start expecting to be happy every single day with our partner? That’s not real life, real life has ups and downs. You might succeed in reviving your marriage or you might not but don’t you think that it’s worth trying your best before jumping to divorce?"
Accidentally went through my SOs phone...,"Please let me preface this by saying we know each other’s passwords, we leave our phones lying around, we’re not sneaky. 






Well the other day my phone had died and SO was in the shower and I wanted to tell my BFF something. So I unlocked his phone and opened their message thread 







And found him asking her advice on rings and how to find out my size. I’m so conflicted - my heart feels like it could burst but at the same time I feel like an incredible surprise-spoiling snoop!"
I'm afraid that the end of my life will feel like the end of one of those weekends where I had planned to get a lot of stuff done only to realize on Sunday evening that I did none of it.,I also know what to do to not make the end of my life like that but the same goes for all these weekends and they still happen all the time.
I am NOT proud of my son.,"This Saturday, my son will have been sober for 18 months.  He got his GED this year, and he starts at Community College at the end of August.  He finally has a job that I didn't get for him, soon he will be moving into his own apartment, and he hasn't missed a single appointment with his therapist.  He has done everything you would expect of a precocious 17-year-old who hit a rough patch after meeting with a particularly bad influence.

 He is 29.

This is the point where I'm supposed to say that, nevertheless, I'm *still* proud of him for turning his life around, getting off drugs and off the streets, staying out of trouble, and acting like a responsible adult, or at least an adult who knows the meaning of ""responsible."" Maybe I'll throw in a reference to the Prodigal Son and kill a fatted calf for him. That's certainly what's expected of me.  That's certainly what my *son* expects of me.  He ~~wants~~ demands praise and forgiveness and a party and me to hug him and tell him it's all right.  Demands me to tell him how proud I am that he's made something of himself.

But I'm not, because he hasn't.  Not in the slightest.

His mother and I gave him every opportunity we could.  I don't expect any praise for that, because unlike my son, I don't expect praise for *doing what you're supposed to*.  She and I worked hard to give him a loving, stable, comfortable, supportive home.  We were involved in his school, we introduced him to music (to the extent that any two people can; his mother was a damn good cellist, though) and sports and culture, we fed him healthy meals, we played with him--thanks to him, we got in the best shape we'd ever been in since our 20s--and we let him stumble and fall and make mistakes and *get back up again*.   

He started shoplifting at 15.  The first time we caught him, we bodily dragged him back to the store, made him return the copy of Grand Theft Auto and apologize, and offered to pay for any damages.  The second time we caught him (this time with a pair of shoes), we did the same thing.  The third time, we started going to family therapy.  

Therapy seemed to go well, and after a few sessions the therapist asked for a few one-on-one meetings with him.  After two of those, the police came knocking on our door, because the little shit had concocted some story about how we were a religious cult who raped him for breakfast every Saturday ... and the dumb chickenshit therapist actually believed him.  Rational heads prevailed, we fired that therapist, and he went through six more in as many months, until eventually we couldn't find anyone who would take him as a patient.

By 16, he was drinking.  Then we found pot in his bedroom, and in *our* bedroom.  He started leaving needles, bongs, and crack pipes where he knew we'd eventually find them, just to fuck with us.  I know this because he said so, in those exact words.  He had his first intervention and first trip to rehab that year, and his first relapse.

He had to repeat a year of high school at 17, which meant he was now the ringleader of a group of other young dipshits, who saw him as this totemic mentor-shaman who could hook them up with whatever shit they wanted.  I'm also damn sure he started fucking one of his gang's younger sister (13) around then, but I had nothing to go on but my own instincts, so all I could do was tell her parents to keep an eye on her.  No charges were ever pressed, and the family never spoke to me again after that, but they did pull both of their kids out of that school, and my son was furious at me for daring to not let him continue committing statutory rape.

He decided to try for ""normal"" rape later on.  While I was away, he spent an uncharacteristic night at home and on his best behavior.  After his mother went to sleep, he followed her to her bedroom.  He took a knife with him.  He crept into the room, straddled her, put the blade to her throat, and slid his other hand inside her. 

I don't know exactly what happened next.  I know he held her down and tried to undress her.  I know she fought.  I know he stabbed her. I know she got away and locked herself in the bathroom before he could catch her; I hope that means she kicked him good in the balls.  I know she broke the window and screamed for help.  I know he ran.  I know she was lucky the ambulance got to her before she bled to death.  I know he called his friends to brag and beg a ride.  I know the police caught him.

I know if I'd been home, or if *I'd* caught him, I'd have killed him with my bare hands.

The state tried my son as an adult.  He pled out, but only after making his mother testify and smiling the whole time.  She divorced me a month after his sentencing; I looked too much like him.  She killed herself a year later.

I would be a liar if I said I didn't blame him for her death, because I absolutely do.  He was sober when she went to her room, sober when he pulled out his knife, sober when he climbed on top of her, sober when he raped her, sober when he stabbed her, sober when he ran, sober when he called his friends to brag, and sober when the police found him.  When I made the mistake of visiting him after the divorce, he laughed and said she'd had enough of his dick that I could never satisfy her.  When I made the mistake of visiting him after she killed herself, he laughed again and asked how it felt to have ""some prick take your bitch away.""

I should have killed him right there.  It is to my eternal shame that I did not.

They let him out after serving three years.  He spent the next six years on the streets, in and out of rehab, on and off other people's couches, and would grace me every six months or so with a phone call demanding money.  Eventually I refused to talk to him unless it was to drive him back to rehab, and I stopped completely after he stole my wallet.  

Two years ago, he came to my house with his aunt (his mother's sister) in tow and crocodile tears in his eyes.  He pretended to apologize.  I slammed the door.  His aunt barges in to try to shame me into forgiving the man who raped my wife, caused her death, and laughed about; he stayed outside.  He slashed my tires, threw a brick through a window, and drove off in her car.  His aunt had no idea that he'd taken or keys, or that he'd been armed the whole time.  She blamed me.

He guilted her into letting him stay with her, went to rehab and relapsed, then went again, and here we are.  

In stark contrast to the ball of shit that is my son and his life, I have watched my friends' and colleagues' (those who will still talk to me, that is) children go on to become doctors, lawyers, skilled tradesmen, actors and musicians, academics, entrepreneurs, and career military.  I've seen a few start their own families.  And even the ones who've had a rough start, or who stumbled and fell, managed to pick themselves up again, or are bravely soldiering on.  I have nothing but respect for them.  I also note that *they* do not expect juice and a fucking cookie for having a job and not getting hopped up on meth or raping their mothers for 18 whole months.

My son has pretended to reform before.  He has even convinced himself once or twice.  But he always backslides, always relapses, always finds new ways to disappoint, always hurts other people for his own short-sighted benefit.  His aunt is already at the stage where she is pretending she ""must have forgotten"" where she put some knickknack or piece of jewelry, and has already told me to fuck off after I've warned her of what my son can, will, and has done before, and what he will do again now that he thinks she is weak.  When he fucks up again, when he hurts someone else with his ceaseless bullshit, I will not be there to pick up after him.  I am through with him.  I am through with his aunt.  I cannot talk to her without being overcome with rage and shame as I see the stupid, stupid hope I used to have that my son would ever amount to anything, and I do not need any more disappointment and failure in my life.

I am not proud of my son.  I am sorry for inflicting him upon the world."
I heard my neighbors puppy get hit by a car last night,"So my neighbors got a new black lab puppy a few months back, he’s super cute and looks about 6 months old. I typically mind my own business and don’t talk to my neighbors much but they are really nice people. 

Last night I was outside putting up some Christmas decorations and saw the puppy in their yard across the street. I didn’t think much of it because he’s outside sometimes so I figured they had an electric fence or something.

While I’m turned around I hear this big thud then hear this poor dog let out the most awful scream. I freaked out and ran across the street and he was sitting on the side of the road and looked up at me and he looked so scared. I ran up to their door and let them know because I was the only one who heard it happen. 

I’m 6 months pregnant and this literally freaked me out so bad I can’t stop crying about it, I keep hearing that puppy scream in my head and everyone is acting like it’s no big deal. 

UPDATE: I just saw my neighbors come home and they were carrying the puppy into the house so he survived it luckily!! 

UPDATE #2: I talked to my neighbors and the little guy has a bruised lung and 2 hairline fractures on his pelvis but the vet said he’ll make a full recovery!"
We're calling off the wedding,"Last night my fiancé and I sat down and had a frank conversation. 
Things have been going really poorly for our relationship lately. We've spent lots of nights fighting over catering and budgets, who to invite and leave off the guest list. At one point we were screaming over the color of tablecloths. Our couples therapist is making bank right now over the increase of our visits. 

Finally last night we both had enough. We sat across the table from one another and decided to call the whole thing off. Fuck the deposit and the linens, and my future Mother-In-Law's wishes. Fuck it all. What a crock of shit. 

Last night we called it off. Last night we also spontaneously bought tickets to Scotland. We're going to secretly elope to the Isle of Skye. I feel like a huge burden has been lifted from both of our shoulders.   "
"It took 24 years, but I finally kissed the girl I had a crush on in Grade 11.","She was one of those popular girls in High School.  Heck, she was better than those popular girls at school because she never gossiped or said anything bad about anyone to anyone.   She was nice to me, always said hello to me, always smiled.  She was the one all the boys wanted.  I helped her out once on a school project and as a thank you she took me out to dinner when she was driving me home (she had a license and I didn't!).  I had such a crush on her.  

&nbsp;

What shot did a nerdy (My mom still bought my clothes for me at 16!) bookworm like me have with a popular girl like her?  Even though I knew she'd say no, I don't think I could have dealt with the rejection so I never tried asking her out.  After High School, I would run into her occasionally at the clubs and sometimes when visiting friends at her school (we went to different colleges in town).  And that was pretty much it, after I graduated I didn't see her at all and she passed into memory.

&nbsp;

Fast forward to this year. I've changed quite a bit obviously, more confident and comfortable in my skin as all adults should be by now (Although ironically, I'm posting this with a throwaway).  She popped up on my recommended friends list on facebook so I added her.  We started chatting, catching up on what happened to the both of us after high school and made plans to meet up for dinner to catch up in person.

&nbsp;

Meeting up at dinner, she still looked every bit as beautiful as the day I met her.  Still the same pinball smile and bright eyes that all made my heart skip a beat everytime she looked my way in highschool.  She told me that she had always found me nicer than the other boys at school and really cute and smart.  I admitted to her that I had a huge crush on her all throughout high school.  She acted surprised and asked me why I didn't ask her out if I had a crush.  A little part of me died knowing that I actually had a shot with her back then.  Dinner was wonderful and we went out to a pub for a quick evening drink and made plans to meet up again on the weekend.

"The next person who says ""aren't you a little young to be using a cane?"" is getting the ugly truth about why I need it.","[EDIT: Holy fuck this blew up. I've been bouncing around subreddits for a while now but have never had a post gain this much traction. To answer some of the common questions: Yes, I have cut off contact with her. I did so about a year ago after confronting her about the mess she made of my life. No, I never got the chance to report her, she herself was a social worker so the odds of anything happening was zilch. I don't care a whole lot what people think, but after a while it gets really old when people do this shit, which is why I wrote this post.] 

[EDIT: Thank all of y'all so much for your kind replies. I carry my past around with me invisibly, and sometimes it just gets so frustrating that I can't just yell ""I""M TRYING MY BEST WITH WHAT I WAS DEALT."" I made the decision last year to forgive her, simply because holding onto my hatred was poisoning me. Thanks to the support of my best friend and her mother, my mentor, and the wonderful healing powers of cannabis, I'm back on the path to chasing my dream. She isn't in my life, and if everything goes according to plan, her effect on my life won't be around in a couple years either. I'll be in my dream school making it work, and she'll still be the same miserable shell of a human she's always been.] 

I'm 20 years old, and for the past three years or so, I've needed to use a cane part-time. Mostly in the winter, but as time goes on I've needed it more frequently. When my pain flares up, walking without it feels like my feet, shins, and knees are breaking when I walk. The longer I try to tough it out, the more the pain crawls up my body. The cane takes a pain level of a seven or eight and brings it down to a manageable three or four. 

I hate the stares I get. When I take the bus, older people give me hateful glares for sitting down in the seats reserved for disabled and elderly people. Even with my cane in my hand, they stare at me like I just slapped them. People my age gawk at me when I'm out and about. The nicer people try to joke about it. Laughing, they ask ""Aren't you a little young to be using a cane?"" 

Yes. Yes, I am a little young to be using a cane. You want to know what else I was a little too young for? I was too young to be thrown around like a fucking rag doll by my mother. I was too young to be snatched by my hair and dragged down stairs. I was too young to have my face thrown into cat shit for being a forgetful ten year old who was too busy fantasizing about suicide to remember to clean it out. I was too young to be grabbed by my hair and have my legs swept to be thrown to the floor whenever it amused my mother. I was too young to be forced to ""train"" until my joints popped out of place, my knuckles bled, and I was barely able to breathe. I was too young to be forced to fight adults three and four times my size. I was too young to be hit with bamboo and solid wood swords until I bruised and bled three times a week whenever I couldn't hold forms perfectly. I was too young to be ""restrained"" with my face shoved into a concrete floor, simply because I didn't want to stand there while my mother took out her anger on me with a belt. I was too young to have my body broken to the point that I don't know if I'll ever have functioning joints again. I was too young to be the scapegoat and punching bag of a six foot tall, 300 lb woman. 

So yes, I'm a twenty year old using a cane. For the first time in my life, I have access to tools that make my days less painful. I'm too young to need it, but my mind and body have been aged so much by the violence done to me that it doesn't really matter. Shut the fuck up and let me sit down when I get on the bus. You don't know how much pain I'm in. "
I lost my everything.,"This morning, my girlfriend and soul mate of 6 years passed away from an intentional overdose. She called me right before and I heard it all happen over the phone. I called her mom to check on her and she was found convulsing and seizing and when the paramedics arrived she stopped breathing but they got a light pulse. Unfortunately by the time they made it to the hospital she had died. I spent 3 hours in the hospital with her body holding her cold hand begging for her to wake up. She was my everything and I now feel like I have nothing. She was only 21. So young, she did not deserve this. I'm just glad she's no longer suffering. I'll always love you Erica. Please come back. Hold onto your loved ones. I have no words for this. I'm still so numb. 

Edit: will respond to all comments and messages as soon as I can. Feeling very overwhelmed with everything going on, but I appreciate the support and love more than I can say. Thank you. "
I messaged my rapist today,"15 years ago, I was raped by someone I considered a close friend. I did not report. I didn’t even leave our friend group. The only confrontation was when I woke up to him raping me, and I asked him, “Why would you do that?” The only two people who know he specifically (although my therapist and husband know it happened) raped me are my best friend and ex boyfriend he bragged to, although he bragged to others as well. In his version, I was not only fully conscious, but a sexual dynamo. In my version, I was asleep and covered in vomit. 

This is the message I sent him. 

It’s been 15 years, but I want you to know that I thought of you yesterday when I watched Dr. Ford’s testimony. I thought of you when I read all the comments on my FB about how it must not have happened bc she didn’t go to the authorities. I thought of you every time someone I care about called her a liar, or said “boys will be boys”, or said that even if it did happen, “it wasn’t a big deal”. 

I thought about how she said that her most vivid memory was Kavanaugh laughing with his friends at her expense, and how you laughed to your friends- OUR friends- about your “conquest”. 

I thought about how you have a daughter now, and you have to think about what she will face when she’s [age I was raped]. 

But really, most of all, I wonder, did you believe Dr. Ford? Because I would love to believe that you’re a less shitty person than you were to the girl who trusted you 15 years ago."
My fiancee of 10 years left me at the altar. She packed her bags and ghosted me. I just want to die.,"I can't do it. I just can't. I have no idea what I did wrong but, I clearly I did do something. I've been dating her for 10 years and known her since i was a kid. We had moved in together, we were soulmates.  I waited so long to get married because, I made a promise I would be in a stable position at my job so we could start a family. I did everything I could for her. 

We were to be married 2 weeks ago. I was at the altar waiting for her. She never came. She disappeared. Her family knew and didn't say a thing. They all watched as i waited for her to come. When they found her gone, everyone looked at me. Can you imagine the shame, the humiliation I felt at that moment? I cried, I fucking broke down and cried like a baby in my dads arms.

I went home and she had already gone. She had clearly planned this in advance. Everything was gone. No note, no nothing. Her family weren't talking to us either. They cut us out. They were in on it. They always hated me. They always said I wasn't good enough for her...

I can't get over it. I can't. I was supposed to be on my Honeymoon this week. I was supposed to be having the time of my life with my wife. Now I'm sleeping alone in the dark. I've been drinkin all day, everyday. I just want the pain to stop. I can't go on like this.

I loved her, I loved her for more then anything. She was my life, my best friend. I don't know what to do but,I just cant go on it hurts too bad."

I hate when people assume I’m not educated because I work retail.,"I graduated with a bachelors degree four years ago. I work retail because it’s the only job around in the rural area I’m in while I pay off debt and save up to move elsewhere. 

And there seems to be this prevailing notion that retail is a ‘poor man’s job,’ or one for the uneducated. It really ticks me off. 

Baby boomers are the worst offenders. I just had an elderly man come up to me and get in my face (yes, I mean literally) and tell me “This is a test, like one in college— I mean high school, that’s probably as far as you’ve gotten. Where’s the honey?” 

I just looked at him and told him “Aisle one. Looks like my bachelors degree is good for something after all.” I said it as cheerfully as I could muster and with a smile. He just blinked and shuffled away, hopefully humbled by the interaction. 

I’ve had far worse though. I’ve had people straight up yell at me if I failed high school bc we didn’t have something they wanted in stock or if I didn’t count change fast enough, as if me having a lower education had anything to do with it. 

There are so many people in retail from all walks of life, of all forms of education. It just grinds my gears when dumb customers try to make assumptions about you or your life. Retail workers honestly deserve more than they get, and I wish working retail or fast food was a requirement to teach people how to be humble. 

Edit; Holy fuck I really didn’t expect this to blow up like it has. I made a comment yesterday before I shut off notifications because I was getting overwhelmed but it’s comforting to know a lot of folks have dealt with similar situations and I hope my post allowed some people to reach some kind of catharsis by venting their own experiences. 

For the curious, the degree was a B.S. in Biology with the intention to teach. I was gung ho when I began only to be completely disheartened and kind of miserable by the time I finished. I realized my heart was elsewhere in computer science. I plan on going back for it eventually, but I’m keeping my chin up during this ‘in-between’ period while I save up money. Thankfully my job pays pretty well and has good benefits so it’s not all bad. Good pay, same retail gripes. 

Anyway, happy holidays! "
"I got accepted into Yale Law yesterday, so fuck you racist fuckheads.","I'm a dark-skinned black guy from the Deep South. I have attended a state college for the past few years while getting my undergraduate degree. Simultaneously, my mother has been dying of AIDS and I have been working to support both of us. 

I applied to Yale as a joke, really. No one expects to go. I asked one of my professors to be a reference and he laughed and asked me, ""Can you even talk right? Do you even know what Yale is?"" Fuck you, asshole. 

Even my friends: ""They're not going to let a n***er into law school."" 

Another professor: ""Don't waste your money."" 

My supervisor at work: ""Do blacks even know the alphabet?""

My best friend: ""Don't go to Yale, just try and marry a white girl instead. Same thing."" 

Fuck all of you. Fuck you. I got the acceptance email before going to my minimum wage job at Wendy's and I almost passed out. All day while I made burgers and served out chicken nuggets, I had the stupidest grin on my face. I'm going to Yale and they even gave me a scholarship. 

No one knows because I haven't told them. No one deserves to know, and no one will care. No one understands. I'm going to Yale Law and I'm going to fucking try my best to succeed. 

Thank you all for listening. "
OMG FUCK YEESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I AM FINALLY GOING TO BE PUBLISHED!!!! 

I AM GOING TO HAVE MY NAME IN A SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL!!! 

AND. NOT. JUST. ANY JOURNAL!!

I AM GOING TO BE PUBLISHED IN A  TOP TIER, WELL KNOWN JOURNAL OF MY FIELD. 😭😭😭

I really can’t believe it reddit. I am seriously tearing up right now.

I know. I know. I am probably nerding the f out right now since it is not directly obvious how significant this is. 

But I can honestly say, this is one of the greatest moments of my life. 

Getting published in a prestigious journal is an experience that has the potential to greatly affect a young/up and coming scientist’s life.  

And it could not have come at a better time for me.

After all the bullshit I’ve dealt with.
All of the insane drama I’ve made peace with.
All of the people who undermined my intelligence, skill and hard work. Simply because of the color of my skin. 

And after just my first semester (well earned humblebrag).

I’ve busted my ass through every waking moment of my life and I fuckin did it. 
I thought it would never happen, but my dreams had just taken a detour.

I want to scream at the top of my lungs.
But it is late...so Reddit, I will just yell to you.

I am finally proud of myself.


**EDIT**
Thank you everyone!!! I can’t believe the amount of encouragement and positivity coming from complete strangers. Reading through your comments had me tearing up again.

You guys are awesome, and reading about your own experiences is inspiring.
To anyone who’s struggling right now in the harsh world of academia: 
Take it from someone who has continuously fallen so much, the ground has became my home. As cliché as it sounds: **Do not give up!! Keep pushing!! Keep climbing!! Find amazing mentors, work hard and surround yourself with positive people and the world will be your oyster. You WILL get there.**

Thats the biggest piece of (general) advice I can give. Do not underestimate the power of your workplace environment. A toxic environment will surely deter you from your full potential, while an encouraging, supportive one will fuel your ambition. So surround yourself with people that have good positive energy. 

I will try to answer as many as the specifics questions I can once I get home. "
My aunt and older brother fell in a river 36 hours ago,"The numbness brought on by the entire ordeal is indescribable. My household is in turmoil, and in the midst of it I don't know where my new course of life leads.


Over the weekend my aunt and older brother decided to travel together to Medellin. They had both talked about the planned trip for a long time, and were both super psyched. Our last communications were a number of photos my brother sent to my mom of them at a forested park area. The last photo was received at 1pm approximately.  We wouldn't hear anything of them for the next 24 hours.


The Sunday I returned from picking up groceries to find her in hysterics with the phone clutched to her chest. She was muttering that they fell in a river. Now, knowing my mother I just assumed she was being a bit fatalistic, she gets like that at times. To this day, despite working at my job for a year she never fails to tell me to ""stay safe and don't do anything dangerous"". This time though, there was more, the tears, the shaking, this time was different. After pressing her for more details she gave me the full story as recounted by the third person traveling with them.


The trio had just gotten done *exploring a river after a hike* outside a little town called Cocorna. My aunt, brother and a co-worker of my aunts had gone for a swim with about 3 others. *Close to the end of the swim it seemed sudden weather had set in causing the river to begin to swell. The three other bathers managed to exit the water before the surge came bursting down, but my aunt, brother and the third individual were caught in the swell. All three were washed downstream. My aunt's coworker was found 2 or so hours later downstream clinging to an outcropping in the surging river for dear life.* 


My aunt's body was found downriver the next morning. My brother still can't be found. No one knows how to feel right now. Thank you for reading."
"Dear straight guys: ""lesbian"" means ""likes women"" not ""try harder""","It doesn't mean ""bisexual""

It doesn't mean ""hasn't found the right dude""

It doesn't mean ""only kisses women for my pleasure""

It doesn't mean ""open for a threesome""

It doesn't mean ""open to all tongues and fingers""

And for god's sake, ""no"" means ""no""! Even if I wasn't a lesbian, if I said ""no"" to your advances, that means you should stop. You don't need any other explanation or reason. It means I'm not interested and I want you to leave me the fuck alone.

""Oh, that's okay, I've slept with some lesbians before. ;)""

""Don't you mean bisexuals?""

""No, really, they were hardcore lesbians.""

Perhaps you mean they became ""hardcore lesbians"" after they slept with you. Piss stain.

Disclaimer: Yes, I know this isn't all straight guys, blah blah blah. ""Dear (some really pushy and annoying) straight guys"" is a bit wordy, don't you think?"
To our waitress last night,"I know you had a bad night and I saw the tears you were trying to hide. You were so kind to my husband and I. We weren’t in a rush and willing to be patient on your busier than usual night. I hope my tip found you well and that you spend it on something fun or something you really need. I just had to let you know in my own way that I saw you, you matter, and that no customer should make you feel bad for something that wasn’t your fault. I understand. "

Hi reddit. My dad died last night.,"My dad attempted suicide twice when I was in high school. The divorce hit him the hardest, he lost everything he ever loved. I understand why he would want to end it. I used to lay in bed at night and imagine different scenarios of me finding out he killed himself again. I was preparing myself, because I couldn't let myself get caught off guard again. Everytime he, my grandma, or my brother called me, my first thought would be ""this is it.  He did it this time"". Its been over 10 years and i still had that thought. 

I thought I was prepared. But last night when I got the call that he died, turns out I wasnt prepared at all. He died of believed natural causes, the coroner still isn't sure what his exact cause of death yet.  But he said it doesnt look like suicide. So I guess that's good, right? 

But....hes gone for real this time. It doesnt matter how it happened. I'm not ready. 



EDIT: Wow everyone, thank you for all of your kind words. The coroner determined that his cause of death was a mixture if hypertension, high cholesterol, diabetes (he refused to believe he had it) and heavy heavy smoking. It was all too much for his heart. So as one poster said, he literally died of a broken heart. 

While I'm relieved that he didn't take his own life, the fact that his death was preventable makes it even harder to deal with. But so many of you are right, he's no longer suffering, he's no longer unhappy. He's free of all of his physical and mental pain. Im still overwhelmed and in shock...i miss his so much. but my friends have been extremely supportive, in a way I could never imagine. And so have you all. Thank you all for sharing your stories. I've saved many of your posts to read in the future for the bad days. You all are amazing. 💜 anyone is welcome to PM me if they want to talk further. My inbox is open 💕"
My Aspergers mate got married at the weekend. I was his dyspraxic best man. I've never been more proud of him or myself.,"My best mate has Aspergers syndrome. I have dyspraxia. To keep this post a somewhat reasonable length, many things aren't easy for either of us, namely socialising. We've been best mates from school for over 20 years. 

He got married on Saturday to a wonderful (neuro typical) woman. There was a worry that the occasion might be overwhelming for him. With everyone he knows wanting to socalise the crap out of him. To the point where there was a special quiet room set aside for him to use should he need to use it. In the event, he took the whole thing in his stride. Honestly, I've never seen him so at ease and relaxed. And happy. And I've never been so fing proud of him.

For my part I had to step up. As a dyspraxic, organisation doesn't come naturally to me. I had 7 groomsmen to organise to ensure that everything went smoothly and to keep him happy and relaxed. Oh and a speech to perform. 

I got him to the venue on time. Everything went smoothly as I'd been clear about what everyone had to do. I performed my speech. And whilst I couldn't stop shaking throughout, it was warmly recived. People laughed when they were supposed to.

His family came up to me afterwards to give me a massive group hug. To tell me I'd been a good friend to him. This pretty much made me blub.

After this I gave him a bro hug (thanks to his now wife, he's gotten better at physical contact. Did l say how amazing she is?) No words. Just we fing made it pal.

Edit: Formatting and wording. 

Edit 2: Wow! RIP my inbox! I did not expect this level of response when I went to bed last night!

"I'm a First Nations elder, I want to tell my story.","I wanted to tell my story on the internet, because my grandson has recently been diagnosed with depression, I don't mean to try offend anyone or hurt anyone, I simply want to tell my story.

&#x200B;

My name is John, and I used to live on a reserve in Northern Alberta, I'm 52, and I was lucky enough to never go to a residential school, 

&#x200B;

My family didn't have much money, same as all of us on the reserve, I grew up playing outdoors, damming up creeks with rocks, and clay that we scooped out with spoons, My mother was a hard working woman, she cooked us 3 meals a day, and spent most of her time making sure our house was presentable. She would always say that there's no point in moping around and trashing our house, it was truly all we had to be completely honest, 

&#x200B;

Both of my parents were alcoholics, my dad especially, no matter what my mother did to make the house presentable, the living room would never stop smelling of Cigarettes and beer, my father was mean when he was drunk, I don't think he knew what he was doing either, his eyes almost changed color from when he was drunk and not drunk, there was sometimes violence, and I had my fair share of it, I still have nightmares about it to the day,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I was strangely whimsical about my culture, if you've ever watched the movie Smoke Signals, I was a lot like Thomas, I thought that everything had a story to tell, it does too. If you stand near the water it'll tell you it's story. You can't understand it, but you've just gotta listen. I would never hurt animals that weren't the fish, I couldn't stand seeing a Deer's eyes as it bled out, Animals have a story too. You can see it in the way they walk, and in the color of their coat. 

&#x200B;

When I grew to be a teenager, I became extremely self-destructive. I had a girlfriend that equally complimented my problems with more of her own, the first time I became blackout drunk was at the age of 13. I remember waking up the next morning on my girlfriends lawn, standing up, feeling the blood rush to my head, the feeling of flight, and then falling back down and vomiting all over my clothes, I went inside and she had done the same thing. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

The feeling of being drunk my first time was almost breathtaking for me, It felt like everything wrong flew away and I was capable of doing anything, 

&#x200B;

The occasional drinking turned into alcoholism, and that turned into many stupid decisions, at the age of 17, me and my girlfriend were drunk driving, I crashed into a boulder on the side of the road, my girlfriend made it out with minor injuries and a broken leg, I got out with shattered ribs, a broken arm, and a broken collarbone,

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

my destructive habits continued into my 20s, when I was 23 I decided to stop drinking, leave my girlfriend, and try start a new life, 

&#x200B;

I moved away, lived well for a year, and then fell into a horrible depression, I felt like all I needed was a chance to go home, after that I went back home, 

&#x200B;

I took long walks around the mountains where I lived, I came to peace with myself and those around me, after a few years, reconciling with my father and mother, I left, and started working for construction in British Columbia, where I remain to this day.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

It hurts my heart to see children in pain, I know you don't want to hear it, but the sun has to set to rise again, be thankful that you've been given the opportunity to breathe the air you breathe, life is shitty sometimes, but if you go through it with your head held high, and your spirit held higher, you'll come out a greater person than the one that you were before

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

the colors around you are vivid, and the life you've been given is the only one you get, I know it might seem bad, But please, you are needed, you are a part of what makes the air around you worth breathing,

Goodnight, someone out there loves you."
Ex bf tried to rape me last night,"As the title says. 
He was in town and asked if he could crash at my house. I said yes. He does this sometimes. He sleeps in the spare bedroom. Last night he came over and was saying how horny he was. I denied his advances. Eventually it turned into me bitting, scratching and kicking him in the balls to get him off of me. I told him I’d call the police if he did manage to rape me. He was just like “no you won’t”. The whole time my dog is going crazy trying to get between us (wish she’d bit him). It ended with me getting to the kitchen and picking up a knife. Which got him to stay away. I got him to go outside and I locked the door. This whole thing lasted probably 5 mins. One thing I’m proud of is fighting him off; I didn’t give up. I don’t plan on telling anyone about this because it’s kinda extreme. I mean I pulled a knife on this guy. Sorry for the jumbled up thoughts. Cheers, Reddit. 

*edit* 

Thank you everyone so much for your kind words and support. I plan on filing a report when no one else is home (for privacy). I know as much as the next girl that without proof not much can be done. I don’t live alone. I was actually surprised no one heard the fighting. I wanted to punch him but I didn’t, I wanted to hurt him, but I didn’t. I was embarrassed to be literally caught in that situation. So I didn’t call for help. I probably didn’t leave any marks on him because I wasn’t trying to hurt him, I was just just trying to make him let me go and stop. I did text him later in the night and told him he was never welcome at my home again. I never plan on seeing him again. Ive looked into restraining orders but they’re apparently hard to get in my state without a “reason” (that can be proved).  I want to add that to the few that said I would be somewhat responsible if he did this to another girl and I didn’t do what I’m obligated to do which is to report this and then it happen to another girl...I would feel guilty forever. One day he may have children and what if they bring a girlfriend over and he does this to her? I want everyone who’s concerned about my mental well being that I’m ok. If anything I feel empowered. I WON. I feel silly saying that. But I did it guys. I fought off my attacker and I won. Thank you again for all the encouragement and good advice. Also thank you for the tough love from some commenters. "
I put a ladybug out in almost freezing temperatures and left it,"I know this is stupid but I don't really know why this is hitting me so hard. 

Last night I was sitting in my room when something moved out of the corner of my eye. I flinched at first because I thought it was a bug, but I realized it was a ladybug which I've always loved. It was below freezing and I knew he came in for warmth, but I knew he would starve if he stayed in forever, so I decided to let him stay in my room for the night in a container with a little bit of water, and I would release him the following morning.

Well.. Right now is the following morning. I woke up and he was in a different spot than when I went to sleep so I knew he was walking around looking for something to do, I knew it was time to release him since it's just about the warmest it'll be all day, but it's still almost freezing. I felt sad as I picked up his container and carried it outside, but like I said I knew he would starve to death for sure if he stayed inside, and I didn't want to interfere with nature's course that much anyways so I knew he had to go. 

I went outside and found a little tree and some soil to put him by and let him crawl out into it. I stood up and looked at him and he was so small and he was walking around, and instantly I felt like crying. I'm a 22 year old man and I had to cut myself off from looking at him because I thought I was about to cry outside in public. I got back to my room and I started crying, just the image of how small he was, alone and probably cold and hungry and how I had to turn my back on him.

I don't know why I feel so bad. I believe in my logical reasons for having to release him, but I can't help but think, what if I could keep him inside and warm and well fed and stuff. I don't know. Like I said I know this is dumb but I kinda just had to vent. Thank you

EDIT: Wow, I didn't expect anything like this kind of response. I wrote this 14 hours ago on this alternate account of mine, and just now I was browsing the home page of Reddit on my main account and came across a post on this subreddit about a ladybug with 2.8k upvotes, over a hundred comments, and gold/silver, it took me a moment to realize it was my own and I'm completely blown away. There's so much support, advice, and just general thoughts put into all these comments and PM's that I don't even know where to begin. 

From what I've learned in this thread and some personal research, ladybugs are more resilient to the cold than I initially thought and have numerous methods for coping with it - Obviously not all of them survive but there's at least the hope that he's okay. Even if he doesn't, a lot of direction was given regarding dealing with that possibility. I, and from the looks of it most of you, want him to survive, but all of it is honestly just nature's process and in the end there's only so much we can, or should, do. It still saddens me, the image of that small, lonely ladybug against the elements as I got up to walk away, but I'm much more accepting of it now.

I appreciate all of the kind words and thoughts put into this little venting session of mine. I would love to reply to each and every one of you but I hope this edit and a few replies can show how much it means to me, I've read through all of your replies and they are all appreciated. Thank you all so much. I hope at the very least this can spread the positives of empathy and bring a little more care to people's hearts."

One of the many lies who told her about his status and upbringing etc was that he graduated from an extremely top university (About the same prestige as Harvard for a US equivalent). After several occasions of sleeping with expensive escorts in foreign countries, my mom divorced him and raised me and my three siblings on her own in a foreign country where she knew nobody. We went from living literally the lifestyles of multimillionaires to being dirt poor and struggling to get by for so long (though things have been going pretty well recently). 18 years later, my two older brothers and I are all on full scholarships to overseas universities studying Medicine and Law and I just got accepted into the university he told my mom he graduated from. He is on his fifth wife, declared bankruptcy twice and his son just got arrested for possession.

You can fuck off with the WhatsApp messages loser. 19 years too late.


Edit: Wow, this really, really blew up. Thank you for the incredible support everyone. Really means a lot."
"In late 2013, a lady in downtown Olympia hugged me when I found out my wife committed suicide","My wife was on the east coast and she killed herself.   I was dealing with the aftermath on the phone and you overheard me talking.   We were standing outside the elk building apartments when you overheard.  

I planned on also killing myself when I went back upstairs to my apartment.    You asked me for permission to hug me.    

Because of that, I didn't kill myself.  Just one small positive emotion derailed the bullet train of emotional darkness I was experiencing at the time.  

My life is amazing again... And I just wish I could thank you properly.     Hugs are the one gift that is not rude to give back.   "
To the family that took me in:,"I was 12 when I left the group home. I was 14 when your father/husband found me wandering the streets. He didn’t ask where I came from, he didn’t ask what I was doing going through the trash... he asked me if I could go for a hot meal.

You all took me in, you gave me my own room, you bought me new clothes, and you fed me EVERY day for 5 years. You didn’t ask about the scars or the beaten down body before you, you only tried to make it ok. I am alive today because of you, and I love every one of you. I live my life with only the purpose that one day I can be a man you can I’ll be proud of.

I never got the chance to tell him how thankful I am... and with his recent passing I never will... to all those reading, if you have someone you need to thank PLEASE do it. One day it will be too late and you will never get to say what you should have said so many times.

Edit: Oh my god this received so much positivity! Thank you all so much, I would love to respond to everyone individually and say thanks for all the kind words!"
Fuck the Senate so fucking much,I'm so ashamed of my country.
My brother shot himself yesterday.,"He's currently in the ICU, on a breathing machine. He's unresponsive, and he's not going to make it. All I can think about is what a shitty sister I have been for the last few years. I should have been better. I should have been there for him when he needed me. He's only 15, his birthday is in January and he's going to miss it. 

On Sunday the machine gets shut off and he will be gone forever. I will never see him again. 

Jordon, I'm so sorry. I'm so fucking sorry.

Edit: I didn't expect this to get so much attention. I've been at the hospital as much as I can. I know that it won't make up for lost time, but at least it's something. I'll be there tomorrow, too. Thank you for all the support, it is greatly appreciated.

Edit 2: Please don't tell me to wait. It's not my decision, it's my mom's. He's not coming back from this, he's declining. I don't need to hear that letting him go is wrong.

Final edit: He's gone. I stayed with him and held his hand until the end. I don't know what I'm going to do now, but I guess I'll figure it out. Thank you again for all of your love and support and prayers. I hope that he is free of his pain and keeping my grandma good company."
I was almost raped tonight.,"I was just taking recycling out to the bins outside my apartment, maybe 7-8 feet from my back door. I didn't see which direction he came from, but suddenly there was a gun in my face and a man in a ski mask told me I was ""coming with him."" He pushed the gun into my back and ordered me to walk down the alleyway into my neighbors' backyard. I offered him my phone but he told me to shut up and keep walking. Once in the dark space between the garbage bins and the garage, he told me to take my shoes off and get on the ground. The whole time, I stayed the calmest I think I've ever been. I have no idea how, but I think it's one of the things that saved my life. I didn't try to fight, and I did what he told me to do.

If it wasn't for the motion sensor lights on the garage, I know he would have raped and/or killed me. They were triggered by me stumbling, and he was scared off. I ran into the building, which was thankfully unlocked, and called 911. A woman came out of the nearest apartment because she heard me knocking and screaming. She and her SO were really nice and helpful and kept their door open for me until after the police arrived. I spent almost two hours with officers and sensitive crimes detectives before finally coming back home. I'm still a bit in shock that it happened at all. I live in a decently sized city that people typically say is dangerous, but I stupidly thought my neighborhood was safe.

I posted this to get it off my chest but also as a warning to everyone to just always be careful. I was outside for maybe 30 seconds before this happened. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and I don't want anyone else to be in the same position. Also, motion sensor lights are great. Thank you for listening."
First time having sex since being sexually assaulted,"Today i had sex with my boyfriend of over a year for the first time after being sexually assaulted (and first time w him in general). I started bawling halfway through because I couldn’t handle the emotions I was feeling but my partner was so supportive that
 1: i cried even more
but 2: I finally feel like that part of me that my assaulter still had claim over is gone

For so long it was stuck in my head that he still had the power of being the last person I was with and I know it’s stupid but for a year I felt like i still had some sort of an attachment to him that I couldn’t shake off. After we finished I was finally able to laugh uncontrollably again, that kind of laugh that you feel deep down in your stomach that you can’t stop no matter how hard you try. I’ve missed that feeling so much and I’m forever thankful for having such an understanding boyfriend to help me through this

PS sorry if this breaks any sort of nsfw rules I just wanted to get it off my chest

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your responses I’ve never felt better in my life and all of you are all beautiful tropical fish (except whoever called me a fixer upper girlfriend, I’m a boy and your moms a ho)

EDIT 2: Thank you for my first badges!!"
My daughter just nonchalantly told us she was atheist. I held in the tears until I was alone,"My daughter got a new job.  It is at a fast-food restaurant. She loves her job.  She talks about it all the time and sometimes hangs out there when not working.  Crazy in itself. 
The owner plays Christian music all of the time and my daughter's latest story about work started with that tidbit of information.  She says that it is okay with her but she thinks it is funny because there are 7 atheists working there.  She begins to name them and count them out on her hand.  At the end of the list she just says, ""...and me.""  
I am really good at keeping a straight face.   I did this time as well.  She finished her story and I turned to my wife and asked if she heard what she said about being an atheist.  She said she did.  Mind you, my daughter is still sitting there.  This is the first time she mentioned her beliefs to us.  She has visited churches with friends and even with me when she was very young and I was showing her the type of church I grew up in.  
I am so proud of her for being able to say something like that to us without feeling like she will be judged.  I am also proud of our parenting in that area.  We never pushed the issue and never let her know until much later what our beliefs are.  We let her find her way.  
I know she has some very religious friends.  She didn't let that influence her, apparently. 
My wife and I are of different views.  My wife has a bit more religion than I do.  My older daughter is very religious and quotes the Christian Bible often.  My extended family is VERY religious.  I am ... Dudeist, at the moment and consider myself atheist.  
I am happy that my science-loving, intelligent, and kind daughter has chosen her path on her own.  I am happy that my older daughter has chosen her path as well.  
I think we have done a good job and it actually brought me to tears to have her speak to us as equals in her early adulthood.  
I hope I didn't ramble too much."
I just proposed to the love of my life last night and she said yes!,"Words can not describe the absolute joy that I feel right now. 

She is my heart, my soul, my everything. She is the only one for me, and I can not wait to take this journey that is life together.

2019 is already shaping up to be the best year of my life.

Edit: Wow, I was not expecting it to blow up like this. Thank you to everyone for your well wishes. Here's hoping everyone's new years is as awesome as mine is so far"
I stopped my mom from suicide with cookies and water,"I don’t know if this is the right sub for this, but I have literally told no one, and the thought came back to me tonight. 

I was around 10 at the time, and I was pretty dumb. Me and my sister were home alone because my dad and mom went to the bar to have some drinks. About 4 hours after they left, my mom comes home in an uber.

She storms upstairs, and is crying insanely hard. I have only seen her cry one other time, and it was about a movie.

My sister said hi to my mom, but she didn’t respond because of how upset she was. My sister got mad when she didn’t respond and made things even worse for her. I just looked out my door and did nothing.

When I walked into her room to ask what was happening, she was on the bed crying and responded with: “Nothing. Nows not the time.”

I really could tell that there was something wrong, but the least I could do was bring her something to drink or eat

I went downstairs to the kitchen and got a cookie and some water. When I went back upstairs, and into her room, she had a nooce laying on the bed. I remember seeing it but not thinking to much of it.

I handed the water and cookies to her, and she just stopped crying for a couple of seconds. She looked at me and then looked at the snacks. She put them down and said: “Thank you ~my name~.” 

I’m almost certain that she was mad because my dad either hooked up with another girl, or was mean to her because my dad has anger issues.

I also think that she was about to attempt suicide, but just cookies and water made her stop from suiciding. 

I’m almost 14 now, and she’s doing really good now. She smiles everyday and has gotten really involved in church and loves her bible study group. My dad is also doing better now, and he is learning to respect my mom more for what she is.

I like to think that her feeling when I gave her the cookies was that: “If I left this world, i’m leaving so much behind me. People will miss me.”

Thank you for reading.

edit 1: holy crap thank you guys for the explosive response. someone gilded me and I have no idea what to use it for lol. "
Two years of job searching,"I've been looking for a fulltime job for 2 years now. I've gotten so many rejection letters I lost count. I've worked some shitty retail jobs, been fired from one, and been so depressed I didnt feel like I could push through it or make it. I lost 20lbs (and I'm already really skinny) cause I couldnt afford to eat a lot. But today I got a job. A real job in my field. It's literally so much more than I've ever made. It's been the hardest 2 years of my life and it turned around in a day. I'm still in shock and I cant believe it. This literally changed my life over night and idk even, I'm just really emotional and happy today.

Edit: Did not expect this to blow up so much, but thank you all so much! I'm trying to respond to everybody I can, but I'm about to go to bed, so I might miss some. If I miss you, thank you so much for all the well wishes and I hope everybody out there job searching feels a little but encouraged (you can do it!)

Edit 2: Wow, thanks for my first silver stranger! "
"I just realised that I was slowly being a creep. So I've just deleted 3410 porn videos & photos, deleted my porn related reddit and tumblr accounts and as from 2019 am going out to meet new people. I don't want to be a virgin volcel anymore","Yeah...I had 3410 porn videos and images saved on my phone. The thing is, at some point I masturbated so much that I didn't even realised that porn took so much place in my life. 

The reason why I was so much in porn is because I was frustrated. I live in one of those shitty village where there's nothing to do and where people aren't that handsome according to me. I've always dreamed to live in one of those big cities, near the beach and with skyscrapers, where I would go out at a the skatepark with friends after school or have different kind of girls that maybe I could date. But hey...If there's nothing fun to do outside and that the only way to release your sexual urges on beautiful girls, is to masturbate online, why would I leave the house ?

So I masturbated and gave zero intention to get in a relationship with girls more than friendship (that's why am a 18 year old voluntary celibate). 

The creepy part of that story is that among those pictures and videos, I had a ""collection"" of approximately 1500 pictures of Instagram girls that shows their ass in bikini thongs. I don't mean Instagram **models** but Instagram **users**, who are college students of my age or older who doesn't really post these pictures as fap material. I literally created an album for each, with their names in my phone and didn't find anything wrong with that. It's only yesterday night that I realised how fucked up I was getting.

As from 2019, Am moving to one of those states of my dream for further studies and fuck this old creepy me, am a new and better person now."
I have a year clean from heroin today.,"It just feels like a regular day, honestly. I didn't want to use yesterday, or the day before. I don't want to use today. That dark chapter of my life is over, and I'm incredibly grateful for that.

Only one person in my life knows that this is my real clean date, and I owe so much of this to him being there when I was at my absolute worst, on the verge of death. I couldn't have done it without him. He's my best friend, and I'm very, very fortunate to have him in my life. He always tells me how lucky I am, seeing as I'm alive after multiple overdoses. He's right. I am lucky. 

It's also my mom's birthday today. I couldn't have done it without her, either. I hope she likes the fancy Alexa we got her. It's got like, a display screen that shows you the weather and stuff? I dunno, it looks neat. She asked for the most basic version, but she definitely deserves the nicest one, so that's the one she's getting.

Like I said, it's just another day, really. I'm gonna do boring stuff like go to the gym and get my car's oil changed. The difference between yesterday and today is pretty much imperceptible. But somewhere in the last year, I've started becoming a pretty different person. The kind of person I actually like, maybe. It's still a work in progress. I guess it always should be, though, shouldn't it?

Anyway, these are just some thoughts I wanted to put down. I could say more, but the take-away is that I'm just grateful. I could be dead right now. It's a wonder that I'm not. And though I'm not perfectly happy with my life, I am so thankful I didn't die. I'm so thankful for the people I've had in my life that have helped me to keep living and be a better person than I've been.

Thanks for reading."
"To all the people donating money to the Go fund me border wall campaign, fuck you.","If anything, your money will go to waste anyway. Jokes on you."
My Grandmother literally paid me simply for visiting her,"My grandma is in her 70s and does have a husband but he is away alot (he plays golf constantly and is also a Mason and has family in England and America while we live in Scotland). I'm usually the one he calls upon to check up on my grandma which I would usually do anyway when he's away since she is too frail to walk her black lab herself.
One such day was yesterday, my step grandad left early in the morning and wouldn't be back until 4 the next morning so I went up for a few hours to keep her company. On the way I bought her a cake from the bakers so we could have lunch together. She was so happy to see me and we walked the dog together since she wanted to go for a walk.
As I left she stuffed a 20 into my pocket just because I had visited her. I did not expect money and outright refused to take it, her excuse was that I bought her a cake. A small cake. From the bakers. It was a couple of pounds not 20.

It really puts into perspective how lonely elderly people can be and although she has the dog to keep her company she must crave human attention. I ended up going back later that night to walk the dog again for her and I won't forget the smile on her face as I unexpectedly walked through her door.

Love you grandma

EDIT: I just wanted to say how happy I am about all the love! I also want to give my condolences to those who have lost their grandparents, I can't go through all the comments giving my condolences. Thanks to those who commented with loving words, hopefully this post and you beautiful redditers made somebodies day :) "
So I got pulled over by a cop the other day...,"I wasn't wearing my seat belt. He pulled me over and informed me that I was being written a ticket for a seat belt violation. He asked me to get my information out of my passenger door because the driver's side was bordering the road. 

When I was digging in my glove box, he noticed my bag of pipe tobacco. He asked what it was, and I told him it was flavored pipe tobacco, and we had a short and friendly conversation about that. He then asked if I had anything illegal in my truck. I told him no, and gave him free reign to search my vehicle, to which he declined. 

After I handed him my registration, he was patient while I loaded my insurance app, and then he noticed that I had recently moved, and my insurance/license addresses were different. He told me that is a citable violation, and I should get it changed immediately. However, he did not issue that violation. 

While writing the ticket he asked where I work, and what time I had to be there. After I had answered, he responded ""I'll try to get you out of here as soon as possible.""

No drama here. No interesting story. No abuse of the law. Just a story about a polite and friendly police officer doing his job. I figured with all of the negative stories out there, I would share a good experience. I really think people forget that cops are people too - most of them good people. "
Almost all social media sites are annoying now.,"Tumblr just looks really fucking ugly (not to mention the people on it are insane), Instagram is full of 13-year-olds who feel the need to ""flex"" on each other, Snapchat is obnoxious for many reasons. Although Reddit has proved its toxicity in some areas, I find some peace here. Thank you for reading."
"It sucks not having that person to talk to anymore. When you see something you both enjoyed and you want to show them but you can’t. New music, tv shows, jokes.","Life’s pretty shit for me right now. I don’t know what to do. I haven’t been able to eat properly in days, and I miss her. I removed all of her friends on social media because I don’t want to see her with another guy. I’m so lost, and so scared. I just want to fast forward and get out of this hellhole. Please help me.

"My mother and sister had a car crash. My mother died, while my sister survived with a brain injury. How to continue?","TL;DR at the bottom.

&#x200B;

My family owes two bakeries, about 60 kilometres from each other, so we kinda split up - me (27) and my sister (23) managed the one in the smaller town, while my father (53), mother (46), other sister (25) and brother (21) managed the one in the big city. On November 18th, my mother and sister came to visit us, like they did most  Sundays. My mother woke me up but i didn't get up right away - I had been drinking the previous night because it was my friend's birthday and was really hungover. After a while, I managed to get up and hang out with my mom for a while, but i was just waiting for them to leave because I really wanted to get back to bed. I am probably never going to drink again.

Around 12:05PM they decided to take off. Before going, my mother started to scold me like she always did - ""you need to get married, you're 27 years old, I want grandchildren!"". I just laughed and shrugged ""you're not even 47 yet, where's the rush?"". I Got up, hugged her and kissed her, said goodbye and went back to sleep, not realising that that was the last time I will ever talk to her. I remember my last thought before falling asleep was ""what if they have an accident?""

&#x200B;

It happened about 35 minutes later. They were 15 minutes from home. We still don't know what really happened, only that my sister was driving and my mother was asleep. If she had been awake, she would have probably survived with some minor injuries, maybe a concussion. But it didn't go that way.

We found out about an hour and a half after it happened. My father called to ask if they had left our place. That was the first alarm. I tried to call them both, but no one answered. Took a look at the different communication apps we used - they weren't online since they left. That was the second alarm. Tried to call them one more time, still no answer. I'm panicking. I open up a news site, but there's nothing on it. I open up another one and I see a picture. A picture of our car. Title: Car crash - one dead, one with heavy injuries. 

I got a friend of mine to drive me and my sister to the hospital where they took my other sister because I was physically and psychologically unfit to drive. It was the first in a really long series of terribly agonising rides. We still didn't know who died and who survived. I will probably always hate myself for wishing at that moment that it was mom that made it, even though I knew that her's and dad's remaining life would probably be hell. But mom died on the spot. 

If only she hand't been sleeping. If only they hadn't drop by. If only they had taken dad's car with all the extra security measures. If only I hadn't been hungover and told them to stay a bit longer. If only.

&#x200B;

My sister had a hematoma and they had to preform brain surgery. She also broke her left elbow, right wrist and a couple of fingers on her right hand, but nothing too serious. The brain surgery went extremely well and she was put into an induced coma for three days. She woke up the next day, which was a really good sign and remained in intensive care for the next two weeks, before being transfered to post-intensive neurological care, which she is finally leaving tomorrow.

She's coming home for a week or two before her physical and psychological rehabilitation starts. She is currently really depressed after staying for so long at the hospital and having such a mess in her head. The biggest problem though? She still doesn't know mom died. A few days ago, I asked her if she remembered all the people that came to visit her. One of the people she mentioned was mom, which got me a bit. She probably didn't remember that well, but she just assumed that mom would come by. We are all scared to death because we don't know how will that information affect her psychological health and that it will depress her even further. And the time for telling her is almost upon us - in a maximum of 10 hours, she will be home and she will notice that someone is missing. It's gonna be hard. It's gonna be painful.

&#x200B;

I really miss my mom. I cry almost every night when I drive back home and all I can think about is her. I miss her hugs, I miss talking to her. I miss her scolding me. I miss telling her every night how much money we made that day and I miss her calling me in the morning to ask me if I'm awake. I miss her voice. I can't look at her pictures and I hate myself for it. But the worst thing is thinking about the future that doesn't include her. I think about all the possible good things that might happen in life - all the business successes, our family growing - and she isn't there to share our joy. I see old couples walking on the streets and feel sad that she never got the chance to grow old. I expected her to live for at least 30 more years. Hell, sometimes I thought she will outlive me. 

Life is cruel - it makes you work really hard, put in your blood, sweat and tears for the good things, but it only takes a single moment for everything to fall to pieces. Just a couple of weeks earlier, I was telling a friend of mine that I finally felt satisfied with my life. Business was good, I finally payed off a loan, I was healthier than ever and everyone was in a really good mood. I wonder why the hell I even said anything. Now the only thing stopping me from killing myself is not wanting to hurt my family even more. They just don't deserver to have to deal with another tragedy.

Every night, when I go to sleep, i pray I somehow manage to turn back time. I wish to relive that morning and try to change things. And every morning I wake up disappointed that I failed. I might start wishing a meteor hits us so this suffering ends.

&#x200B;

I wish I was more religious and that I believed in some form of afterlife - an afterlife where I will get the chance to see my mother again, tell her about all the stuff she missed out on, and one day introduce her to all of her grandchildren. But every inch of my body tells me that that's not how it works and that that day was truly her end. Every single cell tells me that life is just a series of infuriatingly tragic moments that ends with an endless darkness and silence. If we're lucky enough, our body will overload with all the different happiness hormones so our brain manages to give us the happiest thoughts right before we go back nothingness. 

But God do I hope I'm wrong.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR

 \- mom died in car crash

 \- sister still doesn't know because she suffered brain injury, even though it's been more than a month since it happened

 \- life sucks

 \- I want to die but can't because It would crush the rest of the family even more

 \- I wish I believed there was an afterlife, but I don't

 \- Please someone give me a time machine or arrange a meeting with someone that will buy my soul in exchange for reverting all of this

&#x200B;

Sorry for the inconsistent rambling, I just don't have the strength and knowledge to try and write it somewhat better.

Sorry for all the writing mistakes, english is not my native language.

Sorry if I don't reply right away, I need to go to sleep now because it's getting pretty late and have to get my sister out of the hospital tomorrow.

And thank you to anyone who takes the time to read this mess. Truly, your effort is appreciated.

My cat knows when there’s a problem with my nieces illness,"I adore animals, they are truly the most amazing creatures on earth. I have a cat who is about 4, she is an absolute love bug and an amazing little thing, a couple of months ago she started living at my sisters house due to us moving and not being allowed to have inside animals, it wasn’t a big deal and we see her almost daily. Around the same time my 4 year old niece was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and my sister has been slowly learning to deal with it. One night my cat pushed her way into my sisters room at around 2am and meowed and jumped on her until she woke up, my sister went to check my nieces sugars and she was at 2.1. If it wasn’t for my cat my sister wouldn’t have woken up, my cat sleeps with my niece and wakes my sister up anytime her sugars are low, it’s incredible that she knows. She sits with her all night and my sister sends photos to my mum throughout the night of my cat sitting watching my niece, I just wanted to share this because its amazing that some animals are able to help with illnesses, if anyone has a similar story feel free to share

EDIT: I woke up to all these comments! Thank you all so much for reading and sharing your experiences "
I attempted suicide,"About 3 weeks ago I attempted suicide. I had hung my belt up around my over the door coat rack. I'm a pretty heavy set guy and I didn't think it through. I stood on my chair and tied the belt around my neck. I pushed the chair away and started to hang. I lost consciousness pretty quickly and I saw my life flash before my eyes. I woke up in hospital a few hours later. The knot I tied wasn't tight enough and came loose because of my body weight. Apparently the noise of my unconscious body hitting the hard wood floor was enough to wake up my cousin on the other side of the house. She performed cpr and called paramedics. The amount of people and flowers and the overall support brought me to tears. It ultimately brought my disjointed family together to openly talk about our mental health issues. It was an unfortunate situation that brought up some much needed conversations. Please if you're suicidal really think about the side affects before attempting to go through with it. 


Edit: Wow. The support is incredible thank you. Firstly I'm doing alot better mentally. "
I am an ER nurse. I saw a mother kiss her grown child three times on her face before she said her final good bye.,"We spent an an hour and forty five minutes trying to bring her back. It wasn't the normal code (cardiac arrest). 

She was a young adult, although, with an extensive medical history where she is total care (tracheostomy and various other issues). 

Her mom took care of her for over 3 decades. Her mom kissed her goodbye and she yelled ""how am I supposed to live without you?"". 

The patient next door, a mere few feet away, with only a curtain between them, began hysterically crying. I tried to console him too but that wasn't easy as my eyes were full of tears.

They are still full of tears. 

I hope she's resting peacefully. And I hope her mom eventually finds solace. "
"My dad killed himself, and I have a message for you.","Apologies if this isn’t appropriate for this sub. I’m really unsure where else it would go. (Sorry, on mobile)

18 years ago today, my father committed suicide, at the age of 46. 

Although we knew depression ran in his family (his own mother committed suicide when he was a child), he exhibited no signs of depression, or expressed suicidal thoughts. Ever. 

We had a happy life. He and my mother had been together since they were teenagers, and were truly happy. He had what seemed, everything to live for. Yet, on the afternoon of February 23, 2001, my dad left a note on our screened porch, telling my mom not come outside, and hung himself in the shed behind our house. 

I’ve read many posts and comments here of those suffering and contemplating taking their own life. For what it’s worth, and it may not be worth much, but that voice - the one that is telling you it’s for the best, and your loved ones are better off? That the pain is too much to continue? That you are a burden to those around you? It’s not true. I am not dismissing your feelings, I’m really not. I just want you to know, as a person on the other side of suicide, that voice is wrong. 

It may be situational — an episode in your life that seems hopeless. Or maybe you’ve suffered with depression and these thoughts for years, and you just want it to stop. So you make the decision. You plan, and you are finally at peace because you know the end is near. That’s one part people don’t understand. How could someone go about their lives as if everything was ok? “They were happy! It doesn’t make sense!” “They finally seemed to be ok!” 

But think about it. When you have what seems to be an impossible problem, how do you feel and act when you finally find a solution? You feel relieved. Calm. Sometimes even euphoric. 

I can only imagine the pain my father was going through to have chosen to leave us in such a way. But the days leading up to his death, he seemed so happy. The day of, he and my mom went to lunch, spoke of plans about moving down south to be closer to my sister and I, and even spoke of plans that evening to have dinner with friends. 

I was 22 when he died. I was so angry right after. We all were. How could a man with so much to live for, who had such a wonderful life, choose to kill himself? We were totally blindsided, and thought what a selfish, deplorable thing he did. 

How wrong I was. 

Since then, after research, talking with suicide survivors, and those who have lost loved ones, plus suffering from my own depression, I now know it isn’t selfish. To the sufferer, it’s selfless. Sufferers are totally convinced their absence from this earth will be a relief for those who love them. One less burden. The feelings are real, and they are persistent. 

I’m not sure what I’m trying to say. I guess I’m talking to both sides. If you’ve lost someone to suicide, try not to be angry. It’ll be hard, trust me, I know. But after 18 years, I’m not angry. I’m just so fucking sad. Sad he had to suffer in silence. Sad he’ll never know his grandkids, or see what my sister had I have accomplished. Sad my mom still cries for him and misses him everyday. Sad I can’t get his advice or hear his corny jokes when I’m down. 

I’m writing this to you. 

You are loved. You are worth it. You will be so very missed. This pain is real. But it doesn’t have to be permanent. Reach out. Talk. Share. There is no shame. 

The voices are temporary. They can be silenced, and there is help. 



Edit: I am reading every one of your comments. I am overwhelmed, and so grateful to those of you that shared your own suffering, and those with loved ones lost to suicide. You are all stronger than you know. If any of you need to talk, feel free to message me:) 

Thank you for the silver and gold:) very appreciated. "
I can get an abortion if I want.,"It’s my body . It’s my choice.  The same goes for any woman. What we decide to do with OUR bodies is NOT UP TO YOU. 

I don’t care what anyone says. You cannot change my mind. **I won’t budge.**

If you have ever gotten an abortion just know you have my support. If you have ever had a baby know you have my support. If you decided to give your baby up for adoption you have my support. 

I’m pro choice. Not anti life. 

Edit: 283848383. A lot of people assumed one thing or another about the why of my post and the background of myself or even hypothetical questions about the nonexistent man who fathered my nonexistent child, and everything else in between. All of which were irrelevant, that’s not at all what this is about. 

I made this post to show my support to **all** women who have made or will make a decision regarding **their own** bodies when it comes to making babies. Your opinion is not and will not ever be needed. 

**To all of you who need it please know I stand by you and your decision. Whether it be abortion, adoption, or motherhood.** 

I am in no way shape or form trying to say that abortion is a “birth control method”.  Also, just so you know birth control, condoms, vasectomies, & tubal ligation are not 100% effective .. unwanted pregnancies happen in all kinds of ways. 

I hope the amount of backlash I received is an obvious answer as to why this was an offmychest.

My son made his first friend,"My son is 11, he's autistic. He's in sixth grade which is just an awful, awkward time in any kids life. He's never had a friend before. He made a friend on the bus, his name is Alex. He's in my house playing video games with my son now and they're having a great time. I ordered them pizza and let them drink soda. I can't remember a time when I have been so happy. I just had to tell someone, I'm trying not to look like a crazy women who's way to excited and embarrass my little guy.

Update: IT'S A SLEEPOVER!!

Edit: You are all really good people. Thank you."
I just signed back on to FB and it made me realize I like you assholes more than the people I actually know.,"I deleted my account over a year ago and against my better judgement, I signed back up so my wife and ""out of town"" friends and family would leave me alone. In 3 days, I've realized how much I hate FB, cannot stand to hear what the people I know have to say and guess what? Nobody gives a shit what your dumbass kids did every 20 fucking minutes! I have my own life and dumbass kids, why do I need to spend time looking at dumb shit, AD, dumb shit, AD, repost, AD.... Anyways it makes me miss my time here. I learn way more, I laugh, I get pissy, but I like you assholes better than the ones I know personally."
I lost my job because of my dog.,"I received a call from my oldest daughter crying. She told me our dog got out and she didn't know what to do. I had about an hour and a half of work left today. The owner of the company was out so I told the other staff member I needed to go my dog is lost.

I am creeping along my neighborhood, driving down every where looking for my little dog. My phone rings, it is my boss. She said she didn't appreciate me leaving, that my kids will get over it that it builds character for them, and if I didn't come back, I didn't have a job. 

I choose to not go back.

Quick edit here:

I just wanted to thank everyone for the support and kind words. I have no regret for my kids and my dog, but the situation left me with a lot of mixed feelings. Thank you all again for boosting my confidence in what I also felt was right."
I'm black. I'm not apologizing for that.,"I'm a black man. I'm about 6'2"", average build. Nothing too fancy. I think I look normal, not intimidating in the slightest. I grew up in a middle-class neighborhood. My parents were blue collar workers, but provided for me and my sister. We were taught manners, said our pleasantries. I got detention once in fifth grade because I was late to class because I spilled paint in my Art class and had to clean it up. But that’s it, that’s the worst trouble I’ve ever been in in my life. 

I am a surgical resident at a hospital you’ve probably heard of. I was educated in a Top 10 university and went to medical school at a pseudo-Ivy League institution. I have had a great life. I’ve made sure of it. So have my parents. 

Of course, I have noticed racism throughout my life. I have been pulled over and the officer has never given me a clear answer. Sometimes, they will straight up lie and tell me that I was speeding when I know I wasn’t. Once, I was stopped and frisked. The officer apologized and told me that I matched the description of a criminal-on-the-run in the area. The only description was “black man, average build.” I never reported this, but I always remember it. 

Today, I was leaving after a 26-hour shift at the hospital. I’m in my fourth year of residency and the hours get longer and longer, but I’m almost done. Today was particularly grueling, because I found out that a patient I have worked with since the start of my residency is now deemed ‘terminal’ and will be moved to hospice care. It sucked, it broke my heart. It was like four years’ worth of work had been erased. 

As I was walking across the parking lot, a young man—younger than me, maybe twenty-five—leaned out of his car and called me the N-word. It was loud enough so people could hear. People stared, most in shock. Others picked up the pace to get away from the earth-shattering embarrassment unfolding. 

I stopped and looked at him. The man didn’t get out of his car, but he made sure I saw him. The sneer on his face, it grew into a piercing grin. He started mimicking the sounds of a monkey. He called me the N-word again. People continued to stare. My mouth fell open. The guy mocked my expression; he feigned behavior like one of my patients suffering from severe mental retardation. He was trying to show me how he saw me. 

A lot of things were on my mind in the forty-five odd seconds I was standing there. I wanted to walk up to the man and list off all my accomplishments. I wanted to tell him how, in eleventh grade, I won a science fair by creating a more efficient way for our school’s agriculture club to conserve energy. It took me to a national conference. 

I wanted to tell him about the first time I fell in love. I wanted to tell him about the guy who made my heart beat so fast that I thought it would explode. This guy, he was tall, his smile was dopey and his eyes were light. Just the thought of him took away the painful feelings that this man was bringing to me. 

I wanted to tell him that I’m a good person; that I volunteer, I save lives, I work so people like you get a chance to survive and carry on being the hateful people you are. 

But instead, I walked to my car. The man called me the N-word about five more times, laughing so hard I thought it was certain he would lose consciousness. 

I sat behind the wheel for a very long time, maybe ten minutes, processing. I was angry at the man, but also at the people that didn’t say anything. I was angry at myself for not saying anything. 

Sometimes, I just feel alone. Who I am, simply the color of my skin, makes me the target of hate from people that I will never even know. I truly try to love and understand everyone, so when one person returns that with malice and ill-will, it’s a lot to take in. 

I don’t think anyone will read this, but I just wanted to tell you all about my day. I want to put this out into the world. I want to let the Internet know that black people are good. Black people are strong, capable, smart. Black people are resilient. I’m proud of my Blackness. I’m proud of my coarse hair and thick lips. I’m proud of my body that is subject to ridicule. I am proud of who I am, what I have been through. I am proud of my ancestors who were slaves and now I am their wildest dream. 

Black people can be bad, too. Black people can be murderers and thieves and rapists. Black people can be everything—except human, apparently. I just want to be acknowledged as a human. I want to be seen as a human. I want to be known. 

I love my black body. I’m tired of having to explain that pride in my black body is not hatred for any other race. I’m tired of worrying that I may be shot driving to work. 

I don’t hate police. I don’t hate White people. I don’t hate anyone. 

But, God, I love me. And I want that to be enough. "
Update on my husband is dying of kidney failure.,"You were all so lovely, just to say my beloved husband died in my arms on October 4th. 
Given the three expected endings ,,( heart attack, drowning in fluid or drifting off)we were blessed that he drifted. 
He shocked us by announcing vehemently on the Thursday 4th that he had ( swear swear) had enough of feeling like (swear swear).....he meant it! 
His Mum and I gave him permission, loved on him even more and held him...
He raised his thumb, and being held and loved, like he always has been but especially in the last year... he literally drifted.  I cannot wish him back, because I adore him and he deserves the break...but by Cripes I wish I could have the healthy years again. Anyway this is just to thank you for the loving thoughts you sent and to send beloved on his way for his "" long drive"". Xxx"
Fuck everyone who calls kids with cancer warriors and superheroes,"I want to punch people in the face who tell me my baby is a ""superhero"" and ""he's such a warrior! He's so brave!""

You know what? My 5yo isn't a superhero. He isn't a brave warrior up against a faceless enemy, destined to win glory and fame.

He's a 5yo child who is scared every day we're in the hospital. He cries with every new (and old) procedure and just wants to go home. Every day we're inpatient and he gets toxic chemicals pumped into his tiny body, he goes to sleep leaking sad tears that he's not sleeping in his own bed.

Fuck you and your stupid idea that cancer is some glorified battle. He's not a superhero, he's a goddamn victim. Take your stupid meaningless words that you throw out to make yourself feel better and shove them up your ass."
"As a former helicopter parent and current mother of a 23 suicidal son, PLEASE take my advice. Do not smother your kids, do not try to mold them to be the perfect child. Let them be independent and take risks.","I wanted the best for my son, so I scheduled his entire life. I grew up around 3 brothers, who spent their teenage years in the 80s drinking, doing drugs, partying, fucking girls. They slacked off, and I hated it. I hated their attitude towards life, I hated them for how unproductive they were. I wanted my son to be nothing like them. I had this image of my son being this smart, witty hipster kid who, on his own accord, said no to partying and drugs because *he was better than that.* I saw what the stereotypes of kids today were, and I was happy to see him grow up in this generation, which seemed to be more accepting. 

Except, around 13-14, things changed. I saw him hang out with different kids. I found out he cut his after school art class, I found him kissing a girl at 13, he wanted different clothing, he started listening to hip-hop. My dream of a smart hipster accepting kid was fading away, and my reaction was to smother him. No hanging out after school, I have to talk to his friends parents always if he is going to see friends, I have to make sure his friends are the 'right type' to be hanging out with. It got to the point where I told him he cant listen to certain music because it was too crude or had curses in it. No violent movies. No over sexualized movies. I picked out his clothing, I told him he cant wear his more 'edgy' clothing. No hanging out in the park, no hanging out on the streets at all. No going to parties unless there are parents there. No violent video games. No going to the sketchy bodega. I tried at one point to make him eat vegan and organic food only. I made him read books I picked out for him, feminist books mostly. 

I did everything in my power to make sure he was the right type of person. I didn't want him to have fun, I didn't let him choose his own time. Because he would have chosen the wrong things, and fun usually just means up to no good right? So I didn't like the idea of him having fun, as many excuses as I made, that was it. Fun to a teen boy, to me, was getting drunk at a party and doing something you will regret. Not MY kid. 

I tried molding him, and in the end, he became sheltered from the world entirely. At 17 he was going off to college, and we spent 2 weeks at my sisters house. Those 2 weeks were just so eye opening to me. My sisters kids were 16 and 17 and they just seemed so much more mature, so much more socially healthy than my son. They had a lot of friends, they had girlfriends. The parents looked the other way to the older son drinking a few beers with friends. The kids listened to whatever they wanted, they watched whatever movies they wanted, they hung out with whoever. The older son had a public enemy shirt on, something I would have disproved of for my son. But he was... just so much more mature. 

My son went to college for 9 weeks, then dropped out. He came home, telling me college was too overwhelming. He became depressed. I still tried to withhold him from bad influences, but after some eye opening events I realized how wrong this was. And I also realized it was too late. He was 18 years old with the maturity and life-exposure level of a 12 year old. I got him to move out at 20, with my help, to an apartment only 4 blocks away. 

I wish I could say he has done better. It has been 5 years, 7 suicide attempts, no friends, no girlfriends. I give him 400 bucks a month for his apartment. He doesnt blame me, but I blame myself. I really fucking do. 

Let your child be themselves. Let them take risks. If they fuck up in some way, if you catch them drinking with friends at 17, learn to look the other way sometimes. They dont have to be perfect, but they have to be themselves. I never learned this. I wish I fucking did when I had him. 

Edit: Holy shit I am on the front page of Reddit. "
"Austin, honey, go f—k yourself.","Hi, Austin. You are legally separated from your wife. She is dating. In fact, she is dating the man she was FUCKING while you were DEPLOYED to a war zone. Isn’t that usually how it works out? She’s dating the man who momentarily broke up with her, which caused her so much distress, she tried to commit suicide in front of your kids and forced you to come home from a mission early. 

Maybe I shouldn’t have gotten involved with you before the ink settled on your divorce papers. But hey: you two are separated. Divorces can take a while. Especially in the military.  Plus, I’d never have sex with someone who was married, technically or not. You and I were flirting. Nothing harmful. We were getting to know each other so when you fully and finally divorced, we could figure out if dating was an option or not. 

Maybe that says more about me than you. But I’d like to think I have a strong moral compass. I don’t cheat or condone cheating, but hey: you signed papers of separation, started the divorce proceedings and lived apart. Is it really cheating if you’re in the process of getting divorced? It’s breaking up + a legal component. But for all intents and purposes, you BOTH acted and were SINGLE. You were broken up. A court hearing and a piece of paper were all that were keeping you two legally together. 

Here is what I need to say, but I won’t say it to you because, well, fuck you. Your choice will fuck you up more than my words could. 

The first time, she went psychotic on you, and out of fear of losing your kids, you ghosted me and tried to make it work with her. I get that. You knew that if you didn’t play the game, you’d lose the only sources of joy and love in your life. The first time, we were just friends. You cut me out because you were afraid of her construing our friendship as something more. 

But you came back. You came back begging me to give you a real chance. You told me you were done and choosing her over yourself and the potential for anything with me was a big mistake. You called her every name in the book. You took more steps to divorce her this time than last. As a friend, I knew you were serious. So as a potential partner, I allowed the flirting to begin. 

Last night, you went back. 

You went back to a woman who won’t help you raise your kids. You went back to threats. You went back to someone who has no ambition. You went back to someone who won’t even get her GED. You went back to someone who was verbally asking you to come back, while, at the same time, texting another dude to set up a time to fuck LATER THAT NIGHT. You went back to someone who gets drunk downtown over taking care of her children. You went back to someone who has had you arrested out of spite. You went back to someone who spends YOUR money on bullshit but can’t afford her own bills. You went back to someone mentally unstable when she doesn’t get her way. You went back to someone who only wants to stay married because she won’t get a real job, therefore she is unable to support herself with rent, groceries or a car payment — in other words, a leech. Or in military speak: a dependapotamous. A term I learned from you, by the way. 

So, this time, instead of wondering why I wasn’t good enough or what I’d done wrong, I woke up early, got a good workout in, got my favorite coffee, got my nails done, ordered Chanel makeup (I just love seeing the box come in the mail), bought a new dress from Neiman Marcus, got dressed to the 9’s and went out for cocktails with my best bad ass ladies and celebrated international women’s day. 

You missed out on a hard working attorney who would never dream (or need) to depend on you for money. You missed out on someone who wanted to help you grow. You missed out on someone with ambitions and goals and an education. The only baggage I’d have brought was my student loans, which I wouldn’t depend on you to pay. You missed out on a whole lotta love, respect, and stability. 

And I dodged a motherfucking bullet. Good luck fucking crazy and lazy for the next 14 years till your kids are grown and gone. I have court cases to win and people to help. You, thankfully, won’t be one of them. 

Thank you, NEXT. "

I'm proud of my generation.," I'm 32. Right in the middle of the millennial generation. 

You know what? We're awesome. We're dealing with crippling student loans, a horrible job market, a defunct political atmosphere, and a nearly unattainable American dream. Older generations shit on us for not succeeding in what they see as the same world they grew up/matured in.  We're lazy/dumb/stupid/entitled, and it's our own fault if we struggle. 

You know what I see? Thirty year-olds trying to eke out a living in their own way, working hard while still trying to be socially conscious and environmentally friendly. We were fed the American dream, but it somehow soured before we got a true taste. Now we're all behind schedule according to our parents, trying to make families in our 30s and be financially stable in a volatile, unstable world. And yet we're still trying to have fun, trying to be social, trying to cope with a raw deal and still maintain our integrity. 

I'm proud of us. We're doing the best we can with the hand we were dealt, while being the societal scapegoat for other generations. 

Edit: walked home from work and saw this had blown up. Thank you for the gold, your encouragement, and your stories. ❤️ Never have I felt more solidarity with so many people. 

You're all amazing, and I'm proud to be one of you. "
My schizophrenic older brother killed our abusive parents.,"This happened about seventeen years ago. Today, all of these memories came flooding back for some reason or other. 

My parents physically abused me and my brother. I was very young, about six-years-old when they died, but I remember their anger and violence so clearly. My brother was ten years older than me. He always protected me. 

One day, my mom was punishing me for getting mud on the kitchen floor by holding my head in a sink filled with water. She was trying to drown me, I swear. I urinated on myself out of ear. It happened so quickly. I just remember my brother pulling me back, then he just choked my mother until she passed out. 

My brother hugged me and told me it's okay and then he went and murdered my father. Both of them had broken necks. My brother was committed to a psych ward but killed himself. I went to live with my aunt and uncle and had a great life. 

I think everyone assumes that I've forgotten about this, but I haven't. I remember. I remember how hard I cried when my brother died, but I only allowed myself to break in secret, because everyone else labeled him as a monster. 

What he did was horrible, I understand, but he saved my life. I believe that. I know he loved me, and I loved him, and I miss him every single day of my life. 

Just wanted to tell someone. Hope you all have a good day. "
Its my birthday and I have a story,"So hey. Ive never posted on here but I'll do my best not to sound like a weenie. So im turning 24 today, not important, but it has been almost 6 years since a guy in my high school committed suicide. It is important that I didnt say friend because I honestly hardly knew him. We had one class together, gym, and we didnt really talk much. We were friendly with each other and knew each others names but that is about it. One day he helped me find a ring i dropped in gym and that was the most interaction we ever had. His name was Cal R. Obviously i wouldnt feel right saying his full name here but to this day I still remember him. I remember how he would dye his hair every few months. I remember how he would try half heartedly in gym. I remember how his parents accepted his diploma only a few weeks after his funeral. I remember the kids getting arrested because they spray painted ""Remember Cal"" under the bridge where he committed suicide. So I dont really know anything about him, what his home life was like, or why he did what he did. But I remember him, and I most likely always will. I'll remember his quick ""hey"" and ""how are ya"" in the hall or at lunch. I'll remember how excited he was to have found my ring. For whatever reason it really seemed to make him happy. What I'm trying to say I guess is. Well I dont know what I'm trying to say. All I know is that he is gone forever and I'm sure a lot of people miss him. I hardly knew him and I miss him, the very fact that he isnt here makes me sad. So, I'll always remember Cal and if you are in a place like that. People will remember you. No matter how alone or unwanted or anything negative you may feel. I guarantee someone will miss you. Shit, if you say hi to me and tell me your name, I'll fucking remember you. So. Please. Keep trying, keep fighting even if it sucks. There are people, even if you dont quite know it, who will miss you. Who will stop everything they are doing during the day and just. Remember you, what you were like, what you could have become. So. As a certain character says ""Keep struggling"" You can do it. I believe in you. And even if I dont know you, as a fellow human who knows what its like, I fucking love you. 

EDIT 1: Okay i figured out that simply editing the thing is better than writing a random comment. Im trying to get to as many comments as I can. I will definitely be responding to more tomorrow but I think its time for bed for me. But I want to thank everyone for making this a very memorable birthday. All of your stories has really touched my heart. So while I will be back tomorrow to talk and try to help anyone who needs it tomorrow I want to. I dont know leave a message now that I feel I have a platform. No matter how small an act or gesture, it can change the course of someones life whether you know it or not. So if you think something as simple as buying someone a candy bar at work is going to be pointless. It might make them feel wanted and thought about. So just. I dont know. Spread love this month I guess. I'll be back tomorrow! "
I am a Trump 'regretter' and I feel very isolated,"Sounds douchey, I know.. but hear me out-

I'm not sure if I was a victim of trolls and ads or not.  I was all for Bernie, but seeing how the DNC did him really left me stumped.  Between that, the clintons, and the rest of the hogwash that comes with her (read: Debbie wasserman schultz) at the time I truly felt like I was making the 'lesser of two evils' choice.  

I regret that now.  I know that this is bad.   I can't hang with far-right crazy, and I can't go back in time to change my vote.   when people learn and grow, they can admit mistakes.   its better to have someone who knows they were wrong than to have someone defending a lunatic purely to keep up appearances.  

I will be doing my part to right this tomorrow.  Please give people like me a break...without a party to accept them im worried people might just stay on the wrong side.  embrace it.  thanks for reading"
when my doctor sent me home to die," I’ll never forget the first GP my mom dragged me to after she saw the weight loss.

It was years ago. The doctor weighed me and calculated my BMI. 

She told me about a specialized clinic in the hospital. 

Anorexia spoke through my mouth, saying I didn’t want to go.

She said ‘That’s fine, you don’t have to go. You’re not that skinny anyways.”

Yes, she knew my BMI was underweight, but not ‘that’ bad. 

Did she do an evaluation of my mental status? 

No, of course not. I wasn’t skinny enough.

I went home. I lost more weight. I cut and bled and starved and binged and purged.

One year, -10 kilos and 3 fainting spells later, we went to the clinic. 

They said I had acute dehydration (I was too scared to drink water), hypoglycemia,

osteopenia, muscle degeneration, a pericardial effusion, and the beginnings of liver failure.

I was too weak to walk and so they put me in a wheelchair. 

My heart was so slow and potassium deprived, they hooked me up to machines

and woke up 3 times in the night to make sure I hadn’t died in my sleep.

Oh and that’s only the physical stuff.

They saw I bled and cut and starved and binged and purged so they made me better.

They saw my depression, the OCD, the craziness, the fear, the anxiety and they helped me.

I was fed, first through a tube, then through drinks, then solid food.

I gained weight but that was all.

3 months later, I relapsed. I went to the hospital, for even longer this time.

And sometimes I wonder what had happened if, years ago, that doctor told me 

the effects of an eating disorder on my body, and my mind, and my life.

I wish she had told me how sick I was. And not that I was’t skinny enough.

Recently I fainted in school, I had to tell the school nurse that I had anorexia.

She asked me if I was in treatment, I said yes, at the hospital clinic.

She looked me up and down and said she was surprised they had ‘accepted’ me.

So I sat down and I told her everything I and been through. 

&#x200B;

I wonder how many people with eating disorders and psychiatric disorder die each year because they aren't 'sick enough'. It disgusts me enough to never want to see a doctor again. But maybe that's why i'm going to be a psychiatrist. So I can actually help people. Wish me luck."
After 2 years of job hunting i finally doubled my salary!!,Fuck yesssss akahsjwiwnwbw I'm so damn happy. I can finally move out of my mom's house and make fucking money!!! Fuck yesssss. I can leave this shitty job yo!
I strongly suspect my grandparents are planning to commit suicide and I’m kind of okay with it.,"My great grandmother rotted with dementia in a home for over 10 years. We would get a phone call in the middle of the night every so often saying she wouldn’t make it through the night and she always would and it nearly destroyed everyone in our family. From that point on my grandma was honest and upfront about wanting to die with dignity. She’s since lost her sight, a leg, and any semblance of independence in her long list of ailments (diabetes, heart condition, strokes). My grandfather beat prostrate cancer once already and has spent the last 15 years taking care of my grandmother through all her health troubles. Recently a Supreme Court decision allowed the company he retired from to discontinue their “lifetime” health coverage. My father has also recently moved from across the street from them to another state. This week they started dropping off boxes of my childhood toys and mementos from their house into my garage siting that they are cleaning out their house. I don’t think I’m reaching too far with thinking I know what’s coming. I’m not going to try to stop them. But I think I’ll be visiting more frequently with my small children, making sure I take pictures, and letting them know I love them. "
I got genital herpes when I was 13 years old.,"I lost my virginity while simultaneously getting herpes when I was 13. My older sister guilt tripped me into telling my parents that I had it (as she was in the doctor's office with me). She believes that kids shouldn't hide anything from their parents.

My narcissistic step dad called me all the promiscuous names (euphemism) and told me that he personally would NEVER date a woman who had herpes. He told me good luck finding someone who would ever love me. My mom proceeded to beat me with a stick she found in the garage. My sister provided no emotional support. My at-the-time boyfriend proceeded to post all about how he didn't have herpes on Facebook (despite how I told him to keep it between us and how he was the only person I ever slept with).

That fucked me up for a very long time. I was extremely suicidal and self harmed for a few years. But on the bright side, I no longer talk to any of the aforementioned people and am extremely happy with my life now. I'm going to to the school of my dreams on a full ride and can't ever consider killing myself like I did as a kid. 

Edit: I don't want to be that person but I'm going to be that person. This post blew up way more than I thought I would. I really appreciate all of the support I've gotten from everyone. I'm also really happy that we can all learn a thing or two about this shitty stigma. "
To the guy I had sex with last night,"Thank you! You made me feel sexy and wanted. After my sexual assault I thought I wouldn’t be able to enjoy sex again, that it would always make me scared and self conscious, but you changed that. You made me feel good about myself and my body. You were happy for me to take control and without even knowing it you gave me back my power. It feels fucking fantastic and even though we’re casual I will forever be grateful.

Edit: thank you all for such nice comments! "
I learned today that my 14yo daughter has been so depressed that she's contemplated suicide multiple times.,"I'll call her Jane. That's not her real name. Jane was born without a thyroid gland. There was a lot of medical appointments when she was an infant and toddler. She has to take a synthetic thyroid pill every day. Not so bad. As the pediatric endocrinologist told us days after she was born: ""No parent wants their child to be born with a disease, but if you have to have a child born with a disease, you should pick this one because it only means she has to take a pill every day for the rest of her life. Otherwise, she'll have a perfectly normal life.""

So at 14, she needs a blood test to determine her thyroid hormone levels every six months: That happens to be March and September for her. Because of the way that health care works in the US, I have to take her to her primary care doctor each time in order for him to tell my insurance company to pay for the upcoming blood test.

Today, during Jane's checkup (but after a long conversation about her menstrual cycles), the doctor said, I need you to leave the room now. Thinking myself a savvy and cool father, I figured this is when the the physician asks my daughter if she's sexually active. As I left the room, I said, ""Jane, if the doctor writes you any prescriptions that you are embarrassed by, then I will not ask any questions."" There's no more direct way of indirectly saying, ""I won't judge you for being sexually active if the doc says you need birth control pills."" Right?

So after 10 minutes in the room where I waited while the doc chatted with Jane, the doc came in, and closed the door. ""I need to speak with you, Mr. Doe."" Now, I'm not the type that deludes himself into thinking that his daughter will wait until marriage... or even perhaps to 18. 14 is a whole different ball game. My heart lept with fear that Jane was sexually active.

That's when she showed me the paper that she had been carriying. There was nothing on it about sex. The whole form was about depression. I glanced at the questions about depression in which she usually checked off the category, ""multiple times every day"". My eyes suddenly became fixed on the two questions at the bottom of the page:

1. I have thought about suicide? (the YES box is checked)
2. I have thought about how to commit suicide? (the YES box is checked)
In the notes section for question 2: ""I thought about stabbing myself with a kitchen knife.""

Now look, I've got a plan that I've started in conjunction with her doctor that involves psychologists, possibly psychiatrists and anti-depressant drugs, more frequent well-checks with the PCP, and even a vacation to her favorite place ($700 plane ticket) with her favorite cousin over winter break. I knew she was embarrassed, so I told her how I have had the same thoughts, and needed to be on prescriptions for those thoughts since returning from Iraq in 2006. The point of this paragraph is that I don't need advice. I am confident in my plans. Support is nice, but as the name of the subreddit suggests, I'm just getting this off my chest.

If you've read this far, then thank you."
My best friend from kindergarten had cancer. I saw him at the grocery store completely healthy,"For the two years I've been in kindergarten (I was crying when my mom wasn't around me) I had around 3 good friends. One of them, let's call him Gabe, didn't have hair. My child brain thought that he was born without hair or he lost it in an accident. I didn't ask because I didn't want to be rude. 

We had fun. We caught worms and snails, played with Hot Wheels and Legos, generally a great buddy to play with. After I finished kindergarten I never heard from him again.

After some years I realised that he didn't have hair because of cancer. I cried 10 minutes about it, that poor child of 5 already struggled with cancer...

And then, I found him at the supermarket, buying vodka. When I realised that this was Gabe, I was shocked. It was weird and cool to see a childhood friend but this different. I talked to him about 5 minutes and found out that...

...he was getting the vodka to celebrate 10 years cancer free. 

Edit: Woah, my first gold! Thank you kind stranger!"
I couldn't care less that XXXtentacion died.,"The guy was known to beat his former significant others and even tried to walk away from it like it didn't matter. As someone who had their own mother abused by their piece of shit father, I can't stand up for anyone like him. I don't care if people ""liked his music"" or ""we should only remember the good a person has done"", there isn't enough good this guy did to overcome the negative he projected. He's everything I hated in a person and everything people needed to see to what a piece of shit human he was. I don't care about his career; I couldn't give two shits whether it was good or not to others (it wasn't). 

No amount of deeds he did would outshine how much of a terrible person he lead in his life. No one deserves to die, no one deserves to be shot point blank in broad daylight only to have onlookers just to have their last moments being snapchatted as they're dying. My condolences to his family and friends, but it'll still never change who he was and who he could have been. I'm not saying my life is a damn walk in the park or even be called a saint. But never have I thought for a moment to beat my pregnant girlfriend, slander women, and deny something that could change my life around if I just admitted my faults."
To the tire store employee who helped me on December 24th 2009,"I'll never forget you.

That was one of the biggest snow seasons our area had seen in quite a few years. I had spent every dime I had to purchase that brand new set of studded snow tires the previous week. No one expected the snow to stick, let alone stick around for the better part of the month.  I didn't have much money, and had to buy them unplanned so I could be sure my daughter would be safe when we drove to and from school, and so I could even get out and about as the roads were such a mess.

When I pulled in with the rear left completely flat, you asked me how long it had been driven on like that. I was honest with you. A long way. I had no way to remove it, the roads were a mess and down to one lane in most places. In the middle of many heavy snowfalls that month, it getting dark out, and with my daughter in the car, I had to just keep driving to get us somewhere safe, and warm, where we could figure out what to do.

We warmed up in the lobby. When you rolled that tire inside and your manager showed me the damage from driving on it flat, as well as the piece of metal you pulled out, I was shocked. He explained that it couldn't be saved. Driving on it flat had destroyed it. I hadn't purchased the extended warranty and needed to buy a new tire.

I don't know what you saw in my eyes as I stood there after you told me that, but I feel like somehow you knew the situation I was in from that glance. 

A newly single father to a five year old girl. Someone struggling to make ends meet. Someone who didn't have a pot to piss in, let alone the money to even buy a nice set of tires like that to begin with. Someone who was going hungry every night, watching my daughter eat dinner, and lying through clenched teeth that I had already eaten, so she should go ahead and I'll just sit with her. Someone who had spent every penny I had that month. Someone who was feeling more hopeless than ever in that moment.

You asked me to hold on for a minute, and you disappeared into the back with my tire through the door your manager had walked through. 

You came back a moment later without the tire.  I'll never forget trying not to break down and cry, as you told me it was obvious it was a defective tire. That it was flawed from the factory. That the hunk of metal that had pierced it, and the shredded rubber from me driving on it flat had nothing to do with the issue. That you were going to replace it for free then and there.

I don't know if you paid for it, or if you convinced the boss to replace it. I don't know why you wouldn't look me in the eye as I stood there trying to keep back tears, my 5 year old daughter hanging off me oblivious. Maybe it was because you didn't want us to be a couple of guys having a cry together in the tire store during your busiest time of the year. Whatever the case is, I want you to know, you saved me that day. Saved me from the hopelessness I was feeling. Restored my faith in humanity just when I was feeling as down as I had ever been. Saved me from myself since I was at the end of my rope.

I want you to know, I've paid it forward ever since. Helping stranded motorists. Changing tires, giving jump starts, giving rides to people out of gas.  I even gave an elderly woman a ride later that week. She was waiting for the bus in knee deep snow trying to go to the library, and I pulled over and offered her a lift.

I want you to know that life is good now. I'm financially secure, everyone is healthy, happy and well fed. 

I want you to know, I'll never forget you."
I hit the 100k salary mark!,"Hi Reddit, 

I (24, F) hit a huge milestone in my career this week. I got a raise that put me over the 100k salary mark!!!!!

I work in IT,  more specifically data mining.  It is a primarily Male field, and I only learned SQL a couple years ago so I would have never imagined I would be this successful. My whole life, I have over compensated for my lack of intelligence with a great work ethic and it finally paid off! I am so proud of myself. 

Unfortunately, I feel money is a touchy subject and this is not something I can share my excitement about in real life.

Edit: Wow, thank you all so much for the kind words and taking time to celebrate this with me!! I am trying to go through and reply to you all as fast as I can, but just know I am truly grateful for all you kind internet people! :)

Edit 2: 
As far as learning SQL, my favorite online resources to get started are:

This is 20 years too late. ,"Hello everyone. This is a rather tragic story. It will not be suitable for light hearts. It's my deepest, most darkest history, which led to my own near-death many, many times. 

20 years ago, Germany, 1993. I was 20 years old. I had two sons. Their names will stay with me. But I will provide aliases. My youngest, Mathieu, was 14 months old. And his older brother Sam, 2 years of age. Mathieu was the happiest of children. He would smile at you even if he didn't know who you were. He was the sweetest, happiest little boy to ever cross into my life. Both of my sons were all I needed and wanted. My wife and I were 18 when she got pregnant. She was so happy, that I couldn't even grimace. I swore my self to her and married her when she was 6 months pregnant with my Sam. She was so beautiful then. Her smile could make a well kept man go mental. She was an extraordinary specimen. 

                         The Incident. 

 It was a freezing winter's morning. 19°F.  The roads were slick; the people's coats were packed on like the snow blankets covering the ground. I had work at 9 am that morning. I awoke to Mathieu; crying. It was 8:43. I had to be at work in 17 minutes. My boss had a no tolerance policy and would dock your pay for too many tardinesses. I knew I couldn't be late. 

 I got my son and myself ready and was out of the door by 8:51. I was rushing my son and I to my mother's house, time was ticking. My lateness was inevitable. My speed picked up as my worries did. As soon as I realized, I was going 50mph in a 30mph. I had no time to stop. I skidded over the crosswalk line into oncoming traffic. I whizzed by every other car coming from side to side. But instead I was headed for a large industrial truck. My whole life flashed before me, time was going extremely slow. I felt as if I was the Grim Reaper, watching this ordeal from an orb of some sort. And *I* chose my fate. I came back to reality to see me nearing the truck. I maneuvered my truck to hit my side of the his. Hoping to save me from my son's injury. It was no use. I survived, woke up in a hospital some time later with a broken  femur and head trauma. My son's neck was broken from the impact. He died instantly. 

I remember telling the nurse ""I want to see my son. I need to know he's okay."" She looked away, hiding her tears, and replied. ""Your son is no longer with us. He died instantly from the crash. I'm sorry"" I.. I honestly could not explain the feelings after that. To know that it was your fault. You killed your own son because you didn't want to be late for work. You didn't want to get yelled at by your boss. Like your job is worth taking your own son's life. After that day, my whole life changed. My wife blamed me and left without a trace. The next time I saw her, was 16 years later. She was sitting in a casket. She died from a fall while mountain climbing. The last time I saw her alive. She was crying and yelling at me, she wanted me to take my son's place. And frankly, I did too. I still do. 

Since then, I've had 3 suicide attempts, several broken bones. I sliced two of my fingers clean off. (Irrelevant, it was from an office guillotine.) Many run ins with the law, and overall, a broken, beaten, shrivelled up heart. A heart that is set in stone. And unmendable heart. 

He would've been 21. I could've taken him and my eldest son out for a beer, like good men. And we would be a family. I would've still had my wife. I knew she loved adventure, and I wouldn't have let her go mountain climbing. I still love my wife. I still think about we everyday. And I wish I could go back and fix all of this. But I can't. You never can. Life gives you the worst options, and you have to deal with them, or die. It's one feeling knowing that someone died because if you, it's a whole other, morbid feeling to know that it your own son. And that of a toddler. 

Though I shed many tears as I wrote this, it feels so amazing to just scream it all. The weight of this will only be lifted when I take my final breath. But only with the support of my remaining son, and my will to live, I will remain. Thank you all for reading. 

Regards, Mathias. "
An older man offered me cash for my virginity and I took him up on it...,"I’m 19, trim, fit, and traditionally attractive by most standards. 

Im a part time student. I have a few ways to make money. But my primary gig is working the desk at a high end hotel. I figured that looks better on my resume. It’s the the type of place that costs too much because of location and because it’s frequented by business travelers and I’m required to wear a jacket, blouse, and slacks or skirt. It’s a good, professional look and I get a lot of male attention. 

Sometimes too much. I’ve been propositioned more than once.  Sometimes for dates. Often more direct “will you come to my room” type offers. They’re almost never the type of men who would appeal to a young woman. 

But recently it was from a guy in his mid-30s (I’ve seen his ID). He’s European. He’s been in a few times. He obviously successful. He always gets a room high up and they cost substantially more. He’s asked me up to his room in a joking way a few times. I flirt (not just with him, I like when customers mention me to management). But I’ve never acted. But this time he came in and said he’s had a horrible day of travel and been delayed all day and was next to someone with body odor on a long flight. He outright told me if I’d come to his room after my shift then he’d give me $500. 

I tried to play it off and told him he could probably find a pro. He said he didn’t want someone who fucks for a living. And he didn’t want a dirty stripper that everyone has touched. He wanted someone innocent and young with a good job. And if I came up To his room could have the cash even if nothing happened. 

Again I played it off. He opened his billfold and started counting off hundreds. 

Then I told him I just couldn’t because I’m a virgin. 

He immediately offered $2k. I think my eyes popped out of head. But my gut reaction was to say no. 

He offered $2500 and then $3k. I was stunned. And then he said the offer stands all week. Three thousand, but I had to spend the night and give him my virginity. 

I thought about it for 24 hours and decided to go through with it. I didn’t see him that day, but the next day I caught him walking in and told him I was willing but it couldn’t be at the hotel where I worked because there are too many ways I could get caught and lose my job. He agreed on going elsewhere. Then he slipped me $200 to buy “adult lingerie” and a good dress. 

At the planned time I met him at a different hotel in his room wearing a new dress and a lingerie set from VS. We had room service in his suite. 

Then we had sex. He was gentle. Then we did some other stuff and more sex. Then repeated again. In the morning he handed me an envelope with $3k in hundred dollar bills and said he hadn’t been with a virgin in a long time and loved it. Then I left, showered at home, and put his cash in the bank. 

It was a good experience. I don’t have any regrets. I could use the money. The only thing is...I wasn’t really a virgin. And...when I’m not in school or at the hotel I work part time as “a dirty stripper...”"
"I know parenting is hard, but if your kids are being terrible and someone complains, your answer should not be ""mind your own fucking business""","My ex took our 2 year old to the park so I could get some much needed study time. Our county park has a sprinkler area that's mostly for toddlers and little kids. For the most part, everything was fine.

Then a mother and her 3 sons arrive, the youngest of whom apparently looked like he could be 11. Mom sits herself at the nearby sitting area facing away from the sprinklers so she can play on her phone. The boys start roughhousing, wind up hitting one kid and almost hitting our daughter. The family of the kid who got hit don't notice and don't care, but my daughter is scared and runs to her dad. 

Her dad, understandably upset, goes up to the mother and says, ""excuse me, your sons hit one kid and almost hit my daughter. Could you watch your children?""

As the title says her response was, ""why don't you mind your own fucking business?""

Now parenthood sucks. You're tired all the time and with three rowdy boys, I can only imagine how amazing a little me-time where you get a moment to unwind. But you don't get to check out of being a parent and you damn sure don't get to pretend there aren't consequences to your kids' actions.  

Boy, sometimes I hate other parents."
I just found out my boyfriend of 5 months is married and my best friend knew all along.,"So last year my best friend asked me to accompany her to visit her boyfriend for a few days. He had a roommate so she took me along. Once I met him, we immediately hit it off and had a great time for the two days we stayed over. After returning to my place we kept in touch constantly and after a few months became official.

I was so deeply into this guy and honestly thought he was the one. Last night there was a photo of him tagged on Facebook with another lady holding a baby, and all the comments are complimenting them on  what a wonderful family it is. I was a bit confused so I asked my friend and she goes ""Oh yeah _her guy_ told me he has a wife he's hardly committed to and a kid""

My head was spinning, I can hardly think or do anything. It's so painful I never knew I would be this affected. I've confronted the guy and he's so apologetic claiming he never really got the right time to tell me.

I'm so pissed off at both my friend and the guy I've cut ties with both of them. My friend's excuse is that she thought it was his place to tell me. What kind of an excuse is that?

I don't know how to move on and seriously needed to get that off my chest."
I just left my wife. And I feel 100% fine about it.,"I have a Reddit account, however I thought I'd use a throwaway for this one. 

Ten years ago I thought I had the perfect life. Upper six-figure job, beautiful wife, clean house, two new cars, and a child on the way. My job made me happy and I was good at it, and the stability was great. My wife loved me for me and ignored my flaws as I tried to perfect them. In return, I adored her and we seemed to be the perfect couple. People would always compliment us, and talk about how envious they were of our relationship and everything.

It kept getting better. I kept getting promotions, the kids (now 3) were born, and we eventually moved from an ordinary house to an incredibly nice one. My wife was doing very well in her career (optometrist), and we took fun vacations every year. Again, I thought I had it made. 

I don't know how this would have prompted it, but in early 2015, I bought her a Tesla, for her birthday. She hadn't gotten a new car since 2008, and I kept getting new cars, therefore I surprised her. She loved it, loved me, and I remember spending that entire day just taking rides in it and figuring out how all of the gadgets and icons worked. 

It was complete downhill from there. I don't know how that would have triggered anything, but in the months following, she became increasingly distant from not only me, but our children. My oldest (10, F) in particular, felt hurt by this and would often try to ensue conversations with her mother, in order to get her talking. Some days this would work and she would be pleasant, others it would have the opposite effect. 

The first time I suspected that I was no longer her man of choice was in July 2016 when I noticed she was no longer going to yoga classes, but telling me she was. We were on the same phone plan, and part of that plan was we could see our locations of our phones. I was routinely browsing the app one day, and noticed she appeared to be at someone's house. Since she had been irrationally angry that day prior to leaving, I didn't question her about it when she got home from ""yoga."" Instead, I chose to closely observe where she went during her ""yoga"" times. It would always seem to end up at the same house - a well-off neighborhood (probably a step above ours) a little north of town. 

I was getting ready to confront her when I noticed that she had been returning to yoga again. During this period, she became incredibly distant, and hormonal. My entire family had noticed this behavior going on for over a year now, but I had had enough. I sat her down, and asked her what was going on. She gave me the cold shoulder, and when I questioned her about the yoga locations, she accused me of stalking, invading privacy, and being a ""grade-A dick."" 

That's when I asked her: ""are you cheating on me?"" Of course, the answer was no. What followed in the weeks to come was distrust, hatred, and plain anger towards me. It was clear she knew I had caught on, and was now trying to play the ""I-can't-believe-you'd-think-this"" victim card. But I knew. I saw through it all.

When she finally admitted she had seen and slept with another man, that's when I made my mistake. I forgave her. She told me she loved me, she loved our family, and in that moment, I believed her. I thought she could change. I was wrong. 

We tried marriage therapy. We tried taking adult days. It seemed to work. We were happy, and she was genuinely having fun and it seemed like I had the old her back. I was relieved, this allowed me to pour more time into my kids and my work, and have less stress overall. 

My business trip to San Diego (I live on the East Coast, USA) was cut short when my colleague fell ill, and our clients insisted that we reschedule. It was a hassle, but I we caught the next flight out, and returned home. 

I'm not sure why I didn't tell her I was coming home, but I just didn't. Maybe I wanted it to be a surprise? The only surprise I received when I pulled into the driveway was seeing a Ford SUV in my garage, and finding not one, but TWO men in my bed. With my wife. 

This all happened yesterday. I'm finally putting it into words. My wife started babbling when it happened, desperately trying to explain. I heard none of it. I walked out of my room, went to the basement, and poured myself a drink. I could hear the men upstairs leaving, and when I returned upstairs, it was my wife sitting there, clothed, with a sad smile on her face. 

She started talking, but I wouldn't have it. I told her to get out. I told her to get out of my house. I informed her that I'd get her stuff to her by the end of the week. She tried to pull the ""what-about-the-kids"" bullshit, but I was just done. I'm sad, but not for her. I'm sad for my kids, and I'm sad for whatever poor soul she meets next. 

I will fight hard for my kids, but my biggest fear is losing them. I know the court will rule incredibly in favor of mothers. I hope they realize that I've spent the last three years doing my best to mend a broken marriage for my family, and nothing has worked. 

I told my kids this morning. They asked why mom didn't spend the night last night. I didn't make them go to school today, they're all upstairs together. This whole situation is terrible for everyone involved, and it could have been completely preventable. 

I don't pity my wife. I hope that she has one label for the rest of her life - cheater. I want it to follow her. I want people to know. She is a prominent optometrist in our area, this could very well hurt her business if word spreads, which it very well may.

Thank you all for listening. If you have undergone something similar, I'd love to chat. 



**Edit:** What a wave of support! Wow! I will try and get back to all of your comments, please forgive me if I do not. This makes me feel a lot better. I've never been gilded before!"
"I grew up in a far-right military family believing the US was by far the best place to live. After travel, I learned I was very wrong","I spent the last few weeks traveling around Europe. I won't get into the details since that's more suited for a travel forum but needless to say it was one of the best decisions I ever made and it was the first time I left the US. 

I have a great job with lots of vacation time saved up, and a woman I love who is in similar circumstances. She's more of a free-spirit than I am and she wanted to spend our planned vacation going from town to town in Europe while I was content spending a weekend away at a nearby beach. She won. 

I grew up believing the US was perfect in about every aspect. I'm not military much to my dad's disappointment but he was along with both of my grandfathers. We were told to love Reagan, we had flags, we stood proudly during the anthem during the sporting events, we supported the Iraq war 100%, and my father thinks the NFL is a traitorous organization. Anything that questions American superiority should be silenced right away, blah blah. I just kind of grew up thinking the same thing though not as strongly. I seriously believed pretty much every other place on the planet is a bit of a shithole and I'm living the best life any human can. 

I know I was on vacation and that provides a different perspective on life than a resident, but getting to know people outside of the US on a personal level and how they live, I can't say for sure anymore the US is ""#1"" anymore. I've seen cultures not driven by excess and greed, not succumbing to obesity and stress at an early age, who believe that the group is stronger than the individual. I've seen impressive infrastructure, what can happen when the governments work for the people. I'd much rather be able to read a few chapters on a train to work than be stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic for 90 minutes a day. When I went through borders and security at train stations and airports I wasn't treated like a potential criminal like the TSA but I was treated like a human. Countries outside the free travel zone let us enter their country with a quick check, but when I was entering my own country I had to fill out a long two-page form and get asked about ten questions by a border security guy just drooling to bust someone for committing a minor crime. 

I was told by my family visiting Europe was a mistake. They spewed some talking points fed to them by people with an agenda. They thought I'd be murdered due to all this sudden and rampant crime over there. They wanted me to be very careful in London, a city they believe you can't go out in after dark (beautiful city, lovely people, never once felt unsafe). Sadly I bought into their warnings and when I first arrived I was on edge, but very shortly after I relaxed and so glad I did. 

I can't imagine those places are perfect, no place is perfect. I do think overall quite a few of the places we visited offers a higher quality of life than I maintain in the US and I'm considered to be pretty successful by US standards. "
I made my father cry,"Have to start off by saying that my dad is a rock. In a family with a history of mental illness and addiction, he has always been steadfast, never losing his cool, never losing control. He holds the family together. 

And yesterday I made him cry. After being homebound for 3 years, struggling with severe depression and anxiety, I finally got myself a part time job in a children daycare. I got a text from my boss yesterday, because they wanted to commend me for how good I am with the kids, and how happy they are to have me onboard. I read the text aloud to my dad, and he started crying. He hugged me and told me how proud he is of me. The only other time I’ve seen him cry was when I tried to commit suicide. I feel accomplished and happy for the first time in many years. 

Thank you for reading.

My family cannot afford a graphing calculator and while I tried to tell the teacher my problem **in private** he uses me as an example and announces to the whole class ""If you cannot afford a graphing calculator like ponytailparade, then get a job or find someone who will let you share"". Just because I'm a junior does not mean I am old enough to get a job and you had no right to announce my inability to buy something to the *whole class*. You suck. 

UPDATE: Wow I really did not expect so many people would read this. Instead of telling the principal I told my counselor about it since I always tell her a problem I'm having. She switching my teachers and is going to make sure Mr. Teacher from hell knows exactly why. Victory! All of you guys are awesome by the way I got a good laugh from some of your comments thank you!

EDIT: to everyone telling me to stop whining because I'm using a smartphone or laptop, I would like to point out that I am posting this from an IPad that I **won** for **free**.

THE CALCULATOR JUST ARRIVED :D http://m.imgur.com/wthwd5h 

Thank you norms0028 and everyone else who offered, just the offer itself means a lot to me. Thank you guys!!!!"
Something my ex-band member said to me last night has me rattled.,"They use Reddit, and to be honest, if they're reading, good.

They were my friend in addition to band member. I was ""fired"", in very vague terms, and replaced by a 60 year alcoholic (I am 24). I started my own band and reworked a song that I had presented to them into my new band.

I log on Facebook yesterday with an essay of a message, about how I need to remove it from our Demo, how I'll be sued if I use it as ""they did the work, I just played a few chords"". 

At the end of this message was the line that really got me --

""Don't pretend this is an original [my name] composition. We all know you aren't good enough to write a song that good.""

I took the song down, why? Because I spoke to my father, who I trust and he told me in no less words, ""Be the bigger man and let them get what they want this time, their time will come soon"". I didn't want an unnecessary issue -- I have enough.

But you know I said ....

You say I'm not good enough to write a song and that's your biggest flaw. I wish you success, and I wish success on myself.

Today I wrote a new song. And every fucking day now I will write a song, until one day I write the greatest song you've ever heard. I won't crush you with my fists, or in some petty claims court, no fuck that.

I will crush you where it hurts. Where you think you are best.

Watch me. 

Edit: This got much more attention I had anticipated. Thanks everyone.

I joined Reddit a year ago to find grief support because I found my boyfriend passed away and a year later I am actually very happy,"I didn’t think I was going to make it a year after I found him dead from an overdose. Now I have over two years sober, two wonderful puppies, a boyfriend who I can trust, and much more. 

Thank you Reddit for saving me from a path of destruction and offering me a community to feel safe in. "
I hate being a mom,"I don't know where to start. But I'm hoping someone else on here can at least understand what I'm feeling without judging me or telling me things like ""You don't know how lucky you are; a lot of people can't even have kids!"" I know. And although I should be completely over the moon about my awesome kid, I'm just...not. 

It started with the pregnancy. The second I found out I was pregnant, I had a strange feeling. Not the one of excitement or a bit scared, but that I didn't want it. Deep in my gut, I knew I made a terrible decision to get pregnant. My husband and I agreed to try, though I was still on the fence. I also didn't think I could get pregnant because I had horrible problems with ovarian cysts my whole life and doctors told me I wouldn't be able to get pregnant past 30 (there were other reasons too but I won't get into them). I was 34, so I figured, what the hell, we'll try (he really REALLY wanted kids), and when I can't have them at least we'll say we tried. Well, turns out it only took ONE TRY. One. I know. Most people would consider that so incredibly lucky, and trust me I am well aware of the people out there who struggle with infertility. 

As the weeks went on I struggled with absolutely terrible morning sickness until about week 22. That's a long time, especially HOW sick I was. Around week 22/23 I started to feel a little better, especially because I knew I was more than halfway done with that hellish experience. At week 28 I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes and was back and forth to doctors every five seconds. I felt like a science experiment. 

I was induced at 41 weeks and only pushed for 12 minutes. He came out in 5 pushes. Again, I know. Luckiest person on the planet especially because I had an epidural that worked like a charm. But the second I held him I didn't want him. I wanted to give him back. I felt no emotional connection. Nothing. And then I hemorrhaged. And then I developed eclampsia, which is high blood pressure after birth. It was the most hellish three days of my life, thinking I was going to have a seizure or stroke and possibly die. Finally when I got released from the hospital on a myriad of medications, I didn't want to be there at all. It wasn't the same home.

It wasn't the home of cooking all-day meals, spontaneous trips to the wineries, sitting and reading a book for hours. I didn't realize I actually cared about any of these things until they were gone. And that gut feeling of not wanting  a baby only got worse. 

In the next weeks and months I struggled with what was eventually diagnosed with postpartum depression and postpartum PTSD. It was absolutely terrible and I contemplated suicide many times. The lack of sleep paired with those things made me feel like a complete lunatic. My marriage suffered, and I believe my husband and I will never be the same because of what occurred in those months with my emotions.

Fast forward to today. My husband does SO MUCH to help me. He's there every second I need him and works right down the road, so he can be home in a second if I truly need something. My parents watch my son one day and my in-laws another day. But it's not enough. I don't want to be around him. I'm bored to tears playing toddler games and even going to the playground and stuff with him. I'm looking at my watch every five seconds. 

Part of the problem is that I work from home. I was very, very talented and successful in my office job, which eventually converted to a work-at-home position. So by default, I became a stay-at-home mom. Let me make one thing clear: I NEVER EVER EVER wanted to be a stay-at-home mom. I made this very clear from the beginning, and I absolutely said I would never do it. I'm not cut out for it. And here I am. Sitting home with him, day after day. We do tons of things. He takes gym classes, art classes, we play outside all the time, go on outings, go to the food store. He's clean and well-fed and loved and always entertained and happy. He really is a great kid. 

But I HATE THIS. Like with every fiber of my being. Hate it. The sleep transitions, the teething, the not wanting to eat the food I make, the tantrums, everything. Like literally everything you can think about having a kid, I hate it. And the noise. OMG the noise. The tantrums, the kid songs that make you go insane.... I just can't anymore. 

I feel like being a mom brings out all of my worst personality traits. I didn't even KNOW I was impatient, but apparently I am! I get so frustrated with him so quickly, and I have silent little anxiety attacks while I discipline him or deal with whatever is going on. 

I just am so surprised - and weighed down - by the responsibility. I am one of the most responsible people on the planet. Always early to things, always organized, always on top of stuff. I have a dog, who I got as a puppy and I take a lot of pride in training her and being her dog mom. I have nieces who I take care of from time to time and I take what I say and do around them very seriously. And my job is extremely integrated with other people and working with teams. I am a director, so a lot of people rely on me. But SHIT. This is too much. Being responsible for a little human being, and every single thing I say is going to affect them in some way??? No thank you. It is a weight that is suffocating me every second of the day. And I wasn't expecting that. On paper, I should actually be a great mom. But I'm really not.

And I don't know what to do. I went to therapy, was on medication, everything. But I feel like the only thing that would truly make me happy would be to go back to work full-time in an office job. Right now I piece together my work. When he's napping - if he naps - at night, early in the morning. I can never concentrate and what was once a bright and lucrative career now leaves me stressed out and awake at 3 a.m. wondering how I'm going to get my work done. I can't concentrate and its like he needs something every other second. I keep waiting to like it. I keep waiting to feel something. But I don't. 

And don't get me wrong. When he hurts himself or cries from being sad, my heart breaks. When my parents pull away with him in the car and I see his little face in the back seat I miss him. But then...he gets back and I'm like...when can he go over their house again???? It is truly the strangest feeling. I'm confused. And if anything ever, EVER happened to him I don't know what I do. He is a sweet, gentle, loving, kooky kid. Always laughing and smiling, and I make sure to give him tons of hugs and kisses every single day and tell him I love him. I don't ever want him to know these things I'm saying here. 

Thank you for listening, whoever is out there. I pray you will not judge me. My husband is absolutely wonderful, but he hates when I try to talk about this kind of thing. We've always been very open about all of our feelings and issues, but he gets so angry when I try to tell him that I really truly don't like this. He doesn't believe me and says ""You make yourself not like it."" I'm not sure what to think about that. But alas. "
"Brother exposed to my extremely religious family, out of revenge, that I'm not Muslim, and has ruined my life. But some good came out of it.","I'm a 21 year old college student.  

&nbsp;

Older brother has known I'm not Muslim for a while, and we come from an extremely religious family. We got into a fight a month ago and, to exact the dirtiest possible revenge against me, he called my parents and told them everything: how I drink occasionally, party and befriend women (how awful, right?), and don't believe in god. 

&nbsp;

Now my family has disowned me; my mom has been crying for the past few weeks, dad told me on the phone to NEVER: come back home, speak to my 2 sweet younger siblings whom I love dearly, speak to my mother. Also, my father was helping pay off my tuition and my housing, now he's cut me off. Thanks to my brother. Tried calling dad but he's blocked me, same with mom. Won't let me talk to the siblings in any shape or form. Had several terrible panic attacks and frequent mental breakdowns. 

&nbsp;

Anyways, went to a close friend's party 2 weeks afterwards. Wasn't planning on going, but decided to go anyways after friend insisted I'd feel better; what'll you have it, I met a girl from Malawi. We seriously hit it off, for the first time in 2 weeks had some mental clarity. I got her number, and we went on a date the next day. We were going back to her place, then my brother called and humiliated me; somehow he knew what I was doing, and I've no idea how (if anyone has any idea how this could be, please tell me, I can provide more info privately).  

&nbsp;

After being screamed at and told I was a piece of shit, I hung up and tried to tell her what happened, but instead broke down heaving and crying in front of her. She didn't say a word, put her arms around me, and let me sob on her shoulder while patting my back. Keep in mind this was the second day since we'd met. 

&nbsp;

She wasn't weirded out about the incident at all, and was so unbelievably gentle and compassionate about it all. Since then, she's been messaging me every day sending me depressing 2meirl4meirl memes (well-meaning in a hilariously inappropriate way), keeping tabs on me and making sure I'm okay, inviting me over to her place and just cuddling and relaxing with one another. She's always smiling, optimistic for no reason, and just a dancy, awesome person. I'm so fucking relieved that someone so great made it into my life, and at quite possibly the most necessary timing possible. I have no idea what I'm going to do about my family that has derided and abandoned me, or my mentally abusive, manipulative helicopter brother, but at least I found someone to help me forget about it all. 

&nbsp;

EDIT: Appreciate everything u guys are saying, for both the advice and the well-wishes. Genuinely, thank you.  
Not hating on Islam, and my parents aren't shitty to be clear, my brother is. My parents are actually great, hard-working people. But Muslim parents finding out their kid drinks and has a girlfriend is almost the equivalent of a white person's parents finding out their kid does heroin. I disagree with their reaction, but I can totally understand why they're acting this way.  
Also, I meant this post as optimistic in spite of all the garbage that has been happening. I already have a plan for paying off my final semester, getting support from amazing friends, cutting off ties entirely with family (not with my younger siblings though), finding a job, etc. 
"
I stopped putting my mom as my emergency contact because I didn't want her to be the first notified when I killed myself. Today I put her as my emergency contact again for the first time in years.,"TW: abuse and suicide

From October 2015 to the end of June 2017 I was in a relationship with a horrifying man. He was a sadistic, sociopathic rapist who seemed to take special pleasure in driving me to kill myself. 

One night in April 2017 I told him I was going to kill myself with the bottle of pain killers we kept in the bathroom. I described exactly how I would, and I told him I'd do it with barbiturates but I couldn't afford them so I was going to swallow the bottle of painkillers instead. I told him I was going to do it tonight and that he needed to contact my therapist immediately. He shoved me, shouted ""Jesus Christ"", and then went to go play video games with our roommate. They turned the volume as high as it could go but I could still hear them laughing. I didn't take the pills. My best friend talked me out of it. I fell asleep but woke up multiple times that night to my ex biting me as hard as he could. I still had bite marks the next day. When I asked him why he bit me, he told me, ""I thought you killed yourself. I was checking if you were still alive."" 

That was when I knew he wanted me dead. 

I was suicidal long before that night and until the end of our relationship. Even after I left him, I would have episodes where I would figure out what pills I had in the house and then look up how long it would take for me to die from swallowing all of them. I also looked up how much of a mess it would make. I didn't want my roommates to have to clean up a room full of shit and vomit after the paramedics put me in a body bag. That usually happened when I screwed something up. But I haven't had an episode like that since November. 

During this time, whenever I had to fill out emergency contact information on anything, I would never put anyone in my family. My mom had always been my emergency contact up until this time. But I stopped putting her on there. Before I was born, she lost my half brother when he was two years old. Her mom, my grandmother, put him in bed for a nap one morning and he never woke up. My mom's the one who found his body. No one comforted her and everyone blamed her, even though his death wasn't anyone's fault. 

I didn't want my mom to have to relive that. I didn't want her to be the first person in the world who knew I was dead. I knew she would have to find out eventually, but I wanted her to find out from someone who loves her. Not from a stranger. 

But today I was filling out an application for a master's in law program, and I just finished filling out the emergency contact information when I realized I put my mom's name down. I realized it's been a long time since I wanted to kill myself. I'm not actively worried anymore of her being told that I died because, short of some accident, that's not a likely possibility. 

I just wanted to put this out there. "
My mom might be brain dead.,"This post will be scattered, and absolutely deleted when I wake up.

Monday, December 17, 2018, at around 3:40ish p.m, I had just grabbed my work clothes, and peered into my mom's room, to find her having a heart attack, or stroke, or.. something. Doctors still aren't sure.

Today, Monday, December 24th, 2018, she is still not awake. She is diabetic. Her kidneys aren't functional. She's on continuous dialysis. If she makes it through this, she absolutely will lose one or both feet. Her lungs aren't working properly. Today, she is supposed to have a test done to see if there is any brain activity. 
And, our landlord texted us. We are extremely late on rent. He is preparing eviction papers.
These last 7 days have felt.. unreal. Like I'm in a dream, or an episode of a lame tv show.

It was so sudden. My mom hasn't been feeling well the last few months, but no matter how much I talked with her, how much I yelled, she would not go to the hospital.

I'm breaking. The last few months we have NOT gotten along at all. I said such horrible things to her. I want more than anything to go back to even last Monday, and tell her I love her more than anything, and beg her to go to the hospital. I'm only 27. She is only 51. She is too young.

I can't lose my mom. I can't lose my mom. I've been having nightmares, I keep seeing her terrifying face, as she's gasping, gripping her chest, eyes staring to the right. I keep seeing her huge, BULGING eyes with a vacant stare in the E.R. after they somewhat stabilized her. A machine breathing for her. Hooked to so many tubes.

As absolutely pathetic as this is, I just want her to hold me and tell me everything is going to be okay. My mom is far from perfect, she is only human... But I will always and forever love her.

I want my mom. 

... Thank you for reading. I needed to type this out.

Happy Holidays.

UPDATE: Thank you to those who have read this, and have commented. An update.. the test shows there is damage. Doctors don't know to what extent. If nothing changes by the weekend, we will have a very, very difficult decision to make. But it would honor her wishes. I don't know if I believe in God, or any afterlife, but I hope there is some sort of peace for my mother.
Thank you.

UPDATE 2:  I can never express how grateful I am, and how loved I feel to you all who have read and commented on this. THANK YOU. My heart and thoughts go out to each and every one of you. 
Just... Thank you. Each and every one of your comments comforted me, and renewed a bit of hope and faith. Honestly so many of the comments made me cry, overwhelmed from all the support and well wishes, as well as the ones with similar experiences. I promise you all, I am doing my  best staying strong. I have been breaking down the last couple days, since it's begun to sink in, but I know I will.. be okay.  I hope whoever you are, wherever you are reading this, you have a great day, even if you don't celebrate the current holidays!

Edit: I want everyone to know I read every. Single. Comment. I am so grateful to each and every one of you offering your prayers. I can't wait to tell my mom how many people are thinking of her and praying for her! I also do plan on taking the advice to read this post to her. I know I keep repeating myself, but.. thank you. Thank you for all the support."
I started working at a jail and have met the worst people I have ever known. They aren't the inmates.,"I got a job working as a Corrections Officer about 2 months ago. I love my job. Every day is different, there's always something to do, and I'm learning a lot. But some of my coworkers are sucking all the joy out of my new job. 

I became a jailer because I wanted to protect the rights and well being of a class of people often overlooked. I wanted to make a difference. Every day, I do my best to be kind to my inmates. I smile and tell them good morning. I ask them how they're doing if they seem upset. I'll bring them a book from the library, even if it's not their assigned day to ask for books. I'll bring them pictures of loved ones out of their property locker when they ask me for it, even when I have a million other things to do, even when it means skipping the only break I have. I do all this because I believe in the power of an act of kindness. I believe that all people deserve respect and love, regardless of their actions. 

In my short time at the jail, I've been told by an inmate that I ""made him feel human again."" I've had an innate, tears streaming down her face, tell me that ""she could see my heart."" I've been thanked for being kind and told that I'm appreciated. I guess it's possible that some of these compliments are manipulative, but I choose to believe in them. 

But my coworkers. One in particular, who is a control room officer. She sits in a secured area and opens doors for me, and also hands me requested items through a small window. She is so jaded. She is mean and spiteful and it hurts my heart so much. An inmate who I've seen grimacing in pain all day will respectfully ask me for an Aspirin, and my coworker won't allow me to give it because, ""I don't like that inmate, he can wait."" An inmate who has seemed depressed all week will finally drag himself out of bed and ask me for soap so he can take a shower, but my coworker will say, ""I don't feel like getting him soap right now, make him wait an hour or two for annoying me."" 

Every polite request is met with an eye roll and an attitude. She complains every day that the inmates are ""annoying"" and ""too needy"" but all I can think is ""that our job."" Our job is to take care of them. We're here to bring them soap and medicine. We're here to keep them warm and safe. 

I hate her. I hate her for taking out her lack of patience out on my inmates. I hate her for making me look bad when she denies them something for a non-reason. And to be honest, I've started to tell the inmates, ""I'm sorry, *Coworker* said you can't have what you asked for. I don't know why."" 

She shouldn't be a CO. She has no compassion. She has no patience. She has no desire to help these people. Her only desire is to pass judgement and play God by denying them simple requests and punishing them in her own way for their alleged crimes. 

I believe in kindness and smiles. I have looked murderers and child rapists in the eye and still seen some good in them. But all I see when I look at her is hate and spite. 

And I am so, so scared that one day, this job is going to turn my in to her. I am so scared. "
I am sick of being reminded constantly how nobody cares about pedophilia.,"I once argued with my father about Bowie having raped a 15 year old girl, and it’s incredible all the excuses he would try to find to excuse it or make it seem like it wasn’t that big a deal at all. He actually told me at some point “No, I am explaining things you don’t yet understand to you”, and I am so enraged. My father thinks I’m a complete idiot. I’ve been abused by my grandfather my whole childhood before my mother finally decided to estrange my grandparents (for reasons unrelated, nobody in my family knows about my abuse). I’ve been living with this my whole life. I know what the fuck I’m talking about. 

And when I speak up about Woody Allen all I hear are excuses. I’ve had my boyfriend get upset at me for saying pedophiles should die. All I ever hear is excuses. How we must dissociate the artist from the art. How child porn is good, because that way the poor pedophiles can “satisfy their urges”. How the pedophiles are suffering, they’re so alienated from society, they’re so in pain…

What about me? Do I need to keep making myself tiny, silent, do I need to keep forcing myself to feel compassion for the people who broke me? Do I need to keep praising the man on the screen while a traumatized woman who used to be a little girl he assaulted is breaking down in her home at the mere mention of his name in the media?

Fuck you all. Fuck you if you think you can make Lolita out to be the greatest love story of the century, if you think we need to shut up and get over it, if you think we need to stay silent because some asshole’s movie about a teacher dating his quasi-teenage student is more important than the very real pain of countless human beings, fuck you if you think you can get off to recreation of my abuse. I have nothing but contempt for you all."
"As a father of 4, I have failed","As I sit here writing this I am half tempted to stop. Why? I ask myself, what is this going to solve? But for some reason typing this and facing this makes it hurt less.  I have four children ages 11, 7, and twin boys who are 3.  This year has been absolutely miserable.  After living with my girlfriends parents for years to get on our feet we did it at the beginning of this year.  

I was promised a promotion at work which would bring in MUCH more money and we could live comfortably, however that did not happen.  My brother was murdered in a Rite-Aid a few months ago, I suffered a broken leg and missed work for a month, and our bills fell behind and I fell into a deep depression.  

I have been paying rent, but late every month.  Often times not being paid until the 15th of the month.  I hate having to sacrifice paying either the power or water bill, or just not getting gas in the car for the week.  Christmas is now here, and my kids are asking me why we don't have a Christmas tree? How am I supposed to tell them that we can't afford one?

I have sold all of my stuff worth of any value to be able to pay some bills and I have nothing left.  My power is due to be cut off on December 10 because of a $400.00 past due balance, my water is due to be cut off December 10th as well due to $120.00 past due.  And of course all this comes full circle in December.  

I just got off the phone with my landlord asking in a not so happy tone when the rest of Decembers rent would be paid.  I feel like a complete and utter failure.  It pains me to my core, and nothing hurts more than seeing my kids go without.  I honestly don't think I can bare to look into their eyes on Christmas morning, and what I will say.  

Or what I will say on Monday when we have no power or water.  I am working two minimum wage jobs, and their mother is working full time as well, yet we are barely scraping by and can't get caught up because of the month with no income.  If there was only a way to get caught up we would be ok.  But playing catch up with past due balances in coming full circle.

I just wanted to vent, and perhaps cry a little, for the pain I feel for my kids.  I hate myself that I could of not done better, or I could have a better job with more income.  I am supposed to be a father and a provider and I can't even do that.  I am dreading Christmas morning, and wish I can just escape all of this.  

**UPDATE: Power bill almost completely paid up, and water bill paid in full. (http://i.imgur.com/PIaxZ.jpg) you are all AMAZING GREAT PEOPLE!!!**

**UPDATE 2: THANK YOU ALL!!!! The compassion is beyond amazing. Just a FYI almost all extra gifts, and some of the high priced items on the wish list will be going to my brothers family, my brother was murdered a couple months ago, as well as some of the money. I will also be paying all this extra generosity to others who need it around me as well. Pictures will be posted for proof. Your all amazing and many tears have been shed today**

**UPDATE 3: Honestly everyone, this is beyond amazing. PLEASE PLEASE help others who are on here needing assistance with bills and toys.  AGAIN - ALL extra money and toys will be going to others so I can spread your love.  PLEASE PLEASE help others out here who need it now, let's make this a night amazing for others as well. Thank  You for everything.**

**UPDATE 4: I see I am  getting a lot of hate now, but I am blown away by all of this. So PLEASE if you were one of the people posting on here about how you need help please PM your info and let me help you now.  I have lots of extra toys and money to help pay some bills. For the FINAL time all this extra compassion will be put to use to make this holiday just as good for somebody else, so please let me help now the best I can, PLEASE PLEASE DONATE TO OTHERS NOW!! We are beyond blessed at this point.  Let's make this an awesome one for others too!!**

**UPDATE 5: FINAL UPDATE: Thank you all again. i honestly can't say that enough I hope I helped some other people out as well. I need to get home and go to bed as I got work at 5AM.  Please No more donations you have all done so much already.  I am eternally grateful to all of you.  Pictures will be posted of Christmas and the gifts I have helped others with.  Goodnight and thank you.**

**ONE LAST UPDATE: I am trying my best to go through all of the submissions for help.  As of this morning over $1,800 dollars has gone to helping others with power bills, toys, car repairs, food money, and etc. Donations are also being made to a local community outreach center that helps with utilities and other hardships.  To answer just a few questions. People are skimming my pasts posts regarding me purchasing turn tables, records, and etc.  99% percent of those items were purchased at thrift stores and yard sales for pennies on the dollar.  That money came from many of the side jobs I do for extra cash, and everything that was posted was sold well over 6-8 weeks ago.

The reason I kept adding to the wish list was for the benefit of others that I know from my place of employment, in the neighborhood, and others who are need that can benefit from the kindness of others. The higher priced items that were added was in part from my daughter sitting in during my phone calls as I told her ""add some stuff your brothers and other kids would like"", she is a kid she didn't know any better.  

I am at work on break but I am trying to fill as many Christmas wishes with verification as possible, if I don't respond or can't help out I am sorry, I am trying everything I can.  The IndieGoGo is in the process of being hidden.  Once opened they will not close it once donations have been made, but they can ""hide"" it so no more donations will be made.  I sent the request by e-mail last night and I am hoping it will be taken down. For those sending negative hate, threatening e-mails and messages, and even death threats, please put that negative energy into helping others.  For everybody that donated and contributed, and sending positive message and vibes I thank you from the bottom of my heart.  You are all wonderful people.  Pictures will be post once the holiday nears of others receiving goods, and etc.  Thank you and happy holidays to all of you**"
You died today.,"I met you 10 years ago when I started work as a teller at the bank. You were the first one to treat me like a real person and not like the nuisance-new-girl. You showed me the ropes and took me under your wing, and I love you for that, because starting a new job is already nerve racking as it is.

Who would have guessed that you would become my best friend?

You, me, and Jennifer shared our entire lives together behind that teller line---we did spend more time with each other at work than with our own families, after all. 

I remember the time the drunk man came in. We rock-paper-scissored it to decide who had to wait on him. I lost (of course!). We had just gotten the new instant messaging system on our computers that allowed us to send private messages to each other. When drunk man approached my teller window, Jennifer sent us both an IM that said ""OH HELL!"" and we lost it. It's like when you're at a funeral and you get the uncontrollable urge to laugh, even though there's absolutely nothing to laugh about. I'm surprised I didn't get fired. You got to go hide in the break room! 

Then your first date with Daniel, the funeral home guy. Your first date involved riding in his hearse. He told you he just had to transport a body to the funeral home and then you guys could go out, and you reluctantly agreed to ride with him. Ten minutes into your trip, he had to slam on the brakes and the dead person+coffin comes flying into the front of the vehicle. I have marked that down as one of the hardest laughs I have ever had in my life, to date. 

Oh, and then there was the time I slammed my thumb in my car door and you performed surgery on me in the bank bathroom.

The time I got in a fight with my then-boyfriend and you came to my rescue.

It has been seven years since we worked at the bank.

Seven years ago you went to the doctor for the 100th time and they diagnosed you with lupus.
Fast forward a few years and your liver started failing. Then you tripped over your cat and fell and broke your hip. I'm sorry I gave you so much shit about that, but come on...you were 31 years old and you fell and broke your hip and had to have a hip replacement!

You went to a doctor in Texas and got on a liver transplant list. In January 2018 you found out you were one of the next in line to get a new liver.

On Tuesday of this week you were admitted to the hospital and put in ICU because you had an infection in your blood.

On Wednesday your body went into shock and your organs began failing.

On Thursday at 12:22 p.m. you were pronounced dead. 

Your 15-year-old son just messaged me on Facebook **to see how I was doing.**

His mother just died, and he is checking on me. I hope you saw that, and saw how great of a kid you've raised. 

I'm at a loss right now. I've picked up my phone about 100 times to text you and then realized you were no longer there, and I've found myself wishing I was with you instead of here.

You were my best friend. I'll hold down the fort here until I see you again. 

Edit: Wow. I am blown away by all of your support. What started as me sipping on my third glass of wine and writing this just to get it off my chest turned into an overwhelming amount of support from all of you. I've cried on and off all day reading your comments and your stories. I love all of you, thank you so much. And I will keep in touch with her son to make sure he's okay. "
I secretly interviewed at a rival bar AND I CANT WAIT TO QUIT ON MY ASSHOLE BOSS,"**UDDATE 2***

My boss is not your typical aashole. Recently he's been accusing me of money laundering each time I make a tip bigger than $20. I find it very insulting. Im also one of two employees so i am ALWAYS there like 6 days a week and if he springs a double shift on me with no warning i have no choice to take it or i will be fired. he's also done several racist things too. Just not a good guy.
    Soooo i had enough. tired of crying over work and the way im treated. Few nights ago i had an interview at one of the coolest music venues in houston and i think it went really well. Im not very religious but i am praying i get this. Mainly so i can go off on my current boss and see him panic to find another employee who would put up with all his bullshit. "
I just paid off my first student loan!,"I graduated this past May, and have a history of struggling with money (I was disowned while in college). Today, I paid off one of my student loans in full (around $7500)! I don't want to bring it up to my friends (a lot of them are still in school or living at home post grad), but I'm really happy and excited! It's been a lot of budgeting and stress, but I feel like I'm in a really good spot going forward.

Edit: wow this blew up way more than I thought. Thank you all for the kind words and wishes! Still a long road to go ($~65,000 after this loan I believe), but I'm hoping that I can make as much progress as possible and pay it off in under 5 years.

Someone also asked below for advice on how I was able to pay off my loans, so if you are looking for pretty straightforward tips that I found effective, that comment can be found in the thread below.

Thanks again!"
Sometimes I upvote a post to let the OP know they’re not alone.,"I find myself up-voting people’s posts, even when no one else has. Mainly because in subs like this, sometimes it takes a lot for someone to admit something they’ve been holding in for hours, days, or even years.

I like to think that seeing the “2” sitting off to the left lets them know that someone cares...

I just want them to know that they’re never alone.

EDIT: Oh my gosh, y’all are so amazing! I wasn’t expecting this many people to react and support this!! Every little thing we can do to help each other out, should be done without a second thought. 

It makes me beyond happy to see that I’m not the only one that does this! Keep supporting and lifting others up instead of down 💕"
"For the person scrolling,","You, you're important. You know that? I'm so proud of you for still being here. Right now, it might seem impossible to get through the day without shutting down and going back to bed again. I know, I just know, one day, you'll be looking forward to getting up and even the day after. Who knows, it might be a certain someone who changed that, or something, or anything, but it will happen. Some things won't go your way, but you can get through it, beat that shit and don't let it get to you, be it someone who's always let you down, or something that just keeps popping up in your head, or even the table that you accidentally stubbed your toe on. Whatever it is, you can get through it. Smile, cry, talk, write it out, anything. Treat yourself once in a while, manicures, pedicures, a new video game, new clothes, or that one cookie that always caught your eyes. 


If no one's ever said this to you, I'm super proud of you, I'm happy you're here, you look incredibly good today, I love that smile of yours, and I'm here for you and I love you. People make mistakes, no one's perfect, own up to your mistakes and forgive yourself. I mean all that, it was hard for me to wake up too, it was so hard to get through the day without going back home and locking myself in my room. I understand, I've made many mistakes and lost a lot of close friends. I know it's hard when everything comes at once, it's overwhelming, but you can do it. You have the potential to. 


If you need someone to talk to, I'm here. I'll always be here, always. I'll try my best to help you through it, I might not be able to give the best advice, but I'll listen to everything you have to say. Whatever it is, I'll listen and support you. Cuz it feels better to let it out, rather than keeping it in all the time. You can call me or text me, I'll listen. You're important, every single one of you out there, you don't know me and I don't know you, but you mean a lot and I want to help. I love seeing everyone smiling, so I don't care if we don't know each other, I just want to help, even in the smallest way possible. I love you.  You can get through it. Good job, and you look incredible today and everyday.

SOMEONE NOTICED!!!!!!!!!!,"I went up front today to take paperwork and a girl asked if I was still working out. I told her I sure am. She said, ""I can tell!!"" OMG!!!! I have been working so damn hard for almost 6 months now and I don't see scale results so this made me so fucking happy!!!!!!!!!! First person to say something!!! "
I hate how teen girls are so sexualized,As an 18 yr old girl who went through years of sexual abuse I think it’s so gross how teen girls are a fetish same with really young looking girls. I don’t think 18 should be old enough to do porn at all and the minute a girl turns 18 it’s automatically okay to have sex with them but we can’t even buy alcohol yet. 18 is not an adult I don’t care what anyone says and no one even treats us like adults but the second someone wants to get their dick wet we turn into adults. It’s disgusting 
Married men on dating sites,"When I find out they are married I purposely meet with them for a dinner date or whatever ( no sex) to make their experience miserable

Sorry for the confusion "
"After years of telling myself it was my fault, I'm finally ready to tell my pedophile mentally abusive ex that it's HIS fault","To the piece of shit who took my virginity right after I turned 17:

&#x200B;

As if you wanted to wait until I was 17. No, no, you and your friends all placed bets on who would be first to have sex with me. And because I had a very negative relationship with my parents, my self esteem was shit, and I mistook your disgusting disregard for me as a person as attraction and love.

&#x200B;

We met when I had just turned 15, but you liked me because I looked 13. You knew exactly what to say to get me to lock on. Then, when you found out I wouldn't just have sex with you because for some reason I had enough willpower to know I wasn't ready, you punished me by having sex with 3 other 15 year old girls. You pit us all against each other, and reaped the benefits of our desire to prove we were worthy of you.

&#x200B;

Meanwhile, you were 23, 24, 25 years old. Your mommy sent you money cuz you couldn't even work a fucking job. You're a ""rapper"" but you ran out of breath before you could finish lyrics. You had to record each line separately but you knew we wouldn't tell because you ruined our reputations with our social circles to protect yourself.

&#x200B;

I remember when we went on a ""date"" when I was 17...we had just had sex for the first time.  I had finally let you take my virginity, naively thinking it would somehow turn our toxic abusive nightmare into a healthy relationship. I took you to see a community play that some of my friends were in...including a 12 year old girl.

&#x200B;

You tried to convince me to set you up with her...you tried to make me lure a child to you to have sex with. While I was too weak, foolish, and insecure to see what was right in front of me, I at least knew that was disgusting, and I told her to stay away from you. But I hated myself so much I stayed with you.

&#x200B;

So you cheated on me with a pregnant 18 year old...yeah, that's another one of your fetishes. Pregnant women. You only told me because you got an STD from her. Luckily, the universe wanted to cut me a break and I didn't get it.

&#x200B;

You fucked me up real good, buddy. You really nailed it. You fucked up those other girls too. One of them is 32 years old now and too afraid to leave her house. I remember holding her head in my lap when she was 20, she would cry and say it was her fault you were a bad person...she was 16 and you were 20 when you met. The other one is dead because she kept getting into disgusting relationships with pieces of shit like you.

&#x200B;

And you? Well, you still couldn't manage to be a fucking grown up at 35. So your mommy shipped you back home to Mexico. You found a 20-something year old there who would dress up like a little girl and talk like a child for you (you filmed it and put it online...gross), and she didn't speak english so you weren't afraid she'd find out who you are from anyone else.

&#x200B;

That's the last I know of you. You blocked me online after you tried to contact me when I was 22. I was willing to speak with you until you started sending messages to my boyfriend telling him he was better off without me. Usually that worked for you when I was a teenager because I only dated scum like you. But I was dating a REAL adult this time. So you just looked like a fucking weirdo.

  
That pissed you off, so you started trying to humiliate me publicly online. My friends came down on you and mocked you and confronted you for the pedo piece of shit you are. That's why you blocked me.

&#x200B;

I only wish I could talk to you one more time. I only need one conversation. I'd tell you how one girl is dead and it's  your fault (it is. don't ever think otherwise. you made her think she wasn't worthy of anyone but a guy like you, and he killed her. Of course it's his fault, but it's yours too). I'd tell you I've been keeping tabs on you online and the minute I see you with any underage girls in any pictures I will be alerting local authorities. But most of all, I'd tell you you're a piece of shit. A malignant tumor. The world would be better off with you dead and gone.

&#x200B;

I am so so happy in my life. I thought being happy meant I'd forgive the people who hurt me in the past, but actually being happy helped me see how much you hurt me as a teenager. And because I'm happy, knowing you have done and are probably still doing that to other teenagers makes me sick.

&#x200B;

You thought you'd be a famous rapper now. Instead, you're a pathetic loser making background music for failing youtube channels. I wish you weren't even getting THOSE projects. I wish you were just sitting in a basement alone waiting for death.

&#x200B;

I hate you. Every girl who has ever been abused by you and healed from it hates you. But I'm also happy, because I'll always be more than you. What you did will not define me.

&#x200B;

Shove your shitty music up your ass, you worthless child rapist.

Edit: thank you all for your kind words and support. It means the world to me to feel so validated. I only wish I’d gotten this off my chest sooner, it feels good to get this out in the open. I hope all of you feel as happy and loved as I do now. And anyone reading this who isn’t feeling happy or loved, please feel free to reach out to me. If you need an ear, I am here. Thanks again everyone!!

Edit 2: many of you are questioning my validity because of posts I made in /r/raisedbynarcissists. My narcs lurk in that forum, so I tweak the story enough to prevent them from connecting it to me. That’s also why I hide my posts so they can’t immediately locate what I say. I was honest about my background in this post because I know they don’t go to this forum. This account is used as my “therapy” account because I have it a random name that my narcs wouldn’t assume immediately is me. They have always stalked me online. I understand that people make stuff up but please be careful before assuming that’s what’s happening. People who have been abused often protect themselves from their abusers by hiding from them. I’m in a better place now but if I’d been accused of lying 5 years ago I may have gone to blaming myself and allowing the toxic relationships to continue."
I love my daughter,"I'm a 32 year old man, happily married for 9 years, and we have a daughter who is almost 5.

I had a really bad day at work today. I came home, dragging my feet exhaustingly through the house, and looked into my girl's room. She was drawing and coloring at her little table. I came up, forcing a smile onto my face, and asked, ""whatcha drawing, sweetie?""

It was a picture of a castle with a princess inside (she loves fairy tales) and a dragon fighting with a man in armor, who looks like they're trying to protect the princess. She said, pointing to the princess, ""that's me, and this-"" she moves her finger to the knight. ""-is you, Daddy.""

I know it sounds really cliche.

I was just overwhelmed with good feelings in that instant. It made me  remember everything amazing that happened in this last decade. Meeting my loving wife, getting married, buying our own home, raising a family, having a daughter who loves her father so much that she looks up to him as a hero.

Made my day brighter, to say the least.

I told her it was a beautiful picture, kissed her forehead and left the room.

I'm still not quite sure why I posted this here, but feel free to put any thoughts or discussions down in the comments section.

EDIT: Wow, thank you guys so much! I didn't expect this to be seen by so many people, nor did I imagine everyone would be so touched by it."
I got a job today!,"YES! YES! YESSSSSSSSSSSSS

it's a banking job so it's got BENEFITS, know what I'm sayin? 

FUUUUCK YES!

My brother tried to kill me while my parents watched.,"My older brother developed schizophrenia. It was horrible and fast. He was twenty-four when it happened. I was seventeen and he moved back in with my parents. They made me move out of my room and into the living room instead of just converting my dad’s study into an extra bedroom. My parents loved my brother. They worshipped him. I think they loved me, too, but my brother was the first-born. He was the child they had when they were happily married and excited about forever together. 

The illness hit my brother hard and fast, as it can sometimes do. He tried to attack his (then) girlfriend with a knife while calling out that she was trying to “experiment” on him. He heard voices, he would keep the whole house up all night crying and screaming. He would hide his medications. He would torture us. But my parents were beside themselves; their perfect child had broken and they were lost. I was annoyed, because I was a teenager trying to make it through high school and apply to college and this was added stress. 

I was never close to my brother, but I loved him fiercely. He was older—old enough to be in college when I was developed to a point where I wanted to get to know him. But he was always nice and kind. He would fix my bicycle when the chain would break, or he would make me grilled cheese late at night when neither of us could sleep. He scratched my back when I got chickenpox. Once, he snuck twenty dollars out of mom’s wallet so we could order a pizza after she had been on a health kick and we had had steamed vegetables for dinner. I was about five at the time and thought my brother was an actual superhero. 

But at the same time, it was like living with a friend. He was always aloof; he would sometimes stay out late, stay with friends for weeks at a time, sometimes he just wouldn’t come home at all. It wasn’t until I was a little older that I realized why: My parents had grown to hate each other. They fought constantly. My mother was physically abusive to my father and drank a lot. My father was having multiple affairs. He got drunk and crashed our car. But they refused to get a divorce. I think they were holding out for me to leave the house. It drove my brother off the deep end and he moved out as soon as he turned eighteen and rarely visited. This broke my parents and they mourned his absence. 

So when he moved back due to his illness, my parents were secretly thrilled. They would dote on him and hold him and be the warm, “loving” family that they weren’t. It was like they were getting a second chance with him and I was being fazed out. 

Some days, my brother would be lucid and would stumble into the kitchen and make a crass comment about my bed hair and playfully stick his tongue out at me. Others, he would try and break through his bedroom wall with his fist. 

But the night he tried to kill me, I will never forget. I remember my parents had left for work that day and I heard my brother muttering behind his bedroom door. He was talking to the “voices” and was talking about “she’s not ours” and “she’s evil.” I didn’t know it was about me, but I was scared to be alone with him so I just went to my room and locked my door (what my parents told me to do when I was alone with him). We had a nurse stop by during his “alone” days and he seemed fine, so I didn’t think anything of it. When my parents got home, I told them he was talking to his voices again but they didn’t seem worried, either. 
That night, though, I was in my room while my parents were making dinner and my brother knocked on my door. He asked me if he could come in. Out of habit, I kept the door locked. I got up to open it, but I remember feeling uneasy. He had never come to my room, even when he was pre-schizophrenic. He always let me have my space, and even though my brother was battling a mental illness—he was still the same person. He still gave me space. 

I asked him what he wanted through the door and he said he wanted to use one of my extra toothbrushes. It seemed harmless enough. I grabbed an unopened toothbrush package and unlocked my door, and that’s when he rushed me. The door flew open and smacked me in the face and immediately broke my nose and dazed me. I was so stunned that I couldn’t register his hands around my neck. I remember very clearly looking up at him and his face was so red. He was breathing through gritted teeth. His eyes were wild, but he had tears running down his face. I thought it was sweat, but it was tears. 

I spit blood in his face to get away. His grip loosened and I pushed him back and ran down the stairs. He tackled me so hard that we both rolled into the kitchen where my parents were. I was screaming and my parents were in shock. My brother was beating my head against the floor and calling me a “traitor” and “thief.” My dad finally tried to get my brother off me, but I will never forget my mother. She said: “Don’t. We’ll have to call the police. Let’s think about this. He’ll have to go away.” 

My father still tried to pull me up, but my brother jumped on him. I was crying and screaming. My mother was pacing. I remember my father pleading with my brother to stop. They were about fifty feet away, but then my brother’s head turned back to stare at me and I could tell he was going to charge at me. I pulled a skillet from the drying rack and just arched it back and slammed it across his face. My mother finally screamed when I did that. She finally made a sound. 

I hit my brother again when he was on the ground. I kept hitting him until my dad pulled me back. 

I killed my brother. He had a brain bleed and hemorrhaged before he could get to the hospital. 

I had a broken nose, jaw, fractured eye socket, three missing teeth, and a concussion. 

After everything was said and done—after the funeral, after my face healed, I moved out to live with my aunt and uncle. I told them it was because I didn’t want to stay in the house anymore, but it was actually because I couldn’t stand to look at my parents. And my parents knew. 

They knew that if they had to choose, they would choose my brother to be alive. He was their last hope at being happy again. Why didn’t they read into the fucking symbolism? Their last chance at being happy was mentally ill and violent. 

I went to college and never talked to my parents again. My dad sent me an email today and told me that my mom has cancer. I deleted the email. My dad calls me a lot, I know he cares about me, but I haven’t spoken to him in six years. 

But I miss my brother. 

I was thinking of him tonight. It’s his birthday and he would have been thirty-years-old. 

Thanks for reading. 

**Edit**: Hey! I just got off work and tried to reply to a lot of comments! But I'm tired and gonna go nap! I'll reply to more later. I love you all, thank you for sharing your condolences and stories with a stranger! You're in my heart and my heart is with you! "
i hate having a female reproductive system,"i don't think there are words which can actually explain the level of hatred i feel for my body right now.   
i hate periods. i hate the fact i am biologically capable of being pregnant. that's like one of my biggest fears. i never asked to be born female, why is it illegal to get hysterectomy. because im """"young and will regret it later"""" or im """"mutilating my body"""". 

i dont give a fuck just delete it aaaa"
My Parents Stopped Talking to Me Because I Found Out I Was Black,"I grew up a biracial boy in an all white family. My mother never wanted me to know who my biological father was. My entire life I respected my mother’s wishes not to tell me because I didn’t know her reasons for not telling me. I didn’t know if it was a situation of assault or something else sinister. I assumed it was something really bad for my mother not to tell me. She assured me it was not. My mother and stepfather raised me in a strict conservative christian home. We always lived in predominantly white parts of the country. I grew up in western Pennsylvania until I was 16. At that point my mother and stepfather decided to move to North Dakota.  

I endured a heavy amount of racism as a child. I would come home from school crying trying to understand why people were making fun of my skin color. When I was in elementary school and we had to do the standardized testing, I remember looking at the bubbles where you had to mark ‘caucasian’ ‘african american’ ‘hispanic’ etc. and remember asking my mother what to mark. She told me to mark caucasian. My teacher called me out and told me I marked the wrong bubble in front of the entire class. My mother didn’t want to acknowledge my blackness and I wasn’t entirely sure of my race either because my mom told me I wasn’t black. I always felt I looked black, but my skin was a light enough brown that I felt I could be any number of races. 

Incidents such as these plagued my childhood. People would constantly ask me “what are you?” and I was so unsure of how to answer because my mother only ever wanted me to acknowledge being white. My parents moved from North Dakota to Wyoming. Once I got the cops called on me in a town in Wyoming just because I was walking down the sidewalk and people were afraid. I literally had dropped my car off at an auto repair shop to get the brakes changed and walked down the sidewalk to a gas station and was stopped and questioned by the cops. It was an all white town in Wyoming. I’m not sure why I was shocked, but I still was. 

I always wondered if I had other siblings as well on my biological father’s side. I asked my mom and she said “No”

So I left it be. Fast forward to being in my twenties and weird stuff started happening with my body. I started constantly having flu symptoms. I was gaining weight and feeling really low energy. My body was experiencing heavy edema and I didn’t know what was wrong with me. I wanted to at the very least try to obtain health history from my biological father’s family because I had been going to the doctor and they weren’t entirely sure what was wrong either. One morning I woke up and my face was swollen so badly that I couldn’t open my eyes. I was driven to the ER and the doctors said they found fluid around my heart. They felt that it must be an issue with my kidneys because of the swelling and weight gain I was experiencing.

When I went to my mother to ask again about the identity of my biological father she became extremely angry and lashed out at me. She told me she refused to tell me and that I was always bitter and angry at her as a child. This hurt me because I didn’t ever feel that I had a bad childhood. I just felt this was a topic never discussed or resolved. I always assured her I never held this against her I just wanted to know. I still can’t get over that. It hurts so bad.

I decided to take a DNA test. I didnt expect to find any relatives, but I felt that it would at least clarify my race for me.

What I found was that I was indeed half black and also in my research I discovered that I had a sister that was nine months older than me. She also grew up biracial. 

All in all, I am rambling, but to sum it up, I was diagnosed with a kidney disease and my mother and stepfather have stopped talking to me because of the fact that I took a DNA test and found out I had a sister and clarified to them I was half black.

It’s been rough fighting a kidney disease and also having my family abandon me. I won’t stop fighting for truth tho and I will always love my family no matter what. Any advice on how I should deal with the pain is greatly appreciated. "
I fucking hate Army girlfriends.,"When my boyfriend decided to join the army I supported him 100% because it was his decision to make and he's wanted to join since he was young.

During his time in basic training, I liked his platoon's Facebook page because it updated family members on what phase they were on and when graduation would be, etc. For some reason the other SIT's SO's added me on Facebook and I thought why the fuck not. It's good to make new friends right?

FUCKING WRONG.

They posted about how they're ""Proud Army Girlfriends"" and spammed my news feed with military wedding pictures, quote pictures with how much they loved their soldiers, pictures about their boyfriends being heroes of war. These girls are making their entire lives about their boyfriend being in the army.

Don't get me wrong, I love my boyfriend and I support him 100%, but I have my own life and my own career path. I am my own fucking person and I'm not gonna make my life about being an ""Army Girlfriend.""

One girl even wrote a Facebook status that was ridiculous,

""Traded in my pearls for his dog tags, traded in my blouses for a t-shirt that says 'I love my soldier,' traded in my diamond bracelet for a rubber one that says 'Army,' and at the end of the day I'm still smiling. What's love without sacrifice?""

Are you fucking kidding me? He was only in basic training. What exactly are you sacrificing? Not being able to wear diamonds or pearls anymore? I'm so fucking sorry for your hard life.

Before my boyfriend left, I used to get offended when people made fun of military spouses, but now I can see why. 

Edit: I forgot to mention, I did in fact un-friend most of them, kept the sane one as friends though. This happened a few months ago. I was just reminded of why when one of them messaged me this morning about why I deleted her off Facebook."
My boyfriend thought I was sleeping...,"The other night I woke up when my boyfriend moved in the bed. I ignored it and kept my eyes closed. He pulled me towards him and I kind of grumbled/sighed and I guess he thought I was dreaming. He whispered ""Are you okay?"" I didn't respond. Then he whispered ""It's okay, I'm here. I love you so much."" he kissed my forehead and hugged me tightly, ""...so much. I love you so, so, so much."" and cupped my face in his hands. Then he snuggled down and went back to sleep. That's all that happened. Sorry, nothing kinky or offensive. Just a happy moment in my life."
"I'm an Uber driver, I just had to make my first report of a possible crime going down. I feel like shit.","Like the title says. Got a girl who told me that she was going to a guy's house who, from what I heard from her, had been grooming her to sexually assault her. He had been giving her free tattoos, and had already told her that he was going to do sexual stuff to her. She was telling me about this as if it were her internal dialogue; 'I don't know if I should go. But his kid will be there, he wouldn't do anything to me with his kid there"", basically trying to rationalize her fear and justify going there, despite her fears. 

I tried to convince her not to go. I couldn't not take her, that'd be kidnapping. And she was a minor, which was the makings for a whole different kind of shit show...so I dropped her off.I tried to get her to not go. She said she'd be ok. So I left, reported it to to Uber, and the police. 

And now, I feel so powerless to help someone who was practically screaming for help. I hope she's found by law enforcement, I hope they are able to stop anymore abuse (she told me about having had a pretty shitty upbringing.) I just needed somewhere to get this out. I know there's an Uber subreddit, and women-focused subreddits, but I chose this one. I hope she's found, I hope she gets help. Fuck, man"
I learned the sex of my baby,"My entire life has fallen apart in the last 6 months. My husband is leaving me. I’m filing for divorce. I don’t have a job or money. I’ll probably lose the house. He wants to screw me over for child support.

But today, I needed to feel in control of something, so I ended my campaign of the green pregnancy. (I’m 35 weeks along) I asked my doctor (while getting an STD check, because my husband is also having multiple affairs) to tell me the sex of the baby. I’m going to have a baby girl. I know her name. No one knows except me, and now reddit. She’s going to be so loved.

I just wanted to have something to myself, because he’s taken everything. 


Edit: thank you to everyone who has been so kind to me! No thank you to the many PMs I’ve gotten suggesting I kill myself, or the baby, or both, or that I’m a shit mother because x y and z. Y’all are such charmers! It’s so sweet. /s

Also, I am legally covered. Where I live there is implied paternity and he can’t get out of any sort of support or “not sign” the birth certificate. I have a lawyer and a great family. Thank you for all the advice, everyone. I feel so much more support from you than you can imagine. 

Edit 2: since many people have asked, I posted her name in the comments. But it’s definitely going to get lost in the flood, so her name is Aurora Michele. Rory. After my mother, Michele. "
My home is not destroyed :),"I left my home in Syria back in 2011 , the conflict kept escalating ever since, my city  lost contact with the outside world so I couldn't know if my home is still standing or not , today however and AFTER 7 YEARS, my uncle sent me a video that he filmed inside home  after he was allowed entrance, and guess what IT'S INTACT THE WHOLE BUILDINGS IS UNTOUCHED, I'M SO HAPPY RIGHT NOW, after all these years my home still exist

Edit: wow I'm really amazed by all of your supports thank you guys it really make me feel happy to know our world is still fine"
I found my person,"There was a moment last week when I was at my boyfriend's house and we showered together

That is our habit, whenever I am there with him and one of us showers, we typically hop in together without thinking about it

he put on some music on the speaker before we got into the shower

and for awhile we were both under the water, torsos pressed together in embrace, me with my arms around him and my face in his neck, him with his hands on the small of my back

he was singing to the music, and as we swayed back and forth under the warm water I could feel the damp soft skin of his neck and the scratchiness of his jaw stubble against my cheek, and I could hear his voice signing sweetly in my ear

and the moment felt so perfectly natural,

so good-

that I started to cry, tears mixing with the water droplets rolling down his shoulder

and he stops and says ""this is my favorite song by them"" then continues his singing

and I turn my head to look at his face, because he is smiling, and I am smiling and crying but you cannot tell because the water from the shower is pouring down my face

I swore right then to cherish that moment, and that man, for the rest of our lives

Edit:

For those who asked, he says the song was Radio America by the Libertines"
"It finally happened, fucking alcoholic."," When I interviewed my roomate, she did not mention she had a drinking problem. A 3 DUI and breathaliser in her car drinking problem. Said her dog just died and was looking for a mellow place.

I didnt say anything when finding shot glasses on the bathroom sink in the morning.

I didnt mention how fucked up it seemed when you asked me to grab your bag out of your car and empty beer bottles were all around the front seat.

I didnt try to make you feel bad when you got so wasted you almost missed your 1st day of your new job after getting fired from your old job.

But you finally crossed the line.

 Knocked on my bedroom door in a big hurry. ""Im going to be late!"" Please just help me start my car?!

Fucking no. I will not blow into your breathaliser at 8am to help you start your car. You've made these decisions, deal with it. Dont ever ask me to do it again, because I wont. 

The fucking nerve. I think im going to see if my landlord will kick her out. She has seriously crossed a line with me. 

Fuck that shit

 "
"After trying to save my mother my whole life, tonight, I blocked her number.","Tonight, I'm finally done.

In my head, I have sat 9 year old me down. I look at her, and dark brown eyes filled with worry and confusion bore into mine. I squeeze her small, pale hand. The fight is over. She cries and I cry with her, but there's nothing we can do. There's nothing anyone can do.

  
Somewhere out there, is a 54 year old woman, sitting on her porch, untamed dark curls tucked into a beanie. She's drinking either box wine or one of the little bottles of svedka she sneaks into her purse to take to work. Dealer's choice. She's at least high on Xanax. Klonopin too, if it's a bad night. In between swigs she's inhaling cigarette after cigarette. She probably hasn't showered in a few days.  

Either she's drowning in the voices in her head, or she's thinking about better days. College in the cape of South Africa, her trip to Florence where she became the mistress of a married man - London, with whispers of the promise of Wimbolden in her ear. ""My feet were meant to walk on marble floors"" she always said. 

Of course, none of it panned out. She came to America and married the first sucker she could find. Got her Green Card, popped out a couple of kids. Never had a career. She spent her days drunk and angry. I learned what an alcoholic was at 9 when she was pulled over for her first DUI, with me in the backseat.

I cried when they took her away that time. Even though she would slap me, even drag me down the hall by my hair, refuse to feed me, scream at me - she was still my mom. 

Then I found her on the bathroom floor, almost dead from an overdose. 

That was the first attempt. There were a few more. She slit her throat in a parking lot, but someone found her.

She was in and out of rehab, in and out of jail. I got my first period without her there.

When I was 12, my dad left her.

By 15, she had remarried.

She stopped drinking, but dedicated herself to making me feel like I was ugly, that I was fat, that I would never be anything. 

When my stepdad got physical with me and I ran out of the house, she called the police on me, saying I had run away.

I was gone at 17 - my sister was still stuck with her. My stepdad left, and she spiraled. My sister had to Baker Act her several times. She was strong, but every time the cops emerged from the house with my mother's small frame in tow, my sister would bury her face in my chest.

She hears voices now. She doesn't eat. She's had two heart attacks. She can't keep a job. I offered my own money to put her into rehab and she said she'd rather die. 

She mainly exists in my life through my phone. Today, she texted me saying I would never find a man who would love me, as I've ruined my body with tattoos, and I should be ashamed. She was also mocking my job, because I don't make that much.

I work two jobs and go to school. I'm not ashamed of myself, and I'm not worried about finding a man who loves me. But her saying that, after I just ended a relationship after being cheated on and abused, is hard.

So, I blocked her number.

  
Somewhere out there is a 54 year old drunk woman who smells like cigarettes, and won't remember why I blocked her tomorrow."
Being a female gamer sucks,"Just had someone on my competitive team quit because his wife thinks something more is going on.  

The only relationship we have is a professional one, like coworkers. 

I've had teams break up because multiple people liked me. They fought. WHY was I the last to know? Why did they think I would date someone online? 

Hell, why did they assume I like men? 

Just because I refuse to give you a picture of me, why am I ugly? If I do share a picture that breaks the professionalism. I HAVE to maintain that boundary or else shit breaks loose again. 

All I want is to be friends. Why can't I have that? "
"""But you're gay.......""","Guuuuuuuuuurl let me tell you what this dumb broad said to me.... 

Today I coworker called me if I could help her out, she had a flat and nobody she knew was helping, so I said sure, and head on over to her location. I pull up and she's comes and hugs me and thanks me. So we're making conversation as I'm changing her tire and I mention my boyfriend has the same car, and she's like ""you're gay?! How awesome! We should hang out more often!"" I don't really acknowledge her invitation and continue changing the tire. As I take the wheel off I tell her she's gonna need new brake pads soon, and she's all like ""how do you know?"" And I tell her I can tell, they look worn, working on cars is a hobby of mine, then this broad proceeds to drop ""but you're gay..........."" Like being gay will prevent me from disassembling and engine and working on it. Fuck you Denise. I'll work on my cars AND fuck your man. Don't play with me, don't play. I won't fuck him tho, I've seen him and he's not cute, but whatever. Last time I help her out. "
You came into my ER today...,"...presenting as a complex cardiac arrest case. a review of your history revealed that you had stage 4 lung cancer and had undergone massive amounts of chemo and radiation in an effort to extend your time. your family was plentiful; you were undoubtedly loved. 

you were 54 years old, and a mother of three who just happened to look very much like my own mother, also 54 and a mother of three and recently departed, falling too to stage 4 lung cancer. you even had similar eyes. your haircut? identical. you could have been twins, 

actually. it was difficult to focus on receiving report from the medics during the transfer of care when I realized that not long ago, I stood on the other side of this equation. I wasn't in scrubs then--then, it was me searching desperately for clues on the faces of those trying to preserve a life. I wasn't focused on the quality of my chest compressions then -- instead, it was I who stood frantically wondering if the sounds I was hearing were really what CPR was supposed to sound like. it was I who was receiving heartfelt condolences from the people smoothly tending to my mother as though in an orchestrated dance, it was not me moving in the precise rhythm of a highly trained trauma team. 

we worked on you for 41 minutes. 

though the words probably sounded as empty to your children as they did to me when I was standing in thier places, I wish you knew that we really did do everything we could. the thready and faint pulse that your precious kids were holding on to was simply and sadly the epinephrine, finishing it's job until it could circulate no more. 

they say nursing isn't for everyone, and they tend to emphasize that emergency nursing isn't for everyone, but I love my job and I give it everything I've fucking got every day. 

I'm sorry we couldn't bring you back. 

I always thought this career was the one I was destined to fall into and I've handled the precarious balance of beauty and tragedy exceptionally well, but today, I met the first family that saw me crack. I cried when I said I was sorry, and I hope to god they believed me. each loss we sustain is difficult and we accept it as such and continue to forge onward, pouring our energies into those remaining in our care. this one got me, hit me in a fragile and tender place. it was too close to home. I've never cried in front of a patient or thier loved ones before. this time, I *know* how they felt and how they will feel in the coming hours, days, years. 

I wish with all my might that they will stumble through grief as I did, finally making thier way to a safer landing spot in which happy memories ever so slightly mask the details of that awful day. 

to the family members, I can only hope that above all else, they knew, even for a fleeting moment in time, I *saw* them.

godspeed to you and your family. I am honored to have had the chance to serve you to the best of my ability. please know that what you got was exactly that; nothing short of my best. I can tell you with honesty, too, that the crew surrounding me in that trauma room is a crew I stand beside every day and I am proud to do so. each one of us gave it our all. 

I used to think that emergency medicine is where I belong. 

tonight, I'm not so sure. 

edit: I came back to this and have read every single comment, ending in tears. thank you all, each of you, from the bottom of my heart. I have recentered and have a day off in which I will relax and go back in with my head a little higher. you are all beautiful. I am humbled by your support, your sharing of your own experiences, and the absolute just...love. 

thank you for the silver, the gold, and the humanity. be safe, y'all. "
"Yes I vape, no it’s not because I’m “cool”","I’m super mad that vaping has become some hipster “cool” bullshit. I’m real tired of being lumped in with assholes who puff all day on unicorn fart or whatever fancy ass flavor of the week they’re doing. Every time I pull my pen out in front of anyone I get that fucking “oh you VAPE? Lolololol!” bullshit. 

Let me tell you why I vape: because I’ve been addicted to nicotine for 20 years. Because cigarettes are fucking expensive and I hate how I smell when I smoke them. Because since I moved to a vaporizer I stopped getting winded climbing stairs and I can wake up in the morning and take a full breath without hacking and spitting shit up into the sink. 

So yeah I “VAPE”. Because I have a fucking addiction, you assholes! Because I’m trying to “step down” my nicotine intake over time so I can eventually quit! Because it’s better for me and for you and for everybody if I vape instead. Don’t mistake me by my Warby Parker glasses, I’m no hipster. I’m a 40-year-old mother of two with an incredibly stressful full time corporate job who is still dealing with the aftereffects of a 10-year abusive marriage. I quit drinking, I quit pot, I never let a doctor prescribe me with narcotics even when I know they’ll be more effective. I know I have an addiction problem and I’m trying to deal with that while you get your fucking lols. You don’t know why I vape and I’m fucking tired of hearing your judgment about it. 

The “flavor” I use is whatever tastes the most like a cigarette. I don’t go for the fancy shit because I’m not looking for a cotton-candy-flavored air pacifier. I’ve successfully moved from 24 mg to 12 in the last six months and that was a struggle by itself. I’d like to celebrate that. Instead I get some seriously immature yuks from people I don’t want to fucking explain myself to. 

Addiction is serious, and I wish people would understand that when it comes to nicotine as much as they do when it comes to any other addiction. I’m trying motherfuckers. It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever tried to do. Keep your goddamn jokes. Laugh about me later. I don’t give a shit. But don’t look me in the eyes and laugh about me “trying to be cool”. Nicotine addiction is not cool. It sucks and I hate it. "
Dear Germany,"This migrant crisis in Europe has got me thinking a lot about you again. After many years of bittersweet memories and pent up emotions (I can't decide whether it's nostalgia, sadness, or anger) it's time I let them go.

The war started on my first birthday. Four months later I officially came from a country that no longer existed. It was a civil war and things were too messy with neighbours turning on one another, and with my mother being a muslim and my father an orthodox christian we had no other option but to get out (neighbours constantly threatening to behead their children wasn't their cup of tea). 

So we somehow fled to Slovenia. But they didn't want us. (Though it would have been perfect since we would've been so close to all the family that we had left behind). 

And then we moved on to Austria; where we were taken in by an Austrian family (who already had five kids) and they lived high up in the hills and holy shit they became our second family. We were allowed to stay there for 9 months before Austria told us that it was time to go. 

But the war was still raging on back home. Where to actually 'go' was as much of a conundrum as ever. But that's where you come in Germany. You allowed us to cross that border. 

And you placed us in a refugee camp for a year (which was amazing because we had a whole bungalow to ourselves!). The town was called Braunlage and it was in this scouting / ski location that you allowed us to call home for a while, and the place was filled with Balkan and Russian refugees where we all actually had a great time and all us kids used to hang out and we'd come home at 2am (including us rebellious post-toddlers!) because the parents were in too debilitated and depressed of a state to actually care. 

And then Germany, you tell us that we're allowed to stay for even longer, years even! And we're all ecstatic, and slowly my mother tongue (which was Russian) slowly begins to transform into German, and then an Egyptian landlord contacts us and tells us that he's heard about our situation and how the kids were riddled with PTSD, so they've got an apartment for cheap and it's up north in a town in Braunschweig ready for the taking. So off we went. 

That's where we spent the next five years. Where we were given 400 Deutsche Marks every six months to go to C&A and buy ourselves a shitload of clothing, where my best friends were called Lisa, and Werner, and Otto, where our neighbour gifted us a used radio so we could listen to some diaspora recall the dead for the day, where random german strangers would knock on our door and offer us food and hand-me-downs, where the local toys 'r' us fooled me into thinking I had won a competition and handed me over with a gift card, where my nerd of an older sister was refused entry to the best gymnasium (because she was a refugee) but then the whole town rallied against the decision. They were good (occasionally hard) times — but the good definitely surpassed everything. 

But then we got a letter in the mail. It was time to go, they were getting rid of all of us. In hindsight, I guess it makes sense. The war had ended, no more excuses. But you never considered that our dangers didn't end at that time (people had done ugly things in that war), where after six years I might've considered you my only home and that it was going to take me some time to comprehend that you no longer wanted me. 
I remember my mum tucking me into bed as I cried to her,
'why doesn't my country want me anymore'
'this is not going to be your country for much longer'
'which place will?'
'i don't know'
'then where am I from?'
and she told me and i cried even harder because I couldn't even pronounce the name of the place let alone speak the damn language. 

And I re-read all those newspaper clippings from back then, how we were told that we were detrimental to the economy (which we were), how we provided no benefit to the country, how they wanted us gone, how we were humans they no longer wanted to have responsibility for (and they were right). Didn't mean that we didn't take it hard. So you stripped my parents of their working rights; my engineer of a mum and my professor of a dad became cleaners for the disabled before that too was put to a hold. 

Mine and my sister's classrooms came to see us off at the train station. I remember the teachers crying, tissues in their hands as they waved us off. That was that. 

We soon (and finally) found home somewhere else. 
More than fifteen years later and I'm finishing off my postgrad at Oxford Uni when I'm approached by a German professor, there's a bit of talk when he finally says 'why didn't you stay in Germany? We would have loved you and your family there!!', and I think that I just laughed and responded with 'it was too cold!'. 

I get that you didn't want me Germany, even though at one stage in my life you were the only thing that I knew (I thought I was you). I get that at the time you saw no worth in me, even though your citizens disagreed with that. But this was a little child's grudge that I couldn't let go off. 

But in the end I just want to say thank you, God knows where I would have been without you. I have no idea how many debts I'll have to repay until we're even. Danke danke danke (I'm over it now). 

http://i.imgur.com/2lSfN0Q.jpg?1 
(me and my Russian pals!) 
 

Edit: Thank you all so much for your kind comments! I just wanted to emphasise that this was not an attack on Germany, instead it was a thank you. I'm old enough now to understand why we had to be expelled (and that their reasons were definitely justified - they took care of us for six years, that's a lot to be thankful for!!!), but I just needed to get rid off a childhood grudge (kids don't really understand the economy and politics)- hence this post. Although I do have to give an apology to Germany; after spending six years in its borders (and being a native German speaker), I completely forgot the language - it's a travesty and something that my sister won't stop poking fun at me for. I'm giving it another try with duolingo though - we'll see how that goes!!

"On my third day of work, someone called my boss about me.","I'm autistic, and a few weeks ago, I was hired for my first job. My mom was a huge help, seeing as she also works in the same company, same shift, and asked me to apply for the recently opened cashiers position.

Today, she called our boss about something, and he mentioned to her about something he'd been meaning to tell me.

I was still new at the job, so with every small mistake, I made sure to apologize for the inconvenience. Apparently, this was something a woman noticed, and needed to tell my manager about. Cue the anxious breath, thinking I had done something wrong.

She complimented me.

She said I had great customer service skills, and that she was surprised I had only worked there for two days. In my bosses words, relaying his conversation with this customer to my mom, ""I wish there were more people like her working in positions like that. Please tell her that she's doing a great job, because after leaving, I was happy to have stopped here."""
"To my darling, cheating, fellow avid redditor husband. (An open letter)","Note: I've a sudden lack of interest in contributing anymore of my time into this, so my apologies for any typos or grammatical errors you may come across.)




My dearest Daniel,


I thought I'd address you by this (pseudo) name since you've always enjoyed using and having it for your online dating profiles, your self-given nickname (this I never understood), and we can't forget that one incident during our bedroom roleplaying (this I really never understood). 


First and foremost, I'd like say that this open letter to you is not one of reprisal (that means revenge) yet one of reflection and gratitude. Perhaps one could even deem it to be a healthy outlet during this time in which I've just learned of your infidelities (this means cheating, on numerous occasions. I thought I'd just clarify that too since you mistakenly denied that you've done such). 


I wanted to take the time to thank you for the past five months of our marriage. Even though it was short-lived, it felt like years, maybe even lifetimes. Yes, multiple lifetimes actually. I'm grateful that I had the opportunity to witness such Emmy-Award winning acting. I truly understand (now) why you often spoke of becoming an actor - you are brilliant, I assure you. I also want to share my genuine appreciation for helping me brush up on (my) empathy, compassion, and grace. Although the numerous lessons and practice of forgiveness were becoming a bit excessive, it worked out in the ending - as I've become quite the (sort of) expert of mindfulness and innerpeace. It's funny, I was thinking that if this whole Financial Manager thing doesn't work out for me, I could always switch careers with all this new experience I have and become a Spiritual Guru. 


Anyway, I thought that you would like to know that throughout all of the wonderful, sentimental, and crazy times we shared (like the time we had sex on the side of the road in broad daylight up at Tahoe, and all the countless beer & sake nights, oh! And that time when I answered your phone and it was one of your side-pieces, and you were so distraught from getting caught that you started throwing up for a good 5-10 minutes!) ...yes, during all of those goodtimes and adventures, I was always loyal, and faithful. I never had any interest of straying or difficulty with commitment (even though I was the one who needed convincing to get married). I vowed to be such, because of the pretty simple fact that I did love you - and when someone genuinely loves another, everything else comes quite naturally. I want you to know that I was always honest with you. Granted I've told a handful of (innocent) white-lies, but they were never anything that would be detrimental to our relationship. They were just silly ones I told so that you wouldn't feel bad or uncomfortable ..like.. ""No, that shirt doesn't look too tight on you"" and ""Yes, you're the biggest I've ever had"". 


We had a pretty good run for a couple that had a (hidden) underlying foundation of deceit. Our marriage has about run it's course, and it's time to close things up. I can see from the unknown number that you've been calling me with - you're aware that I've blocked you on my phone. As you can imagine, I needed to do a little realigning in my life. I've started some new thing based off of self-control that's (supposedly) fantastic for letting go and moving forward. According to the breakup community (had no idea that was even a thing, by the way) it's referred to as ""NC"" or No-Contact"". I personally like to call it ""0F"" or ""Zero-Fucks"". It covers both the mental aspect of the person who is not answering/returning one's attempt to communicate (this is me; I give zero fucks that you are trying to talk to me) ..while simultaneously addressing the caller's curiosity of ""I wonder if I'll get another chance - how many times will she let me sleep with her again"" (that's you, you will be getting a total of zero fucks from me here on out). Regardless of what you call it, I have to say it's been a wicked (literally wicked) discipline to master. 


And so with all that said, I will not be sending this directly to you. In fact, I'm just going to kind of let it dissipate into the wide-world of the interweb. If by chance you do (oddly) stumble upon this; I give you one last cheers, and wish you the best. Of what exactly? I'm not really sure -- luck? wishes? I don't know ..but I do know that you will need something. As you are about to have one hell of a time cleaning up this last mess that you've made. 



Very truly ..though now formally yours,

(see what I did there?)"
My boyfriend said yes!!,"I still can’t believe I did it!

Am I allowed to share the story?

He’s my old high school sweetheart. We went our seperate ways after high school. He went off into the military, I, kinda took a wrong turn. I wound up in an abusive relationship, after that ended I hit a low point. Couldn’t pay bills, couldn’t feed myself. I ultimately resorted to taking my clothes off on stage to get by. I’m not ashamed of it, but I do wish things had never come to that.

But my old boyfriend came back from the Army a year ago, and we found each other again. He put me back together, rebuilt my self esteem, and was still the same wonderful boy I remembered him. He never made a negative comment about the things I’d done. He never made me feel like I was a “victim” to my ex. He just accepted me and everything that had happened.

We’ve been back together for a year now. He’s the only man I trust completely (no offense guys, not your fault), and I decided last month that I wanted to keep him forever.

I got him a ring and wrapped it under the tree. I fought the urge to run back out and hide it again all night. And this morning when we opened presents.........it had fallen behind the table our tree is on, and I was too scared to point it out to him. It seems so stupid now. I know he loves me. I never doubted that for a second. He’d never put up with all my crap otherwise. 

But I still worried that I’d lose him again. Maybe he’d wise up and realize he could land someone so much better than a former stripper and battered victim for a wife. I don’t know.

We spent all day at family events while I had that big nervous ball in the pit of my stomach. And then tonight we get home and I just told him there was one more present for him under the tree for him.

He opened it up, then looked at me while I dropped to a knee like a doofus (because that’s what you’re supposed to do, right?) and then he hugged me and told me he’d love to marry me. 

Even with every stupid decision, even with my crazy emotions, even though he has to watch his volume because I get scared when someone yells around me, he still wants to marry me.


.....and then he went and grabbed the engagement ring he’d intended to give me on New Years!

Marry Christmas everyone!!"
To all the slim women who feel obligated to be thick:,"I am a thick woman by definition and I want you to know that my entire life, including now, I've always wanted to be slim and look delicate and slender. I know my body will never be like that as badly as I want it to be, so I want you women to know that you are gorgeous and intensely sexy in a delicate, svelte way. Don't you ever feel like less of a woman or less attractive because you don't look like someone else. Love yourself and your body because although the media tells us we should look a certain way, the reality is that a lot of us just want what we don't have. I also have curly hair but have always wanted straight hair, and people with straight hair tell me they want my curls. 

We should all stop beating ourselves up. We're beautiful just as we are and we need to actually start seeing that.

Be kinder to yourself. If you aren't who will be? "
Forgotten Birthday by Best Friends,"I'm a newly 17 year old female. My birthday is today. My closest friends always make a big deal out of their birthdays. As I do theirs. As soon as it reaches midnight, we spam happy birthday in the group chat. One of my bestfriends birthday was earlier, about 20 days before mine. As soon as it reached midnight, everyone was online, spamming hearts. This happened for the rest of everyone too. Then comes my birthday. I go into the group chat. No one is online when it reaches 12. I know me crying and being sad about this is absolutely stupid. But it just really sucks. I know I've been the subtle ""least important"" one for a while now. But it hurts. Because I always make sure they're feeling loved when it reaches midnight for their birthday. It's been a hard year for me. It just really hurts. I'm stupid for relying on them."
I am a 25 year old straight man who just surprised himself by accepting a date with another guy.,"I don't know where exactly to post this.  I'm a traditionally heterosexual guy, only dated and slept with women. My porn is almost exclusively lesbian/heterosexual.  I haven't really wondered what it's like to experiment with a man before, although like everyone I've run it through my mind a couple times to see how it feels. 

I've been in a relationship for the last five years, but we broke up over the summer.  I'm trying not to get into anything new, and just enjoy my time in the city as a single guy for the first time as an adult.  I've slept with a few women since the break up, been on a dozen dates or so. All casual.  

Anyway, today I'm sitting and waiting for the metro to go home from work and this guy sits down next to me.  The train was delayed, and he mentions he hates waiting more than a few minutes because there's no cell service underground.  I tell him my trick is to load up an interesting article on my phone before coming down, and I read that while waiting.  

He asks me about the article, and we talk about it for a few minutes.  We talk about where we're taking the train to (I'm going home, he's going to dance practice).  

The train comes, and I take a seat. He asks if he can take the seat next to me, and I say of course. Now, this guy was fairly effeminate so I figured he was probably chatting me up because he was interested, but he wasn't being flirty and I love talking to people, so I didn't want to throw out a ""by the way I'm straight.""

I ask him about his dancing, he asks me about work.  He's actually pretty easy to talk to, and we're making each other laugh, so I'm enjoying the conversation.  He finally gives me his name, and I give him mine. We shake hands, and he gives me *the most flirtatious eye contact I have ever had*. 

I felt it like a jolt of electricity through my body.  And in a moment things were just *different*.  I suddenly found myself thinking ""oh, this guy is pretty good looking"" and then all of a sudden I realize I'm talking to a very handsome man who seems to be interested in me, and I get nervous. I realize as we're talking further that I'm...kind of trying to impress him? All of a sudden I care about his opinion of me, and I'm building up myself up a little bit subtley. it was literally like something had awakened in me all at once. 

I get in my head, like ""what am I doing, this is a guy, and I'm very straight.""  At this point, he notices that I'm kind of tearing at the label of my water bottle and asks me with a smile if I'm nervous.  I say no, and kind of...shyly laugh?  I'm surprising myself, literally thinking ""am I a straight guy being coy and flirty with a man I just met on the subway? Why am I doing this? What is happening?""

He says, ""you're cute, [my name]. Would you want to go out with me on Friday?"" And I looked up at him, and as excitedly as if a beautiful woman had asked me the same question, I respond with an enthusiastic ""sure, I'd love to.""  Literally in shock, beside myself.  

We exchange phone numbers, and have really light and vibrant conversation the whole way to my stop. I get off and he says ""text me, I'm looking forward to Friday!""

I texted him almost immediately, and we hammer out the details of our date. We're meeting up for a movie date at my apartment.  He says he wants to watch a scary movie, but that he may need me to be strong for him since he startles easily. It's all turning me on and I'm feeling butterfly-y, I keep replaying the conversation in my head, and smiling the whole walk from the metro stop to my apartment.  The whole while thinking *what in the hell just happened?!*

All of this is just so weirdly exciting.  I left the house this morning a heterosexual man who never really entertained the idea of being with another man, and returned with a date set up with a handsome man *who's coming over to my apartment to cuddle and a watch a movie!*.  What?! 

And I'm weirdly way more excited than the dates I've been on with women since my break up.  I have no idea if I'll sleep with him on Friday or what (I don't know the first thing about having gay sex, honestly, so if anybody here has tips, I'm all ears/eyes), but I'm just excited to see him again.  

I have no idea what this means for me or my sexuality, but I'm a little nervous and kind of pumped for possibly a new chapter in my life.  I've been thinking about it, and I would be totally open to dating and falling in love with a man, if there's a connection like this. I just never knew that I was capable of having one. men were always just buddies to me, you know? 

I'm really excited, but also very confused.  Why didn't I ever really have gay thoughts before? Is this how people find out they're into their own gender?  

Can anyone relate or share similar anecdotes? I'm as perplexed as I am giddy. "
Update: my conservative coworker. I'm going for it.,"First of all, I want to thank all of you for the overwhelming attention - both positive and also very, very negative - my previous posts received. I got a huge kick this weekend out of reading your responses and feedback.

Many of you encouraged me to continue writing on this account, but admittedly I am feeling more than a little trepidation about doing so. In part this is because I don't want to be identified by anyone who might know me. I am sure a great many of us want to fuck our coworkers until they either can't walk without their thighs quivering or they accept that wealth redistribution will save our economy, not destroy it. I am equally sure that few of us publish these thoughts.

My therapist feels I should continue writing. His advice and your requests to read more have inspired me to continue. Also, one woman sent me an entirely unsolicited photograph of her (rather perky and pleasant) breasts and it occurs to me that I should do something (anything, everything) to ensure that happens again.

ANYWAY many of you recommended I ask my coworker out. I have decided to do just that. Inexplicably, I am terrified of her response. So I'm going to procrastinate by letting you know *why* this is such a big deal to me. Getting all that off my chest, where it's sat for years. So. Here we go. 

My wife died on September 26, 2009. Her obituary said she died after ""losing a battle to cancer"". She did not. Cate never lost anything in her life. She was a fierce competitor, dogged in her pursuit of perfection in all things. She did not and could not lose to something so trivial and meaningless as cancer. Cancer snuck up on her in the night and stole the life from her. If cancer had fought fair Cate would still be here; Cate would have methodically conquered it like she methodically conquered anything she wanted to. 

When she passed I was wearing sweat pants. I will never forget that. What if she woke right before? Her last image on earth of her deplorable husband, ugly sleeping in a ratty t-shirt. And sweat pants.

When Teddy Roosevelt's wife died, his journal entry that day had only one line: ""All the light has gone from my life"". I don't feel that way. After Cate died my life had never had any light in it. Any memory of light is gone and any memory of her, however happy, is haunted by the her absence. Even my most cherished memories of her are repositories for great amounts of grief. The night we met is simultaneously the happiest and darkest of all of them. It was '06. I stepped out of a Yeah Yeah Yeahs concert to have a cigarette between sets. Her brown, almond shaped eyes appraised me slowly and she said to her friend, ever so cooly, ""Well, well. Look at this one."" And then I was hers.

That was the first night I saw her easy, crooked smile and I wanted - still want - to see it as much as I possibly could.  And yet in remembering I can only focus on the immeasurable guilt I harbor from the times I made her upset. When angry, her eyes spoke like cannon fire. Each volley traveled the length of her perfect, aquiline nose and struck me, invariably, in the guts. I made her cry. A lot. People make other people cry, I know. I can't stop picturing her standing in the shitty one room apartment I lived in, her curly, black hair covering her face, her shoulders hunched in exasperated defeat, tears streaking her eye make up. Who the hell was I? I don't even remember why we fought. I would pay any price to live that day again.

I asked her to marry me a couple days after we graduated college. I will never know why she said yes. Three months later she was diagnosed. One month after that we had a quick ceremony. We did not have a honeymoon. Six months after we wed I was at her funeral. It was sunny because the universe does not care about the grief of men. I don't remember much else about that day. 

As they lowered my wife into the ground, I silently renewed my vows. I had loved her, and only her, until death parted us. From that moment on I would love her, and only her, forever.

After her death I was not arrested. I did not drink too much. I did not abuse heroin. I quietly settled my affairs and left the city forever. I was so angry those last weeks. I was angry when friends mentioned Cate, angry at the somber looks they would give me before they asked ""How *are* you?"" I was angrier still when they didn't mention her, angry that life went on. I couldn't take that all the places we knew together continued existing. I fled.

I started my job a couple weeks after I moved and that's when I met my coworker. I didn't notice much about her that day except that she was my age, passably cute, and not wearing a bra. Her name is the same at as my wife's, but is spelled with a K and y, seemingly for no reason. She goes by Kate.  At that time, any pang of attraction or desire was an insult to my Cate's memory. I resolutely buried all romantic and sexual impulses beneath my grief.

Still, I've always enjoyed sticking my dick in warm, wet, human places, and this desire, base as it was, couldn't be ignored forever. L was the friend of a friend of a friend, and our circles often intersected, like a big drunken venn diagram. She was chubby, but not big. She wore low cut shirts in a way that said ""Here I am, tits and all."" She was incredibly direct, in all things. Once, she looked over her glasses at me and said ""That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard. You should feel bad for having that opinion."" Her indelible optimism and joyful approach to drinking more than made up for her shortcomings. Late one drunken night L approached me and said ""So are we going home together or what?"" Who says no to that? 

She knew what happened to me. What I was. A widower. On the way to her place I talked about how I wanted her but wasn't sure I was ready. When she pulled down my pants, my dick was flaccid. When she looked at me her eyes were so full of pity and disappointment. I'll never forget that look. She didn't give up, though, and soon I was fully erect. When I came in her mouth I felt an immense wave of relief followed by am immense wave of guilt. The next morning I fucked her properly and happily. And I swore to Cate it would only be sex and never, ever anything more.

Over the next few years I met several more women, but no relationship lasted more than a few weeks. I also tried being with a man. I met B at the gym, where I caught him (not so) subtly checking me out as I showered. I think it surprised me just as much as him when I threw my towel over my shoulder and introduced myself. He appeared to enjoy being fucked more than anyone I've ever met. I will always remember the little heart shaped tattoo on his ass, and the sound he made when I first penetrated him. It wasn't a moan, but a pleased whimper followed by a very enthusiastic, mumbled ""Oh god yes"". When I popped I came so much I thought the condom would break. As fun as that encounter was, I couldn't allow myself to love men, either. I got no great joy from sucking B's dick (though years of trying to find new, exciting ways to lick a clit made me pretty good at it). I haven't been with another man since, and likely never will again. 

A year later I realized that being a widower had a curious effect on women. I was always upfront. I told each woman I dated that I wasn't looking for anything serious and why. Yet I feel like being a widower almost made them want me more. The combined look of pity and lust and shock terrified me and, as ever, made me feel guilty. I can think of nothing worse than using your dead wife as a wingman. I stopped seeing anyone. I started noticing my coworker. 

I can see her desk from my office and in moments of boredom I (voyeuristicly) observe her habits. I watch her strum her fingers and fiddle with her smart phone when procrastinating. She is undeniably not my Cate. *My* Cate wouldn't blow her nose twice with the same kleenex. *My* Cate wouldn't drink 7 (7!) Diet Cokes in one day. *My* Cate would never have a tattoo of a cartoon character.

*But I love this Kate*. I love her awful political views. I love her narrow eyes and each of her small, white teeth. I love the curve of her body and the way her breasts bounce when she laughs. I love the careless way she places her hair behind her ear. I love her goofy jokes. I love her fashion sense. I love her addiction to lip balm. I love the way her skin looks pearlescent. I love this Kate too. I can't run from that anymore. 

And I'm going to do something about it. Today. I am so sorry, Cate. I never want to get over you and I hope I never will. But it's time to carry on. Because I want and need so desperately what everyone on the planet wants and needs so desperately: to love and to be loved. 

I'm not going to do some grand, romantic gesture. I'm not going to ask Kate to have me, broken as I am, forever. I'm going to invite her for drinks, just the two of us. And I'm going to find out if she does -  or could -  love me back, broken as I am.

Well, well. Look at this one."
I got my degree!! I freaking did it!,"Me, a little girl born to crackhead rapists, broke out of that life and made something of herself. I’ve already served my time in the military, saw the world, and now finished school. And it wasn’t easy after I failed my first semester and had to claw my way back up. Sure I’m 26 and still constantly fight feelings of being “behind the curve” of my peers. But I did it. Still waiting to hear if I got the job after my government interview but my god life is sweet now

EDIT: Wow thanks everyone! Reading all your comments has made so happy, you guys are the best. Also for this of your still reading, I just found out I’m advancing in the process for my government job! Here’s to strong finish this year!"
My boyfriend made me so happy I cried last night.,"We met up with some friends at a bar, had a great time and he got little more drunk than he probably should have.

I get a little tense when he's drunk. My ex used to drink, too, and it always made him mean. 

But I helped my boy up to the apartment and plunked him in bed, and I figured he was out for the night. 

But when I climbed into bed next to him he rolled over and looked at me and smiled, and said ""You're so pretty."" Then he laid his head on my chest and passed out.

I don't know why, but it made me cry. My family never thought I was pretty. My old crush never thought I was pretty. My ex went as far as telling me I'm *not* pretty.

But my boy thinks I'm pretty. I'm so happy."
"It’s dumb but my dog who is very old is my best friend, and I’m so scared to find his body whenever he dies.","My dog is 13 years old, he can’t go on big walks anymore and he has some minor breathing problems, but because of this my family practically disowned him. 
Yes, he still lives with us and yes my mom still feeds him, but no one pays attention to him anymore since my mom got a “replacement dog” (literally that’s what she said) 
I’m the only one that loves him still, I check on him I pet him I hangout with him. But because I’m the only one who worries about him, the chances are pretty high I’ll be the one to find his body. 
Makes me sad and also scared. 
Sorry this is a dumb post 


EDIT: thank you random stranger for my first silver!


EDIT 2: All the rest of my family still “claims” to love Burrito (that’s my dogs name) they just don’t show it (their words not mine) so they still kind of have souls maybe? And for those wondering I’m a 24yo grown ass woman who handles death like a child. "
My abusive ex committed suicide in front of me yesterday and I don’t feel anything about it.,"My ex and I dated for 5 years. 2 of those years were amazing, but the last three were hell. He was physically, mentally, and sexually abusive, but mostly mentally and sexually. 

Every time he’d physically hurt me outside of sex, he’d always blame me for pushing him to hurt me, then try to kill himself. He’d run into traffic and get hit by a car. Or try to overdose. Or stab himself. I always helped him after, called the ambulance, stayed with him until I knew he was ok. 

We broke up almost two years ago, and he never fully accepted that we were over. I never really felt free from him - he still controlled me, only I had put some distance between us. The abuse didn’t end, but it lessened. I figured that was good enough. I never did anything or talked to anyone about the abuse. He told me I deserved it, and I believed him. Our mutual friends still thought he was a great guy. 

I recently met a group of amazing people who convinced me that the things he did were horrible and wrong, and I deserved to be free from him. With their encouragement, I gathered all the evidence and went to the police.

He found out. A mutual friend I thought I trusted told him that I’d gone to the police. And he went ballistic. I went to stay with a friend he didn’t know, and I thought I was safe.

I don’t know how he found me, but somehow he found where I was staying. My friend let him into his house (not knowing it was him), and he came after me. After pushing me around and attempting to shoot me, he shot himself in the head. I didn’t help him. I just left him there. 

Right after it happened, I had so many questions - why it happened, why he couldn’t leave me alone, why he didn’t just kill me. But I’m never going to get answers to those questions, so why think about them? All I know is my friend and I are safe, and I’m finally free from him. 

Now I don’t feel anything. I just feel cold. My head hurts from where he pushed me into the wall, and my ears are in pain and ringing, but I don’t feel sad or angry or guilty. I just feel empty. I’ve gotten so many texts today blaming me for his death. I’ve had friends tell me I’m reacting wrong, or I’m a psycopath for not being depressed. I don’t know whether I’m a monster or broken or what. Maybe it just hasn’t hit me yet. 

I apologize if this doesn’t make sense. I haven’t slept since it happened. 

Edit -

I finally managed to get some sleep, and I’m blown away by all the support. Thank you all so much for your kind words. I’m at work, but I want all of you to know that I have read every comment and I appreciate every one. To answer something I’ve seen a lot - I’ve ended contact with all of our mutual friends and have contacted my therapist and psychiatrist to set up appointments. 

Again, thank you to all of you."
Everywhere I go is a fucking petting zoo,"Generally in the face of tragedy I find it incredibly annoying when people use that to draw attention to themselves or their religion, cause, whatever. Someone died, they deserve their day of remembrance like everyone else. 

However, this time, the tragedy did feel very personal. Though I know Reddit is not free from ridicule, this is the place I feel most comfortable and least judged in posting this story.

About 5 years ago, I was working for Apple retail. I checked the morning's appointments one day, and there was an appointment made for a ""Robin M Williams"". We all thought ""No way!"" and went on with our day. 

The time came, and a man walked into our store wearing a black fedora, sunglasses and a black polo shirt. He approached our Concierge ""Excuse me, I have a genius bar appointment"" ""May I have your name sir?"" ""Robin Williams"".

The concierge looked up in shock, stuttering ""Okay sir, please go to the back of the store and a Genius will be with you momentarily"". 

I was there in the back. I saw him walking forward and knew who it was. I was straightening up some phone cases and pretending I did not see Mrs Doubtfire 3 feet from me, as I was taught to do. He leaned over and just asked me how I was doing. 

Shocked, I stumbled over my words ""Not too bad today, and yourself?"" ""Well I thought I finally had a day off today."" ""Me too, friend.""

He had to come back to the store a couple of times for his computer to get repaired. The second time he returned, everyone noticed who he was and the picture taking began. It was cool that he was open to it and offered to take pictures with everyone. 

While we were posing for our picture, he looked to me and said ""you don't want to be me. Everywhere I go is a fucking petting zoo."" I laughed, ""I can only imagine!"".

At the end of the day, he returned to retrieve his machine. I was dusting or some other retail bullshit, and someone whispered in my ear ""Do they ever let you leave, Bethany?"" I turned around and did all I could not to piss my pants. 

""Only one more hour left for me. Then maybe tomorrow I can actually have my day off!"" He responded ""I haven't had one in over 30 years."" On his way out, he waved goodbye. 

Though the words were few and seem pretty insignificant, they mean a lot to me. It was a very true human moment we had. He was just like everyone else. He worked hard, he was kind to those around him, and he just wanted a day off, like everyone else. At the time the things he said were just funny. Now as I recall that day, those words have a whole new meaning. Words that were once funny, are now terribly tragic.

"I believed March 2017 to be the end. January 2019, I'm here. Happy.","After many years of suffering under my mother, and a couple poor choices in men, I sat up in bed one day and yelled, *""Why is living so hard?!""* I spiraled out of control... dropped out of college, stopped paying any bills, burned through 10k in inheritance (on mostly overdraft fees!!), alienated any and everyone, stopped doing basic hygiene... 2016 was the year I rotted.    
  
March of 2017 I spent my last few dollars on a bottle of sleeping pills, and downed them after getting home from work. I don't remember anything that happened for a while after that... just waking up and crying that I couldn't even kill myself, and being out of money to try again.  
  
Somehow, I still had my job and apartment. Thanks to a couple true friends, I was able to slowly crawl out of the pit and become emotionally healthy. By the end of 2017, I was stable.  2018 was spent working on my financial and professional health.  
  
Now, in 2019, my income has doubled, I'm with the love of my life, have a cat, volunteer, and generally live a wonderful life. There is so, so much I almost missed out on. My life was never ruined. Everything is alright. I am alright."
My dad and brother found my vibrator,"A little background info: I come from a very conservative family. I (21f) am not allowed to wear shorts, date boys, show my skin provocatively (whatever that means!), drinking is allowed but I can’t do it in front of my parents. 

ANYWAY... so without my knowledge my dad and brother were moving my bed and found my vibrator. A hot pink, dick shaped, battery powered (and with 15 settings might i add) vibrator. So I come home to my dad ignoring me completely and my brother who is 19 yrs old followed me into my room, where he told me how disgusted he was of me and how he couldn’t look at me the same ever again. He continued with “no girls go out of there way to buy things to pleasure themselves” that it wasn’t normal like it is for guys and the only girls that he did know with toys were gross and “asking for it.”

My dad ended up telling my mom and the whole thing was kind of like a bad dream, I had to answer questions about if I have sexual urges and why. (Cuz I’m fucking 21 and HORNY) No one in the house spoke to me for about three weeks. I cried every night, I started off by thinking there was nothing wrong with me and then they started to get to me. 

Fast forward a few weeks and I have apologized to all of them, they talk to me again and everything is normal. My dad cracks jokes everyone is happy. But I can’t help but resent all three of them and it’s sad because they are my family but I just don’t like the kind of people that they are. Neither one of them cared that I went to work with puffy eyes everyday (from the crying) and that their words really hurt me and I’m not okay and I’m allowed to be angry right back at them. 

Thanks for reading, it’s nice to get that off my chest."
Found out BF was cheating on me while he literally pooped his pants,"So my friends and I went away to go partying for the weekend. Had cigars, champagne, nice hotel room so we were good to go. My boyfriend at the time was also in the same place with his mates. I was excited to see him because he had been distant lately and acting a little shady. Finally met up with him and he was blind drunk and been abandoned by his friends. So I took him back to our hotel room to look after him.

My friends hated him because he treated me like shit sometimes. Was never violent or abusive just a genuine asshat. So they told him he could only come in if he drunk a glass of vodka. He did despite my protests. Later they bid me farewell to hit the clubs. By this point he had vomited all over himself and I was bathing him like a baby. But hey that’s what a good gf does.

It got to the point where I couldn’t take care of him alone and I knew his older sister was in town. So when I helped him to the toilet I asked him if I could use his phone to call his sister. He mumbled yes. So I went in to call her. As I looked for her number a text popped up from a girl saying “where are you? X” naturally I clicked into and it was bad. I then went into full investigation mode and went through all his texts and fb messages (terrible I know, this has been the one and only time I have ever looked through a boyfriends phone, but honestly what would you have done if you saw that?) turns out my bf had been sending thirsty messages to every girl he knew. Dating back for our entire relationship. I mean this boy was the definition of a fukboy. 

Almost all of the replies were “no”,  “please stop messaging me”, “I have a boyfriend”. But he managed to bang some and it was awful to read. Honestly the sheer amount of thirst. He’d triple text, harass these girls and their friends, send nudes. I was utterly disgusted. So I did end up calling his sister. She said she was on her way so I hung up. Went back to the bathroom and he was lying on the ground and had shat himself. He shat is pants so bad it went up his back. I left him there, lying in his own shit and poured a glass of wine. I went through and deleted my number off his phone, erased all our photos and messages, everything.

I’m not a complete biatch so I helped his sister carry him to her car. I told her what happened and she was embarrassed and apologised for his behaviour. When we got him strapped in he started to come round and finally told me he loved me for the first time. I replied by slamming the door in his face. Went back to the room. Cried. And blocked him on everything. When he came to the next day he was distraught. He kept hitting up all my friends about why I had erased him from my life and they ignored him too. It drove him crazy. His own sister didn’t tell him either for a while. She and I really got along. Weeks went by and he started showing up where I lived pleading with me. By now everyone knew about the destruction of pants because my friends told his.

He never found out why dumped him and it destroyed him. I know I should feel bad but I really don’t, I’m sure his sister told him eventually, or he figured it out. It was a tough experience, I cried a LOT, but after him I vowed to never let myself be treated like that again. And so far I haven’t. I’d like to think he’s changed now, like I taught him some kind of lesson. But tbh I never really think about him. I’m glad I was never one of those girls who believes the “he will change”. Cause now I have a caring, faithful, amazing boyfriend....who doesn’t poo his pants."
"My husband is dyslexic and the way he spells ""potato"" is the cutest damn thing I ever saw","It comes out as ""pattoo"" every single time. All the right letters as well, just absolute textbook jumbling. I LOVE IT IT'S SO CUTE OMG."
I'm 31 Days Clean and I Can't Tell Anyone,"Just over a month ago I decided to clean up my act and as of today I haven't touched cocaine or pot in 31 days, even when I had someone do both of those things in front of me. I quit smoking 14 days ago as well. Strongest thing I've touched in a month is a couple of painkillers for a migraine.  I don't have anyone I can tell this to, either because they never knew I did any of this stuff or because they are to into it themselves to care, but I'm really proud of myself. "
My brother saved my life and he doesn't even know.,"A few nights ago when I was at work I started to feel whole with myself, as though I was ready to go. I did not want to be here any more. I was going to clear my bank account and give random people $100 as I walked from my car, through a city and to a tall building.

I planned this attempt my whole drive home from work. I was going to clear the account friday, figure out a way to buy a bottle of whiskey (I'm 20) and after handing out money to strangers (those of you questioning this, I wanted to do something good for those who weren't expecting it. Like it was my last good deed. Pluss I wouldn't need the money anymore anyways) i was going to find a way to the top of a building and drink untill I had the balls to jump. 

I sat in my office chair at home playing a game on my PS4 still planning because I knew it would be easier said than done, when I got a text from my brother. This is unusual considering he does not text me often. He is the same age as me and I see him a few times throughout the year. He said, hey sis!? I replied, yes? 
Do you have a second?
Kinda, why?
I have a song I want you to hear.
Ok, what's the song?

He then sent me some Rock song that I ended up liking. We talked for a few more hours about music and he sent me a couple of his favorite songs including some that made him think of me. I forgot about the suicide plan and listened to his music for the rest of the night, crying. I do not want to tell him because I do not want him to worry. But someone needs to know, my brother saved my life and I will forever be great full twords him.

Edit: thank you for everyone giving me so much support. It's nice to see people care about one another even when they don't know them. I love you all. "
I lost today...and it is going to cost me everything,"I don't have anybody to tell, but I broke down today. My cancer is winning, and there is nothing left to try. Today I got the news that I will die soon. I am struggling to breath just from how much I want to live. I am in my twenties, and I will never experience some of the basic things life has to offer. I wanted to marry, I wanted kids, I wanted a family, I wanted to travel, I wanted to eat, I wanted to see the world... and most of all, I wanted to make a scientific contribution. I don't know how to say goodbye, but I think I am coming to peace with it. 





EDIT #1: Thank for your support, each and everyone of you. For the first time, I am literally having trouble finding words to describe my feelings. I did not expect this post to get much attention, I thought I was just posting to a quiet corner of reddit.

EDIT #2: I will do my best to respond to each of you over the next few days. Right now, I am reading every comment and PM, and thanking you out-loud. I am feeling much stronger thanks to all of your kind words. 

Some of your questions are complicated/deep, and I do not want to give an answer I don't fully believe in. I will think about what you have said and compose my self before replying.


EDIT #3: Thank you to all that suggested donating my body to science. I am already an organ donor, but I will ask if that extends towards becoming a cadaver for medical students as well.

Honestly, thank you everyone for all your support, I really appreciate it. I am still replying to each and every comment and PM, there are just so many and they keep on coming. I try to do 2-3 pages of my message box a day.



I just want to add that, for those of you PM'ing me with a ""cure"", I will follow up, but it almost feels like I'm being mocked.

Goodbye reddit. Thank you for all the laughs"
I fucked up my whole life this very morning,"I was for 3 years a full time delivery driver. I loved my job. I wasted it all this morning. I drove more than twice the speed limit because I was angry after a very sudden and stressful event and I got busted. Now I have a 1500$ ticket and I'll soon loose my driver license. I also lost my job. I haven't told girlfriend yet, she's having a stressful day at work. If it wasn't about the fact that I love her and that she holds very much to me, I'd probably have jumped off a bridge. Thanks internet for providing me a place to at least write some of my thoughts. I might update this post once in a while. Wish me good luck and courage

Edit : To anyone who has commented, I want to thank you. I've announced the news to my gf, she was torn to learn all of this but we'll keep our head up and go forward. That's the only way. 
Today's the first morning after the events. Today I'll be applying here and there and hope for the best. It is ripping my insides not to do my usual routine and just going back to my beloved little job. I feel like I'm having a nightmare and I might wake up soon. Maybe are all of you right, maybe it had to happen. I'm conscious that what I did was dangerous but on that road I've taken, there is never anyone on foot, or ever really a cop parked there. The only life I risked was only mine. Maybe I should get a lawyer but I doubt there's any chance of reducing the cause. I was alone on that road, arriving at full throttle, when suddenly further down he slope, a hidden cop right. At a place nobody in the world would never have expected. Turns out it was time for me to stop all of this. Thanks again everyone I'll be updating as things goes by

Edit 2: 3 Days later update. 

Once again, your support has been of an unexpected help and has helped me a lot in my darker moments where I was home alone. One more time, thank you to anyone who has commented and shown support. As many of you said, it is just an other step in my life. Rather an abrupt plunge than a step, but hopefully it's for a better future. Nothing irreparable has been done, that's what matters

My SO has also been extremely supportive, she's be exemplary. She helped me keep my head up and see the positive through this. We've worked some solutions and everything should be alright.

I have been looking for a new job non stop since then. Most of those interesting require a driver license. Fortunately, since it is my first big offense, chances are that I might be able to obtain a ""restricted"" license during these these 3 months where my license will be suspended. It means I'll certainly have set hours where I could take the road, for example to go to work, go to the store, but last those hours I won't be able to drive. As it is not guaranteed, I can not apply for a job who requires driving. I've had a few interviews here and there and I've found a job in a food chain! I'll be starting next week and more than that, during that afternoon I'll be having an interview for a closer job into a grocery store. Everything is not lost. 


Once again, I want to thank each one of you personally for your support throughout this. 

EDIT 2018-10-31: Just wanted to make an update, today I realized that life is not so bad. I've found a nice job in a shop, I have the same work schedule but since I don't have the huge withdrawals on my pay for the insurances of driving 40 hours a week, even if I'm slightly over the minimum wage, I still have a nice pay at the end. My license will be suspended for 3 months in 2 weeks but it's not the end of the world, my new coworkers are very nice and they will lift for work and back home. I've taken an arrangement for my ticket and I'll have 13 months to pay this 4 digits ticket which is quite reasonable. Today I realized that this whole thing might be the biggest mistake of my life so far, but life goes on, and giving up on life at the moment where it all happened would have been an incommensurable mistake. Thanks again to everyone from the bottom of my heart "
"As a victim of child sex abuse, discovering the existence of MAPs makes me want to kill myself","MAP stands for minor attracted person. I found them on twitter. They exist. They say they are non-offending and their desire for children doesn’t make them any less. But I just see them as ticking time bombs.

I was sexually abused when I was 10. I was ten years old, by my uncle. I was staying at my aunts house, and her husband did things he shouldn’t. He was a pedophile and he was married, played soccer and lived a normal life. We were supposed to be friends. He liked me more than my sister, because we had things in common. We were supposed to be friends.

Since finding MAPS I want to kill myself. I was fine before, never was suicidal in my entire life. But seeing these pedophiles have a community and idk I can’t put it into words. There are people who support them. They justify their “desires”. They don’t think they should be ostracized by children. Someone said they just want to be friends. Well he was supposed to my friend. That’s how it started.

I don’t want them to exist, calling it a mental illness hurts me. I have a mental illness because I want to kill myself. They have sexual desires and fantasies about YOUNG CHILDREN. They have a community, they are supported. They have compassion. I want them to wipe off the face of the earth. AT THE VERY LEAST AND I MEAN IT. They should not be allowed any children. So yes, they should be ostracized from their families, because families have children. They should not be allowed to have any of their own. They should not be allowed near schools. OFFENDING OR NOT

I was so good. I was doing so good. I was so happy for so long. I was at peace. I found forgiveness. And now I want to die.

Im supposed to be 19 in a few months. Idk if ya girl will make it.

Edit: Thank you so much for everyone who responded to this and gave some support. You guys helped me out more than words can explain. Just the smallest bit of encouragement makes me feel like I can breathe again.

To the person who gave me gold. I’m still new to reddit and I don’t know what it means. But thank you for your support too.

To the MAP apologist. Idk why tf you thought this was the right platform to advocate for them. It’s a free country, but it’s the last thing I want to see right now.


Edit: HEY EVERYONE, Thank you so much for all the support. I know I'm not responding, but I see and appreciate it. It's kind of hard to respond to this kind of things, but thank you."
Dont know anymore,"So here is the rambling. Keep in mind that im not *expecting* advises, but they are reeeeally appreciated. 
------------------

I m so angry i have no idea what im doing, im wasting my time, I feel shitty, I have exams and I fukced up on the last ones and lost a lot of marks, I have headaches that are not that hard but way too annoying than normal, i have anxiety and i want to kill myself(ironically, kinda) i dont know what to do. Also, summer is coming soon so im pretty much fucked  because last summer, i really had nothing to do, i was almost completely isolated but with my parents yelling at me for stuff on top of that and I got depressed 

I domt know what to do, i have no idea how im going to survive life from now on because there is nothing im looking forward to. 

Thanks for reading >:D

E: lmao kinda overwhelmed by the inbox 

Late edit: I ended up doing very well at my exams and even a little better than last term!"
My son is a straight A student in life,"My mom called said she fears my son is being bullied by his schoolmate. I asked him if that's so, but it turned out he voluntarily gave the money to the kid because the kid is poor. It looks like he's being bullied because the kid is bigger in built than him. I took him aside and tell him its OK if he's ashamed to admit of being bullied but my son took me to see the kid's parents and true enough they were barely making enough money and my son felt he has more than the kid so why not share his pocket money w him.

My son understand he has slightly more than others. From that day, I gave him extra pocket money to share w the other kid. I packed him extra snacks because I want his friend to enjoy having his own. During my son's birthday I invited him to join us but he declined said he has to go home look after his sister. I found out he's ashamed that he has no presents for my son.

My son brought the leftover cake the next day. To see the joy on his face, the big grin to have the cake...""I never had cake on my birthday. My parents couldn't afford this."" My son cried when he comes back home. Next thing we know, he packed half his toys and give it to him. ""Take it, don't worry bout it. I have plenty.""

Last week we found out his friend's father passed away. The mother barely make enough money alone so my mom volunteer to look after her daughter for free (my mom babysit for some neighbour's kid btw so its not an issue to her at all) so that her son can go to school and not to have stay at home to look after his sister. My son was overjoyed to know that his friend can come stay w us after school before the mother fetch them after work everyday. They have been close friends ever since and even though my son is smaller than him, he acted as a protector to this friend (his friend was the one who got bullied at school: he's really poor that his school shoes has holes, he has only a pair of school uniform, and use plastic bag for his books instead of a bag).

Look, I am not here to brag. I just want to get it off my chest because my son is 8 years old and he shows that he understands that when you have more money, to not raise your standard of living but instead to raise the standard of your giving. I have watched him grow up in front of me wishing for him not to just excel in school, but excel in life as a person. If he doesn't get good grades in school, I'm OK w it knowing he will grow up being a better person.

And I'm an Asian parent. Not all Asian parents want their kids to be straight A student at school, I want my son to be straight A student in life. 

Edit: grammars and typo

Edit 2: GOLD. Thank you kind random stranger! 

Edit 3: well didn't know it'll blow up like this. But you guys are awesome w the kind words. To those who PM me, thank you for the offer to help but can't think of any now and my son's friend seems content w what he has now. It's a wonder when we have less but we feel happier, I guess that apply to this kid. I am not here to seek for help or money, just retelling a story of a son that makes me crazy proud of him and the tale of his friend who has less but made my kid learn responsibility from young age. The kid has this condition where one of his leg grew slightly longer than the other one that it's unbalanced. Imagine having to walk and drag one leg at the same time...yeah something like that. So he qualify to get monthly help/assistance from local welfare department and some NGOs are interested to sponsor his school fees for the next term. On the other hand, the mother seems a bit reluctant to accept help but my mom is having none of it and every time she voice out her uneasiness, my mom always tell her ""pay it forward next time"". OK to those who wants to help, pay it forward, like my mom said. If you know someone in need, provide assistance for them and let's hope everyone pays it forward next time."
So Fucking Happy,"I don't even know that all of this is real and has happened/is happening. It feels like a dream. 

Bought a house in 2014 despite crushing student loan debt, shitty job, and no idea what I was doing.  I just sold the house and got enough equity to buy a newer, bigger, better house, pay off all of my debts (student loan, credit card, Lowe's card, IRS), and actually have money in savings. 

I have been hustling for what seems like my whole life. Paycheck to paycheck. Trying to make ends meet. Wanting the dream with home ownership (even though everyone told me I was an idiot for wanting to buy a house with my financial situation). Trying to have a savings account, but in reality it would only last until something came up. 

I'm sitting in my new house writing this. Dogs asleep on the floor. Husband watching a movie. And literally just paid off everything. I feel so lucky and happy and like I can finally breathe. "
Instagram culture is toxic,"Everything is about looking good on camera, looking good is the most important thing in the world, and likes/followers/comments are how you get your validation. This is how a lot of my old friends are and it’s so crazy to me how easy it is for people to get sucked into this constant need for validation. Does anyone else feel the same way? I had to remove myself from that friend group entirely and delete Instagram for awhile to get away from it."
Today a guy I was talking to on Tinder made me cry,"I’ve been using tinder lately for the hell of it; to make new friends, find guys who I can vibe with or even just simple hookups. I’ve never met anyone or have gone on dates through tinder, so this has all been new to me.

I matched with a guy who took incredible photos (on his Instagram which I saw through his profile).

We talked casually about cats, school, life. Somehow we got onto the topic of friendships and relationships, and I ended up opening up about my anxiety and my previous toxic relationship with my ex.

He listened throughout it all, and gave me nice advice, and was incredibly understanding about it. To him, he was probably just being ‘normal,’ and sympathizing, but to me, it meant the world that someone cared to listen and consider my feelings. I ended up uglycrying into my pillow at his thoughtful responses.

Maybe he’s just nice to get in my pants, or maybe he wasn’t even that considerate in his perspective. But this just reminded me kindhearted people exist and how a few simple words still impact me so much.




EDIT / UPDATE: Wow, I didn’t expect this to get any attention!

For me, I’m not personally looking for a relationship right now. I’m still learning to get over my ex, so it wouldn’t be fair for the guy (if he’s interested in me any more than a friend). 

I’m also leaving here (South Korea) to back home (Canada) in 3 weeks since I only came for an exchange semester for university, while the guy is leaving to Prague in 2 weeks for an exchange semester there. 

We both like photography and small indie cafes here so we’re planning to hang out when we have time. We also both want to vlog and do small cafe tours and he wants me to make my last month here ‘flourish’ (since I’ve been staying home for the past 3 months crying and only going back and forth from home and school mourning over my breakup). 

We’re also keeping things platonic since we’re both leaving so soon! It sucks we didn’t meet each other sooner, but we’ll be keeping in touch as friends across the world~

Thank you for your sweet comments and worrying that he might just be taking advantage of me. Thank you all for your warnings and advices of taking precaution ❤️ I truly appreciate it."
i just wanna say one thing....,i’m so fuckin thankful for all the ways you can eat potatoes cause damn they’re gods best creation. 
New respect for gym bros,"Yesterday I went to the gym by myself. 

For some of you it might be typical, but I absolutely despise being alone. 

I started out with a good friend about a month ago, but now our classes get in the way of meeting together now. 

And as detrimental as it is, I’m not all that self motivated; half the time I wonder why I’m there.

Fast forward to yesterday, my pathetic ass tried benching a 25 on each side. It seemed doable, no spotter necessary. 

Totally misjudged... i was still regrettably weak. 

I failed my fifth rep and looked like the biggest fool as the weight came down on me. I struggled  red faced to get it up by the end, and only because someone else was there to help at the last sec. I felt the failure roll down my back. And I probably would’ve left too if not for his offer. 

I still don’t know his name, but he was basically the most shredded guy in the place. 

He didn’t laugh at me, or crack a joke, or tell me to get a friend or anything. He actually took me seriously. 

So he looked dead in the eyes, and told me to get ready so he could spot me and teach me the right form. 

It was reassuring. 

I didn’t feel like going home early that day."
"After being homeless last year, I have developed a burning hatred for the homeless (USA)","Let me set the scene: I ended up homeless last year due to incredibly poor financial management. I stayed in a homeless shelter for two months while working nearly 60 hours a week to make enough money to rent a place of my own. It was hell on Earth.

The first few days were easy enough because no one knew me or anything about me. However, like prison, its only a matter of time before they start learning about you and your habits.

For those of you who have never been to a homeless shelter, let me explain how this one worked (should be similar to most):

You get up at 6AM

You eat breakfast

You leave

You return late in the day

I spent a maximum of maybe 6 hours a day at the shelter because I hated it. Every day, some new fucked up thing was waiting to happen to me. There were a group of guys who actively hated me because I got a doctor's note that allowed me to stay in past the wake-up time. They harassed me every time they saw me. There was a guy who wanted to start a fight with me because he thought I stole an apple from him. Another guy wanted to start a fight with me because I wouldn't share my chewing tobacco with him (Pro-tip: DO NOT SHARE YOUR STUFF). In the two month period I was there, nearly 30 different homeless people had this intense hatred for me. 

I worked so goddamn hard to get out of there. Before my final day, I made sure to let each and every one of those fuckers know that I was getting my own place. They started getting real friendly, asking if they could crash at my place when their time at the shelter was up, and I told them to go fuck themselves. I was actively looking to rile them up. It was pathetic of me to want to start shit with homeless guys, but until you've been surrounded by them and start sleeping next to them, you do not understand the burning rage I felt for them.

I got my own studio apartment and motorcycle eventually. I'll see some of those same homeless guys on the street from time to time, and they recognize me immediately. I don't care for their plight or suffering anymore, all I remember is the way they treated me. My memories of that experience still keep me up at night, but I feel I've become stronger from it, even if I'm far more cynical now. I will never, EVER, go out of my way to help out a homeless person whom I don't personally know ever again."
I saw a man hit his wife...,"I was driving to school today and I saw a car to my front right. The man driving turned and violently punched the female passenger. Hard. Like, so hard her head looked like it was coming out the window.  Then he turned to the backseat and violently punched his little boy in the face. In broad daylight, in traffic. It all happened so quickly and I just reacted. 

I put on my hazards and got behind him and started blaring my shitty little horn. He tried to lose me on the interstate but I stayed with him and called 911. I told them everything, what happened, where I was at, his license plate number, anything I could think of. 

I followed them to a walmart where he drove up to the fire lane upfront and almost hit the building. He ran inside, she followed and they left the kid in the car.

She had a bright red mark an her face and the little boy was crying and had a bloody nose and a red face. He hit them so hard.  

I stayed with the car, which was parked really illegally and waited for the police officers.  

I was shaking and crying because all I could think of was him hitting that little boy and I can't stop replaying it in my head. I gave them descriptions and my information. I told them I would give a statement if needed.

They said they weren't able to find the parents inside but they had the little boy.

I hope I saved him from something. I hope the mom sees this as an opportunity to get out of that situation. But more than anything, I hope I helped that little boy. 

I can't unsee it and I'm a mess right now. 

I had a panic attack earlier and all I can think about is that little boy's bloody, red face. 

How do people do that? How do they hurt little ones? There's a level of personal responsibility with adults but children have no choice. That little boy didn't ask for that.

I'm so hurt by the world sometimes.

**Edit/Update: First, thank you all for your words, they're really making me feel love all around and I need it right now. I came home and hugged my little boy and sobbed. Took a scalding hot shower and went for a run. Things are still very fresh in my brain and I'm still trying to process everything I think. I keep hearing the little boy cry if my brain is quiet for a second. It's kinda rough and raw right now but it will get better. I'll seek resources. 

I mentioned below that I was knocking around going into social work and I believe that this morning really solidified that question. Working with the officers and helping the little boy as much as I could was enough for me to decide emphatically that that is the career I belong in. 

There was an update from the police officers I spoke to: they ended up finding the parents. They were in the changing rooms together and they had taken clothing and makeup and were changing clothes and she was applying the makeup. The officer told me he had some heavy warrants out for his arrest and they may not have found him if I hadn't called everything in.

There were witnesses that gave statements about his erratic driving and how I tended to the child. I certainly hope that man goes away for a long time.

Again, thank you, every single one of you.**"
Domestic violence against men is not a fucking joke,"I was having a drink with my friend when she mentioned that she had seen one of our mutual acquaintance's boyfriend with a black eye. She said she'd asked him how he got it to which he replied that his girlfriend did it to him. She then started laughing like it was something hilarious. I said to her that it's not a joke, and that if it was his girlfriend with the black eye she wouldn't be laughing. She then said ""well yeah obviously what kind of man gets beaten up by his woman"". I couldn't believe it and was starting to get more irritable, I replied that people like her is the reason men don't come forward to report domestic violence against them. She laughed again and said that domestic violence against men is minuscule compared to cases against women. I tried to explain to her that that is partly due to under reporting but it wasn't registering with her. She just kept laughing and saying how she can't believe a man can't defend himself against a woman who's physically weaker. She could see I was becoming more and more irritated by her views so she dropped it. 

Domestic violence against men is not a god damn laughing matter and people need to encourage men to come forward when suffering rather than making them feel ashamed and embarrassed. "
To the couple in the ramen shop tonight: f*ck you.,"Posting this here since I have nowhere else to offload this on so enjoy.

Me and my husband visited our favourite local ramen shop tonight. It’s a tiny joint, with just six tables and is run by a hard-working, sweet Japanese husband and wife. It’s a local favourite so its six tables are always full and there’s almost always people waiting for a seat.

So, a little bit of backstory. My husband has suffered from several ailments throughout his life, one of the first being problems with his ears as a child, resulting in multiple surgeries. He can hear now as an adult and he’s not deaf but he definitely can’t hear as well as most people so he talks a little louder than a lot of people. Nothing crazy, he doesn’t shout, just a tiny bit louder than what is normal but he is suuuuper self-conscious about it and sees himself as an embarrassment which isn’t true at all, and I tell him this almost daily.

He also had a severe car accident when he was a teenager in which he broke his spine. He got a spinal fusion and metal hardware screwed in to keep his spine in place and he’s very lucky to be able to walk today. He still suffers from a great deal of pain many years later because of his accident and has had multiple surgeries over the years and he spent so long being bedbound and depressed that he developed severe anxiety when it comes to leaving the house. I like to think I’ve helped him a lot with this though, and we go out more than we used to. He’s become a lot more confident and I’m so proud of him.

Anyways, back to the story. We ordered an appetiser (which was fantastic) and we were both in high spirits and enjoying our ramen date together when a male and female couple in maybe their late 30s-early 40s walked in and sat down at the table next to us. We barely noticed them as we were so busy enjoying our conversation and amazing food. About ten minutes later, I get a text message from my husband which was strange as he was obviously sitting directly in front of me.

“The couple who sat at the table next to us keeps staring at us, did you notice?”

I didn’t notice but I kept an eye out and sure enough, the lady turned around and stared at us for a few seconds every minute or so. It was super weird. We quietly laughed about it, shrugged it off and carried on with our conversation and meal. Then I hear the man exclaim loudly to the lady “UGH some people talk so LOUDLY!” which was obviously about my husband. 

My husband’s face immediately dropped and it broke my heart because you could visually see that it really hurt his feelings. He couldn’t eat another bite after that so I hurried up and finished my bowl so we could pay and leave. I wanted to say something to them, but the ramen shop is so small and ran by a lovely couple that I just couldn’t make a scene there. I felt that it would be disrespectful and we frequent there a lot so we just upped and left.

But it’s left me so angry. My husband wasn’t even shouting, just talking a little bit louder than everybody else. He can’t help it and nobody else has ever had an issue with it. I just think that it’s so f*cked up that people can be so rude to others when they have no idea what that person has gone through in their life. It takes an awful lot for my husband to even get out of bed some days due to his pain, let alone leave the house and I’m just so damn mad that what should have been a lovely evening together has now been ruined by complete assholes. He’s the sweetest, kindest and most beautiful soul I’ve ever met who has been through hell in his life and he more than deserves to go out and eat dinner with his wife without being made to feel like an embarrassment over something he can’t control.

I know this isn’t the most fascinating story but I needed to get it off my chest. I’m so mad. To the couple at the ramen shop tonight, f*ck you.

EDIT: Thank you so much for the gold! Never expected that. Made a sad evening a little brighter for us. :) 

And also thank you all for your lovely comments. <3

EDIT 2: Didn’t expect this to blow up! Thank you all for the support, am going to show my husband shortly (I’ve just woken up) so hopefully it’ll put a smile on his face! And thank you for the platinum and silver too :)

Also, lol. I wish all the people commenting crap could actually hear his talking volume because then you’d understand why it made me angry. He doesn’t shout, he is just a tiny bit louder than everybody else. Like, when I mean tiny, I mean *tiny*. If he was being overly loud then obviously I would tell him (and DO tell him when he accidentally does sometimes!) but I’m telling you, he was talking at a perfectly acceptable noise volume. 

And something I should have added before is that the couple were completely silent the whole time. Literally said nothing to each other, except to make the rude comment. So my thoughts are maybe that they expected to sit in complete silence and eat, which is fine but ridiculous if they expected everybody else in the restaurant to do so too. 

EDIT 3: So something I forgot to mention originally was that we met up with my husband’s dad and brother at the restaurant but we sat separately to them. And after we left, they stayed. Apparently the couple was really rude to the poor lady serving them and was complaining about absolutely everything. So they were just assholes in general and not specifically just to my husband. Glad we left when we did!"
"I was a teacher, I was arrested for something I did not do. Here’s my story.","So I’m sat here on my sofa, partner in bed because she’s practically done with me. 4 glasses of wine deep, and thinking that it’s time to tell my story. 

All I ever wanted to do was teach, teach kids my passion (music) and show them that the arts is not a “wasted career choice” and as a 24 year old male teacher, I thought I could do it. 

February of this year I got a call about working as a supply (substitute, for my American friends) teacher. Back story, I have a degree in music technology and music performance, i then trained for 2 years to become a fully fledged teacher. I did this, and graduated with honours at the top of my class. Supply work was my “Foot in the door” if you will. It would have hopefully led me on to bigger and better things in the future. 

I was assigned by my company to a secondary (high) school in my local area. “Great” I thought, right on my door step, no travel expenses and I know the area perfectly. At the time, I had moved in with my loving partner and her step son. I can’t tell you how in love we are/were. I adored her and her step son. I finally had my happy family that I wanted, we even got a dog! 

So, I arrive on my first day as a teacher at a new school. Suit, tie, the lot. Time goes by and I make a brilliant impression on my boss, line manager, and pupils alike. All the while working at other schools to get a little extra £££ and to also network with various schools.

Cutting out a chunk here to get to the important part, 9:45am on a Tuesday morning. My boss told me the night before that the school in question did not need me; which is normal, as a supply teacher, you go in to cover sickness, maternity, etc... and I there is no sickness or maternity, you’re not needed. 

My partner here’s a knock on the door, she answers it. Two men are standing there, they ask her if “Joe Public (me) lives here” she replies “yes”. They make their way into the house and proceed to tell me that I am under arrest on suspicion of sexual misconduct with a minor. 

I want to say that my heart sank, but it didn’t.. it was more. I was in tears, my partner was in tears, thinking to myself.. “No, surely not, this is wrong, they must have me mistaken surely.” I was screaming, my partner was screaming. In my book, this is the worst crime you could ever commit and here I am being branded with THAT label.

They took me away, I spent 30 hours in a cold prison cell, my mind as my only friend. Knowing DAMN well I did nothing of the sort. But I’ll tell you, when you’re lay there, sleeping away the hours you start to doubt yourself.. 

“Did I say something inappropriate?”
“Did I make physical contact with a pupil?” 

Of course I didn’t. 

What was to come has been the worst 4 months of my life. 

I was released after 30 hours. Within those hours I was questioned. My charges were that I had sent inappropriate pictures to someone in one of my classes via Snapchat and had an ongoing relationship with the person through social media, Facebook, Twitter etc.. those 30 hours, the police had spent digging through all of my devices (my phone, tablet and laptop). I was released, pending investigation, because nothing was found. 

The next months were hell. 

Due to the allegations made against me, Social services had become involved, meaning I could not be around anyone under the age of 18 on my own, which of course, included my wonderful step son. That was the hardest part. Heartbreaking isn’t the word. How do you begin to tell a 10 year old everything that’s going on around him? He had social service visit him in school, at home and asking him questions such as “Do you like Joe” and “Does Joe ever her angry at you”. There are more obvious questions but I can’t bare to type them. 

I thought about taking my own life. I did. I’m ashamed to say it. I knew DAMN well I was innocent. But I’ve read the news, I’ve read papers, I’ve seen videos on these “paedophile hunters”. I thought I might end up like one of them.. I thought about many things. 

July 27th. The police rang me to declare that everything had been dropped as the allegations were reported to be falsified and no evidence was found in the contrary to the allegations made against me. 

Social services were still on our case for a number of months, refusing independent access to myself and anyone under 18. 

As of now, the case has been dropped and social services have left us be. 

No emotional support or guidance has been offered to me, no compensation, and even though I have been found innocent and a victim of misjustice, i cannot work in a school ever again without them knowing my story, because that is the “protocol”.

I fear that I may have some form of PTSD from the ordeal as I cannot walk on the pavement when there are teenagers there, I live in fear every day that one of my pupils may spot me whilst shopping and shout something out. I live in fear. 

I feel degraded, I feel violated emotionally, and I still have thoughts around my head thinking “what did I do to warrant this?” All I wanted to do was to secure a decent living wage to support my new family. 

The emotional stress on me and my partner has been colossal as I’m sure you can imagine.. 

Apologies for the long text. As mentioned before, I am 4, (5 now) glasses of wine deep, me and my partner have argued and all these memories come flooding back.

There’s more heartache and pain to the story but it’s too much to type and too much to think about. 

Thank you for reading. 


Edit: I just want to say a massive thank you to everyone who has commented something positive. I really have felt alone with this as of late so it’s nice to read some uplifting comments. It’s obvious what I need to do here but I don’t know if I want to. Brining it all back up again after we fought so hard to get it closed. I’m sure you can all understand that. Thank you. 

Edit 2: I feel the need to point out that my partner has been nothing but supportive and loving through the entire thing. She knew how colossally bullshitty the whole thing was and has been by my side through it all. "
I’m in love,"Every time I pass by a bridal shop, I fantasize about seeing my girlfriend in a white dress and marrying her. I’m so in love and I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with her."
I sexually harassed a female friend years ago and later blew her off. #MeToo helped me realize I was wrong.,"Some backstory: I've always considered myself a respectful guy. I guess they all do. In college, I was that guy kicking drunk predators out of my fraternity's parties. I've been in a handful of long term relationships so I've always been a popular platonic friend. Even when I was single, “just friends” never bothered me. In fact, I often preferred that.

This was just before college though when I lived for a year in my own place in the city. I invited a girl who was a year or two younger than me to come hangout at my pool. We weren't super close but had kind of recently become friends. I was recently single but I had no intentions with her, just messing around. At one point, her top got loose and I thought it would be funny if I yanked on the string. She laughed, I laughed, yada yada. I thought it was a funny game and so I persisted – I did it like three more times before the afternoon was over. To me it was kind of a flirty game. The day ended, she went home, so did I. I moved away to go to college shortly after that and we rarely talked. My sophomore year, I randomly texted her to see how she was doing. We talked briefly and she made some comment like ""the last time I saw you, you were sexually harassing me and trying to strip me in public.""

I was horrified. That wasn't how I remembered it at all. 

I said something along the lines of “that’s definitely not what I remember but sure” and I stopped replying.

It’s been four years since that conversation. I saw plenty of awful things in college – guys who took advantage of situations without true consent – and I swore I would never be that. One time when I was my fraternity chapter’s president, I pulled a clearly intoxicated girl away from a bad situation, took her to her place, helped her into bed and despite her asking me to stay, left. The next day, she told me how shocked she was that I was respectful enough to not take advantage of her vulnerability. That was one of many days I realized how bad it really is for girls in college – that a normal guy doing a normal thing like not raping/assaulting a drunk female was somehow an accomplishment.

Lately, I’ve seen a lot of the #MeToo stories come to the forefront of the news. Initially, I thought to myself “I’m so glad I was raised right to not do those types of things.” Then one day, I remembered that girl from the pool. I wasn’t better than anyone. I was part of the problem just like everyone else. I was the reason she could have tweeted #MeToo.  That realization was almost soul crushing.

It took me a few days to build up the courage but I texted her a few days ago. I explained that I had no excuse, that I didn’t expect or need a reply from her, but she was owed the truth from me: what I did was wrong, was without consent, and I’m sorry for putting her in that situation. Even more, I’m sorry for the way I blew her off when she first told me how it made her feel. I’m the problem just like all the guys I thought I was better than.

She didn’t reply until yesterday. She just said “thank you. I really appreciate that.” I left it alone after that.

I know this is long winded but it’s something I just want to get out there. The #MeToo movement, victims speaking out publically for the first time in the news every day, it does more than raise awareness for other victims. In my case, it was the reason I realized I was a part of the problem. Not because I was a frequent offender but because my mindset was wrong. The first step in changing is acknowledging that I have contributed to the same problem that has hurt millions of women. 

I hope this was the first step in me becoming a part of the solution instead."
"Today is the best, proudest day of my life and I can't tell a single soul","Two years ago I was arrested on pretty serious drug charges.  Since this was my first and only offense (ever!) I was offered a fair plea deal. I pled guilty to four felony charges and my sentence was 3yrs probation,  50 hours community service and $3000 in fines.   As a convicted felon,  I gave up **all** of my civil liberties - I couldn't vote,  leave the state or own a gun.   I submitted to weekly drug tests where the nurse stood in the room &  *watched me*  pee in a cup to avoid cheating.   Finding a job,   *any*  job,  was next to impossible. 
 
But,  Goddamn it, I did it!   I found a shitty job,  paid my fines,  volunteered 50 hours at an animal shelter & passed every random drug test they gave me.   I've been 100% clean & sober since April 9, 2014.  My probation officer went to bat for me and petitioned the court for early release.   Today the court ruled in my favor and I was given back my freedom.   My felonies were reclassified as misdemeanors, my civil rights reinstated and the **SECOND CHANCE** part of my life has begun! 

But ....I was so ashamed of my arrest that I didn't tell a soul.   Aside from legal entities,  the only living person to know about my arrest was my Ex-Husband, because he's the one that bailed me out of jail.  I survived the most difficult challenge of my entire life and emerged on the other side: humble,  sober and grateful for this second chance.   Since I can't throw a ""off-paper party"", I am sharing my happy news,  anonymous like,  with my reddit peeps.  Thanks for reading my story! 

Tl,dr; I did the crime,  I did the time & today I got a clean slate."
Im Breaking up with my Manchild Boyfriend,"I'm breaking up with my boyfriend. Finally. Because he is a fucking man child who refuses to be an adult (he's 50) and do basic adult shit like clean his house (which was GIVEN TO HIM), not go out every single night, monitor his health (he's on heart meds) not do coke even though he's on heart medication, and put his stupid fucking phone down and stop scrolling facebook while we are having dates. Whats worse is, the more I refuse to be his mommy, someone else steps in and does it because he's a pretty well known musician in my town. Also, fuck him for posting pictures of all these girls at his DJ gigs and never posting pictures of us. Also fuck him for making fun of me for working towards my own goals. He has had everything given to him. EVERYTHING and cant even go get the windshield wipers fixed the car that was ALSO given to him so he cant drive himself to his gigs. He makes up songs with his name in them and all he ever talks about is himself. 

I have a full time stressful job, an adult child who is moving out next week, a business I am about to go full time with and an upcoming move and JUST had to evict a roommate (first roommate situation ever)  for being a blackout drunk and having a complete psychotic breakdown.  It would have been nice to have an adult partner. 

Also I haven't had sex in MONTHS. Fuck THIS SHIT. Im out. 

EDIT: WE DO NOT LIVE TOGETHER (THANK GOD) "
People who don't speak English well are just...wow.,"My girlfriend was at work, staffing the changing room at a Marshall's. An Indian woman was waiting for someone in the changing room and complimented the dress my girlfriend was wearing. She said thank you, but the Indian woman said, ""Well, it's not the dress... How do you say..."" and paused for a second.

""You exemplify the beauty.""

Damned if people who speak English as a first language say anything nearly that beautiful. She made my girlfriend's week."
My son is a gamer,"  When I was younger, & I had my little baby boy, I never wanted my son to have a Nintendo, Xbox or PlayStation. (It'll rot your brain...etc) nope, nope, nope.
  At about 6 yrs old, my son was diagnosed with Perthese Disease. It is the degeneration of the bones in the hip, where the femur heads & pelvis joints doesn't get blood flow, so they die & collapse in on themselves. He couldn't run and play & be his goofy self, bc the was in pain a lot. 
  My little man didn't get to start little league t-ball, or soccer, or any of those things. At 8 he had a surgery where they cut the top off the femur & shove it into the pelvis & hold it in place with a big plate & 6 screws.
 I got my son a PlayStation to keep his mind off of the things he was going through.
  He was in a wheelchair from 8 to 10. He's about to be 12 now & doing so much better. Still has some pain though.
  I always felt like he was missing out on all these things, but he just ran in & told me all about his 3 wins in a row on fortnite. And it finally hit me... 
This is who he is, regardless of Perthese, he wouldn't have played sports, he freakin hates sports anyway.
 He's a gamer through & through, and I'm ok with that.

It's my 10 year wedding anniversary today,"It's insane to consider. A whole 10 years of being married to the same man. That's a decade, folks. It feels weird to hear and to tell others, because it doesn't feel like it has been that long. And yet I have 10 years of memories. It's both comfortable and normal, yet big and expansive.

I love this man so much. I've gained weight, lost weight (30 lbs down!), we've had 2 children, and he's seen me in my ugly jammies that I change into right when I get home from work. I'm an introvert that is a total hermit, yet somehow I snagged an extroverted friendly neighbor type guy. I have changed from a shy, passive aggressive girl to a more confident person, and it's really because of him. 

God damn. I can't believe my luck."
We won!,"My mum beat that motherfucker!

It took 9 months but she got an all clear from her oncologist!

"This lady at the gate to my plane said ""thanks handsome"" when i handed her my ticket",First random compliment i've gotten probably all year. you're welcome cutie
My boyfriend's penis is three inches long (7.6 cm),"Just a note before you all read this: I'm a gay guy. Also there are some sexual themes below.

My boyfriend always seemed self-conscious of his penis so he would never show me. Sometimes I'd ask him if I could take off his pants, you know, to give him a blowjob or something. He would tell me that he wasn't ready for that. Of course I complied; I wouldn't want to hurt my darling.

I've been dating him for ten months and he had not revealed it to me until just recently. He just told me last night that he was ready to show it. I was really, really excited, like you wouldn't believe! He took it off, still appearing nervous. I was so happy to see it finally. He asked if I minded that his dick was three inches long. I shook my head no.

Honestly, dude, I fucking love your penis. It's so cute, I mean it. Even if it wasn't, I wouldn't really care anyway because our relationship is not about sex. I'm glad I have you because you're so smart and so nice. You're a fun person to be around. This is why I really wanted you in the first place. I am so lucky to have you and I really love you very much.

I understand how much it hurts you but I can't seem to get the point across that I actually don't mind at all. I actually really like it.

Thanks for reading, Reddit."
I need to tell this story off my chest.,"Greetings, I'm sorry if this is not the appropriate reddit.

I live in the Netherlands, was waiting for the train on a bench, scrolling reddit, the usual.
A woman approached me (say she was in her 50's). She then said that I have beautiful curls and that her son had the same . I thanked her and then she sat next to me and started telling me stories about her son while showing me pictures of him. By the end she had told me that he passed away, and that I reminded her too much of him that's why she couldn't stop but talk to me. I was in shock, and had tears in my eyes. But I was really happy that we had a little conversation. She left really happy yet really emotional. "
My life has been so much better since I became an asshole,"I've been a nice guy all my life, I give people second chances, I let them borrow money, pin fuckups on me, etc.

But not anymore. Early last year, something snapped in me and I became a complete asshole, and I've never been this happy in my entire life.

Money has been somewhat tight recently, partly because I let friends and family members ""borrow"" money whenever they're in need. The main reason I snapped was seeing one of my uncles buy a fucking boat, a few months. after I loaned him a few thousand $ for his house and car payments. 

So I went one by one, to every friend and family member, and asked for my money back. Most of them denied borrowing the amount I said, so I had to print out text message convos and bring it with me. It took a few months, and I probably lost a lot of ""friends"" but I got all my money back. If you buy a fucking boat with the money I let you borrow, you do not get to be insulted that I ask for it back.

It's carried over to my work too. When people fuck up, they put the blame on me behind the scenes. I always find out, but I let it slide because I don't want to create any drama. Not anymore. After a huge fuck up that cost us a major contract, one of my coworkers told my supervisor that I didn't give him the proper specs in time and delayed the project. I dragged him into my boss's office and told him to confess that it was all him. 

I love my parents, they raised me to be a nice, caring guy. But fuck that. If you want to get anywhere in this life, you have to take what's yours."
I’m pregnant and I have no one to tell.,"Because I’m not a socially graceful creature and find it hard to make friends or keep friends.

I wasn’t at all expecting so many well wishes and good thoughts (I really wasn’t expecting anything). I woke up and burst into tears when I seen all the replies. This is just overwhelmingly, insanely the nicest thing I have ever encountered and you have all made an internet stranger’s day/month/year/century. I am so touched and just a blubbering mess.

I got the job!,"The position won't be available until the end of April, but I'm upgrading from Retail to a full-time job with benefits and *quadruple* the pay.

I'm going to be able to afford rent. 

I'm going to be able to schedule time off with my friends, because I won't be leaving work at 9 pm anymore.

I'm still going to have to deal with customers, but with exceedingly fewer of them, and in a position where I'm dictating the terms.

If I weren't so fat, I'm pretty sure I'd be floating a foot off the ground right now."
I'm Sitting in the Waiting Room for a Psychatric Hospital,"This sucks man. I want to die. This is the fourth time in my life I have been admitted to a hospital for psychiatric reasons. I am sitting by myself at 5AM alone, completely by myself with nobody even knowing I am here, in a waiting room for over an hour right now while I am having a complete breakdown. This is the first time I have ever self-admitted myself voluntarily before so maybe this is progress...wish me luck reddit. I hope that this is what I need to start getting better.

Update: Six hours and a lot of crying later I am laying in an ER bed, waiting for a triage nurse. Thank you for all your positive replies, I am reading, appreciating and upvoting every single one.

Update #2: I have been here since 4am. It is now just past 5pm. I have been trying to sleep on and off but it is so difficult right now just laying in the ER ward as the person to my right is bawling her eyes out behind a curtain and a man is screaming and banging on glass as hard as he can. I have been seen by a psychiatrist who told me he likely was not going to keep me as an inpatient despite me feeling quite suicidal...that was two hours ago and he has since talked to my ex gf and parents, who told me he was seriously considering keeping me here. I am so tired and regret coming here right now, I kind of wish I had just jumped off a bridge already like I had wanted to. This isn't helping. I have been given no medication for sleep or anxiety and pain and I'm ready to just walk out of here. 

Update #3: Have been changed into a gown and told I'm going to the psych ward...wish me luck guys. Thanks for keeping my spirits up during this ordeal.

Update #4 Spent five days in the psych ward...for the fourth time...I was beaten by security, kicked in the face multiple times, forced to take antipsychotics that made me feel horrible, was not able to shower, was ridiculed and laughed at, saw horrible neglect and mistreatment of the elderly...I should not have gone. It was pure torture. But maybe it made me stronger. I am not suicidal anymore. Exams for uni are coming up...we shall see..."
I'm HIV positive,"Earlier this year I had a relationship with a guy I mistakenly trusted. I don't want to get into it because it upsets me a lot, but the short and short of it is, he told me he was clean, he was actually HIV positive, and now I am too because I felt safe enough not to use a condom with him during our relationship together. 

I found out because I got what I thought was the flu, but it hit me so, so hard. I went to the ER twice. The first time they gave me fluids and some meds for my massive headache and sent me home. The second time I had a fever of 103 and they didn't have any beds and wouldn't for hours so I said fuck it and decided I'd rather die/go braindead in the comfort of my own bed. Two and a half weeks later I was still having fevers over 101 and couldn't get out of bed except to pee. A rash like chicken pox that didn't itch covered my entire body including my palms and my liver enzymes went off the chart. A month later after more tests and head scratching by a team of doctors, they finally diagnosed me with syphillis (stage 3) and HIV. 

I took it in stride and went to therapy, took my new meds, and now my viral load is undetectable. My CD4 levels are normal (that means my immune system is working normally). Honestly the treatment for the syphillis was the worst. Three rounds of huge shots of penicillin in my butt, one in each ass cheek each time. I would be so sore it would be hard to drive out of the parking lot.  

Life is pretty much the same, all except for I can't donate blood anymore and I had to unregister from the bone marrow registry. Also I avoid this man like it's my job. I don't shop at the grocery store he works at. I don't go to the park he lives near. I do a double take every time I see an older guy dressed in black on a bike now. I tried reporting him to the police but there's nothing they could do for me because my governor changed the laws recently to reduce prison crowding. 

Few people close to me know I'm positive. I haven't even told my dad even though he asked me point blank when I was really sick and I just lied even though he's a doctor himself and would love me all the same. I just don't want him to worry, or to have to be burdened with knowing someone hurt me giving it to me, or if I leave that part of the story out for him to think I was reckless with my own health. But not telling him weighs on me too. 

EDIT: I tried to report him. It's not clear whether he knew he was infected and lied or he just never got tested and said he was clean instead of saying ""I don't know because I've never been tested."" The laws were changed so that theres no legal recourse because it's a misdemeanor not a felony so police can't get his medical records and he won't hand them over voluntarily. I tried to find a lawyer to take my case but no one would take it. I reported him to the health department too when I got diagnosed because he ghosted me as soon as I told him he infected me. "
My boyfriend is training a dog that shares my name. It turns me on so much.,"David (not his real name) and I have been going out for about a year now and things have been going pretty well. He works as a professional dog trainer, people bring him their dogs that they don’t have the time or inclination to train and he does it for them. 

About a week ago he took a client whose dog has the same name as me. I didn’t really notice until we met up for lunch and he was talking about Molly (name changed to preserve my dignity) misbehaving at work. I got curious and started asking him questions. He talked about how she was having issues being rough with other dogs and described how he’d discipline her if she misbehaved and reward her when she did well. I started to get turned on hearing about it, something about it being my name and listening to him detail how to change her behavior. I think I started blushing because he asked me if I was OK and I brushed it off. 

I found I’ve been going to his work more often and trying to watch while he’s training Molly. There’s something about watching him snap his fingers and shout my name in that commanding tone of voice that just makes me weak in the knees. At one point yesterday, he knelt down and started scratching her ears saying “Good girl Molly, good girl!” and I just about lost it. 

I went home and masturbated to this, thinking about what if it was me he was training. Telling me to sit, heel, petting my head and saying “good girl”, even walking me around on a leash. Fuck, I came so hard. The next time we had sex it was all I could think about. We’ve never really played around with BDSM or anything like that but I’ve hinted at it a couple times. 

I don’t know if I can tell him about it because it’s super embarrassing but I kind of really want him to treat me like that.

A video game saved my life.,"It's weird that I want to share this to you people, which I have kept hidden from my current friends for years. I really don't why to be honest, but here's the full (long) story.

Harvest Moon saved my life.

I was bullied since I was a freshman in high school. I don't know the reason, it might be because I was fat, I was ""weird"", a nerd, a lesbian, take your pick. I was depressed, I was angry, I wanted to kill myself, and I tried but I seem to have a tolerance for sleeping pills. Soon I just gave up. I feel like I wasn't alive, I just existed. I sometimes cut myself or eat just so I can make myself feel better.
Gaming was my only escape from hell. Everyday after school, I would play my PS1 and for that time, I was genuinely happy, where I can feel alive again. Well one day, some of this kids beat me up and locked me in the old janitor's closet. Now a lot of people know that I have claustrophobia, so I was terrified for hours until they let me go, I cried when they just left and making me feel worthless. I thought for that moment, I would hang myself.

No more pills, no more cutting, just tie a rope to my neck and end it all. When I went home, I passed by the game store I frequent and saw a game on display. ""New Arrival"" it said on the case, it was a copy of Harvest Moon: Back to Nature .It was a simple cover art, it has Comic Sans, yet it mesmerized me.
Now I didn't know why I bought it, maybe make it like a ""last meal"".

So I took it home.

I put it in the CD, tearing up since I know this was my last day, and this was my last game.

I started to play.

As I played, I felt better just taking care of my farm, and helping the people of Mineral Town, getting to know them made me pretend I had friends. As night fell, I completely forgot I want to hang myself.
It was like magic. I now ignore all those bullies, and just get excited on playing Harvest Moon when I get home.I was doodling pictures of them, planning my farm.
In Mineral Town, I had friends, I have love interest, lots of animals and vegetable to take care and make happy.I won races, shows, I played the ocarina in church, went to festivals, got married and had a kid. It feels as though my real life is there inside the game.
I was living my ideal life.

I loved the feeling that people need me, and I need them. I found my courage to stand up and believe I have the right to live. I was reborn in Mineral Town, and made my real back to the real world to be a new and better person.

A happy person.
In time, I found my courage and because of an incident where I just punched a bully in the face, I was left alone.
I grew up, and made real friend, a real love interest. I have self-confidence and self-esteem. I am happy. I moved on to the PS2, the Xbox, the 360, the PS3 and PC. Even though I still have some psychological damage and issues because of the bullying, like anger problems. I try to keep them in check for my sake and others.
Now whenever I hear the soundtrack from Harvest Moon: Back to Nature, I cry. I cry because they made me realize that I can be happy, and I am. I realized that it saved me from death 10 years ago."
"I had a best friend, she was magical. I hope I see her in every life after this one.","My best friend committed suicide on 23 August 2018.

We were soul mates. She was my everything. And now she is gone. 

Everyone has moved on. Everyone celbrated Navratri (indian festival). Her brothers wedding invites have been sent out. Her husband has boxed up her possessions and is talking about what his next partner will be like. 

I get it, people have to move on. This is not my first death. In fact I have barely any family alive.

But she was my person. And as I held her while she turned cold not even aware that she was suicidal, a piece of me left with her. 

She wrote: I am so sorry (my name) for leaving you alone. I said I would be with you in life but I just can't. Thank you for supporting me through friendship. Please look after yourself. I love you a lot. 

I feel like im suffocating in grief and anger that I have to hide from a society that believes a blood connection or marriage is necessary to feel ongoing loss.

I truly know that what I found in her was a once in a lifetime event. I know how lucky I am to have known her and experienced her in her short 27 years of life. 

Wherever you are now, I hope we meet again. 

*Suicide has lasting effects on everyone. I have learnt that a loved one's suicide has a ripple effect steering those close to contemplate it just to see their loved one again. Please don't. You are worth so much more than you know. You are loved by many many people, blood and non-blood. You are amazing. Please ask for help and seek assistance. Don't make a permanent decision about a temporary problem. You are magic. She was magic. "
Pokémon Go and my daughter,"I'll preface this with a little background:

30 year old single father to an absolutely amazing (almost) 4 year old daughter.

I grew up watching the Pokémon cartoons, playing Red and Blue, and to a lesser extent the card game. 

A couple months ago I introduced my daughter to the cartoon (via Netflix). She instantly fell in love. She now has a collection of Pokémon stuffed animals.  She does battles with them and even knows a couple of their moves, all their names, and even what type they are.

Fast forward to Pokémon Go. I download it to see what all the buzz was about. I honestly didn't think it would be nearly as fun as it is but i was wrong. 

My daughter absolutely loves the game. We'll go on long walks together to catch Pokémon. The look on her face when she catches one is absolutely priceless.  She shouts ""I got one!"" Hands in the air and everything. She is absolutely ecstatic! Her enthusiasm and passion for this is simply amazing.

I don't always feel like the best father but seeing her so happy and being able to bond with her over this melts my damn heart.

I know a lot of older people catch flak for playing this game but as long as my daughter enjoys it I'll keep playing."
I kissed her,"After 3 years of liking this girl. After 3 years of things not quite lining up. After 3 years of different people and waiting. I finally kissed her. 

After 3 months of not seeing her, we hung out. We watched a movie and relaxed. She cuddled up close to me. I know she felt my heart beating like crazy, but that's okay. After the movie, we stood up and hugged because I had to go. Then she gave me the look. I knew it was finally time. I kissed her, and she kissed back. She let out the cutest giggle after the half minute we kissed, and buried herself into my chest. She held my hand all the way to my car, and kissed me twice good-bye.

I have never, in my life, felt this happy after a kiss. And even though I won't see her for a couple weeks now (and then potentially a month or two after that), I've never felt this content with someone."
My best mate just saved my life for the second time.,"The first time he saved me was when he pulled me out of a rip current. Last night he went home with me and made sure I didn't end it all, as much as I wanted to. The shit that guy's done for me makes me realise that people do care.

Edit: Did not expect this to get any attention at all. Thank you for your words kind strangers, I'll make sure I get something for the bro."
"I married young, and felt unhappy and depressed.","
I got married when i was 23yo, and for a while i was unhappy. I couldn't break up our marriage cuz i had always believed divorce was not an option. So I tried to live one day at a time, not over-thinking the future, hoping that things will get better some day.
The problem was, it was all me, my wife didn't do anything to upset me and she's genuinely innocent. I didn't laugh when she was telling jokes, mainly because she can't tell jokes and always mess up the punchline, it's also because i didn't love her anymore, but i tried to crack a smile as hard as it was. I didn't even notice when she wore something new or fixed herself for me. I was aware of my problem and that's why i was going crazy, the fact that it's all me. That being said, i have never hurt her or even said something unpleasant to her, i never acted on those feelings, i kept my shit to myself.
One day i had to just get away for a while, clear my mind, and try and see a bigger picture, if there was one. Of course i didn't make it seem like i'm taking a break or anything, i'm a good actor. So i left, and took a road trip. Driving always helped me get better for the night. I drive alone and talk out loud and let it all out so i don't burst up and explode during the day.

Nothing happened during those silent days of driving, except that she called me twice everyday to check on me. She never missed a call, and suddenly i realized that i was waiting for her to forget to call me. I keep realizing how much of an asshole i am.

One day while driving i had a moment of clarity, it was so beautiful that i smiled and cried at the same time. My mind drew a picture for me and here it is.. My wife crying while i'm not there or i can't see her, then she gathers herself and acts normal when im there, and tries to tell a joke just to get me to smile even though she knows she can't tell jokes, and for some reason, she was wearing a white dress. I was thinking about my own happiness so much that I forgot to think about how miserable i'm making her feel. I never hated myself more than i did at that moment.

I turned the car around and drove home, and while i'm on the road, i kept imagining her in that white dress. It made me happy. And i recalled some of the jokes she had told me before, and i laughed about how she messed up the punchline every time.

That was three years ago, we had two daughters since then and i can't believe how lucky i am that i didn't mess it up. I'm thankful that she didn't leave me when she had every excuse to. I'm not exaggerating when i tell you that with every love song that i hear, i think of her.

So to the people who think they don't love their partners anymore, dig a little deeper. There's a scene in the movie Hachi: A Dog's Tale, where the father asks his daughter's boyfriend ""do you love my daughter? Because that's what you want to remember in the bad days"". 

I already posted this before, but I thought maybe someone needs to read it now.
Thanks for reading.

Edit: i'm overwhelmed by the response and comments you give me, it's an amazing feeling to know you touched strangers in a deep emotional level, i love you guys. And thanks for the gold."
My husband died and I want to tell everyone about him.,"My husband died in May. Although it’s been just over five months, it’s still hard to digest. On most days, I forget he’s gone entirely. Every morning when I first wake up I am reminded suddenly. 

I want to tell you all about him. 

We first met my senior year of college. I was a bartender and he was a regular. He came in every Thursday night and sat in the same spot. We would always talk about how shitty parking was, because we were both students at the university. I recognized him from a few classes I had in the past. It took him until the day before graduation to ask me on a date. 

Our first date was a disaster. We both ended up getting food poisoning. When he dropped me off at my apartment, he asked if he could use my bathroom. Have you guys seen the movie Bridesmaids? There’s a part where they all get food poisoning and are fighting over the toilet. We literally sat in my bathroom floor until about 4am and vomited, sharing the toilet. I knew then that I really liked him. 

We both stayed around to get our master’s degrees. A year later, we moved in together. We adopted a cat, Carl. I used to joke that he liked Carl more than he liked me. 

He proposed to me after I finished taking my comprehensive exam to get my master’s degree. Literally, I finished taking the exam. He was waiting for me by my car. He got down on one knee and asked, “Will you agree to sleep with me and only me forever and ever?” We got married six months after that. 

For five years, we had an amazing marriage. He was the jokester; a prankster of epic proportions. He replaced my toothpaste with cream cheese one time. I almost divorced him then. He laughed all the time and he made everyone he met fall in love with him, but I was the one he chose. Every dinner we went to, I would get butterflies. Every single day it was like I was meeting him for the first time. Over and over again, his love made me feel grounded and safe. 

But it wasn’t all roses. Sometimes we would argue. He snored so fucking loud. I told him to go to the doctor or do something, because I was about to kill him. He would criticize me for putting the toilet roll on backwards. 

These petty arguments were the worst times with him ever got. I was the luckiest person in the world to have a partner that I wholly trusted and believed in. 

The last morning I saw him alive was perfect. He made me breakfast because I was sick with a cold. He called in to work so he could be with me, but he chalked it up to him just “wanting an excuse to take a day off.” I sat down to breakfast with him. We ate; Carl even sat at the table with us. We had a “family breakfast.” I pressured him to go into the office and that I would be fine. He said he would run in to grab some things and be right back home. 

He leaned over to kiss me, but I told him I didn’t want to get him sick. He gave me a wet, sloppy kiss on the cheek. He picked up Carl, walked with him to the door, and sat him down. And then he left. 

I took Nyquil and woke up a few hours later to my doorbell ringing furiously. It was the police. It happened just like it does in the movies. 

Five months later and I am here. I never realized just how much my husband influenced me; but more than that, I never realized how strong he made me. Before him, if I had lost someone so important, I don’t think I would have been able to make it. But I know he would want me to keep going and to be happy. I have to believe that. 

This morning my brother was helping me to fix my dryer. When he finished, he pulled out a handful of socks that had gotten lost in the machine. They were my husband’s old socks. I took them and just began weeping. 

I have a video on my phone of my husband reenacting the entire fight scene between Luke and Darth Vader in Empire Strikes Back. I’m watching it now on a loop. I hope he knows I’m thinking of him. I hope that idiot knows just how much he ruined my life. That wonderful, lovable, intelligent, sexy idiot. 

I will miss him forever. But this isn’t meant to be a sad post. On the contrary, I wish we could all celebrate his life. The last thing he would want is for me to be sad. He’d probably tell me to saddle up the next guy and ride off into the sunset. 

But my “riding off into the sunset” journey was only supposed to be him and I. Now it’s only me. 

Love you always, B. 

***Edit*** Thank you guys so much for commenting and messaging me. I'm at work currently, but once I get some downtime I will reply to you all individually. I logged on this morning and was scrolling through reddit on my other account (this is a throwaway--because I use reddit at my job), and I saw this post and I glanced at it like, ""Hey--that sounds familiar."" Then I realized. Holy shit, you guys. I'm sorry to make so many people cry, apparently. I didn't mean that, honestly. I just wrote this in the middle of the night while I was drunk on wine. 

To those of you who have shared your own stories of loss with me, thank you for being so open and candid with a stranger. Your experiences give me strength and resolve during this time. 

Honestly, I'm a pretty callous person at times. I have a dark sense of humor at things. That's why my husband and I got along so well. I'm sarcastic to the point of being prickly, but he made me soft. And I needed that. The challenge is not letting what has happened make me hard again. 

Also, for the record, I'm a guy. Lot of you think I'm a woman, which is totally fine--but I think it's funny. Sorry to burst your bubble. I'm a gay! I like the penis. "
Lost my virginity when I was 9,"Last night, one of my friends made a drunken comment about how I’m doomed to be a virgin for the rest of my life. My other friends laughed. It was just a gentle quip that we all share with one another, but this one struck me deeply. I wanted to tell him that I lost my virginity when I was nine-years-old. 

I’m a 25-year-old male. I’m a normal, career-oriented, relatively sane guy. I like to go out with friends, I love reading science fiction novels. But there’s a part of my life that I have never talked about it, and it makes me… not who I am. It makes me someone other than this normal, geeky guy that I’ve grown to become. 

I was raised by my mother. She was a single parent and had to support me. Her family disowned my mother for getting pregnant. We made it work for a while, but we lost our house when I was about seven-years-old. We both became homeless. I distinctly remember my mother prostituting herself for money, but it was never more than $20 per guy she met with. She would make me wait at the Waffle House while she went off with them. I remember one guy came to pick up my mom and he saw me and asked my mom “How much?” My mom was disgusted and turned him away. She walked outside to smoke. I remember watching through the window and they started talking. My mom looked back at me, so did the man. 

My mom finished her cigarette and came and got me and took my hand. She was crying. I asked her what was wrong. She led me out to the man and told me that he was her friend and that I needed to go with him while she went to work. I complied. 

I went with the man and we went to his house. I remember seeing he had pictures with his wife and two daughters on a coffee table. Toys were spread out in the living room. His kids were my age, I assumed. He sat down beside me on the couch and touched my leg. I wanted to play with the Barbies in the floor. He tried touching me again, but I moved away. 

I want to skip over the very gory details. Long story short, he sodomized me after feeding me a sleeping pill that made me drowsy. I was raped by him. I felt everything. He brought me back to my mother with $300 in my pocket. 

My mother started sending me out with guys like the first man more frequently. Businessmen were very interested in me. They were always family men. When I went back to their houses, it was so…domestic. One guy cooked me a grilled cheese and gave me a haircut. Another guy gave me his son’s action figures that he didn’t play with anymore. It always ended with me in pain and crying, though. 

My mom always promised the men to “not hurt me,” which I find ironic. It lasted for a year. I estimate I brought in about $4,000. Some men paid more than others, but it was never under $200. My mother started arranging groups of men to take me because it was worth more to her. We were able to get an apartment and my mother stopped sending me out. I was tired. 

My mother got re-married a year later, when I was 11, but there was a bitter divorce and a custody battle. I went to stay with my step-dad. I did not speak to my mother until my college graduation, and the only thing I said to her—in front of her new family and my half-siblings—was, “Go to Hell, c-nt.”

I do not forgive my mother for what she did to me, and no one knows about this—except all of you. But I wanted to say this. 

But the worst part of it is, when I was with the groups of men, there would be other young boys with me. They were collected from other places. So I am not the only one that was part of this horrible nightmare. I hope they are okay. I hope they are doing fine. I hope they have been able to do everything they wanted to do. 

I just feel kind of…used. Like all of my energy has been used up, and no matter how distant these memories get, I just keep feeling more and more tired. "
My dad died tonight,"It was a fast growing tumour that they didn't know about until yesterday. I got a call this morning that there were complications after surgery and he was going to die today. I drove 900 kms to make it back. I held his hand. I told him I loved him, but he was on the ventilator and under sedation so I think he was already gone. He was starting to deteriorate when my uncle flew in so my mum decided it was time to let him go. We said goodbye. Now I'm in a strangers house near the hospital who knows my uncle and I can't believe that all of this has happened in 24 hours.

I miss you dad."
I went on a date with my crush and was ghosted afterwards.,"But I am damn proud. I’ve had a HUGE crush on this girl for the entire semester and after months and words of encouragement from a friend, I asked her for her number and to dinner and to my surprise she said yes. We went to dinner and I thought everything went well, we talked and laughed, everything flowed smoothly, or so I thought. She never replied to any of my texts again. I’d be lying if I wasn’t a little sad but I’m damn proud that I (finally) summoned the courage to ask her. I really don’t have anyone else to tell other than my friend how I feel so I’m telling a bunch of strangers on Reddit. :)"
One of my students made me cry.,"I teach in a brilliant school in the UK - not a private school, but somewhere the kids are almost universally excellent. 

I realised that something was wrong very quickly with you. You were once a happy, radiant girl. You were top of the school academically, friendly, popular. Even now, in your last year of school, you had dreams of being a doctor. 

But every now and again I'd see your lip quiver in class. It would take you slightly too long to respond to question. Your shoulders were more hunched than your usual confident gait. 

I asked you to stay behind after class. You must have thought you were in trouble. 

We spoke for hours that evening, just you and I, sitting at a pupil desk. I stayed long after I said to my wife I'd be home, holding your hand, just listening. We spoke about everything. TV. Sports. How my favourite chocolate bar was a Wispa, but you thought they were too bubbly. 
We spoke about a condition. A condition I know very little about, but one I've since read almost everything Google has to say about it. Russell's sign. Ever so slight tooth decay. Weight loss. Low self esteem. Suicidal thoughts. You didn't want your parents to know.

We managed to get you therapy. Every two weeks you'd attend a class, and I'd be the first person you'd report back to. Trying food diaries. Replacing your bad thoughts with positive ones. 

You got better. It took 6 months. Tears, rages, you swore at me more times than I can count, several times I kept you in my class after hours because I knew if I let you go home you'd do something stupid. 

But damnit, you got better. 

Two days ago I came to your Leavers Prom. You looked gorgeous, healthy, radiant. I've never seen a student smile so wide and so often. You asked me to dance - I felt you squeeze my hand as we twirled to the music. 

Yesterday was your Leavers Day. You came in to my class for the last time, on your own, clutching your accepted offer to university. I told you I was proud of you. I am so damn proud of you. 

I outstretched my hand and wished you the best of luck. You pushed it out the way and came in for a hug. I don't know how long it lasted, but these hugs are ones you don't put a time limit on. 

Just as you were about to leave you said you had a gift for me, to say thanks for the support. Some of my students have given me expensive gifts over the years - champagne, whisky, luxury food baskets and the like. 

You handed me a single Wispa chocolate bar. I have no shame in saying I broke down and cried in front of you. I broke about a thousand school rules by squeezing your hand, kissing you on the cheek and saying thank you. It's the best present I've ever received. 

Good luck kid. Go be the best damn doctor you can be. 

Edit: spelling - and wow! Thanks for all your kind words and support, and for the gold. It's great to hear so many stories from you all about us humble teachers that can make a difference, however small. Stay awesome reddit!"
My sister announced her second pregnancy during the Thanksgiving prayer. Meanwhile I'm the old spinster aunt.,"During prayer before dinner I felt a bit suspicious. The prayer kept going on and on. Mentioning each person and something they were thankful to God about in that person's favor. Rambling mostly. I had enough time to sneak in a few bites of turkey and slipped my husband some bacon. Then the last thankful thing was about my neice becoming a sister. Then everyone bursting into tears and cheering after the amen. But me. I hid mine of course. 

You see, my sister hasn't struggled with fertility. She promised everyone she would have a kid after she finished her master's. She was pregnant three weeks after the graduation ceremony. Then a few months ago she said to her husband in front of everyone that she had baby fever. 

My neice just turned two. She calls everyone mom. And she loves yelling for me.... They haven't felt the sting of fertility. They haven't felt the pressure of conceiving from their parents/grandparents. They haven't felt the agonization of a two week wait (or much longer because you thought it was finally happening), or endless peeing on sticks. Poking and proding. Publically carrying bodily fluids for testing. Fasting for testing. Blood draws. Ultrasounds. Medications. Etc etc etc. I know I'm bitter. I'll admit it. It's been 7 years of no good results. And I'm just plain tired. Thanks for letting me get that off my chest. 

TLDR: little sister is pregnant with second and I'm infertile but the expectations persist. 

Edit for grammar and clarification. 

Edit again to say thank you for the unbelievable support and honesty shared below and in my inbox. So many who can relate all over the world. We're not alone <3"
Today I saw a kid I tutored in high school,"I graduated nearly ten years ago. In my senior year I was a tutor for a special needs class. The kid I worked most closely with is autistic. He was close to non verbal and would hit himself regularly. I thought he was the best. We worked all year and by the end, he would sit on my lap and read a book to me. It was a huge deal to me, and seeing his progress made me decide to work in the human services field. 

Fast forward to the present. I work as an employment specialist for people with disabilities at a facility that offers many different programs. One of the programs is a summer day camp for school aged-teenaged individuals. I happened to be walking through the hall and looked in one of the rooms... and there he was! Much taller, but definitely him! I told the staff working in his room that I knew him and they gave me the go-ahead to talk to him. I sat next to him, not really expecting much, but to my surprise, he turned and looked me in the eye and said, ""hi, what's your name?"" 

Keep in mind, this kid was limited to Thomas the tank engine quotes when he was little. I worked for an entire YEAR trying to get him to ask questions instead of just repeating them. 

Taken aback, I told him my name. AND HE SAID HE REMEMBERED ME!! We chatted for a while about school and just general small talk, and when I went to leave, he told me to ""have a great day!""  I'm an emotional wreck, in a good way! I'm so deliriously happy that he's made so much progress. I can honestly say that without that kid (now teenager!) I wouldn't be in the career field I am. I would be a totally different person. Today has already been a great day and it's not even lunch time. "
I finally fucking did it.,"After years of social anxiety, and being agoraphobic. I finally took up some of my friends on their offer to go out last night. After a few drinks I got up the courage to ask a random girl to dance, she said yes and we ended up making out. Probably doesn't seem like much to everyone else but it's definitely huge for me. Now I just need to start working on my dancing

Posting this here to remind myself of how great last night was in case I start falling into bad habits. "
I'm making 39k a year.,"I couldn't be fucking happier. 

I'm only 19 in a low cost of living area and holy shit! I'm so bad with money  (I grew up poor) but I'm super proud of my nice apartment and I'm gonna be able to pay for my schooling! Man. I mean. I'm still putting away 400 a month for savings. But other than that I suck. 

This is the American dream! 

Edit: Gilded? Alright that's pretty dope. 

Edit 2, Electric Bugaloo: Thank you for all the kind words dudes. It really means a lot! Plus the amount of money I make is really getting put into perspective."
My son took a smack with a belt...,"My eight year old son was at my exes and got hit with a belt. His twin stepsisters (2 yo twins) woke up too early.  430am.  X was woken up. He lost his shit. He smacked one twin in terms cheek with a backhand and then took off his belt and hit her in the ribs. 

He then asked ""anyone else want one!!""

My son said he did. 8 years old. He did it because he wasn't entirely sure that unless he was personally hurt, I'd make a complaint (I would have). So he took a whack to make sure. To protect his stepsisters. 

The report is made. The new girlfriend did freak out on him. It won't ever happen again.  The family is now being supervised. Because of my 8 yo son. 

He is one of the bravest people I've ever known. I am so proud.

EDIT: So this blew up more than I ever really thought possible. I have read your comments to Piglet, redacting any negative stuff about his dad. He is especially keen on all the folks who are encouraging me to take him out for sweet delicious foodstuffs. It shall be done. 

To the person who suggested xmas presents, that is so very sweet but unnecessary. This year we're doing a rather austere, non-commercial Christmas (read: I'm broke, lol!) and our plan is for each sibling to get a small set amount to spend on each other sibling. So it'll be more about personality and choice than blowing a wad. A life lesson, so to speak. We've had plenty of fat Christmases. This one will just be special in a different way.

To the person who asked why X had his belt on... One does not become the asshole who hit a 2yo with a belt without having once been that two year old - AND WORSE. I suppose to my ex a belt is a lot better than some other things. Throughout our marriage he ALWAYS slept fully dressed. I managed after several years to get him to remove his sneakers in bed. I leave it to you all to interpret what that might mean. 

I am trying to maintain a sort of ... educational attitude about all this... which is not to say that my first impulse wasn't to turn the van around and ram it up his ass. But I don't want Piglet's relationship with his father destroyed. It is still a valuable one. I just want my X to understand without equivocation that this will never, ever fucking happen again, to our son or ANY other child in his care. With the deepest respect and affection, I'll report them every goddamn time. "
"At the funeral home, after my husband died.","I am staring down into my own face. It’s reflected back at me from the shiny wood surface of a very long conference table. It takes me a moment to register that someone is talking to me. I don’t know where I am.

When I look up, I see a man that I could not now describe even if I were being held at gunpoint. He is just a vague head on shoulders that sound is coming out of.

I realize he’s talking to me. I realize where I am after a brief glance around the room — coffins, flowers, urns. Somehow, I realize, I am at the funeral home that will cremate my husband.

I don’t know how I got here. I assume my mother picked me up and brought me. I’m wearing sweatpants that are mostly acceptable to be seen in public and a t-shirt three sizes too big for me. Probably because it was the only thing clean in my closet. I can’t remember the last time I did laundry. Mark was always more important. When it came down to washing our clothes or sitting with him while he was crying and vomiting into that lime green plastic bowl I kept stashed just in case under the coffee table, Mark always came first.

The voice across from the shiny wood table says, “Do you know what you want for your husband?”

I want him to be alive. I want him to be healthy. I want him to be sitting next to me on the couch watching Curb Your Enthusiasm but none of those are an option at this point.

“Cremation,” I say. Oddly enough we had this morbid conversation many times. Mark had always insisted in his stuttery, stubborn way that he wanted to be cremated, no prayer over his body. So I knew I had to do it. Good, anyway, because I’d seen enough embalmed bodies in coffins to know they never looked like the person they used to be. It always seemed to be a mockery of that person, the final twist of the knife.

“Would you like to pick an urn?” the voice asks.

No. No I would not. But I look anyway because my mother is staring at me, his mother is staring at me, his father is staring at me waiting for me to make a choice.

If I pick anything with a religious connotation to it Mark will haunt me to the end of my days but I don’t want something boring and plain either. He doesn’t deserve boring or plain.

And then there it is — a steely blue urn with birds taking to flight. The color is the same as his beautiful eyes, the same ones I told him were beautiful in a hallway in high school. And the birds...

I choose that one, right away. But before the voice-with-a-head leaves, I notice something else. It’s a ceramic rose.

The inner bud unscrews so you can put ashes in it, a slightly less morbid way of displaying remains. I love it instantly because it’s a rose, my favorite, but even more so because it’s white.

I can’t remember why but one night, shortly before we were married, favorite flowers came up in conversation. I told Mark mine was a white rose.

“Why white?” he asked.

“Because roses are beautiful,” I told him, only half paying attention, “but you always see red or pink. You never see white. That’s why I like white. They’re rare.”

He got on his phone, thumbs tapping away.

“What are you doing?” I asked.

“Don’t worry about it.” A sly smile tugged at his lips, giving him a devastatingly handsome look.

I found out later he’d been asking his mother if she could make me a bouquet of white roses for our wedding.

“Can I have the rose, too?” I ask tentatively. I know how much the business of death costs and hate to ask for more but it feels like I need it.

I hear a chorus of “yes” and sit back, thinking it must all be over. I haven’t made eye contact with anyone.

“I’m sorry for this, Mrs. Smith,” the voice-with-a-head says, “but I need you to confirm that this is your husband before we can finalize the purchase.”

The purchase. Such a strange way to say it.

I don’t understand what he’s referring to until the paper is slid across the shiny wood table towards me. It’s got a lot of small black type on it, dates and stats and information. But where his finger is pointing is at the photo in the top left corner

It’s Mark. He’s dead, that much is clear. I’d seen him in many different states — drunk, passed out, drug-induced, comatose, sleeping.

Dead looks different.

“Yes,” I say. I expect to start crying but it feels like my whole body is completely dry. No tears left. At least, not for now. “That’s him.”

The voice leaves. No one knows what to say to me. I want to crack a joke, make everyone feel better. I want to tell them at least this awful part is done. Really, I just want to go home.

The birds on his urn. Wheels start turning in my mind. I think I’m going to tell that story at his funeral, if I can manage to stay upright.

It’s only been a few days since Mark died, and I know there’s so much more ahead. Things I’ll have to see, say, do. I’m not sure how I’ll do it, just like I’m not sure how I got here today.

But I know I will do it. Because I have no other choice.
"
He asked me if I slept with my professors,"I was at my friends house for dinner last night. Her father is a condescending d-bag. Unfortunately, my friend does NOT see that and always makes excuses for his rude af comments. He's a lawyer and I just started law school last month so in the beginning of the night I was picking his brain and it seemed to be going fine. No rude comments yet. I think we can possibly get though the night without him putting his foot in his mouth. Nope, spoke too soon.

At dinner, he for some reason bring up the Korean War, which I know absolutely nothing about.. He starts asking me all these random questions like how many soldiers died, how long was the war, who was it between, etc. I tell him I'm not familiar with the Korean War. He looks me dead in the eye and asked me how many of my college professors I slept with in undergrad and if I'm currently sleeping with any in law school. I knew he wasn't kidding, but I just laugh to try and break the ice. Nope, he tells me that would be the only logical explanation for lack of knowledge about various topics.

I think he unfairly stereotypes me. I'm blonde. I think you know where this is going. I end up getting up and excusing myself from the table, while my friend and his wife laugh. I tell my friend I'm leaving and she tells me I'm being overly sensitive and he was only joking. I can tell you he 100% was not joking. He's such a pos. I honestly cannot stand his pompous ass. It was completely embarrassing and my friend didn't even have my back."
"To Lawrence, the Uber Driver in Chicago","Lawrence,

You picked me up in the morning this past Sunday and rode me a few miles to my friend's place to feed her cat. You noticed I was wearing scrubs, I was running late for my hospital shift when you picked me up. I originally planned to take an Uber to my friend's place and take the train down to the hospital, but I realized I would never make it and decided to just call another Uber when I was done with the cat. You insisted on waiting for me and would then drive me to the hospital. I told you that you didn't need to do that, but you insisted. I was appreciative. 

I was in and out in just a few minutes. On my way back out to the car, I noticed I got a message saying my trip ended. I figured then I would type in my new destination and pay for that second trip separate. I quick gave you 5 stars and submitted, intending to give you a great review once the second leg of the trip was over. I got in the car, and you told me you had ended the trip and would drive me to the hospital for me. I absolutely insisted I pay, but you wouldn't let me. You knew I was a PhD student from what I said earlier. You said you knew I probably didn't have a lot of money (correct), and you just wanted to give me a ride because you did Uber to kill time. During the trip, I learned your wife died not too long ago from cancer. That you drove for Uber to get out of the house. That you still see you and your wife's friends and how they miss her so much. You miss her too. You were kind, you asked me questions about myself, you listened. 

You dropped me off and refused any payment. I realize how badly this could have gone for me, given you weren't on shift and were really just a person driving me, not an Uber driver at that point. You shook my hand, and told me I'm going to do great things in my life. You told me to be proud of my work, to be proud of me. It touched my heart. I needed to hear that. Because you didn't charge for me the trip, I couldn't write you a message telling you how amazing you are. I tried contacting Uber, but wasn't able to get a message through to you. 

Lawrence, you made my month. I cried a little after you left. All you've been through, and you still have such a beautiful soul. You spoke such kind words to a stranger. I won't forget you. I wish I would have said this more in person and it's been weighing on me. 

Thank you.

This whole Brett Kavanaugh thing...,"I’m a millennial and a republican. I was raised republican however I am not as far-right as my parents. 

I was also assaulted at the age of 9 by my new stepbrother. My mom had just gotten remarried and I was so happy. I finally had a father figure (he’s a great man) and a new brother. My brother happens to be the same age as me, so that was cool. We moved in to the same house as a family and that’s when the assaulting began. He would molest me anywhere, anytime and force me to touch him. Playing hide-n-go seek? Yep. Watching a movie? Yep. Hanging out on the back porch? Yep. 

This continued for about a year until one day I swear he was going to rape me until I kicked him. I think I startled him (and myself) because he didn’t expect that (and I didn’t either, honestly). After that, it all stopped. 

I *almost* reported it to my 5th grade teacher but was too nervous. I got choked up and she dismissed me. Years later I was visiting my grandparents and was overcome with guilt and sadness about the situation so I called my mom sobbing. I almost told her, but again got scared. So I blamed my crying on me missing her. I’ve kept my mouth shut and haven’t told a soul for the last 14 years. It’s almost painful and strange even typing this out now. 

The ultimate reason I never chose to say anything was because I knew it would tear my family apart. My mom was happy, I had a dad, and we were all better off financially together as a family. My mom would’ve taken my side, killed my brother, and probably left my step dad. Plus my step dad would’ve been torn apart. So I chose to suffer in silence and keep my mom and step dad happy. 

Anyways, fast forward to now with the Brett Kavanaugh situation. Again, my family is republican but I do not agree 100% with everything my parents think. I was speaking with my mom on the phone tonight and she brought it up. She said how disgusted she was about the accusations, that she felt so bad for him, and how they’re dragging him through the mud. 

Now, I want to believe my mother would believe my story 14 years later. I really think she would. But hearing what she said tonight made my stomach turn. It just made me sad. I couldn’t even say anything other than mumble and say “mm-hmm” and wait for the subject to change. 

I wanted to share this to say: just because someone doesn’t *look* like they’ve been a victim, have never said anything, and other wise seem like a “perfect” child, doesn’t mean they weren’t a victim. To this day, if my mom were to ask me, I would still deny all of it. This is something I’ll carry to my grave simply for the fear of the consequences. 

*Edited to add: not that it even matters, but my brother is a large guy for his age. Now he’s 6’5” and a big boy. So at 9, he was much already bigger than me; it’s not like he was some puny kid. Just felt like adding that detail. "
I'm so goddamn sick of this fucking country,"Everyone hates everyone. We shoot the shit out of each other. We bomb each other. We're way too fucking religious. We're way too fucking mean. The news cycle is driven by drama. We can't just hear the facts anymore; now it's got to be an opinion. We can't just hear the news, it has to trickle in slowly to capture attention of the audience. We can't have a civilized discussion anymore, we have to call each other names. We can't empathize with those who disagree with us, we have to plant ourselves on either pole and attack. We can't speak up if something doesn't sound quite right; we fear being ostracized by the majority. 

I'm so over it. I've lived abroad twice before for months at a time, and when I'm away, it's shocking to me how little daily life revolves around local politics. How safe I feel when I go for a walk by myself in a new neighborhood. How relaxed people are. 

I've resisted moving because my whole family is here, my friends, my dog. But I think I'm ready to call myself an ex-pat. For now, at least. "
I GOT MY FIRST JOB TODAY,"It’s weekends at my local shop but I’m still so fucking happy and proud

EDIT: Thanks for all the positivity and thanks for the silver 🙂 and thanks for the gold!"
He asked me to marry him.,"There was no ring. There was no getting down on one knee. No long speech or photographers or even people watching us. We were at a rave, because we're EDM freaks, and we were just facing and holding each other. Lots of soft kissing and whispering about how glad we were to be with each other that night. Chatting about our days, ""How was work?"" and ""I have Sunday off,"" and other small talk. Told him how much I loved him. I don't even remember most of the conversation leading up to it. I don't even remember the music, honestly. I was so utterly mesmerized by him. And at one point, he pauses, looks me dead in the eye, and says, ""Will you marry me?"" Just above a whisper. Only I could hear it. Only we knew what had just happened.

The reason that this is offmychest is because I can't tell anyone. Nobody would take us seriously. We're still pretty young (not teenagers by any means...full-grown adults with careers and credit and all the other things that supposedly make you an adult), and we haven't been dating for a reasonable time by any realistic standards. I think people would just laugh it off or think less of me. My friends don't know. My parents especially don't know.

But I know that this is real. I felt it when he rubbed my back when I was throwing up from a stomach bug. I feel it in the early morning, when my sleep schedule wakes me up hours before him, but I lay there quietly anyway and listen to him mumble that he loves me, or feel how he twitches in his sleep while cradling me in his arms. I feel it in the space we share at night, when we're halfway across the room from each other doing our own things, and he still makes sure to turn back a couple times an hour to remind me that he's glad I'm there. I feel it when we discuss our problems, about our future, and about our honest pasts. I feel it when he legitimately lights up, like a beacon, every time I see him, whether it's been a week or half a day. He calls me beautiful when I wake up, when I'm sick, and when I'm dressed up. He introduces me as his ""amazing girlfriend"" to everybody and anybody. When it's not ""amazing,"" it's some other wholesome adjective. We go on walks, play video games, listen to music, dance, drink coffee, sit on the porch,  and laugh A TON together. My favorite thing is laying in bed on lazy afternoons, bodies totally intertwined, and just laughing our asses off at some stupid joke that makes no sense. And I cannot get over how much he supports my ambitions and my hobbies. I do the same for him. Wow, he is SUCH a beautiful soul! My heart feels afire when I see him doing what he loves.

In the beginning, he pursued me as much as I pursued him. Timelines or dating ""rules"" were irrelevant.

I've been in several long-term, committed relationships. I've had a 5-year, a 3-year, and a 2-year. Not ONCE during those relationships did I ever feel this way. I thought, ""Sure, we're compatible. This is fine, I guess."" I was content in complacency. But there was always this gut feeling that something was wrong...just off. Dislodged, perhaps? But never obviously, high-alert wrong. Sometimes, I would look at other couples and witness how passionately they loved each other; so I wondered if I was simply incapable of feeling that. Wow, I was so wrong! Society had been telling me to look for all the wrong things. Every time I dated, I subconsciously thought, ""Would my family and friends approve of this guy's resume?"" never once considering that I needed a life partner, a best friend...not a trophy. And, quite literally, the DAY that I decided once and for all to drop all of those ridiculous standards...he showed up in my life. Just crashed his way in, unapologetically himself.

I don't need a fancy wedding. I don't need the thought-out proposal. I would be happy with a simple band or a ring bought from a thrift store. And I would most certainly be happy to show up at a courthouse and get that shit done. I just know, without a shadow of a doubt, that I want to spend the rest of my life with this man.

Now that I've found him, after spending so much of my life wandering about and feeling lost, I'm not letting him go.

Wow, it feels so good to have written all of this down. I just wanted someone to know. Thank you for reading.


Edit: I never thought more than a few people would read this. I am so inspired and moved by all of your responses and stories you’ve shared with me. I’m trying to respond to all of them, but I’m on mobile so it’s hard. Will have to wait until I open up my laptop later today. But thank you from the bottom of my heart!

It’s the morning after he played at the club until 3:30am. I’m laying next to him right now. He’s PASSED out. I love it when he turns his back to me, and I can just snuggle up in it and rub it and scratch it and feel his skin. He knows I posted this (couldn’t help but share some of your comments with him), but he has no idea what the post says...I think I’ll read it to him when he wakes up. We’re gonna go for a walk at a nature park and get breakfast together. Since I’m already wide awake and he’s dead asleep haha (as usual), and he probably won’t wake up for a few hours at least, I’ll just look through your comments again for entertainment. :) 

Edit 2: 
1) We were not rolling.
2) We have never tripped or rolled together.
3) Just because we were raving doesn’t mean we do drugs. 😁
4) I guarantee our love is very independent of drugs or other factors that might interfere with our sense of judgment."

Do you know how fucking hard that is where I live?

I worked so fucking hard for YEARS whilst everybody told me to be satisfied with less.

""Don't study in Year 9, start working in Year 10"", you said.

""Don't study in Year 10, start working in Year 11"", next.

""Year 11 means nothing, only Year 12 counts"". 

Lucky I worked consistently the whole time - ignoring the people who warned me that I'd ""burn out"" if I worked too hard.

I am crying, Reddit. I have never been this happy in my life. I'm going to be a doctor!

And I also know that the hard work has only just begun... Bring it on!

My antivaxxer mom never let me get the HOV vaccine. In a couple minutes I'm finally getting it.,"She always told me I'd die if I get it. My old family doctor told me that only ""bad girls"" need it, and since I'm a ""good girl"" I don't need to get the vaccine. 

Finally, at 24, I worked up the gets to get the HPV vaccine. In a couple minutes I'm getting the first shot in the series. 

I'm so excited to not have to worry about getting cervical cancer. If this makes me a loose girl or puts me at risk of a one in a million death, so be it. 

Vaccinate your damn kids, or they'll vaccinate themselves the moment they get the chance.

"I got my degree, and my family doesn't even care","Bachelors in Physics and Mathematics, 3 years, and a perfect GPA. 

I did everything they wanted me to: I made myself into the perfect child for them. I stayed on the straight and narrow path, paid my own way, always looked respectable, was sensible with my money, stayed away from drama, kept good friends, didn't embarrass myself when drinking, didn't sleep around. 

I thought it'd be enough this time, but they still don't care. My dad didn't even look away from the TV when I told him, and my mum brushed it off when I spoke to her on the phone. I don't expect a big party, but even just going out to dinner one night. Even just a congratulatory chocolate bar, or a sticker, saying ""well done"", *anything*. They won't even go to my graduation because they can't be bothered. I thought they'd finally be proud of me. They were so proud of my brother for his 3.0 in Fine Art, so why not me? 

I know why. 

I'm Autistic, which makes me a huge embarrassment to them and which is something they've expressed multiple times in the past. They can't love me because no matter what I do, I'm always just the defective kid they wish had never been born. They'd rather just pretend that I don't exist, and they don't really appreciate it when I remind them otherwise. 

I don't need them. I don't need a family, I have good friends who are proud of me on their behalf. I'm going to go ahead and do whatever the fuck I want to do with my life, and when I'm the one in the family who has status and money, I won't answer their calls. 

Edit: wow this really blew up....

Thank you so much for your kind words (and gold?!), they really do mean a lot to me. I'm going to be getting on a plane soon to party it up with friends, but I'll probably spend it reading all of your comments. "
I did it,"I fucking did it. I've been working at a restaurant for about 2 years now, last summer started dishwashing at 15 years old, worked all summer(extremely busy restruant) and I told myself by this time next year I would be cooking. I learned and trained all winter while dishwashing and kitchen running at the same time, working my ass off, to finally be a fry cook in March. This summer I've worked 65 hour weeks all summer, made 8 thousand dollars, and can now buy a car for my birthday in October. And I finally made it through the summer (our busiest season)  cooking, at 16 years old. Idc what others say about me being too young, I fucking did it, and I didn't have to, but I made something of myself, and now entering my junior year, I know I wanna cook the rest of my life. I've never been more proud of myself before. "
I’m lying next to my husband.,"Edit: Sorry for the confusion, yes the boyfriend/husband are the same person, he’s just currently my boyfriend! Thank you so much for all the kind words, my day has been made from all the lovely comments on here! 

Right now I’m in bed and my boyfriend is sleeping next to me. He is the most caring, funny, smart, nerdy man and my best friend. I couldn’t imagine life without him and I know I’m going to marry him.
I’m going to try and sleep too now, so thank you for letting me get this off my chest Reddit!"
A letter to my wife,"I met you when I was 20 and you were 22,as soon as we locked eyes I was in love and a few months later when I found a note book of yours where you have been practicing writing your first name with my last name,it made me feel so warm inside and I knew you were the one for me.
We got engaged a year later and got married 10 months after ,we were from different cultures but you lit up every room you ever walked into and everyone loved you.
3 years later we had our first daughter and you were a fantastic mum from the get go,kids were always drawn to you,3 years later our twin girls were born and our family was complete You raised three beautiful smart girls and you were the best mum any kid can wish for,our oldest girl is 15 now and the twins are 12 you just got your dream job and life couldn’t be better. Or so we thought, around the middle of the year you got struck with cancer and it was very aggressive.the doctors told us you might have a year maybe more but that wasn’t meant to be,you cried and told me I love my life so much and I don’t want to die,and I cried with you telling you everything will be ok,we will fight this together,3 months after you were diagnosed you took your last breath with me our girls by your side.you were only 43.
It had been 4 months now and it hasn’t got any easier,you were the light in our lives and it’s so dark and lonely without you,I wish I could just hug and kiss you one last time and tell you how much I love you.

UPDATE: IM ABOUT TO LEAVE

UPDATE 2: i left for the date at 3:30 pm and got to the mall movie theater at 4:10, she arrived at the mall at 4:36ish so the problem was that now she couldn't buy a movie ticket because she was late. at first i was panicking because that means instead we are just gonna walk around and talk/ buy stuff. but against all odds, against my expectations, against fate itself, THE DATE WENT SO WELL HOLY SHIT GUYS!!! I THOUGHT THIS SHIT WAS GONNA BLOW UP IN MY FACE BECAUSE SHE IS SO MUCH MORE ATTRACTIVE THAN ME BUT IT WAS SO GREAT!!! WE TALKED AND TRIED ON CLOTHES. SHE WOULD ASK FOR MY OPINION ON THEM AND SHE LOOKED STUNNING IN ALL OF THEM. TO FINISH OFF THE NIGHT WE (cliche) GOT PHOTO BOOTH PICTURES. SHE WANTS TO DO IT AGAIN SOON!! THIS MIGHT'VE BEEN THE BEST POSSIBLE TIMELINE GUYS. WAKING UP TO YALLS AWESOME SUPPORT AND LEAVING THE MALL AT 9, THIS DAY COULDN'T HAVE GONE BETTER!!! THANK YOU GUYS WE DID IT!!!

EDIT: forgot to mention shes my date to homecoming"
Teen Suicide,"One of my students committed suicide last night.  Instead of opening a dialogue with the students (High School age) about mental illness and the options available to them (Councilor, Suicide Hotline, etc), we are keeping hush-hush on the matter.  I am angry and upset, and to keep my job I have to go along with the status quo and not tell these kids that they have places and people that they can go to if they feel the need. All I can do is be there for them if they decide I am that person, but that obviously isn't enough because she killed herself.  Senior in High School on the varsity softball team with a full softball scholarship to go to college.  I'm fucking devastated but I have to be strong for the students.

&#x200B;

Admittedly this hits so hard for me because when I was a senior in HS, I attempted suicide.  Thankfully I was unsuccessful.  This girl got her father's service pistol and shot herself.  Fuck.  Fuck, fuck, FUCK.  I feel so fucking helpless.

Edit: I just got word they have grief councilors coming in and for those worried about me I have an appointment with my therapist Monday. Thank you everyone for your kind words."
I got my 12 year old little Sister Kicked Out of the House,"My sister and I have different fathers, she goes to his house every other week, and I live with our Mom full time. Her Father totally enables my sister to do whatever she wants, when she wants. He drives her to school every day and he ALWAYS buys an expensive coffee for her, every weekend he has her she has friends over at his house, he buys food for all of them, rides to the mall and my sister always has cash given to her by her dad. She has the latest and greatest fashion and tech. 

My Mom does not spoil my sister like that at all. Although my sister believes she should be treated the same way her Dad treats her at all times. Mom does not have as much money as her Dad either. I don't have the latest and greatest anything, I've worked 2 jobs since I was 14 to buy myself a car when I turned 16. Also there have been times where I've had to help my mom pay bills. 

A month before I turned 16 I bought myself a VW Beetle for $2000. Insurance was $100 and gas was $40 a month. My Mom never gave rides to my sister to go places she wanted to go unless my mom was going to that same place or somewhere in the area. We lived within a mile or two of most places and my sister could walk or ride her bike. But when I got my license she started demanding that I give her rides places she wanted to go. She demanded I give her friends rides places. I did sometimes but I would say no often. Her Dad started messaging asking me if I could give her rides. He offered me money (Which he would give me to my sister to give to me but she never did). So I started saying no and turning down the money he dad offered me. Around this time, my sister also started refusing to do her chores because I was not giving her rides. ""I'll do it if you give me a ride to this place."" That's not how it works because it's what Mom expects to be done every day. So I would do my chores and her chores wouldn't get done. Mom would get mad at both of us. So I started doing both of our chores for awhile. Around this time my friend and I got in a fight, my boyfriend since middle school cheated on me. My friend stopped talking to me. I was really upset and suicidal. I started then getting into arguments with my sister because I didn't want to do her chores anymore because I was working two jobs and going to school. I didn't want to do her chores on top of mine. Then, she started calling me names, saying I've got no friends... etc, she would hit me and kick me. 

I wouldn't do anything to her because the last time I hit her I was in middle school. She told her dad and he tried to take custody of her. It cost my Mom THOUSANDS of dollars. I knew better than to hit her because she would tell her Dad again. She told me to go kill myself, told me that everyone would be better off without me. To a person who is suicidal, that just FEEDS their validation of wanting to end their lives. My Mom overheard what my sister said and obviously went ballistic on my sister. Took away a lot of her stuff. Didn't even let her go to school for two days because she knew my sister would contact her dad and not tell him the truth. And it's her word over anyone else's. My mom composed herself and told her Dad what happened first. He grounded her as well and for once in her life actually punished her. The next week my sister came back. She was out to get me. The arguments about chores obviously continued. She ended up pushing me down the stairs. I caught myself after I fell a few stairs down but my ankle was hurt. She told me to go kill myself and said several other things I would rather not repeat. I went outside and cried until my Mom got home from work. Sister had locked me out of the house too. I told Mom what had happened, my ankle was pretty swollen and hurting but I could walk on it fine. It was just twisted. Mom unlocked the house and screamed at my sister for an hour. Told my sister to pack a bag while she called her Dad to come pick her up because my Mom wasn't going to have one of her kids telling the other to go kill themselves. 


My sister was allowed to come back home after two weeks. Because my Mom can't afford to be out the $400 in child support she gets from her Dad. But it's only until this Summer because Mom and I are moving out of state for her new job. She has decided she will stay with her Dad. She and I aren't allowed to be in the same room anymore as her comments continued when she came back. 

Also, I got help with the stuff I was going through and I got through it. I just can't wait until Summer. And before any of you say my Mom is being cruel for leaving my sister. She was given the choice of who she wanted to be with. For obvious reasons she chose her Dad. Mom has cried over it. But my sister wants to be spoiled rotten. Every kid has a favorite parent but my sister took it to the extreme."
Posting that you’ve made it through a MONTH of marriage is absolutely fucking ridiculous.,"It’s been a month. Part of which you were most likely on your honeymoon. And if not your friends and family just handed you a bunch of cash and cool shit that you all picked out for yourselves. Congrats on making it through literally the easiest part of your marriage. Now please sit the fuck down and shut the fuck up. 



*EDIT: I realize that not everyone’s first month is rainbows and butterflies. But this is a trend I’m seeing grow rapidly—especially in the upper middle class suburbia I grew up in. I just think it’s another excuse to post something on social media for other people to see. Celebrate yourselves with each other—not with Facebook. "
I got an A on my math test,"So I’m doing math one class higher, which is (unsurprisingly) hard, last Friday I had a half year test (test about everything I’ve learned) and I got an A.

I had a great time with my crush.,"It's currently 2 AM, I have to get up for my first day of classes at 8 AM, and right now I'm all excited and giggly. I was trying to sleep earlier around 12 AMish, but couldn't sleep. I decided to text my current crush, and asked her if she wanted to go on a walk. (We are in dorms so she's close to me) This is not completely foreign for us to do, but usually not this late. I figured she was sleeping but I texted anyway. To my surprise she wasn't. I forgot she was a night owl like me, and she said yes. I met her at her room and we walked around in pretty cold weather for over an hour. We talked about a huge variety of stuff, and she said some very confidence boosting things to me. Like how she felt a very good vibe with me when she first met, stuff like that. I really feel like I'm one of her closest friends. It was easily a very enjoyable conversation. Our walk really peaked when we found a collection of blue painted plastic flamingos. I don't know why it was so fun, but we just kept walking through them and it was quiet magically in a weird sense.

We decided to head back around 1:30 AM, but that wasn't the end of our time together. She invited me into her room. While walking we talked about her make up a bit since she wasn't wearing any (except for some on her eyebrows) and she usually does around our friend group. Why that matters is she says the stuff on her eyebrows makes a huge difference, and said she'll show me after the walk. We got into her room and I watched her take her stuff off while I stared at her in the mirror. She is really quite a cutie lol. After words she asked if I wanted to try it. I figured why the hell not. She sat me down and started to apply makeup to me. It was a first time for me, but was quite fun. Also I should add all the eye contact we made while she applied makeup to me really made flustered and happy, and it's when the giggly feeling started. It was a great time and then we parted ways around 1:50 AM, then I walked back and started writing this. I'm really glad this happened and it's definitely worth being a bit sleep deprived for my class tomorrow. Now I will sleep!

&#x200B;

Edit: Woke up to many messages. Thanks for the comments guys! Asking her out is something I'm not going to delay much further. I've been planning how I would do it over Christmas break and I will definitely do it in the next week or so. Even if I'm met with rejection it won't be too bad, she's still a great friend to have and will most definitely be understanding and we wouldn't let it deteriorate what we have. Oh and btw I'm a straight dude and she already knows that. The makeup stuff was definitely a first for me and I was feeling adventurous.

To the girls that got kicked out of the festival. Ha ha,"I hope you learned a valuable lesson.  I did not ask for you to be kicked out, but I am glad you did! Ahahahaha!  I hope you spent all your money to see Eminem.  You missed a great performance!!   I had been standing near the security people on purpose because of my disability, and they were aware of it.  When you whipped me in the face with your nasty, smelly wet hair, I said nothing.  I assumed it was a mistake. Yet then you started pushing up on me and getting in front on me so I could not see. I tappped you on your shoulder and politely mentioned I had a disability and needed some space.  You said “oh ok” but started pushing into me again.  You were progressively getting worse.   So, I finally had to stick my elbow out to get you off of me.  That’s when you got in my face and started wagging your finger at me.  You were asking me who I thought I was, instigating a fight.  Then your little friend got in my face.  I tried to ignore you two and watch the show.  Well little did you know security watched the whole damn thing and had the cops come to collect you.  When you asked me “who do you think you are?”  I did not respond.  However, now I will.  I am a person that has a lot more class than you!"
My little sister told me she will miss me,"My sister is 18 (5yrs younger than me + my only sibling) but has a myriad of disabilities. She has autism, OCD and psychosis. Her most recent IQ test put her at the level of a 3rd grader. Like most people with autism, she has difficulty expressing emotions & being touched. It’s something we’ve all gotten used to, but it doesn’t make it any less hard when she lashes out or breaks down for no apparent reason. But don’t get me wrong, she’s a clever girl. She can watch a movie once & memorize all of the actors names just from the credits. She is amazing with rescue animals and has almost every dog breed memorized by heart. She just isn’t your conventional 18yr old. She spends a lot of time in her room alone listening to music or reading and hates being bothered too.
 
We’ve often butted heads (I have struggled with her diagnosis in the past) and still bicker to this day. Her anger and outbursts outweigh any nice or sweet moments we share... But we’ve gotten closer over the years. Her favorite way for us to hangout is to sit in my room and watch Friends. She thinks it’s hilarious and it’s our way of bonding. We don’t talk much, and I’ve gotten used to that. I tell her I love her all the time. Her response is always “mhmm” and a head nod. It may not be perfect, but it’s how things are and I’ve accepted that.
 
Next May I will be getting married and moving across the state to be with my husband. I’ve been sad thinking about leaving my family but they’ll only be 2hrs away and I figure my sister spends so much time alone, it won’t phase her much. She jokes about how she’s excited for me to move because she gets my bedroom and she can redecorate it how she wants. She hasn’t said much about me moving aside from things like that.
 
Tonight she was in an abnormally cheerful mood while we were eating dinner with our parents and we were quoting Friends episodes, laughing a lot. Her favorite episode is the Unagi episode so she kept quoting it and laughing sooo much. As I was about to head upstairs, my sister said “sissy.. I’m going to miss watching Friends with you when you move. I’m gonna miss you”
 
Y’all I started bawling. It is so so rare to get something so genuine from her and to hear her say that broke my heart but also made it skip a beat from happiness. 
 
Even though she may not show it all the time, my little sister loves me and I am so so blessed to be her big sister. This move will be rough. "
I want my wife to be alive again.,"My wife of 6 years commited suicide December 11th 2017. We've been together since 8th grade, 11 years all in all and she was my only girlfriend, my only fiancé, my only wife. She was my only love and I have never known any other flesh. We loved each other so deeply and so genuinely, we rarely ever fought and we always apologized quickly. We cared about each other's opinions and each other's feelings, we respected each other and were always seen together. We definitely had the kind of relationship where nobody hardy ever saw us apart, commonly we were told that we were role models for our other married friends. 

We were wrangled into one of those independent KJV only Baptist churches at a young age because the church van would pick us up, and that was how we could hang out. In time we became devout Christians and our lives revolved around our religion. We actually waited until marriage when we were 19/18 years old to have sex, the whole scene. Later I became an atheist, and more socially liberal, and she was faithful to me and we worked our way out of a lifestyle of nonstop church and ministry work 6 days a week. It was very trying for us to detach from that kind of all consuming lifestyle, I never doubted that we could weather the storm of that change together. We had so much resistance to our dating (later, ""courtship"") and our pastor convinced her to break up with me several times in the name of her focusing on her spiritual life. It feels like we worked our hands to the bone to overcome so many obstacles and finally be together physically after 5 years of dating; to be married and have a family has always been our dream. We were looking into buying a house next year, I had just gotten a great job with an excellent retirement program and our debts were being paid off fairly quickly.

Really everything was looking up, but she hung herself in our closet and she left me behind. And I don't believe in afterlife. We have two sons in kindergarten that I cannot leave behind in good conscience although my brother in law has done me a great favor in agreeing to raise them if I cannot endure, this is reflected in the will I had written up a month or so ago. He's a great person and his family is well put together, I trust them completely to be competent caretakers for my sons. 

I already know all the reasons I cannot go, I've heard the tough love, I've heard the platitudes, I've heard the religious and my fellow nonbelievers both give their perspectives on why I should stay. I know my boys would never truly know how close we were to my ideal family, they would think we were like our own parents who couldn't stop partying to bother being parents; who didn't really love us and want to raise us until we were already grown. They wouldn't know how sweet she was, how gentle she was. She was so innocent in her conduct, and had such a sweet voice, she could sing well too. People used to say she should have done voice acting. I sleep with her wedding dress at night in the closet where she died. I hold the thigh high Chuck Taylor's she married me in, I smell the lock of hair that I cut off at the funeral home. I cradle the cheap brown plastic box her ashes are in at night to keep it warm. When I saw her at the funeral home I bit a hole in the end of my thumb and colored her pale lips red again, I pulled open her eyelids and looked into them for a long time, I told her I was only for her, that I would never love another woman, I would stay loyal to her even in her death. I told her I would join her in the grave when I put my affairs in order. But they've been in order for weeks now. I have the methods of deliverance ready at any time. But I can't make myself leave my sons alone. I can't rationalize it away. I've made a shrine of sorts in the closet and I go there sometimes to torture myself with her memory; penance for failing to save her from herself. She's all I can think about. I have friends that have moved in temporarily to help me with my sons, and I hang out with them and other friends sometimes when my dad takes the kids for the weekend. But I'm always alone really.

I don't believe she can hear me or see me. I don't think we will ever see each other again, certainly not in a familiar way. I'm completely trapped in life. I want to die but I can't leave my sons behind, no matter how well they would be cared for in my absence. People say she lives on in memory and in my sons but that's just romantizing things. My memory will slowly become corrupted by the natural way we edit and forget the past, I'll forget how day to day life was with her. I'll forget the nuances of her body language and the cadence of her speech. I'll forget what it felt like to grab her waist and hold her hips. I'll forget what her jawline felt like in my hands. I'll forget how her hair smelled after the lock of it I have has stopped smelling like her, and started smelling like me. I'll forget how her face looked when she slept, or how her hair would tickle my nose and make me sneeze when we spooned. Even if I commit all these things to writing, I'll lose the emotional connection, it will lose the meaning. I despise the transience of memory. It's like water falling out of my cupped hands and the oasis is dried up now. 

When I dream of her, she’s disinterested in me now. She left me because she felt she was a bad wife and a bad mother. She felt she was a bad friend and nobody loved her but me. All these delusions were products of her depression. I regret being on board with her getting antidepressants. But if she had died without them I would have cursed myself for fighting against them. I often find myself thinking of open vistas of gray earth, decaying flowers and dark skies. None of it is romanticized for me like it was before. I made peace with the end of self at death long ago, but it was after a lifetime together. Now I'm stuck here at 26 with maybe 50 more years left without her.

I just want her back. I love you Brandy. I'll never let myself be happy without you. We both know we are too selfish with our love to be any other way.

Sorry for the long post. I needed somewhere to say this besides Facebook. "
My parents kept my brother a secret from me,"It's 4pm and I'm drunk lol

These past few weeks have been insane. I posted on here before....my brother went missing a long time ago. I thought he ran away from home. Long story short, I got into contact with some detectives that our family has known since my brother went missing. When I started asking questions, they told me that my brother was no longer on any missing persons registry. When I asked what that meant, they told me that he was removed per my parent(s) request. 

I asked my parents--my dad, actually. My dad ignored me. My mom told me my brother is alive and okay (""as far as she knows""). They found my brother years ago--a very, very long time ago--and found out he was living with another man. He's gay, and it disgusted my parents. He tried reaching out to them. They told him they didn't want anything to do with him and that I didn't remember him adn wouldnt' want to see him.....

I went ballistic. My parents weren't fazed by it. They sincerely hate my brother for who he is--for being gay. They kept him a secret from me all my fucking life. My brother missed the birth of his nephew, he missed my wedding, graduations, EVERYTHING. just because of my parents. they lied to me.

I've been able to get a phone number and contact information from police officers. my brother left it all open in case anyone from our family wanted to contact him. i still can't work up the nerve to call him. the address i have for him is across the fucking country. but he's alive. my brother is alive. i'm drunk as fuck right now because i can't deal with any of this. i haven't talked to my parents in weeks and i never plan on speaking to them again. not for what they've done to me, or my brother. 

this is real and it happened. it happened--it is happening right now. i dont know how to process this at all. my parents let me blieve my brother was dead or kidnapped forever, when in reality he just ran away and when he wanted to come back they disowned him

im fucking crying right now. how could you do that? fuck you, God. fuck you christians and jesus. idont even know i'm so fucking--i'm sorry"
"My soldier daughter came home, my son got his PhD, my other son married his partner, my grandson had a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. It's been a good day.","Normally my wife is the one who posts here on reddit, but after today I really want to share some happy news and get it off my chest in a good way. I am a man in my 50s who has cried more today than I ever have before, and I am not ashamed.

It's been a rough year for my family. My only grandchild got sick and almost died. My oldest child, my daughter is in the armed forces and has been stationed overseas. We haven't seen her in over a year. Now for today: My grandson received a lifesaving bone marrow transplant. No one in our family was a match, we all got tested, but a stranger that we have never met saved his life. Today his father, my oldest son officially became a PhD, after being the the first person in our family to attend and graduate from college. Because of the historic ruling by the Supreme Court a hospital chaplain officiated the wedding of my younger son and his wonderful partner. And in a total surprise to us all, my daughter came home from her assignment early to so she could see her nephew and be with the family. It has been a long, tiring and exhausting day, but it was also the best day of my life."
He kept it.,"   When I was little, I had one friend. One. We rode the same bus to and from school, we liked the same things, we both had kind of fucked up home lives, and we both loved Pokemon. I was too poor to get a Gameboy, and he knew that, so he would let me borrow his. I caught this stupid little Marill because I thought it was adorable, but then I had to give the Gameboy back to him. I moved away a little after that and I haven't seen him in person in 7 years.


   We still talk, and for Memorial Day we were chatting about ""the old days"" when he mentioned that Gameboy. He still had that Pokemon game. He still had his old save files. He still had my Marill. He took a picture of it and sent it to me. This marvelous, fantastic, sweet boy kept that stupid level 1 Marill of mine for 7 years because it was important to me. Now it's a level 58 Azurill. He beat gym leaders with the damn thing. That is one of the sweetest things anyone has ever done for me. I didn't want to cry while talking to him because I know that emotion makes him uncomfortable because of some of the stuff that happened to him and he doesn't like feeling things, but after we stopped talking I had to sit and cry for a while. Thanks, man. That means a lot more than you know. A lot more.

EDIT: I realize now that I may have messed up the Gameboy Advance, Azumarill, and level thing. Sorry about that."
I outed my mother for her abuse on her fb wall,"And I feel ok with it. She allowed pedophiles (her family members and possibly boyfriends) to molest her children. I remember a guy standing in the window of our basement apartment screaming at her that he was going to “screw you and your kid too”. She performed a sex act on one of her many boyfriends in front of me when I was 3 or 4 years old. She regularly beat the shit out of me. She would sabotage the few friendships I had with other kids. She would project her insecurities onto me. She tried to a few days ago and I was strong enough to tell her to go fuck herself. I don’t think she has much longer to live; 5+ heart attacks, smokes like a chimney, high blood pressure, copd, diabetes (age early 60s now). When she does finally kick it, I will feel relief.

Update: I sent her a screenshot of (just) the reddit post and she said that my witnessing the sex act she did never happened. Didn’t deny anything else. And it did happen because I remember her pausing to scream at me to go back to playing with my dolls."
Sometimes I look at pictures of my ex and his new girlfriend and think,That they are really cute and I'm glad he's happy. He deserves it. He is a really great guy who was there for me in a really difficult time in my life. I'm really glad this girl makes him smile 
I’m getting ready to divorce the love of my life.,"I’ve been married almost 9 years, together for 13. We have three wonderful children. I was blindsided by an affair my wife was having with my good friend. I had no idea. 

Last year I bought her the house of her dreams, and a new Polaris rzr just before this happened. I never knew anything was up. 

One night, she went to have dinner with a friend, and didn’t say she loved me when she left, which was very unusual. We always kissed goodbye before I went to work, and always said we loved each other before we went our separate ways. I looked in find my friends, and seen she was at his house. I called to ask what was going on, and she said we need to talk when we get home. 

Fast forward 3 months later, and I’m sitting here, without my family in an empty home. I’ve been medicated, and seeing a therapist once a week. And it’s helped. 

I’m going to lose my family and be financially ruined. I’m looking at 4700-5100/month in child care and alimony. Even with 50/50 custody. 

She shows no remorse for what she’s done, and I’m terrified to see her when we meet to pick up the kiddos. 

I don’t know what’s going to happen next. I’m just scared, and destroyed. People say life goes on, but this was my life. I lived for my family. "
It's Fathers' Day. Not 'Complain about Fathers' Day. Not 'Single Mothers Day'.,"My Facebook newsfeed is filled with statuses like: 

'Here's to all the Mothers, who are both mother and father.' 

'The deadbeat father of my child isn't around. So happy Father's Day to me.' 

'To all the fathers who are not around, fuck you!' 

And a lot of these are women who, I know, are intentionally blocking the fathers from access to their child. They get a court order so the father cannot see the child except 4 hours a week, and then complain about it on Facebook. And all of them have posted the same statuses on Mothers' Day. 

This is not 'Fuck all Father's Day'. It's not 'Single Mother's Day'. It's Fathers' Day! It's meant to celebrate good fathers. You don't see this kind of stuff on Mothers' Day. If you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything at all. "
My pet died,"I know I'll get ridiculed both here and in real life but I need to share it with someone. Today my pet fish died. She was 20 years old. She was with me for 2/3 of my life. And I'm heartbroken.

Edit: Thank you all for your comments of support and your stories about your pets. I'm reading all of them and trying to reply. Thank you guys"
He proposed to me on Tuesday night and died Wednesday afternoon.,"Boyfriend of four years asked me to marry him on Tuesday night while we had dinner. I knew it was coming; he had been planning and saving for the ring for a long time. 

Wednesday afternoon he was hit head-on by someone who was texting and driving and not paying attention. 

I didn't even have time to post the engagement on social media. No one knew about it but me, him and the people in the restaurant. I want to die. "
To my son who got engaged today.,"I wish you and your future husband all the luck in the world.  You're going to need it with how things are becoming lately.

I love you both so, so very much.  And I'm overjoyed and a little shocked, though, I'm sure you were just as shocked as me.  Are you sure you're ready?  I sure as hell ain't.  This is a big step for my little boy.

You all better fucking adopt.  I want grandchildren.

Love, 
Dad"
"Seriously, fuck Taylor Swift","Taylor Swift recently bought a house in Watch Hill, Rhode Island and I hate her for it.

For those of you who don't know, Watch Hill is a wealthy, yet quiet and laid back community. There are a couple dozen small shops and a few food establishments. There is also a small public beach there. I like to go 3-4 times a summer to walk around and relax with my friends or family.

This summer was different though. It's no longer possible to relax on the beach because the reigning queen of ""country""-pop now owns a huge ocean-front house that's directly overlooking the beach. That's not so bad in and of itself. The problem is that the house is constantly patrolled by these burly, bald, middle-age security guards. Let me tell you, it does not make a person feel relaxed to know they're constantly being watched in their bathing suit. I hate it! Instead of just laying out in the sand and walking up and down the beach without a care in the world, you keep on looking up to see 2-3 men starting out from the property, watching you all the time. 

What enrages me the most is knowing that Taylor Swift probably spent a day or two there all summer, yet the security guards are stationed there permanently. She also has up these STUPID signs that say ""I knew you were trouble when you walked in"" as her ""No Trespassing"" signs. Fuck, I hate it.

Watch Hill is not The Hamptons. If you want your own private beach, then go buy a house that'll give you that. But don't come into a public community and make it super uncomfortable for everyone. 

So, Taylor Swift, you can go fuck yourself and get the hell out of Watch Hill."
My husband just made me cry,"I was sitting in our office staring at the first school schedule I've had in nearly 20 years and he came in with this stupid little smile on his face. He pulls up a chair next to me and asks me if he can hold my hand. 

I told him of course. He grabbed it and his smile widened. The kids loud as hell in the background. He's just sitting there smiling.

I told him he was such a dork. He leans over, kisses my arm, rests his head back on the chair he's sitting in and says, ""I could not possibly be happier with our life.""

I agree. I have so many friends and family members with unspportive partners and unhappy relationships and I feel so grateful and happy to have him. "
My roommate Jack,"I was just looking for a roommate. Actually, you could say I was pretty desperate. I was open to couch-surfing. I had just gotten back from a two-year study abroad experience and was about to begin my last year of undergrad. My other apartment options had fallen through due to one thing or another, so when I got back, I had zero prospects and had to resort to Craigslist and posting flyers at grocery stores. 

One of my friends told me about a friend of hers, Jack, that was looking for a roommate and gave me his contact info. I immediately called him and set up a viewing. 

When Jack pulled open the door, the first thing I noticed was that he was wearing sunglasses. He smiled at me and pulled me into a hug before I could even extend my hand to shake his. He brought me inside his apartment and showed me around. Immediately, I knew we would hit it off just fine. He played video games, ate pizza, and had two cats—Milly and Rock (for those of you who know, yes, the names are based off of the dance). 

Jack told me that others were interested, but him and I had vibed the best and he immediately helped me sign the application and put the deposit down. Jack gave me another swallowing hug and said, “It’s going to be an adventure!” 

And boy, was Jack an adventure. The first day I moved my things in, Jack bought a cake and two bottles of Jack Daniels whiskey. We spent the night playing Super Mario and eating cake and celebrating each other. Jack’s major was in Computer Science, like mine, but he was a year behind me due to taking some time off. We had a few of the same classes and helped each other through the tough ones. 

I’m not sure when it happened, exactly. I think it may have been during New Year’s Eve. Jack and I always had people over at our place. Either for small parties, or for quiet nights of video games, pizza, and cat cuddles. But I remember there was a moment when we were waiting for the fireworks to start. I looked over at Jack, and something changed about him. It was like he was no longer just my roommate and friend, but something more. I liked him. 

I repressed this feeling, because I did not want to “fall in love” with my roommate. That’s weird and breaking so many boundaries. I ignored it. 

A few months later, during Spring Break, Jack brought a girl over that he really liked. Of course, this made me jealous internally, but I told him I would go and give them space. He told me he wanted me to stay and that he didn’t want me to feel uncomfortable. I lied and told him I didn’t. 

When I came back, Jack was asleep on the couch and his girl was gone. I fed Milly and Rock and was going to bed, but Jack woke up when I walked by. I sat down beside him and he moved his head into my lap. He asked me if I was okay, and I said yes. He then asked me if I liked him. In his high-pitched voice to tease me, he added, “I mean, ‘like-like’ me.” I told him I did. 

Then he kissed me. Then we “fell in love.” I don’t know. This is weird. 

We spent three months together, in love, but it was a secret, because I think we were afraid of what our mutual friends would think. Then we had to face reality: I was graduating and moving away to accept a job, and Jack had a year left of undergrad. 

There were realities present: We both loved each other. We were roommates. We had a lot of the same friends. 

So what did we do? 

I broke up with Jack. The day I started moving my things out, I just ended it. I lied and told him I didn’t care about him like that, and it was just a confusing time for me. I think he knew I was lying, but he let me go. Our adventure ended. 

We didn’t talk for about six months. Even during my birthday, Jack didn’t call or anything. It wasn’t until this February that I was visiting a friend back home and ran into Jack at the same place. His smile was so wide. And again, before I could even open my mouth, he was wrapped around me in a hug. I could smell that nose-stinging cologne he would wear that I would beg him not to. I could feel his beard tickling my ear. Something about all of this just felt so familiar and so good. 

I miss Jack a lot. I love Jack a lot. I miss Milly and Rock and our cozy apartment. I miss how simple things used to be when I would wander out of bed at 2am and see Jack hunkered over his Nintendo, playing video games. I miss how in-sync we were. I miss us. 

Jack graduated last week. I was there, of course, because I love him so hopelessly, but I was afraid I had ruined it by breaking up with him. 

When I got back to my hotel, Jack called me. Do you know what that jerk said? 

“How about another adventure?” 

God. He’s snoring right beside me and I just love him so much. "
I Walked in on a Shotgun Suicide in The 8th Grade (First Time Sharing This Online)- This Is Why I Can't Forgive Logan Paul,"

I'll share a story with you all. I had walked in on a shotgun suicide when I was starting the 8th grade (2007). There was a terrible smell coming from one of my neighbors apartments and me and my friends laughed and joked about there being a dead body in there. We also laughed because the DVD he had in, Flight Plan, was playing on repeat for almost a week and we could faintly hear it from the connected unit under renovation. This was in a new small building in the complex that only had two working apartments and was a bit out of the way of the rest of the community. We never saw anyone walk by or visit so we always assumed that it wasn't occupied. During the paused period of renovation, which we assumed was because of a small fire we had two weeks prior, we'd play in the unoccupied units. We started making up back stories about this mans life who we had no idea what kind of person he was, and one of my friends even pissed on his patio.

On a dare, myself and a close friend walked into the apartment and saw a bloated body with half of his face missing, I will never forget it for as long as I live. We ran out frantically to his grandparents unit to tell them what happened, which they called the police. After collecting myself, for the next few days I was unable to eat, enjoy video games, focus on my homework and had fits of crying. I was so messed up that I had begged my friend to talk to the police and pretend I didn't see anything because I simply didn't want to talk about it. It wasn't until about four years later, right before enlisting into the military, did I tell my mother and was open about it wish I had done sooner.

After the accident, all I could think about was this mans life and how nobody noticed his absence for almost a week. Common thoughts constantly ran through my head along the lines of ""Nobody loved this guy. He was alone in his final moments and leading up to that. How depressed must he had felt to take his own life. What was he like? What did he do for a living. Does he have friends, did he, what happened? Why am I so selfish to not talk with people who are very sad about their issues. Are there other people I know who feel this way but are hiding it?""

What made me feel even worse for this man, who was suffering more than most of us would never experience, was when I talked with our security guard, because my friend had brought it up with me around, who would always play catch and let us ride our skateboards even against the rules of the complex. He told me his name, Michael, then said he'd often come to the small community lounge and use one of their two computers they had for the tenants. Once, when Michael had logged off of the guest account, the security guard got on to check his email and just download some stuff. When deleting some junk on the computer, he went into the trash to pull something out, finding word documents in their. Normally he would have deleted them but one stuck out to him like a sore thumb, it read something along the lines of ""To my wife when I find her"" and many others like ""to children he never had"". This man was so lonely that he wrote optimistic letters to people he wanted in his life and even named the kids he wanted to have. My memory is a little rusty on the contents of the letters, especially from the second hand account of our security guard.

After this I felt overwhelming guilt I have never felt in my life and regret every comment I made poking fun of someone who was going through this. All I could think about was him looking down on us hearing all of these horrible things coming from our mouths as a last ""Fuck you"" in Michael's already terrible experience on earth. I just wished he could have seen the impact it had on my close circle including the letters we each wrote to him as closure that my friends counselor recommended. We each cried as we sat in his living room writing them and then even more when we burned them.

This is the first time I have shared this on the internet. I feel it is the right time given the whole Logan Paul situation and why I have a hard time feeling sorry for him. I hope this changes his life for the better and he becomes a more genuine person, not just for others but for his own benefit.

To Logan: It is a shame that it took literally over a million people to point out not showing any remorse for the victim in your first apology for you to even consider doing it in your most recent one. I'm not saying that this is disingenuous, but for you sake, I hope you come back as a better person and take this as a very harsh life lesson. 

As for everyone shrugging this off like ""Lol! Oopsie, I feel so sorry for him and fuck everyone who doesn't instantly forgive him because I like his content"" need to do some soul searching themselves. Imagine what must have driven that poor person to the point of suicide and feeling that to take their own life was the only way out. Take the worst you have ever felt in your life and just relive and relive and relive it until just seizing to live seems like a viable solution. 

To those of you that read this lengthy post, thank you sincerely."
I... succeeded,"I defended my thesis. People are calling me Dr. Smith. It's been 6 years. It's almost unthinkable that it's done and I don't have to work on it any more. 

I have treatment resistent depression. It's mostly under control right now, but it never really goes away. When I saw how many people had come to congratulate me, a part of me felt like I had tricked them into liking me. That I had somehow cheated my way into a doctorate I didn't really earn and friends I don't really deserve. Then I felt ashamed for thinking that, since I know it would make people sad and angry to hear.

I know I did earn my degree and that my friends, family and colleagues weren't duped into liking me, but I still feel like I deserve neither.

Oh well. At least I'll have more spare time now.

Edit: I'm overwhelmed by all the kind responses here. Thank you all so much! "
I got a 36,"I got a 36 on the ACT! My parents said ""no one gets a 36, try shooting for a 30 instead."" My tutor said that there was no way I'd get a 36, as I'd gotten a 26 the time before (it was during finals and I had absolutely no time to study for both). But I did it! I spent weeks of my summer studying instead of playing video games or going out with friends, and it paid off!"
My boyfriend said he loves me,"My boyfriend and I went to a beach house party this weekend. We drank wine and swam in the ocean. We went to bed cramped in the top of a bunk bed. 

In the middle of the night he woke me up and said, “I love you”. 

I wasn’t sure if he meant it. In the morning I asked if he remembered saying something to me and he said he remembered saying that and he does in fact mean it. I am happy because I love him, too. 

Edit: also this is the first time he’s said it so I’m extra happy "
To the police officer who was just here...,"You've shown a face of the police the media almost never get to see. The two times I've called the police on neighbor, who is schizophrenic, extremely delusional, and needs help because he stopped taking his medicine when he moved here, it's been you that's shown up.  Even though you couldn't help me get the help he needs, you have come to visit him every day just to make sure he is okay.

Today, you came on your day off with your husband and brought him a microwave, fridge, and food to eat since you realized he had none of these things the other day. Out of your own pocket. Without anyone to asking you to. On your day off.

I don't give a damn what people say about the police, especially in the present climate. You just showed me what it means to be a true caring human being. What it means to be a Police Officer. To help those in need. I wish everyone could see what you have done here today.

I tip my hat to you."
Please stop telling me it’s “time for another”.,"I have a 6 month old kiddo. People ask me all the time when I’m having another. They say “oh she’s getting out the way for the next one!” Or “it’s about time for another!”  My FFIL asked me when I was going to have another, right after the delivery of my first - as I was on my 2nd blood bag. Little did he know I almost died a couple hours beforehand. He also didn’t know I was advised to not have anymore biological children, or that I never should have been able to have my daughter. 

And now, a whole 6 months later all I hear, even from family members and friends who all know that I can’t have anymore children is *when are you going to have another* 

*you need to try for a boy*
*she needs a sibling* 
*just have a c-section, you’ll be fine*

IT DOESN’T FUCKING MATTER HOW THE BABY GETS OUT. NO MORE BIO KIDS MEANS NO MORE FUCKING BIO KIDS. 

I just want to scream at all of them. How fucking dumb can you be. Excuse the fuck out of me for wanting to be here for the one child I do have instead of leaving two children with no mother. 

"
I just realized that I dislike all of my friends.,"My parents told me that I'm going to move to a different country next year. I told my friends about this news and they all told me that they were going to miss me. And a thought just popped into my mind: I'm not going to miss any of them. The thought of moving to a different country excites me, so I can make new friends there. I just realized that I won't miss any of my friends. And that made me realize that I don't particularly like any of my friends. Sure, I like hanging out with them, but do I like them? Not really. It's always me reaching out to them first and helping them. Would any of them ever do that for me? No. I don't know if I'm the shitty person or they're the shitty person. I think I just haven't truly forgiven them for what they've done in the past to hurt me. I feel like I love them more than they love me, so I don't want to love them because they hurt me and they could hurt me more. Spending time with them is fun, but I don't like them and I don't want to love any of them.

Edit: Wow, genuinely thank you for all the kind and supportive comments!"
For 4 years I lived a lie of having a college degree,"My mental health got in the way I didn’t pass the last class I needed to graduate. Instead of finishing it, I gave up. Luckily my career is not in my degree field (it’s liberal arts, I work in tech) so my first career job didn’t verify. After that my experience carried me to my second job. But I left up my degree on LinkedIn. Continued joking about the calls from the donation center etc. about a month ago my job asked me to start applying to MBA programs. I couldn’t really do that without a degree but I was afraid to tell them the truth. 

So I reach out to my school. There’s a class I took one year in a different deptartment. She says it can cross count if the dean of the liberal arts school agrees. He does. 

I’m officially a college graduate. 

I no longer need to tell a lie. "
"To the girl on the bus,","Thank you. 
We see each other everyday, me on my way to work, you on your way home from college, and although we had never talked before, when I fell asleep, you woke me up for my stop, the same stop we both get, so I didn't sleep through till the end of the line. I was having a really shit day. I was sick and I hadn't gotten much sleep. You taking the time to stop at my seat, nudge me and smile at me and then, you didn't even wait for me to say thank you, you just got off the bus. The simple fact that you had even noticed we get the same stops was lovely, but the fact that you saw me fall asleep and made sure I got off on the right stop was amazing. 
So thank you. You made sure I wasn't late to see the little boy I care for. You made my shitty day less shit, by making sure I wasn't late. 
So thank you, sincerely, 
The girl who always smiles back."
I just got a full ride to college. I can go to college now. I can't believe it.,"For the scholarship I had to do multiple interviews...it was so intense... I was nervous the whole time. 

Most of my family just went to high school. I was worrying so much about costs, but now I am so relieved. I honestly can't say enough how relieved I am and grateful. I am in a dream."
My father died yesterday morning. I want to tell whoever is willing to read about him.,"My dad grew up without a father. Because of this, he dedicated his life to being the best father he could possibly be. He told me, when I came of age, that he wanted to have a lot of children, adopt a lot of children, and give them the father he himself always dreamt of.

I'm the first of 10 kids. Some of us are biological children, some of us are adopted, all of us are family. And My father *absolutely* accomplished his goal.

In fiction, we often see mythic men--grand patriarchs that just exemplify wisdom, calm, good judgement, and good character. These are the men who never waver, nor crumble under the pressure of any given situation. These men are mythic because they lack the flaws of humanity.

They do not give in to anything. The conquer temptation, anger, sadness, apathy, and all other poisons to the human condition. They are indomitable and, to put it frankly and simply, they are *better* than everything life throws at them. 

They get thrust into chaos, and they respond with quickness without rushing, they respond with calm and not passion, they stick their heads out to look for where the shots are coming from--and they find the source of the turmoil.

The feel fear, but they fear succumbing to it more than fear itself. 

These men are surely the type of people that can only exist in idealized fiction. 

I am writing this to tell you that if you believe that to be true, **then you. are. wrong.**

Because I have just described my father. The man just did everything right. He gave so much to the people he encountered. He put his best into everything--*everything*. I mean it. My father built houses for a living and as we grew up he would employ us and teach us how to run a business and how to take a patch of dirt and turn it into a home. 

Each home I helped my father build, he built it as if for his own family taking extra care to ensure it was just right. As a teenager, you wonder just why your father is making you repaint a room that was already painted and just needed a touch up. Later on you realize that he didn't just say to do things well, he actually lived by that creed and it was evident by his actions.

Earlier I told you there were ten of us. And, legally speaking, ten of my father's children were his dependents. But I said nothing of the kids he took in and gave a home to. If we had a friend who had a need, my father would meet it and if there was a child in need of a home, they had a home with us. 

Right now, I'm sitting next to my wife in my father's home. There are over 100 people here celebrating his life and Christmas with us and there are more on the way. And when I say celebration, I mean just that. There is grief, but there is no sadness. The spirit of this day is one of pride and triumph.

A man was crafted over the course of a long life of hard lessons. And that man defeated the evils of life. I pray that I see him again one day and I pray I can be as good a man as he.

I'd like to share one story about my dad before I end this. Sitting next to my wife has brought back one of my fondest memories of him.

It was my prom night. And my date, now my wife, came into the living room of her parent's house. I was shaking. I couldn't stop my leg from very noticeably shaking. My heart was banging in my chest and I could hardly speak because I was stuttering. She was that gorgeous (still is).My mother and father were there with cameras as well and they, along with everyone else, noticed my panic.

My father knew just what to say to me and said it in the perfect way. It's as if he'd practiced and prepared for that moment. After the pictures had been taken my dad pulled me to the side and whispered in my ear, *""Knock her up so she's stuck with you forever. That's your only chance.""* 

I laughed. My dad made me laugh and in doing so calmed me. He brought me back out of my head and into reality. The absurdity of the joke smacked against just the right part of my mind and snapped me back into the moment.

That's who my dad was. He was the noble patriarch and the sage. He was the disciplinarian and the comedian. He was the heart and the soul of our family and We all, now, bear the burden of ensuring that he lives on.

Thanks for reading."
"I asked my boyfriend of 2 years if he thinks I love him more than he loves me, and he said yes.","I moved across the world for this person and gave up so much to be with him (put uni and friendships on hold, missed important family events, said goodbye to my cat, allowed my brand new car to sit in a garage for the year). I did it because I've followed my heart instead of my head. 

I am so tired of only understanding half of what someone says (I don't speak the language). I'm sick of struggling to find work and make ends meet. I'm sick of feeling lost in this country I don't belong in. 

But I don't regret it because I've learned so much and had an amazing time... However, I have always had a gut feeling that he would not have done the same for me.

The plan was always to go back to my country (Australia) in March and he come in April, and we spend the year there while I finish uni. But lately I've been so depressed missing home and feeling so out of place. I really needed some direction about whether or not I should go home instead of staying the final 4-5 months. I asked if he would put uni off for the semester (which starts now) and come back with me. He said no. 

Him saying this, and then answering yes to whether or not he thought I loved him more than what he loves me, really gave me the push I needed.

I may adore the fuck out of him - but I am not in control of how he feels about me. What I am in control of is whether or not I continue to look at someone through rose coloured glasses. 

I am not getting overwhelmed by little details, but this feeling of an unequal love has manifested itself in many ways over the course of our relationship and hearing it in words makes everything clear to me. 

I want someone to smell my hair and have their heart feel full, the way I do his. I want someone to tell me I am loved and appreciated and all the effort I have put in is worth it, the way I do for him. I want someone to want me to be their best friend and partner.... Like I do for him. 

Thanks for reading. 


"
Women rape too.,"I am a mediocre-looking male in his early 20s. 

Not too long ago I was completely passed out from drinking too much. I was so wasted but I did notice that a girl, that I considered beautiful before, making sexual advances on me. I already have a crush on somebody else and I am still a virgin. I wanted my first time to be special and hopefully with my crush. 

Apparently, since I woke up in her bed the next morning, she took me to her room upstairs and I just vaguely remember her undressing me and just doing things to me that I didn't give permission for at all.

That morning I woke up and realised what happened and I fled the room in an instant. I texted the girl afterwards that she is a terrible person and that I don't want to have to do anything with her again.

My friend who is friends with both me and the girl told me the next morning that she wasn't that drunk at all and he happily asked how the sex was. I told him that I didn't want to have sex at all and that she raped me, and luckily, he believed me and he is the one person that I was able to share it to. But I still have this immense anger and pit in my stomach that just can't go away.

A lot of people will think that because she is beautiful I probably gave in. But this is not true, I didn't approve of what she was doing at all. 

I hate that there are men that are scared to come out of being sexually harassed or that they have been raped. This whole rape, sexually harass thing is not gender-bound. 

Women fucking rape too, some humans are monsters. "
Dear Subway Employee,"I couldn't go back to tell you because I was at work on dinner break (night shift), but you put the right amount of creamy siracha on my sub. I've been having a rough week and I feel like people aren't always listening when I express my stress. But you listened when I said, ""Just a little creamy siracha"". You didn't load it on, or coat the whole top slice, you put exactly the amount I would have wanted on if I made that sandwich myself. I wasn't sure at first but my entire mouth is dancing and not ablaze. Thank you, for doing the one thing your co-workers can't do right and making my night better. 

UPDATE: found my receipt in the back pocket of my work pants. Dunno if I'll redeem the cookie/drink voucher but I did it for the man, not for the food. Thank your service worker today, give them an extra tip and make their day."
noticed something really little but important to me,"I let a guy who sits next to me borrow my pencil once. I asked if he could return it at the end though, but knowing him I didn't expect him to do it. I didn't really care though. 

Halfway through class, I left without my stuff because I began having a panic attack. Later that day I had to go get my stuff from the office. My book, notebook, folder, and pencil+ the pencil the guy borrowed was in my bag, neatly. The secretary said that the guy brought my bag to the office because I left it in class. 

Not very important but I thought it was nice of him, especially because he is more popular than me so I assumed he didn't even notice me. "
I woke up late and missed my ride which took my girlfriends life,"I posted this in TIFU and it was well received. Lots of kind commenters and not a single bad thing was said. The mods deleted it because it involved a person losing their life and not being able to directly pin the fuck up on me.

I posted this in NoSleep at the suggestion of a lot of readers. It was deleted there as well because it wasn't a ""horror"" story. Funny thing is, I went through sheer horror in real life. I guess that's not fitting enough for NoSleep.

So here I am, reposting this to offmychest at the secondary suggestion of multiple readers. I hope that this is finally the place I need to be with this post. 

I met her in the 8th grade when we became ""boyfriend"" and ""girlfriend"". She moved to my small town from a big city, with her family. She was roller-skating with her twin sister, her younger sister and her dog and I was roller-blading in the same neighborhood with a friend. She watched me blow past her like a show-off, maniac, just before I fell and busted my ass on the pavement for her to see. Her twin laughed at me but she came and helped me up. From that day, till the last day I saw her, we were inseparable. 

It was two weeks before we were set to start senior year in high school. I had established myself in our 3.5 years together, as a part of her family. I had a seat at their dinner table, reserved for me. A seat in their car, reserved for me when they traveled back to their old home town for church. I didn't even attend church in my own town but to be in her presence, I gladly accepted the invitation, every time. Until one day I over-slept. We were supposed to be going to church that Friday and then her grandmothers house.

I woke up around 10 a.m. and I knew they had already left town. I paged her an ""I love you"" message but knew she wouldn't get it until after church. I got up out of bed, hopped into my truck and went to pick up a friend to hang out for the day. As we were driving through town in a west bound lane, I saw a horribly wrecked Mercedes Benz on a tow truck, heading east. I recognized the car and immediately began to panic. I started calling her, calling her mother, calling her grandmother, calling her sister...No answers anywhere. I must have paged her 30 times. 

I rushed to the local hospital and asked them for patients by the name of her family members. After a little looking, they said they didn't have anyone by those names and I felt so relieved. Maybe I was over reacting and it wasn't even their car I saw. My friend and I were walking toward the hospital lobby exit, when the same woman working the registration, called for me. I turned around and she had a phone to her head...I can still see her lips move in my mind, like slow motion, even. It was like I went deaf and I didn't actually hear her say my girlfriends twins name. I just read it on her lips only. That's when I knew shit just got real for me. After this sudden lapse in hearing, I remember regaining it but there was this consistent and audible tone stuck in my ears. It was like the really high pitched beep you hear in the headphones when taking a hearing test. As the sound got lower I caught the end of her sentence ""......stat-flighted to another hospital"".

I had to be driven 26 miles to the hospital that most of her family had been sent to via helicopter. I couldn't drive through all the tears. I guess subconsciously I already knew the outcome. When my father, my friend and myself arrived at the hospital, my dad actually recognized a nurse there. As I frantically searched for an elevator, my dad was asking the nurse if she could help point us in the right direction. My dad caught up with me just as I found an open elevator. He grabbed me by the shoulders, looked me in the eye and told me that I ""need to be prepared for the worst when we get upstairs"". Apparently the nurse knew a little bit about the situation already. I was thinking maybe she was just hurt really bad or in surgery. Death never even directly crossed my mind. I stepped off the elevator right next to a waiting room. Her grandmother and 25 other family members were there crying. She saw me as the door opened and she said it. She said those words. She said ""A***** is dead...they killed our baby"". A lot of events after that are still hazy. I remember crumpling to the floor and not much more. Don't remember ever leaving or how/when I got home. It's all sketchy.

When I missed my ride that morning, she had decided to sit in my seat. That is to say, the back seat, directly behind the driver (who was her recently licensed twin). She actually argued with her younger sister about who was going to get to sit in my spot, according to her mothers words several years after the fact. Within 2 miles of our neighborhood, they were hit directly in the side of the car. Most of the impact was concentrated around the back drivers side door. Right where I would have been sitting. Right where my girlfriend ended up sitting. So now, here I am almost 13 years later, telling this story because I finally felt like it. I had never been late for anything before in my life. It kind of makes you question how things happen in life. I have this overwhelming sense of being here for some sort of greater purpose, that I've yet to fully discover, or understand. 

It's a feeling that only became amplified after a failed suicide attempt in 2003. I loaded a break-barrel 20 gauge shotgun with a shell full of target load. I put the barrel under my chin and pulled the trigger. The first time it didn't go off because I had forgotten the safety was flipped to ""on"". The second time, it just didn't go off. The primer on the shotgun shell had a very distinct dent in the center, from the firing pin making direct contact. Under any normal circumstance the shell would have gone off and I wouldn't be writing this. It just wasn't meant to be though. I was so baffled and frightened by those events at the time. Now I just know it's because I have some purpose here. Whatever it is. 

Now days, I treat everyone I ever meet, with the same kind of respect and care that she showed me the day I fell on my ass in front of her. I learned a lot about life and relationships with people from a 17 year old girl, in the little bit of time she had to teach me. Perhaps her lesson to me on life, is mine to teach. Anyway...I just wanted to share this finally. Maybe it can help someone through a tough time, to know that life really does go on. I used to be bitter about losing her. Angry even. Now...I just embrace her memory and share what I learned from her. I think most peoples fuck ups end under negative circumstances, so here's one with a positive twist that's been 16.5 years in the making (if you count my time with her and the time since I've been without her).

Edit: Wow this really blew up. I read a lot of kind words and replied to some good questions. It's been interesting, to say the least. Thank you all for reading. I knew I might touch a handful of people with this but I never dreamed it would reach so many. Thanks to those who gave my first gold... Not sure what to do with it still.  Can I pay it forward? I think I might have found my favorite sub to share with. 
"
I can't get their screams out of my head.,"My baby cousins, 8 and 10, they've always been my little shadows. They grow their hair like me, try the sports I used to play, listen to the music I suggest. They are the absolute loves of my life. They make me laugh with the things they say, they make the best expressions, they teach me things. We play games, we make dumb jokes, I paint their nails, they braid my hair. I couldn't ever have children because I know they wouldn't be half as perfect as these two. 

Their dad died today. Out of nowhere. Liver failure. They said he had cirrhosis so bad they doctor asked how long he had been an alcoholic. He wasn't. Not even a little. He was fine, and then he wasn't that fine, and then he was yellow, then he was dead, they brought him back, then he was dead again. No warning. No preparation. Gone. 

I took them to dinner, we went to the candy store, with our favorite rule, ""anything smaller than your head."" We pet the cutest puppy in the entire world on our walk back to the car. We kept saying ""boobies"" in the car on the way home and it was making us laugh so fucking hard. Even though I knew as soon as we got home, their world was going to be destroyed. 

I felt like a liar. I felt like I was betraying them by pretending everything was fine and letting them have fun and have milkshakes for dinner and candy and puppies. I knew it wasn't my place to tell them. I wouldn't have the answers to the questions they would pose. 

But we got home. My aunt told them. And their screams. They're seared into my brain. I can't stop hearing them over and over and over and over. I'm just heartbroken. There's nothing I can do and I'm heartbroken. Im sad for my girls. They loved him. And he loved them. And now he's gone. And they're without a dad forever.

I just needed to get it out. My entire family relies on me entirely too much and I don't want to be comforting anyone else other than the two who lost their father. It may sound insensitive, but I don't have it in me for anyone else. 
Thanks 
"
You were a graphic designer. They set your funeral program in Papyrus.,"It's a stupid thing to be mad about. Your family members weren't designers. They didn't know. But like, shit, man, I woulda done it for them. As soon as the pastor handed it to me, I had to struggle not to laugh because I know how cheesed off you would have been. 

How many times had you ranted about Papyrus? You hated it even more than Comic Sans.

But that's how they remembered you, in sprawling faux-fancy script, with a photo you'd hated, looking more like an advertisement for a hair salon than a final token of public recognition. 

It's been months now and I still don't know whether I'm mad about it or if it's funny. It's very *you*, regardless. 

I just started a job at a design firm. My first ""big kid job."" We were gonna start our own company, if you remember all those late-night midterm-stressed conversations we'd had about it. We just wanted to escape any way we could. You did, in a way. That Bright Eyes song has been stuck in my head for months.

*""I'm glad you got away, but I'm still stuck out here...""*

I tucked your memorial card into a special drawer in my desk. 

I promised you long ago I'd carry you with me everywhere, and I'm going to keep that promise."
"I don't really have anyone to share this with, so I'll share it with you","I'm 19 and I'm a pretty lonely guy. I have Asperger's so it's not really that easy for me to make friends. I have 1-2 but I'm not really a priority in their lives, as they both have significant others that they value over me. I don't really blame them for it, people want to be with significant others. But it does make me feel lonely because I don't go out much. I don't really handle loneliness well either.

I said ""fuck it"" and signed up for some online dating. The first person to message me was nice and we talked for a few weeks but I didn't really feel a connection. But I just started talking to someone new and I've never met anyone who is so similar to me. I'm just really excited about it. We both have Asperger's and I've never met anyone else with it so it's really relieving having someone who thinks and sees socializing the same way I do.

I know you guys probably don't care about a lonely 19 year olds dating life, but no one else does, and I'm really excited about this girl. Hopefully she can help some of my loneliness problems.

Happy holidays, everyone."
"As a professional Gay, Black man, I need to get this off my chest.","We recently had the VP visit my work, and my boss said about protesters “why are they protesting? He’s the VP,  deal with it”, and everyone in the room went quiet and looked at me. 

This is the thing. I can’t turn off my blackness. I can’t turn off my sexuality. I can’t turn off me. 

This is what some white people don’t understand in my opinion. Your race can be anything they want. Anything. You can be republican, Democrat, gay, straight, a gamer, an artist. Anything. 

Me. I am judged for having pre understood opinions about situations. About music. About clothing. About food. About everything. 

You see, no matter what I said or did in that moment I was fucked. I couldn’t agree, because I would be seen as a person who doesn’t stand up in what they believe in. The person who is black but not really; the person that exists in the grey area of culturally acceptable yet not fully in the game. 

Or disagree? Then I’m seen as that one black guy who can’t keep his opinions to himself. Who must make it all about race, and playing the race card to get ahead once again. 

Why not just quit? You see, I work in one of the most prestigious places for my profession in the world. I can’t just quit. I can’t go somewhere a little less uncomfortable. And I love what I do, And I’ve done everything “right”. Got a perfect GPA in high school and college. Studied my ass off for years. I’m not quitting shit. 

So what did I do? I Sat quietly while I felt the searing stares of “what is he thinking?” And honestly, deep down I fucking hate pence, his “gay conversion therapy”, and his support of this racist, sexist President we have to deal with on the daily. But I’m professional and I don’t let politics come into work, yet, I feel like if anyone were to bring up their opinion, it would have had to been me. 

So what do I dream of? I dream of a place where no one is judged for anything. I dream of a place where the clearly dominant race in our society can open their eyes a fucking little and see the results of oppression on the black community for hundreds of years. I’m the only black person on my entire floor. And I worked hard as fuck to get where I am, dealing with people thinking I’m not capable my entire life. That’s not ok. I’m not saying hire 50 black people who aren’t capable or deserving, but acknowledge the problem instead of saying we are just “complaining” and “I have it hard too, so deal with it”. 

I guess real change is slow, but god damn I know I’m not crazy for these feelings, and how I know the world can be so much better. We could value everyone’s differences and use it to our advantage. Every culture. Every gender. Every sexuality. We all bring something to the table. Something that builds not destroys. 

Maybe I’m asking for too much, but I don’t think so. I really don’t. 

Edit: Thanks everyone so much for the kind words. It’s great to see grounded, smart discourse from all races in the comments here (and the messages from what I can only assume are from /r/the_donald subscribers are wonderful to read as well). 

Thanks for the allies out there who understand the nuances of privilege and why it truly is a struggle for minorities on a variety of fronts in modern society. To all those who still disagree, I ask you to read some of these comments, many who are personal stories similar to mine, with an open heart full of empathy, and make a sincere attempt to relate with our frustration. 

Thank you all so much.  "
I love listening to her talk...,"My daughter is in university.  She's studying biology and chemistry.  Every now and again, she'll tell me about her classes or show me a paper she's written.

I don't understand one word of what she's saying, but I love listening to her talk.

This morning she was venting a little about something being backwards on a report... it was supposed to go from 3 to 5 or the other way around.  DNA, maybe?  And I was thinking, ""Listen to my little girl!  All grown up and so much smarter than me.""

I really like the person she's become."
Seeing my dad with my daughter is bittersweet,"My father and my daughter share a deep bond. She's 7 and she absolutely idolizes him. When he visits, she follows her gramps everywhere, bombards him with questions, and can't get enough of playing games with him. It's the sweetest thing to watch and he's a great role model for her. 

My dad wasn't around when I was a child. He was devoted to his job and didn't have much time to spare. It was fine when I had my mother, but she died just as I reached my teens. My dad took her loss really hard, and he became even more distant.

We reconciled when I grew up. Now he's in my life and we have a great relationship. It's just the adult child - parent sort of relationship. There's always going to be a degree of separation between us.

But I can see what a great parent he could have been if life had been kinder, and time more available. He's a caring and intelligent man, and he's taught my daughter so much.

I'm not jealous. Just sad. I can see what I could have had right in my face, even though I try not to think about it.

But I'm a grown-ass woman, and at the end of the day, my daughter comes before everything else. I'd definitely give up a thousand happy lifetimes in exchange for a happy childhood for my daughter. 

Now that I've written this out, I can put these feelings behind me.

EDIT: I wrote this when I was in a very strange place emotionally, and it helped me a lot to hear your kind words and read the stories you all shared. The replies (and the gold) are very much appreciated, thank you all!"
I was really fucking good at my job today.,"I work with prisoners, and it’s a bit scary at times. 

Today we had a violent and unpredictable prisoner who kicked off and was very violent and agressive with me and in court. 

I was first guard on duty and managed to get him out of court, get stuck into the fight and calm him down. Stopped him from trying to kill him self, took a few punches and ended up talking to him. 

Basically I just did what I was trained for, and did it well. And I’m really, really proud of myself as I’m still new to the job.

I can’t tell anyone this really close to me as they’re already anxious and scared for me sometimes when I go to work and wouldn’t really ‘get’ that I’m proud of being in the scrap, and how I handled it. And myself.

But I am. 

Thanks for listening. "
I lost my virginity.,"Doing this, with someone I love and trust, was the best choice ever. I can’t tell ANYONE, literally. If my parents find out or if anyone does I would be either dead or shunned and kicked out of my house for not saving it until marriage. 

It felt amazing. I was comfortable, ready and was thinking about it for a whole week. I was so shy and quiet at first but when I got comfortable I was completely different. 

It went so smoothly than I thought it would’ve. He was gentle and sweet. He would stop and ask if I’m still fine with it and I’d always say yes. It was his first time too, so we were both confused but in the end satisfied!

Dw, protection is my #1 priority! I don’t wanna be buried alive by my dad because I chose to be reckless and have unsafe sex!"
We moved across the country and you cheated,"It took me a while to agree to move with you. You wanted to move to the mountains and spend the winter living in a small city skiing and having a good time. I was worried that we might not make it another six months. You cheated on me once before. It was just a kiss. We were going through a rocky patch. I believed you when you promised me it would be ""just us"" from then on.

&#x200B;

So, I agreed. I thought it could actually be good for us to get out of the city. Get away from all the noise and the stress of careers and memories of where our worst moments had been. We could be healthier and active. We wouldn't be around our friend group that are almost all alcoholics.

&#x200B;

We got here just under two weeks ago. It's beautiful and calm, and everyone is so friendly. Oh yeah, even your one friend who I know you have history with. But he was nice, and he introduced me to his friends. I figured the past was the past.

&#x200B;

I know I shouldn't have logged into your facebook account, but it seemed weird that you wanted to get lunch with him to catch up the night after we all went out drinking together. Didn't you spend most of the night chatting with him? But you went, and then you messaged me to say you were going to hang out at his place. Sure, I trusted you. Just before we arrived you had promised me that it was ""just us"" and I nothing to worry about. You came home, and you were acting strange so yeah I did a bad thing and read your messages. Lo and behold, as I sat there, you were having a conversation saying how much it had turned you on to kiss him. How you wanted to have ""hot, dirty, nasty"" sex with even though you really shouldn't. It took you less than a week to cheat on me.

&#x200B;

Maybe I should have left you at that point. But, having uprooted my whole life to move, and having spent all of my money to come out with you, what could I really do? I confronted you. You tried to deny it until I pointed at the words on my screen that you had just typed. You said you fucked up. We had what I think was one of the most honest conversations we've ever had. We talked about strategies to move forward and it actually seemed like we might come out of it stronger than before.

&#x200B;

Then, tonight. I saw a snap from him on your screen. I asked you about it and you lied to me saying it was from someone else. There went all the little bit of trust I had regained in you. So when we went to bed, I sat there wide awake, not able to sleep, until eventually I got up, went on you computer, and read your messages again. Now I know its an invasion of privacy, but I really don't feel bad. There it was. You were messaging him while we ate the meal we had cooked together. While we were sitting on the same couch watching TV. You had fucked. You were making plans to do it again. Not a week ago you were begging me not to leave you. Saying I was the best thing that ever happened to you. You just couldn't seem to remember that when you went to his place and let him stick his dick in you.

&#x200B;

You wasted almost 2 years of my life and now I'm stuck in this town with no home, no car, and no money to get out of here. Fuck you. You're the worst thing that ever happened to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT: Well I literally posted this just to voice the thoughts in my head, to get it off my chest. I never expected this kind of response. It's really so moving that so many of you took the time to read and comment.  For those who've offered help, I appreciate it, and although it may be silly, my pride insists that if I let myself get into this mess. I ignored all the warning signs. I can get myself out of this. (and as many of you mentioned, be better of for it)

As for what I'm going to do: There's one person in town who I know back from my university days, and I'll be talking to him tonight about crashing on his couch for a week or so. After that I'll try and find a room in a shared house, which shouldn't be too hard this time of year. I've been cooking at a local restaurant since Monday, and that should keep me afloat for now. As it happens, I have another friend driving across the country in a month or so and hopefully I can hitch a ride with him to the coast where I have family and friends who can help find accommodation and work. That's it basically.

Thanks again"
You don't get to decide,"Mary,

Your post showed up on my Facebook feed. I think you are the cousin or something of one of my friends. You are 21, already married, and attend a private Christian college.

Your post, directed at the women who marched on Saturday (because you think abortion rights is the only thing we marched for), said that you don’t get to decide whether to have a baby when you become pregnant.

Actually I do – the highest judicial court of this nation says I do. You see Mary, it’s actually YOU that doesn’t get to decide.

You do not get to decide for the couple that just found out their fetus at 20 weeks isn’t growing most of its heart and won’t survive a few minutes past birth.

You do not get to decide for the college student whose birth control failed, and desperately wants to finish school and start a career before having children.

You do not get to decide for the 14 year old that was raped by her stepfather.

You do not get to decide for the mother of four whose husband just left her.

And you don’t get to decide for me, Mary. I’m a thirty something married woman who absolutely positively doesn’t want children. My husband has had a vasectomy. But very rarely, the tubes grow back together and a swimmer still gets through.

If you don’t think abortion is right, then don’t get one when you yourself become pregnant when you didn’t want to. But you do NOT get to decide that for every other woman.

I know you think that all women who get abortions are irresponsible, sleep around, and don’t take birth control. I know this is what your church has taught you, but it couldn’t be further from the truth. I guarantee you that you know at least ten women who have had an abortion – women at your church, women at your school, women at the Christian bookstore you work at. Because 1 in 3 women have had one. It is an agonizing decision Mary, one of the hardest they have ever had to make. No one skips happily into the abortion clinic.

I’m sorry your church has taught you that your only purpose is to make babies, and that your wants and dreams in this life are inferior to that. I hope one day you will realize that you DO get to decide what you do with your own life."
I'm a married man who fell in love with another woman,"I love my wife, we have a good marriage. I love my family, they're the light of my life. I have no desire to divorce and break up my family

I met the other woman at work. She's pretty and friendly. I always found her attractive but I figured it was just skin deep. As we worked together, more, we clicked. We got along well and I always enjoyed talking with her. I found myself being sad when she wasn't at work. I let it go, it's just a school boy crush; it will pass. Even if I had wanted to act on it, I doubted she had anything but platonic feelings.

I got a new job. I'm sad to leave, not just for her, but my other co-workers, as well. I liked my job but the new one is a better fit for my family. 

Today was my last day. As I bade her farewell, she told me how sad she was to see me go. Our eyes met, she placed her hand on mine, and we shared a long, meaningful look. A look of longing and pain. She feels it too. I said ""goodbye"" and left.

I'm sitting in my car, in front of my house, awash with emotions. I can't talk to my wife about it, I love her so much and I know it would hurt her. 




It just hurts so fucking much......"
Life is very okay,"I can breathe, walk, create, I have two loving cats and a small home.

It is only 33 square merers, the windows are a bit leaky, but at least I earned it. I have no such luxuries as a dryer, proper shower or dishwasher, my neighbors sometimes suck, but I have a home. 

I am 25, managed to graduate high school and university without debts, I still don't own a car but it doesn't really matter at the moment.

I am not working my dream job full time now, but I am getting there.

My parents are still around and that's nice.

So basically life is pretty good."
"So, you wanna hear the debaucherous tale of what irresponsible act gave me oral herpes? Sure, I'll fucking share.","I have oral herpes. The same typical cold sore virus that damn near everyone will get in their life; I just have more violent outbreaks. 

Every time a number of sores appear I will get comments about ""the herp"" and using protection and snide comments. When I travel through the Bible Belt, where my daughter lives, I get the judgemental looks. A girlfriends mother once asked me directly what I did to get it.

You want to hear the story of who's dick I sucked? Or that I went down on the wrong girl? That I was drugged up and horny and fucked anyone I saw?

I know what it is, you want me to tell you of the time I let lust get the better of me and had sex out of marriage? 

I'll tell you how I got oral herpes.

I shared a Pepsi with my mom when I was 5. "
"To my wife - No, you do not have my permission!","35% - 6% chance of not making it out of the operating theater. Those words spoken by a surgeon that we both know is the best. You seem to take it into your stride, its been a long 2 years since you first developed heart issues,we knew they might come, you were born with some, and the fix was in, but we knew it wasnt forever. 

12 months ago, you had the first round of heart surgery, they replaced a valve, they repaired a valve, you shouldve been better in 3 months. Full recovery... Only you didnt. They wouldnt take your pain seriously enough, it was just slow recovery, it was trending towards better, give it more time.

So we waited, you never had energy, you couldnt make it to work all the time, your job was at risk. Then back to hospital... Hemoglobin at 55... ""How are you even walking?"" well.... you were, but barely. scans, probes, bags of blood, potassium and iron... Nothing showed up, it will get better, we will just keep an eye on it. You lost your job. Probably a good thing, fortunately with a bit of shuffling, we can manage. I do not begrudge you. I just want you well.... Money we can figure out later.

6 months pass. Then 1 night we get a call, latest ecg results suggest you will need that repaired valve re-repaired. We begin to stress, but its manageable, we call the surgeon, he is reassuring, so we start to relax a bit. Except the next morning our regular doctor calls. ""Swing by here, pick up a note, and get yourself to the ER, your hemoglobin has dropped below 70"" so off we go. Full of edema and mysteriously bleeding internally, youve spent the last 4 weeks in hospital. The bleeding, maybe finally, stopped, theyve taken you off the warfarin... because they cannot find the source, microbleeds, maybe. The edema, likely unrelated, maybe the tricuspid. Which is what we thought was wrong to begin with.

A right side cathether test shows that its probably not the tricuspid valve, its more likely constrictive pericardeitis. Hooray, a diagnosis that actually fits! That bag around the heart has hardened and is causing problems. They want to do one more scan - sure, measure twice, cut once... We agree The MRI... its inconclusive. You need surgery, they just cannot be certain until they open you up, pericardiectomy, or valve replacement. So they plan to do both...

Only this will be the 5th time or is it the 6th time since you were born that they are going to open you up. Each time increases the risk. Th surgeon tells us, in his soothing tone, 5 or 6% that things will go very badly. 1 in 20. I would buy a raffle ticket with a 1/20 chance of winning. I wouldnt cross the road with a 1/20 chance of being hit by a car though. Your 24 months of illness, the current state of your edema, all add to the risk. Theres a list of other possible dangers, but all I can take in is 5%.

You remain positive, I am terrified.

When we first started dating, 10 years ago, you used to ask me permission to do things, was it ok if you went out with so and so? Did i mind if you didnt come to this thing with me? Could you go somewhere? I was wryly amused. I never sought to control you, we have our friends, you have your friends, I have mine. The trust is there, and your life is your own. You have never needed my permission. It was not mine to give. All I wanted was to share what you would share, and have loved and felt loved.

Until now. Now, you need to ask. This one time!

I do not give you permission to go. You will not leave me! 5% is a number, its terrifying me. You cannot go! You must stay. This one time, I am asserting my right as your partner, your lover, your friend, your husband. You cannot go. Not now. Not soon. You will beat this shit and come right back home! 

Please!

Please.

please.

I need you.

**Edit 1**: 12 hrs of surgery and she is now in ICU surgeon is happy with the results. Battery nearly empty, will post better update later when I get home and after I've seen her in the ICU (reckon 30more minutes before I can go in.) Thanks so much for your well wishes, all of you.

**Edit 2:** Home now in front of a computer, not a screen. When i wrote this post, it genuinely was an outlet - somewhere on the internet i just needed to get feelings out. I never even considered the possibility that so many of you out there would reach out with your thoughts, well wishes and prayers. Know that every single message helped sustain me through what was an incredibly long day. 
I started at the hospital at 5:20am this morning, to sit with my wife and be with her when they took her down to surgery. At around 6:40 they took her down to the holding area and i stayed with her until about 6:55am when the anesthetist took her into theater. Aside from about 2 hours early in the morning, I spent the rest of the day in the waiting room, what was expected to be around a 7 hour surgery. It took a fair bit longer, but most importantly, the surgeon is happy. He said it was longer and slower than he wanted it to go, but it was necessary. There was definitely significant constrictive pericarditis, particularly around the right ventricle, and he has removed the entire pericardium. Additionally, the tricuspid valve has also been replaced and he is happy with how that went too. Took over an hour to get access to the ICU to actually see her. I'm not going to say that she looks fantastic, but noone does with tubes and monitors and all that jazz sticking out of her. Damn onions in the ICU.... I will be back in there tomorrow morning, though they may not wake her up until fairly late tomorrow. Recovery is not expected to be incredibly quick, but full recovery is definitely expected.

(Stealth edit:) A few people have asked for contact details as they would like to send some gift or card or something. While the sentiment is very much appreciated, we are very fortunate in life and have few needs that we cannot take care of. My wife though, has requested that any who can donate blood, please do so, it saves lives (my wifes included), and those who's beliefs do not preclude it, please consider becoming an organ donor.

Once again, thank you so much for your messages of support. I may post a further update in the coming day or 2.

**Edit 3:** Day 1 after surgery. Wife is awake, though fading in and out of awareness. She is still hooked up to a breathing tube. During surgery she suffered a very minor collapse in the upper right side of her lung. They attempted to clear it this morning, but were unsuccessful. As I was leaving the hospital this evening, they had the respiratory specialists attending to perform a minor procedure to clear it. They were incredibly confident of success, and the doctors and surgeon say that she wont notice any issues from it, and its not uncommon for anyone who is hooked up to a bypass machine for a length of time. 
We were able to communicate today, a bit, and it really made me happy. Told her she was doing really well, that I love her, and asked her to squeeze my hand to tell me she loved me. She did, I may have shed a tear or two. The nurses in ICU are awesome and deserve so much thanks and respect. 
At this stage she is expected to be in the ICU for another two to three days, before being transferred to the HDU. I will try to post another update in another couple of days. I told her that it wasnt just her known internet friends that were sending love, but a whole heap of internet strangers. It is hard to give a smile when you are intubated, but she tried.

**Edit 4:** Day 3 after surgery. Progress is slow and frustrating, but it is still progress. She is still not quite breathing properly by herself, so is still intubated. When not floating on the sea of painkiller, she is alert and aware, and really wants the tube out. Each day when they test her for being able to breath by herself, she shows significant improvement, so hoping tomorrow is the day it comes out, and then they can start thinking about shifting her out of ICU and into HDU. All the doctors, surgeons etc agree that recovery is within expectations and they are very happy with her heart function. Will do another progress edit in the next few days, in case there is still interest.

**Edit 5**
Day 5 post surgery.

The Good:
- heart is for the most part maintaining sinus rhythm at a good rate, without pacing assistance. This is very good.
- She managed to stand up today and get moved to a chair, where she sat up. While she needed some balance assistance, she did the hard work herself.
- She was able to drink a fair amount of juice and water today and eat a couple of lollies from a bag of party mix
- Got a couple of smiles


The Bad:
- When she is getting tired, she is struggling to get enough oxygen into her blood, and she is fairly intolerant of the various nasal or face masks they are trying to keep on her. 
- There is a concern that maybe the cleared collapsed section of lung has recollapsed, x-rays will be done first thing in the morning
- If she doesnt start keeping her O2 levels up, by herself or with the high flow, they are considering re-intubating her. 

More in a couple of days.

**Edit 6**
Day 7 post surgery, still in ICU (I am posting this from the cafe downstairs on a break)
The awesome - heart is recovering very well. She has a normal blood pressure, good sinus rhythm, and theyve disconnected the pacer. From a heart perspective, the surgeon is very happy with her progress

The good - Yesterday she spent most of the day sitting in a chair. They are pretty confident they will not need to reintubate. Her O2 sats are remaing in the high 90s up to 100.

The bad - Seems that the breathing tube has given her a lung infection, she has a spot of pneumonia, and while theyve substantially reduced the fluids in and around her lungs, heyve been replaced a little bit with mucus and sputum. Waiting for lab results to determine best course of antibiotics to sort it out,.

The really bad (for me at least) - due to the long time in ICU, and the infection, and surgery and who knows what else, shes developed a little bit of delirium. She is asking where she is, wanting to go home, accusing me of lying, forgetting why she is there, or at some points, just unresponsive. The doctors are working to reassure me that this is not too far out of the norm and as she recovers a bit more it will subside (could be a day to multiple weeks). Quite honestly, this is the hardest thing ive had to cope with, other than the fear i had presurgery. It breaks me when she asks to go home, or where she is. Ive had to hold back the tears while in front of her. Additionally, when I am not there, she is getting agitated. 

So far I have taken 7 working days off. Just let my boss know it will be a few more. I have the leave built up, so it shouldnt be a problem, thankfully, but theres a few key things I am actually the only person that can deal with. So sneaking an hour here or there using the hospital wifi.

Thanks for listening, another update in the next few days.

**Edit 7**
Today is day 10 in ICU. I am about to head out to the hospital, the last few days have been very very hard. Delirium set in deeply along with paranoia.  For 2 days she was convinced everyone in ICU was trying to kill her. That I was never coming back, and that she was going to die there.

All I can say is that i am incredibly thankful the fact that she seems to have turned the corner on that one, and that mind that I love is nearly completely back. So now, body, mind and soul are starting to come back together, I am hopeful she gets out of ICU today, and into the regular ward. 

I am not sure how many of you are following this, but I want you to know that your kind words and thoughts have helped me. 

I am hoping to only post one or 2 more updates in the coming days, where I can tell you how she is out of ICU and kicking goals.

**Edit 8**
Short edit - still in ICU. STill trying to shake that darned last bit of fluid from the chest, and concerns over CO2 levels. O2 levels are fine, heart function is fine, respiratory system still not where they want it to be. This is getting very frustrating, but at least she is herself. Drainage tubes removed yesterday, so she has a bit more mobility, though still cant step too far from the bed until a few more lines come out. But she CAN step out of the bed with just the tiniest bit of balance assistance. Really hoping she gets out of ICU within next 24 hrs, while she is my absolute top priority, 12 working days out of the office is starting to bite back. Original estimate was 4-6 days in ICU, then a week back at the office and then work from home when she got released for a few days to make sure she was settled. Boss is being very reasonable about my time, but some things need physical presence. Its causing me a bit of anxiety, though its a much better anxiety to have than some of the ones ive had over the past 2 weeks.

**Edit 9**
Out of ICU! The concern was respiratory acidosis and after a few days of high but stable CO2 levels, theyve decided she is safe to release to the ward. Took about 3 hours to fully detach all the tubing lines and other things, and then 45 minutes to recannulate... even with the benefits of an ultrasound, but finally she is in a room by herself. The whole thing incredibly exhausting. I mustve been significantly holding in all the nerves because after she settled into the ward, i felt like id been hit by a truck in terms of exhaustion. Seems the same for her, because she is sleeping, and it looks like the first real proper sleep she has had in a couple of weeks. Now for some energy recovery

**Edit 10**
Day 14 after surgery, 2 days out of ICU. She looks incredibly frail. The level of diuretics shes on and fluid restriction has made her look gaunt. She is still incredibly weak. So weak, she wont even pick up her idevices. The doctors are trying to get that fine line between getting fluid out of her chest, and letting her body have any hydration. It's times like these in life, where you really wish you could just spin through a montage. Progress is moving forward, but very very slowly. Today, with a nurses assistance, she had a shower for the first time since the morning of surgery. It was good to see some more smiles.

**Edit 11**
This will probably be the second last edit. We are now 19 days after surgery, and she is fully wireless. No monitors, no tubes, no canula. They are still trying to balance out the diuretics, and get her to put some weight on. She is able to dress herself, move about freely and has managed a double lap non-stop around the ward area. All which sound small, but massive improvements, even over the past few days. She is absolutely tiny at the moment, weighing around 38kg which at 5'5 is really not very much. The hospital has given her access to the secret menu, allowing her to pick extra desserts and more foods she might like. In all likelihood, she will finally be coming home late this week. Once she is home, will post a final update. Once again, many thanks for all your kind wishes and thoughts. They have helped me get through this.

**Final Edit**
This will be my last update in here. 
Wife came home last Wednesday. It is incredibly good to have her home. She remains quite weak, and very significantly underweight. I have instructions to make sure she eats and to ensure she does small amounts of walking, slowly building up to moderate amounts.
The going is slow, but the pain is less and less every day, the dogs are happy to have her home, and I am ecstatic to be able to sleep next to her again. The docs warned that its going to be a slow recovery, but we are OK with that. Slowly but surely, she is building up, and it will take as long as it takes.
Once again, I thank you all for your kind words and support. Genuinely, they have been well received and bought some solace and relief to me, in what has been an incredibly stressful time.
"
My Brother used the dick stick,"So my brother picked up the chapstick I have in my room and used it. that was for my dick. I used it on my dick. Basically got dry skin on my dick, it hurt so I set aside special chapstick to heal my dick. He used it, my dickstick. I don't know how to tell him. 
EDIT: I told him guys. He beat me up in response."
"I had problems at home growing up which affected my performance in school. Teachers in high school never thought much of me, and one even explicitly said I wouldn’t amount to anything. I ended up getting rejected to all universities I applied to but one. Fast forward 4 years after high school and...","I earned a bachelor’s degree and visited my high school to visit those teachers. When they asked me what I’m up to now, I just casually bring up I excelled after graduating from high school and learning in an environment of support and being taught by educators that believed in me. Oh yeah, and it felt so good to sarcastically thank them for helping me get into ***medical school***. 

When I finally met that “teacher” that said I wouldn’t amount to anything, I handed him my medical school acceptance letter along with the page in my diary dated the day he said those things. I looked him dead in the eye and told him, “Mr. xxxxxxxxxx, don’t ever tell another student what you told me because all it takes is for one school to accept you and for one teacher to believe in you. Luckily after graduating from here, I was lucky enough to have more than one person believing in me.” 

The dumbfounded and embarrassed expression on his face reminded me of how I felt when he demeaned me. It was so gratifying telling him to keep those copies of papers as a reminder. Visiting my old high school inspired me to look at my yearbooks the moment I arrived at my parents home. All these years, I forgot what I wrote as my grad quote until today:

“I believe in myself. The best years of my life are yet to come.” 

I began crying. Tears of joy that I’ve turned things around, tears of relief that my parents have restored their relationship over the years, tears of satisfaction in not living down to my high school teacher’s expectations, and tears of frustration and anger towards the turbulence in my life prior to starting university. I’m just so thankful right now."
I lost basically my entire family in the hot air balloon accident and had to read hundreds of comments joking about it.,Seriously fuck Reddit. The story is on the front page and not a single comment considers that these are actual loved people.
To the angry woman at the park who called me a pedophile:,"*Brief context- I'm a mid-20's male. I'm a private tutor for all ages. I'm Asian. I've had to deal with this type of situation before, but not this suddenly or violently. I've always wanted to say a lot of this to those people, but I'm not super confrontational so I thought this was a good place to get my feelings out!*

---

I'm still trying to figure out what your goal was. I was hurt, and I was angry at what you did. I still am. But more importantly, I want address what caused you to do it in the first place.

I've been in the same spot with the same student every week since the year started. We read together; that's my job. I sit opposite her at a table next to the playground where, as you should have noticed, many others often play.

These were your first words to me as far as I could remember: ""Hey sicko, I just want you to know that I'm calling the police so they can arrest your child predator ass.""

I've honestly never quite felt speechless until today. That is, by far, the most shocking thing anyone has ever said to me. So I'm sorry for not taking you seriously, I laughed because I was completely shocked at the situation. So I wasn't being sassy when I asked if I knew you. I thought this was just a bad joke.

I couldn't really catch everything you said after that. It was explosive word-diarrhea, to be honest. In both how you slurred every word together into some sloppy set of hyper-portmanteaus and how each sentence became more profane than any 9-year-old girl should ever have to hear.

But I did catch a few things. I caught how there's no way a grown man would willingly spend time with a little girl. I caught how you called me a ""dirty Mexican"" at first and then switched midway to ""ISIS terrorist"", which is not only super racist but -inaccurately- racist. I caught how pretty girls would never willingly be around a lonely single guy as fucking ugly as me. I caught how ""damn sick no-life punkbitchass sick pedo predator loser sick"" is apparently a valid string of words. I also caught how you wanted me to rot in jail forever. It seems my student caught quite a bit of that too, which is the most unfortunate part. But I'll get back to that.

I want to thank you for graciously allowing me to send her off to the playground before we continued this sliiiightly one-sided conversation. Maybe you were too caught up in calling me ugly to care, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you agree that children shouldn't listen to how adults speak. You did seem pretty angry when I interrupted your monologue to tell her to take a quick break from our lesson though. I just wish I had told her sooner.

Anyway, there's so much I would have liked to say to you, but that was not the place and I imagine/hope I won't be seeing you any time soon. So here it is now, even though you can't see it. I suppose I'm just taking my turn to talk at you.

First, let me get the rudest part out of the way: I've never wanted to actually hit someone until today. Congratulations on being my first in that regard. Of course, I would never try to hurt anyone, but this is the first time I can remember -wanting- to.

With that out of the way, let me address what you said, at least what I was able to decipher and remember.

1. No grown man would willingly spend time with a child. Actually, grown men spend time with children all the time. They're called dads. Most people have one. Generally speaking, most of them actually like spending time with children too. Anyway, as I'm not a dad yet, I guess I can't really use that as a proper defense. I guess all I have to say is that you're just wrong. There are plenty of men that like to spend time with children. Male teachers are a thing, for example. Personally, I like the way kids think and how you can see the gears turn in their head when they face a new challenge. Have you seen a kid figure out how multiplication works for the first time? Have you heard their excitement when they learn how and why the sun burns so brightly? It's a truly beautiful thing. It's why I enjoy my job.

2. Which brings me to me wondering how you jumped, of all things, to predator instead of tutor, or relative, or nanny or any one of the things that are a million times more likely. Hell, statistically speaking, it's way more likely I was just a friendly stranger passing by than a random predator. Like, what did you think my goal was exactly? Did you think her parents just abandoned her there? Was I a kidnapper getting ready to spirit her away with about 9 other witnesses around? Not only did you assume I was a predator, but a particularly stupid one. I'd ask if you stopped to think about what you were doing at all, but that was made very clear.

2. Calling me a dirty Mexican and ISIS terrorist. So it's already bad to be a racist these days, but it gets even weirder that you were randomly and incorrectly racist. You made it pretty clear that me being Mexican/Middle Eastern was a problem, but I don't quite understand what that has to do with anything (on top of me not being these things!). Do you think that white pedophiles might be a little better than non-white ones? This part makes the least sense to me. It's funny that this is the *least* offensive part of what you said/did.

3. I'm single and ugly. Eh, that's fair.

4. ""Damn sick no-life punkbitchass sick pedo predator loser sick."" Ignoring the fact that I have no idea what you're trying to say. I'm genuinely appalled that you thought it was appropriate to say a good 60% of the words you used in front of the girl you were so valiantly trying to protect.

5. If you see something you believe is a crime. Do you think it's necessary to inform the alleged criminal that you're reporting them? Like do you tell bank robbers that you're calling the police right now? Even worse, why tell the alleged-criminal *before* you actually even make the call? It's loopy. You're loopy.I wish you would have called the police instead of talking to me. It would have saved us both a lot of trouble.

6. I do agree with you that child predators are the worst of the worst and should be locked up. But I disagree with your assessment, your approach, and pretty much everything else about you.

7. Beatriz, bless her soul, did not deserve the middle finger you gave her. All she did was tell you who I am and what I was there for. You are a disgusting person for telling her to, these are your words, ""fuck off, dont defend this pedophile"" when she made it clear that you were in the wrong. You ran off in a hurry after that though, but, as befitting your character, not before calling us both dirty Mexicans.

* Thank you, Beatriz. You are the saving grace to this experience. Thank you for jumping in when I was still flustered at the situation. Thank you for offering to stay to talk to the police in case the crazy woman really did call them. Thank you for giving me a hug to calm me down. Thank you for reassuring my student that things are okay. I only wish I met you under better circumstances.

This is the result of your actions:

- A scared and confused girl had to ask what a pedophile was, and her parents and I had to tell her that there are people out there that want to hurt children. She couldn't even grasp the concept, wondering why anyone would want to hurt kids. But you introduced that to her, congratulations.

- My student doesn't want to go to the park anymore, which has been an amazing learning environment for her. You've taken that away, although I'm confident we can rebuild it soon enough.

- Two parents are now concerned about their neighborhood. Although I assured them I've never seen you before, we can't rule out you aren't from around there.

- In spite of your efforts, my student just likes me more now. So good job on that. She said she could tell I was protecting her from the monster woman--that's you.

- My student has lost an hour of reading time as she was too concerned about what happened to continue. She's just finally starting to see how wonderful books can be, and you had to retard the process with your foolishness.

- You made a grown man cry. I'm not afraid to admit to crying, but I'm ashamed it was because of such an awful person. It's not about the way you insulted me. That was nothing. 12-year-olds on reddit have said worse. What hurt most was the unnecessary fear you put into my student. Your complete lack of awareness, tact, and common decency unnecessarily made the world a little bit worse. The underlying stigma against men working with children is something I've worked so hard to eliminate, and you've thrown my efforts into my face. That said, I know I'm right. I know that nothing you said has any weight behind it. I hope you feel shame for what you did today. Not because I want retribution, although that's honestly a part of it, but because I hope you realize your own foolishness and become a better person. Because if you didn't feel shame, and really are as bad as you seem, then I would be driven to hate you. Because I want you to see me for who I am. A man who, criminally ugly as he may be, has worked tooth and nail for the education and well-being of our future generation. And I want you to see that that should be expected from any person, man or woman.

If someone in your life hurt you in this way as a child. I'm truly sorry you had to experience that. I can't begin to understand how painful it is to be exploited before you can even really comprehend what exploitation means. If you're coming from a place like that, then I apologize for my anger, but not my reaction. We both, at the least, agree that all children should be protected.

If you were just trying to rile me up, then you succeeded spectacularly. If any of what you said was sincere, then I have to say that you are truly an awful person. It's going to take a long time for me to forgive you. I'll thank you, though, for the ugly reminder. I'll work my hardest to prove just how wrong you are about everything you said.

This felt good to type out. I'm done."
Holy goddamn shit,"(Throwaway account)

I probably shouldn't be angry, but I am.
Last month I had an elective, corrective surgery that also has cosmetic benefits in California. I just received my statement from the hospital in the mail.

$141,526.44

And I don't have to pay any of it.  My insurance is paying all of it. My insurance that I pay *nothing* for.

There were a few services that were not covered that I did pay, and it did amount to thousands of dollars, but I'm talking like, $4,000, and not all at once.

But there are people who pay hundreds of dollars a month for their insurance but can't afford their inhalers, their insulin, childbirth, a fucking ambulance ride.

What the actual goddamn fuck is wrong with this country?

I am so sorry. I'm very thankful that I don't have to pay that money, but I'm *livid* that it even costs that much. This is a broken system. This is not fair at all. 

I don't really understand politics, but I'm gonna learn. I'm gonna learn who to vote for so I can do my part to change this system.

Thanks for reading."
"I just found a new home for my dog, and I'm heartbroken.","I had to do it.

He was a beautiful border collie with an amazing personality. He was so damn loyal. I had him for 5 years. I adopted him from the animal shelter on Valentine's day.

He was an amazing companion and would have followed me into hell...

But life happened.

I had to move into a small apartment. I had to get a different job. I'm still a full time student. All of a sudden I had no time to spend with him. He looked so sad all of the time.

Not to mention my neighbor honestly has a serious phobia of dogs - to the point that she would start panicking every time she saw him, which would scare the shit out of him.

He hated being on a leash, but I had to keep him leashed all of the time because of the neighbor. I even recieved an official warning from the landlady.

It was getting to a point where he was hardly ever outside, and I was always too exhausted to play with him...

Finding a new home for him was the right choice. Now he's living on 4 acres by the river. His new owner has children who will play with him. They've even said I can come visit.

But it still hurts. He was my best friend. My house feels so empty without him.


Edit: Thank you so much for all of your support and for the gold. You guys are amazing.

Also, I got a phone call from the man who adopted my Yoshi, but when I answered the phone I was greeted by a tiny little child's voice saying, ""thank you for giving us your dog."" It instantly brought me to tears. The man who adopted Yoshi has assured me that he's adjusting and seems happy. This has been a difficult situation, but it feels good knowing I made my dogs life better and that my dog is making another family's life better. It's going to be okay, guys."
Sick of the pressure,"I'm in my early 20s. I have always been straight As student with proper manners, hard-working and ambitious. 

Now I'm finishing medical school. I am involved with various research projects, I travel all around the world for conferences, am an active advocate for student rights, I volunteer in my community and work night shifts in a shitty job to be able to afford a semi-comfortable life. I network, suck up to people I don't respect and apply for a hundred internships and training oportunities. 

It draines the life out of me. I'm so sick of trying to become someone successful. Honestly, my idea of a good day is eating chips and watching Netflix. Instead, I get to keep up this charade of  ambition and never-ending list of responsibilities.

I enjoy school, I want to be a good doctor and help people. When has it become a competition of who can be a better machine, sleep less and work themself to death? 

Fuck this rat race. Fuck this society. Fuck you all, you successful, important, rich pieces of garbage. 

&#x200B;"
I quit my job and was told it was a massive mistake,"I worked an awful job, under awful management and dealt with so much shit I didn' t even think there was a shovel in existence big enough to get out from under it. I went back and forth about resigning without having anything else lined up. 


But guess what? 


I put in my resignation after doubting myself for days, and ended up getting an interview with a new company the next day. AND I GOT THE JOB REDDIT! It pays better, has much more benefits and I'll be running my own department. 


My old manager told me I'd never get anywhere if I left her company and made my life hell for resigning. Turns out I was unemployed for one night lol. 


Fuck the old company and their messed up, overtime and underpay policies. Here's to new beginnings!



**Edit** Wow, this got a bit more attention than I expected. Thanks for all the congratulations everyone! My best advice to people going through the same thing is that sometimes walking the less-taken path makes for a better reward at the end.  

**Double Edit** Mandatory thank you for the gold kind stranger!"
I hate that I used to be racist.,"Had to make a throwaway, because I really didn't want this tied to my main account. I'm ashamed of how my mindset was.

I'm a white male. Growing up, I never got the chance to talk to a black person until I moved schools in 8th grade. My dad was pretty racist and raised me with a mindset that hated anything that wasn't right. I was 4 years old and my dad straight up encouraged me using the N word and other racial slurs. I went to a predominantly white school in a racist town. Our entire school had 6 people who weren't white and they were several grades above me so I didn't talk to them. 8th grade comes and I get moved to a school that's roughly 40% black. It was a giant culture shock. I was taught to hate them all my life and now I was surrounded by people who weren't white. I didn't make any effort to make black friends, and straight up refused to speak to them. On the school bus they were really rowdy. All kids at that age were though. But in my old mindset I only saw them as rowdy and chalked it up to skin color. I would frequently refer to them as ""apes"" and ""monkeys"" and it disgusts me how I was. 9th grade comes and I actually became acquainted with a black person. He was into rock and the same games as me. I was still a little off put by his race, but it made me think, ""he's not being mean to me or attacking me."" It went against everything that I was ever taught. We became pretty damn good friends. I was still cautious meeting more black people, but it was getting easier every day. By my sophomore year I had tons of friends who weren't white. We all laughed and joke and that's when it hit me that I didn't care about their race. They were just like me. I recently graduated, and it disgusts me how I was. Every time I make a new black friend, I feel a part of self hate in myself for having such an ignorant mindset. I say it a lot, but I feel disgusted. I wish I could go back and never have had a racist thought. I look back and think of all the missed opportunities to make friends, I think of all the people I was mean to because of the color of their skin, and all I feel is regret. I was and am a disgusting person. I'm happy I'm taking steps in the right direction though.

I'm sorry, I just had to tell somebody. "
I was diagnosed with vaginal squamous cell carcinoma caused by HPV and had my vagina removed.,"In 2013 I found a small bump on my vagina. I went to women's health and they tested me for STI's which came back negative so they said the bump was from shaving. An ingrown hair follicle. 
I stopped shaving and the bump stayed. The nurse assured me that sometimes they stay for years. In the meantime I develop IBS, heartburn, Gurd with stricture, and nausea. In 2015 my Labia swelled up and I returned yet again to women's health and they said now because I do not shave that the follicle is irritated due to rubbing. Seemed legit, especially since I now was having joint pain and kidney stones as well as my other symptoms.
In November of 2017 I developed a skin rash that required a dermatologist. I had to disrobe and when I did she saw my Labia, the same one that Women's health, my PCP, and the ER had seen, and said I squamous cell carcinoma. 
She preformed a biopsy that confirmed those results. On March 2nd, they removed my entire vagina. Both lips, my clitoris, part of my taint and butt cheek. I am having a hard time healing, which I need to do in order to have the cancer treatments. 

Why the hell are we talking about cervical cancer still? I am pretty sure when people think of cancer from HPV they think cervical. No one thinks they could lose their clit or have part of their face removed from oral sex. When is the last time you heard someone say I can not wait to go play with my cervix tonight! 
I am not the first one, obviously because there was not a team of doctors all observing. So why are we not talking about it?
SHAME?!?
There are over 150 strains of HPV and upwards of 80% of the population has it. It is not just an STI. It is a health risk. It is the common cold of cancers. We have to stop NOT talking. Speak up, ask questions even if they are awkward because it is even more awkward to not have a vagina. 
Self Checks. Report changes to your doctor. If they do not listen, be your own advocate.

I got married 3 days ago and today I'm drunk at a bar alone.,"And it's a good thing. My wife is at our adorable hotel in the New Orleans French Quarter taking a nap and I'm having some cocktails on the patio of a really cool bar on Bourbon Street. I'm feeling like everything in my life is going to work out. We've been making friends everywhere we've been while in this beautiful city and having the time of our lives. The wedding went flawlessly. Held on a paddle boat on the Mississippi River and officiated by my younger cousin. My wife, my best friend, was radiant. 

I haven't had the best life, the best experiences, the best luck. Up until today. Today, I feel like the luckiest man in history and love you all."
People who take selfies at funerals are the scum of the Earth.,"I'm so tired of seeing funeral selfies all over my social media. 

""RIP Grandpa 😭😭😭 btw here's my gorgeous outfit and makeup on point lol."" 

I understand maybe wanting to take group pictures at funerals since it might unfortunately be the only time a lot of families have the chance to gather together. However, duck lips and filters right in front of Great Aunt Edna's casket are tacky A.F. and deserve to be publicly shamed. "
To the woman who rang me up at Wal-Mart today...,"I was buying groceries with my link card, and also baby bath soap and deodorant with the only five dollar bill I have to my name. I had checked my card balance before I got to the store and thought I had $120, but as I found out at the checkout aisle, the number wasn't up to date and I only had $70. You saw my embarrassment as I handed items back, just trying to make sure I could bring food home to my son.

You were very patient and kind as we worked out how to get my balance right. Then it came time to pay for my deodorant and baby soap. The price on the soap was actually a couple dollars more than had been labeled, and I was going to have to leave behind the deodorant that I desperately needed so that my baby could have a bath, and that was ok. I was willing to do it.

But you didn't let me leave it behind. You reached into your own pocket and gave me the extra money so I could buy both items.

I cried the entire drive home, not over the left behind groceries, but over your kindness. You had no idea what a rough couple of months it's been for my family. You had no clue just how much that two dollars meant to me. You'll never know how important your small act of generosity was to me, but it was huge.

I wish I'd gotten your name so I could call Wal-Mart and tell them just what an incredible woman they have working for them. I wish there was some way I could repay you for what you did for me. Instead, I'm writing this post, just on the off chance that maybe you get on reddit, and maybe you'll see it. You probably won't, but I hope you do.

There are great people in the world today, and you're one of them. I'll never forget you and what you did for me. Thank you. I wish you every good thing in the world.

Edit: I didn't expect so many people to see this! I'm so glad my great experience made so many of you happy too, and I'll be contacting the store I went to and telling them how helpful, patient, and cheerful the employee was so that she can hopefully get some recognition."
"I, a sex-positive, 19 year old college student, believe that the age of adult film stars should be moved from 18+ to 21+.","Don’t get me wrong, I love porn and I think it’s awesome for the most part...it was just this one time I had came across this video, and basically in the beginning they were talking about how the female pornstar in the flick was 18 and had just graduated high school. 

This video had gotten rave reviews, but honestly I just felt sick to my stomach. It just felt wrong to know that someone who was so close to adolescence was doing pornographic stuff. It also felt weird that someone my age (I feel like I left HS yesterday) was already doing something like this that would possibly impact her life for a very long time

I feel like this will get a lot of downvotes because I probably sound hypocritical as someone who watches porn but is under 21 themselves, and I also know that barely legal porn is popular. But personally for me, for a lack of better explanation it just makes me feel weird and uncomfortable.

Tl;dr I’m really uncomfortable with porn that involves people barely out of high school."
I can't believe I've been missing out on masturbation my whole life,"Last Monday I discovered that my boyfriend watched porn, shocking I know.  This started a week long drama of crying, fighting and yelling which climaxed (no pun intended) with us fighting at 2 AM in bed on my birthday.  

I kept talking about it with my friends who told me that all men watch porn and masturbate.  I was surprised to learn that a lot of my (female) friends did too.  I was raised as a good Catholic girl in a traditional home and believed that masturbation was dirty and porn was gross.  I thought that I was simply immune to self-pleasure as maybe once or twice every 4 years I'd try to masturbate by putting my fingers on my vagina for 30 seconds, feel nothing and then think ""oh well, it's not for me"".

Yea I was fucking wrong.  After I accepted my boyfriend was not going to stop watching porn I decided that I'd just also watch porn to ""get back at him"".  I watched a little and was turned on but didn't feel much pleasure when I was touching myself.  The next day I went out and bought a vibrator and holy fuck this thing has change my life. The first time I used it the internet was down but my God did it feel amazing.

Today the internet is up and running and I watched porn while masturbating and as the title states, I can't believe I've been depriving myself of self-pleasure for 29 fucking years.  It feels so good to get to learn more about my body and accept myself as a sexual being.  I've only ever had 3 orgasms in my life and tonight was the 3rd.  Looking forward to getting better acquainted with Tiffany (my vagina) and making up for lost time.

Seth Santoro you're fucking hot."
To the woman who tipped me $13 on $27...,"We didn't have Malibu, so you ordered a sweet tea. You ordered a small and medium pizza. I brought you two small pizzas. It was my second true-blue mistake on the job. I felt like an idiot. You were wonderful and understanding, professing that it was ok. You'd order another if need be. But the za's came out burnt. You explained you had been a server. Completely understood it was my second week. That I didn't make the pizza. My manager ran you through two, new, correct sized pizzas. They came out perfect. And you asked if tips went to me directly... I said yes. You tipped me $13 on $27 after all that. I almost cried. I've been feeling so out of place. And stressed. You were so kind. Thank you. I needed your understanding. I wish I could hug you. You helped me more than you know today.

Also... Guy with the pokeball tattoo from Mississippi... I really appreciate you telling my manager how wondeful you thought I was. ...I am trying really hard to be a good server. It is difficult. I am completly out of my element, and not ecstatically so. You both completely made my day after a rough couple of weeks and a two state move. Thank you.

UPDATE: Thank you all for your kind words and stories! I saw all your comments in the middle of a crazy double shift. Couldn't check it until now :) This double ended on a rough note. Kitchen took so long on a dinner, and put a product with raw dough... The guy walked out in his drinks and apps (like $25). So yeah. Each day has been an adventure! "
Best friend/ current roommate doesnt take responsibility of her sexual life and its getting frustrating.,"I didnt think this was a thing until I moved in with her. She wont go on birth control because she doesnt want to gain weight, she wont take plan B because it gave her acne once for a week, and she uses a condom less than half of the time because unless the guy insist on one she doesnt use them. She strongly believes unless the guy insist on using them than what ever happens is his fault even though it will affect her. 

She'll then freak out worrying for the next week or so after having sex if shes pregnant or if she caught a STD. Which includes asking me a million questions about if this or that happened what should  I do in that situation. 

Thankfully this only happens every month or so, but its getting on my nerves. Ive told her a hundred time to at the very least take some condoms with her if shes going on a date/hook-up. To take plan B after unprotected sex especially if its her furitle week. 

Im getting really frustrated of her asking what would I do in this situation questions. I wouldnt be in the freaking situation to begin with because I have basic sexual responsibilities.  And its really hard just not to scream that back at her everytime. 

She knows how to have ""safe"" sex and yet it doesnt concern her until after shes had sex. Why are people like this...



"
We made love last night,"Just about 5 weeks ago, I had my 4th abdominal surgery for two distinct cancers in the past 4 years.  The incision has been a bit slow to heal.  I'm still on pain meds and things are still a bit tender.

As soon as we got into bed (we went to bed early), my wife made it clear that sex was going to happen.  Knowing that I'm still far from 100%, she initiated and ran the show.  We had done some ""stuff"" since my surgery, but no actual sex.  I have to admit that with my abdominal scars and some asymmetry in my body, I'm not feeling like I'm very attractive to her or anyone else, but it's only her opinion that matters to me.  Add in the 35 years we've been together, and neither of us is the person we were once.  I still find her beautiful and sexy and she's all I want.  All I've ever really wanted.

There was nothing physically different about the sex.  After 35 years together, it was something that we've done many times, probably on autopilot for more times than we'd like to admit.  

But last night, for a while, it was just beautiful.  I love her, I love having sex with her, and f*ck cancer, it can't steal our love or our love life.  Or, at least not yet.

I'm far from healed from this latest surgery.  The cancer is an aggressive type and it's likely to be my cause of death in the next five years or so.  We are both well aware of the ticking clock.

But, screw all that, because for a few minutes last night, I was making love to the most beautiful woman in the world.  Cancer can never steal what we've had and what we still have.  I feel like the luckiest man in the world."
New friend remembered a small detail,"Essentially I get paid in CryptoCurrency, I liquidate the CryptoCurrency in person via cash. (It's all legit lol)

I met this girl a couple of weeks ago and mentioned this as apart of what I do. She was pretty intrigued but I brushed it off. We were drunk so I put it down to that.

I saw her again this week and it came up in convo that I went to the bank recently, someone else asked why I had cash as everyone uses credit nowadays, and she mentioned that it was because I get paid in Crypto and then sell it for cash. 

It's really a little thing but I have been thinking about it a lot. Even my mom and long time friends need constant reminding of how I get paid and this girl remembered! Maybe I should ask her out lol.

Seems dumb but I'm almost shocked!
 


"
I succeeded as a mother.,"When I was barely 20-years-old, I found out I was pregnant from a one-night stand. I was in my junior year of college. I was terrified. The guy that got me pregnant wanted nothing to do with the baby. 

I thought about abortion, but I was too scared. I felt guilty. I decided to have the baby. 

I didn't love him right away. He cried a lot, and I realized it was because I wasn't feeding him enough. I was a new mother, and I only fed him the recommended amount on the labels. The doctors were like, ""Just feed him a little more."" When I called them, panicking. I laugh now, in retrospect. What was I thinking? 

He grew up into a wonderful child. His imagination was so wild. When he was only 9-years-old, he told me he wanted to write books. He was obsessed with Harry Potter. 

As a mother, I lucked out. Even though I had to drop out of college to care for him as a single-parent, it was a reward. He became my life. We grew up together--literally. He was the perfect child. 

By the time he graduated high school, he was valedictorian. My heart broke when he was accepted to a university over five hours away from me. But I knew he had to go--for himself, and for me. 

After he left, he would still call me every single day. Or I would call him. Occasionally, I would drive up to check in on him. I had just gotten married and started a new job, so my time was limited. So was my son's. We started to communicate less and less. 

By the time he graduated undergrad, we were on a pretty routine schedule of only seeing each other for every holiday and birthday. 

Today, my son turns 26. He is a lawyer. He is married to a lovely man, and soon they are going to start a family. I just finished a Skype call with him. It's 3:45 in the morning, and I am so happy. My heart is so fulfilled. My entire body is tingling with the knowledge that I was able to provide a wonderful life for my son, even though it wasn't always smooth sailing. 

I realized, today, that my son and I only see each other once or twice a year, usually for Christmas and my birthday. He's busy, you know. So am I. He will call me every month or so. Sometimes I forget entirely. That makes me sad, but I realize now that that is okay. It's okay to not be in communication, because a mother's job is to teach their child not to need them. A mother's job is to smother them with independence, so that they can one day walk by themselves. 

After realizing this, I called him. We talked for six hours. He lives across the country now, but we're making plans for his visit for my birthday. I love my son so much. I'm so happy for him, for me. For us. "
This guy didn't kill me because I was nice to him.,"Okay, so last night my husband and I were at a dinner party with some friends. We played the game “Two Truths, One Lie” where you basically say three statements and one of them is a lie and the other two are true. My three statements were:

1.	A man spared my life because I helped him pick up his dropped belongings. 
2.	I helped a woman deliver her baby in an upside-down car. 
3.	I came in last place in a triathlon because I got lost during the running part. 

Everyone (including my husband) said #1 was the lie, but actually it was #3. Shocked, they asked me to elaborate. This happened ten years ago and it has not crossed my mind since (I try to forget about it). 

Ten years ago, I moved to a large city to start my surgical residency. The hours were long and I always got off work at around 4am. One night, I stopped by a gas station on the way home to pick up some Tylenol (being on your feet after a 24 hour shift was killer). As I was walking into the gas station, there was a guy getting out of his car. He was carrying a backpack. He was nervous. A woman walked past him, bumped into him, and the man dropped his backpack. He had bags and bags of coins that spilled out and went everywhere. 

I went to help him pick it up. He was defensive. I told him I wasn’t trying to steal it. I crawled under a truck to get him some stray nickels. He thanked me, shook my hand, and told me I should go home and get some rest. I told him about my aching feet. He told me to go somewhere else. I asked him why. He said he was going to rob the store and that he had a gun. 

When someone says something like this, you have about ten million different thoughts that run through your head. I thought he was kidding. I smiled politely. Asked him if he needed help. He said I was “nice” and “didn’t deserve” what was coming. He pulled out the gun. I immediately ran back to my car. The guy went inside the convenience store. I drove away, screaming and swerving all over the road. I drove across the street to another gas station and called the police. 

Two people at the gas station were shot dead and the man killed himself. I’ve never forgotten about that night, even though I try like hell. Now it’s just a fuzzy memory and a party-story I tell about “how close I came to dying.” My husband was so shocked at this. He basically held me for the rest of the night and said I was never allowed to go anywhere without him. 

Be good to people. You never know what’s going to happen next. "
My parents use my childhood rape against me,"I was raped as a child. It started off with molestation and it got worse and worse until— well.. anyways—I was trying to move on. I got help, I got counseling, I thought it could be open and talk about it. I didn’t feel ashamed anymore because it doesn’t control me as much anymore. I told people I thought I could trust (Relatives) and my mom and dad tell me I shouldn’t tell ANYONE because it’s a shameful secret and I feel like I have every right to talk about it. They said because i like to talk about it, it makes it seem as if I’m proud of what happened to me as a kid. This. This is why I never want to speak to you guys anymore. Fuck you mom and dad. I don’t want to hear from you ever again. 

Edit: I can’t believe this. It wasn’t my intention to blow up over night. I truly came here for the support and that’s all I ever asked for. Thank you for the overwhelming support. Thank you guys. 

2nd Edit:: I just want to disclaim some things— I was 8 years old, I told my folks at 18. 10 years later. 
I don’t blame my parents because they weren’t able to simply “protect me.” They weren’t the villains WHEN it happened. They were working 2 jobs, both, and I do credit that to them. They trusted my aunt to look after me and I blame my cousin for doing what he did. Secondly, I’m not looking for a witch-hunt on my cousin. I care more and ONLY about my healing. I don’t care about my cousin and. I don’t want to project anymore attention to him. That’s why I avoided confrontation. "
SHE SAID YES,I asked out my crush to prom today and she said yes!! I’m so fuckin happy rn wow this is awesome!!
I hate Trump and all his supporters,"I feel like I'm watching people vote for Hitler. His rhetoric about minority groups is horrific. He knows nothing about the economy. He'd start a war because another nation taunted us. He's said he'd kill children for being the brother or son of a terrorist. People who support his candidacy, even if they don't support surveillance on Muslim-Americans or building a wall or starting a war or leaving NATO, are still supporting the man who wants to do all those things. They still want to put him in power. And I find it so morally repugnant that I can't believe there are people who are okay with this. People are literally voting to murder children. 

 I don't care if your reason is you want to keep the supreme court. I don't care if your issue is guns or if trade deals have hurt you and your family. I don't care what your reason is. There's literally no morally defensible way to vote for Trump. Supporting a racist is supporting a racist. And I don't care if you don't think Trump's a racist because if you don't already then you're not going to change your mind. 

And I won't even mention that he's going to put conservatives on the supreme court who'll try to reverse Ogberfell and ensure that minority groups can be shit on for the next 20 years. 

If you support Trump then fuck you. There's nothing more to it. You're a bad person, and I hope that you realize what supporting him means. Because you do have a voice, you do have a vote, and you should really realize that there are consequences to your actions. Voting for him makes you morally culpable for the horrible shit that he'll inevitable do. You can't pretend that he didn't say he wouldn't do horrific shit because he's said, multiple times, that he'd go out and kill children and start wars. "
Remember to tell them you love them.,"""At this moment 17 years ago, millions of Americans went to bed quietly, with no thought that the next morning their world would change forever.

That night, hundreds packed bags they would not live to open. Thousands slept with loved ones for the last time.  One never knows what a new day has in store. 

Let us never miss a chance to let those that mean the most to us know of our love for them. So tonight,  if you have someone in your life that you love, tell them."""
"i have never felt ""pretty"", and this is the first time i do. i sorta like it.","i was out dress shopping and i found this black dress and this nice jacket, and i tried it on. now, usually, i'm sorta ""ehh"" on the thought of wearing a dress, but when i saw myself, i was like ""holy shit. ho. ly. shit."" because, you know what? i haven't found myself pretty before this. i never thought i was capable of looking pretty. but that dress and that jacket made me feel pretty for once, and i am just, very happy about that. that's all. have a nice day.

I’m getting my SIL’s kids the most annoying gifts I can think of,"My sister in law is a piece of work.  She does so many things worthy of complaint, but the one I’m talking about today has to do with gifts.  She’s always given my kids gifts that I’ve specifically told her not to get for whatever reason.  Either it’s messy, noisy, or junk I don’t want in my house.  She will mention it before the holiday or birthday and I’ll tell her not to get it, and then that’s what my kid unwraps.  When I give her a nasty look, she says, “oh, it’s not that messy!” or “but my kids love it!”  I honestly think she does it on purpose to piss me off.



This year, I’m giving her kids the most annoying or messy things I can think of for xmas.  There is a new toy that I believe was developed in the pits of hell to torment parents, called “yellies.”  It’s a voice activated thing that moves when the kid shouts at it.  The youngest one is getting that.  The girl is getting bunchems, which are essentially burrs made of plastic.  I’m hoping they get stuck in her carpet, kids clothes, SIL’s hair...everything.  The older boy I’m debating on.  He’s always getting in trouble for throwing things, so I’m thinking of something that encourages that.  Maybe a learn to juggle kit?  Or a boomerang?  I have to think longer on this.  Suggestions are welcome.


Paybacks are a b-word, SIL.



Edit:   You people are amazing!  I am laughing my ass off at all of these suggestions.  I’m definitely hanging on to this list for birthdays, too.  I will write an update after the holidays to let you know the final gift choices and SIL’s reaction.  Don’t worry; I won’t get anything that could hurt the kids or a live animal (even though giving them a pet is a hilarious idea, I wouldn’t want an animal to suffer...plus she may actually kill me! Lol). "
I haven’t self-harmed in 262 days,"This is the longest I’ve gone since October 2015 and I’m so proud of the progress I’ve made. I didn’t think it would be possible to get this far. 


Edit: I didn’t expect this to get any attention! Thank you all so much for your kind words and believing in me. "
To the girl at the Starbucks drive-thru,"I didn't know where else to post this. But it made my day. And I had to share somewhere. It's by no means negative! 

For Valentine's Day, Starbucks is doing a buy one get one free promotion for all of their lattes. My manager wanted me to get 4 drinks, one for everyone in our department, on my lunch break. She gave me cash since I only had my card on me. Little did I know at the time, my card isn't working. I had to cash my check before going to Starbucks but the atm wouldn't accept my card. I ended up going inside and having the teller do it manually. I deposited nearly $1,000 and I had a good amount presently available on my account. 

Anyway, so I go to Starbucks thinking everything is fine and dandy. Order the 4 drinks, pull up to the window, give the nice woman my card to pay. Declined. She tries again. Declined again. At this point I'm noticeably embarrassed and frustrated. 

Gathering this, the woman looks to her left and then her right before saying audibly, ""You waited for 10 minutes? I'm so sorry about that. Don't worry about it, the drinks are on us."" She then wishes me a Happy Valentine's Day and hands me my 4 free drinks.  

It was unbelievably kind. I hope YOU have the best Valentine's Day ever, Starbucks drive-thru lady."
I hugged a girl today and it felt amazing!,"Today at work we were all saying goodbye to a coworker since it’s her last day.  I’ve known her for a few months, so we became friendly.  When she was saying goodbye at the end of her shift she gave a coworker a hug, then gave me a hug.  I don’t know how to say this without sounding weird, but the hug was amazing!  I haven’t hugged anybody that wasn’t family in a while, so it felt nice hugging someone that didn’t feel obligated to hug me.  Plus she was shorter and her head was on my chest.  She hugged me tight and it felt so nice.  I don’t even have a crush on her, she has a boyfriend anyway, she’s just a really cool friend. 

I’ve never done anything romantically with a girl, and all of my friends are dating or have dated in the past. Hopefully It’ll happen for me, but for now I’ll wait I guess.

 Even though it wasn’t a romantic hug, it was really nice.





***I didn’t expect this to blow up! Thanks to whoever gave me gold!!!***"
My first date after my husband died,"Tonight, I went on a date for the first time in almost five years. 

Last May, my husband passed away. I don’t want to be corny and say he was the “love of my life,” but he was pretty damn important. In six months it will be two years since I’ve heard his voice or seen him laugh so hard his face turns purple. I miss that, I miss him, and I think that’s how it will always be. 

After my husband died, and I was able to get my bearings, I definitively decided to swear off men and dating forever. It just didn’t seem appealing, I wasn’t turned on by the thought of having sex or hookups. It all just seemed pointless and, in a way, devastating—because sex is great. So to lose that desire was crippling.

Over the last few months, I’ve been so immersed in my work. This is my second holiday season without my husband or the closeness of his family. It hurts for me to be around his parents, because they have the same sense of charisma and personality that he had. It reminds me so much of him, so usually when they invite me over for dinner or an event, I find an excuse to leave or not show up. 

One of my work colleagues (and best friends) has been asking me if I’d ever like to “go out” with a guy. I told her no, it was out of the question. But she doesn’t want me to be alone, so she insisted I go out with one of her friends. It was just for a beer, so I wasn’t too concerned. 

I show up to the bar, I wait for about 30 minutes, then I get a text telling me that he can’t make it because he’s “stuck at work.” I was literally stood up the first time I decided to venture out into the real world. That’s messed up, right? That was three weeks ago. 

The bar I was at, and frequent often, is right across the street from my office and is in the center of a district where lots of offices and businesses are located. It attracts a lot of people who are heading home from the office or just need an escape. While I was sitting there, stood up on my date, one of the guys that works in the office next door to mine came over and sat down at the end of my table. He was alone. I only know him from elevator rides and trips to a corner market during my lunch break, but I waved at him. He took this as an opportunity to scoot down to my end. 

We ended up talking for about five hours, and it was the most fun I’ve had with a person since my husband. I know that’s a lot to say, and it’s really heavy-handed, but honestly. He made me laugh until my stomach was hurting and I had tears on my face. That’s genuine. We made plans to hang out the next week during lunch if time allowed, and we did. 

Tonight was our first “official” date, with dinner, a movie, and a walk in the park. We’ve both been really honest with each other about expectations and what we want to happen, and he has been through trauma of his own. When we said goodbye tonight, we didn’t kiss, but he did put his hand on my cheek and he smiled the biggest, dopiest smile I’ve ever seen. Then he gave me a hug and caught his bus home. 

Now I’m here, feeling calm. For a long time, I thought that I owed it to my late husband to never date or have feelings for someone again, but I know that’s not true. I can love him for the rest of my life, but I think the wound he left in my heart is healed enough to where I can feel new things now. And that is okay! I’m choosing to feel good things, new things, scary things—all the things! 

It may not work out with this guy, or maybe it will, who knows? I don’t want to think too much about it. The last night my husband and I spent together, we laid in bed and played Super Mario without saying a word. After, we went to bed and it remained silence. That’s not a bad thing; on the contrary, that’s how in-sync we both were with one another. We didn’t have to talk and chat to convey our feelings. That’s just how we were, and I don’t think I’ll ever have that again. That takes something special. 

But I know now, after tonight, that I will have something again. It will just be different. 

I will always love him, but I’ll always love me, too. And I want to treat me right. I want me to be happy. "
My son counted to ten this morning!,"My son is on the autism spectrum and is non-verbal. All I've ever heard him do is babble. He started up in a special education program back in April and has been going two days a week. 


This morning he found a calculator in my room and started playing with it. And it all started pouring out: ""Wah.....doo.....eeee....or....eye.....ick....eh-en....ay.....eye....en""


I know it doesn't seem like much but to hear him say that was music to my ears. My husband says it's the best Father's Day present he ever could've gotten. I just had to share"
"About to give my daughter a bad Christmas, nothing I can do to help it. But I still feel awful.","3 years ago, after years of saving. My wife and I had enough money saved to take our daughter (then 6) to Lapland to meet Santa.

While there my daughter made friends with another girl called Sarah, she was also the same age. They had everything in common both little girly girls so bright.

But Sarah wasn't there because her parents had saved. She was there as a ''wish''.

My daughter was curious, why was Sarah's skin yellow coloured? Why were her eyes ''looking sore'' and Sarah told my daughter that she was sick and that was that, Lilli never asked again and the two bonded while there.

They wanted to stay in contact so we exchanged skypes. 

The girls would talk almost everyday after school.

We all knew Sarah was getting sicker and sicker, but her and my daughter never minded.

Sarah's mother used to always thank me for how my daughter didn't care about her being sick she just wanted to be friends.  
They used to talk about growing up and opening a vets together and living together and how cool they would be.

We've known for a month or so the time was coming soon.

Their talks grew shorter and shorter, until Sarah was sleeping. But my daughter would still sit on skype and babble about her day.

I wondered if that was bad but Sarah's mother said she loved the fact my daughter wanted to talk even while she was resting it made it ''more natural'' for her.

Sarah passed two hours ago. She'll be the damn brightest star in the sky tonight. It's good she's out of pain finally.

But

My daughter has never had anyone close to her die before, now I've got to tell her on Christmas Eve that her best friend has gone forever.

We were all going to meet in disney next March, Lilli had already picked Princess shirts for the two of them to wear and match each other and would talk on and on about how she can't wait to see Sarah again and go on rides.

Sarah, you had a short life with a lot of pain. But myself and my daughter will *never* forget how much joy you brought, how you giggled and that serious face you'd always pull. Shine on you crazy diamond. You're the brightest star tonight.

Happy Christmas everyone. Sorry about the mellow mood hope you have a good time.

Edit-

Oh wow, thank you everyone so much I just checked back and I'm shocked. So many beautiful comments and even gold. I'm stunned at everyone who has given their thoughts and kind words, it means a lot to me and has helped me clear my thoughts. 

I've had a few inboxes about sending my daughter toys, but please don't. (although thank you so much for offering) She's a lucky girl when it comes to presents compared to a lot of other kids out there, my wife and I work hard as well as grandparents she has more than a lot of other people, if you would like to spend your money please consider donating to a charity of your choice in memory of Sarah. 

We've (maybe wrongly but only time will tell) decided to her just after Christmas. I loved the idea of naming a star after her, I put out on facebook and turned out a friend had a name a star kit which he is giving up for us to use so my Lilli can name a star after her best friend. We thought we should tell her as soon as but she still believe in Santa and o be honest seeing her so excited, I just didn't want to break that. The bad news can wait a day we just got done wrapping her presents up, she actually has a present waiting for her from Sarah it's a photoshop of the two of them with a band they like called 5 seconds of summer. I'm sure she will love that picture.

Again, thank you all for your kind words. I will tell her what has happened, she's becoming a big girl and death is a part of life. I'm just so sad that she has to learn it by knowing another child died.

I hope you all have a wonderful christmas (or whatever you celebrate or do:) ) and a fantastic new year 

"
I almost killed myself today.,"I’m 25 years old, I have been struggling lately with an itch that I have in my whole being. This past year has made me seriously question whether I’d make it this year or not, and today, I went home after an intense situation that added to my accumulation of woes. I opened my medicine cabinet and I took a very long look at the cocktail of pills I have. I emptied out the bottles and looked at the very colorful 100 something pills and I almost did it. I was thinking that I was just *so tired* of everything about myself and the solution was the pile of drugs before me. I could end it all. All the guilt, shame, my life, my mind, all of me could just mute my life and go to black forever. I was so convinced that everyone would be better off without someone like who ruins every fucking thing unintentionally all the time. I was so angry, I could have almost stabbed myself. For a split second, my cat came to my mind. He needs me, the only thing in my life that really, lovingly, needs me. I cried the ugliest cry this year. I cried so hard that I couldn’t hold myself up. My boyfriend called me and I told him the truth. His response was so apathetic that I hung up, cried some more, went to hold my cat, he slept next to me as I proceeded to bawl my eyes out. 

I almost did it again for the 2nd time this year. But I decided that today was not the day. 

That was an hour ago. I’m better now. I’m alright. "
"10 years ago when my son was born, we pawned my wedding ring.","**IVE BEEN SEARCHING FOR YEARS TO PURCHASE IT BACK & TODAY I FOUND IT!!!!**


I cannot believe I found it.  Religiously for years I've went to that pawn shop to scan for my ring.  No luck, I was giving up, figured I'd never find it.  

Today we went to buy a new gun and I said ""why not"" low and behold the damn things there!!!!! It was like it almost was shining and had a light around it, just for me! Immediately I let out a squeal and my husband thought I was insane.  ""My ring! My ring! I found my ring!"" And started to cry tears of joy.  




We pawned it years ago when our son was born to pay the light bill.  Bills kept happening and I knew I'd never be able to get it back out. Then we got financially settled and I couldn't find it.  They couldn't find it in the ""back"".  I was devastated 



I'm just tickled to death that I found the one material thing that means something to me, I cried for years over losing this ring.   It's a specially made ring my husbands father had made for his mother.  She gave it to him for me when we got married.  And here it is on my finger.  


Where it belongs...


This has to be a sign... 


**Edit:** Wow! Thank you everyone. For those asking for a picture scroll through the comments.  One in there :)

I'm gonna do it guys,"I have no friends, I have lots of social anxiety, but I'm somewhat fit and I'm gonna run this 5k alone. I just want to accomplish something decent in 2016."
My mother has poisoned me.,"This is a throwaway account.  Ever since I became an adult about a decade ago, my mother has been against me moving out of the house.  I finally got a job as a line cook three years ago.  My mother (and rest of family, which includes my sister and father) has been against it, mainly saying that such a job cannot sustain me (which was true).  They also said that I would hate working, which turned out to be false.  About a year and a half later, I quit due to health reasons.  The following spring, I got a new job as a computer programmer.  While they seemed supportive at first, my mother and sister (who I lived with) gradually became hostile.  Eventually I moved out of the house.  About a month later, I lost my job, and about three months later, moved back home.  

Everything was cool at first, but as I was getting calls from recruiters and going to job interviews, they gradually became more hostile again, accusing me of being distant and not caring for them.  However, they seemed to be very controlling, and hateful of the fact that I wanted to move out and wanted a decent job.  So last month, I finally got that job as a programmer again, but it was out of town.  I had just enough money to relocate to the new city.  They became very hostile starting a few days before I left, accusing me of not loving them, of hating them.  On the day before I was scheduled to leave my mother gave me two of the styrofoam ramen noodles cups, and tore that cardboard covering that normally comes with it and threw it away.  I was suspicious that they would try to sabotage my life, so I was careful in not trying to anger them.  She gave a few more food items (which I didn't use) to take on the trip with me.  When I arrived at my new city and entered my hotel room, I chilled out.  I was to go to work the next day.  So, after the first day at work, I ate a cup of ramen noodles, and felt ill.  I knew that feeling because my sister fed me something that made me feel the same way in late 2011, which I then assumed was because of my recent illness.  I felt weak, light headed, and ""short of breath.""  I drank water to make me feel better, because that's what I did last time that happened to me. Over the week, my mother kept calling me, making sure to remind me to eat my ramen noodles (I was short on cash then, waiting for my first paycheck).  I never told her that I ate it.  I suspected then that I had been poisoned, and after doing some Googling, believed it was cyanide. 

Now that is something that you should never have to think, that your own mother would do that to you.  So I resisted that thought, because I simply could not bear to think that.  So, I went to http://cyanidetest.com/ and ordered a kit, and I tried it.  Now, look at the graphics and the video on [this page](http://cyanidetest.com/cyanide-detectors).  

Now, here are the results of my test: http://imgur.com/dNf1Dwy

I guess I am going to have to call the cops, and I will never speak to my family again.

**Edit**:Thank you for being my support group.  You will get updates on this story.  

**Update (8:45 AM)**: I am currently in Topeka Kansas.  I work downtown in a government office building. which has a police department.  I visited the Capital Police stationed here, and spoke to an officer.  I showed him the evidence, and he said that he could do nothing about it since the package was opened, and might have been contaminated.  So, does anyone have ideas?"
I was in child porn,"and I want to talk about it. Just a little of it.
I finally want to, so please let me.
If it's not OK to, then please delete this Mods, posting it however briefly should be enough for me to feel relief.

*and breathe*

It has been 16 years since the last time, I was 9 years old, and towards the end of that year everything came to a close.

I have always had blank spots in my memory. These started when I was very young, and I'm told they're because I have a dissociative disorder as a result of what I went through. What I do remember is bad enough.

My dad loved showing off his daughter to his friends, I'm not sure if all of them really were in the army, but I remember the uniforms. We'd disappear off for the weekend for 'daddy-daughter time"", because he was often away. They rarely came over. I was a toddler, missing my daddy, and confused by all the attention. I didn't understand why I had to touch that guy, or that guy, or the 'lady', but I knew my daddy smiled at me a lot and was happy with me when I did.

I didn't like the flashing cameras. I didn't like the little red light. I didn't like the smell, the taste, the voices, the 'bad words' mum didn't like to be said at home. But I loved my daddy. I loved when he was nice. When I realised he was making mummy cry a lot, and putting those nasty bruises on her, I thought if I was a good girl he wouldn't think she was being a 'bad girl' - because only bad girls get hit, don't they? Bad child logic. I delayed her suffering by only a little at best.

My early childhood memories are of being choked by foulness and scrubbing my body raw so that I wouldn't be 'disgusting for mummy', as I was told not to be by him. He'd explain it away somehow, I still don't know how. My mother was in such deep denial.

We were in a garage. We were always in a garage or shed or caravan, what I thought of as 'big car houses' were probably warehouses, but I don't know. We'd get somewhere and on some times I remember my daddy telling me we were playing 'sausages', and I had to lay like one curled in a pan, in the boot of a car, and close my eyes and count. It was so noisy. When the boot opened again, he'd be gone, and I'd have been driven somewhere with one of his friends. Sometimes he didn't show up for days, I found out later. I didn't have a clear sense of time.

I was scared, but I'd get chocolate, and I wasn't allowed that at home. Sometimes I'd eat chocolate pudding, then pass out. I woke up hurting, feeling sick. I wanted something to drink to get the bad taste away, and the request was almost always met with horrible things. There was one guy who just wanted me to be his dolly. I still feel unclean when I think about him.

Sometimes bedtime would come and go and they wouldn't have let me eat. I'd be so hungry, I'd do anything. They used to swap videos, ""so eager!"" comments - I was starving, I'd have done anything to get something to drink or eat. That kind of tactic was used a lot as I got older and didn't want to co-operate - because the older I got the more happened. They started making me wear things more (I still can't wear pretty lingerie) and restraining me.

Some of the people didn't make me touch them, but touched me like I was their ""angel"", and did the least bad things to me. Aside from that they bought the pictures and photos, my dad loved to hear that someone liked the videos and that they were passed on, he started doing more requests, before I got a little older and he started not wanting to share me as much. I started to dread Christmas, because I was convinced I'd been a bad girl, because I wouldn't go along with the things that hurt anymore, they were hurting too much. I started to bleed. They started talking about when I could have babies, about having a lottery for it. He made a lot of money from people who were really into that. These times, and the early years, were the worst.

When I was 9 and someone asked what I wanted to do when I went to big school ""you'll be 10 or 11, right?"" I announced that when I was 11 I'd be having a baby, because that's what big girls do, so I wouldn't need to go to school. I don't know how it wasn't reported.

Years later, in my teens, we'd moved away, I wasn't safe but it had stopped.
One of the guys and his friend found me. He came by and picked me up on the way home from school every now and then. I had to stop going to an afterschool club.
4-5 months later I miscarried. I didn't know I was pregnant.
He took care of it and I only saw him once more after.

When I was 19 I was gang raped by some guys were on drugs (which apparently makes it OK) - it felt normal. That's when I realised that I needed serious help. It took a while, and I'm still working on some things, but I'm through the worst.

Last year I was visiting somewhere not very from where I grew up. Some drunk guys at a bus stop, where I was waiting for a bus, were defending child porn, much like lots of people on reddit do - ""it's OK, it's not hurting kids"", ""kids can be hypersexual, I saw this thing on this other thing"", which eventually became ""have you ever been curious enough to look it up?"" type comments... Long story short, one of them described a bondage themed series he'd seen... And from the description, that was me. I couldn't believe I was hearing people discuss CP offline, much less things that sounded like they were me.

Right now I've gotten so much of this off my chest but I still can't write the absolute worst, because it's just too much to say.

I hate that there are still pictures and videos of me out there, being tortured as a child.
I hate that I can never erase them. That I know for a fact that some of those pictures inspired others.
I hate that I grew up thinking it was normal for people to assault me. That I grew up as an object.
That pleasing people, rather than putting myself first, is still my default nature, I might never undo the conditioning.
That I was never a virgin.
That no-one ever tried to save me, despite the warning signs. I had to wait until I was old enough to save myself, because people who should have been protecting me failed.

Most of all, at this point in my recovery, I hate that although I've learned to enjoy some forms of sex, I will never ever be able to experience a man going down on me without feeling like I'm 6 years old. So many areas of a normal woman's sex life have been stolen from me, and I might never be able to reclaim them.

I dislike that occasionally I'll be on reddit and see lots of people defending it.
That people excuse that behaviour when they've never experienced it.
I hate that I feel like it's normal for me to be abused.
I hate that so many kids go through things like I did every day. Are starved so people can pretend their hunger is consent.
Are hurt by people that should be protecting them. It kills me inside to think that somewhere, there is probably another girl like me, thinking she has to do things no child should even know about, to 'protect' a parent and/or siblings. That there's another startled girl thinking she's dying, because she's losing a child that she didn't know she was carrying, and that like me that's how she'll find out how babies are made.

I feel sad for people attracted to children.
If they don't act on it, or ever even look at CP, then I am at least a little relieved.

But every time I read or hear someone excusing it, my mouth goes dry. I become unbearably thirsty, and smells and tastes that aren't there flood my senses. My body remembers the horrors of my childhood, and I tell myself that those excusing it only do so because they have never experienced it and cannot imagine. They're lucky. I'm grateful that I didn't discover reddit before I was this far through my recovery. And now somehow words that I can never say, because normally I put other peoples' reactions about my own, have relief.

Today is the anniversary of the miscarriage.
Now that I've written this I think that I can sleep. Someday I might give voice to it all, but for now this is enough and I'm grateful for finding somewhere to post.
I hope that anyone who reads this (I don't expect anyone to) has a lovely day.

EDIT: 20 hours later... I just wanted to say thank you for all the comments and messages and to update you. I did manage to sleep last night, for the first time on that anniversary night. I think it is because I posted here.

I am doing well, I know some of you have worried. I have times where it hits me pretty hard or rushes back, such as around an anniversary of an extremely bad time, but for the most part I am absolutely fine. I'm starting my life over again now, but I'll be OK. I promise you.

I will reply to messages and some comments but I can't reply to every comment just now. I read them all. I struggle to believe the kindness I have found here. Thank you all. You are wonderful people. Go out and make your day awesome!"
The sweetest thing my husband does...,"It all started a couple of months ago and to be honest with you I don’t remember the reason… I was in our living room spending time with the love of my life when suddenly I started feeling sleepy. Like a child I started kicking up a bit about it (I’ve never been the best at bed times). My husband noticed I was feeling a bit grumpy and that my eyes were heavy with sleep. 

“Why don’t you go to bed?” he asked 

“I don’t feel like it yet” I replied even though I knew full well I was fighting a losing battle with sleep. 
He didn’t say anything and just held me, knowing that if I fell asleep on the couch waking me up was going to be rough. I was not ignorant to that fact either but for some reason sleep and I have never been the best of friends. I could try to blame my anxiety but to be honest with you I don’t remember a time in my life I didn’t fight off sleep as much as possible. In my teens I was able to manage off of four hours of sleep but I had stopped being a teen longer than I care to admit. 

Then, just as I was getting ready to get up he said it. 

“Want me to carry you?”

At first I thought he was joking. Of course he’s carried me before but mostly for silly things, funny pictures and to overall be cute. But this, this felt different, more intimate and yet I felt like my answer should be no, so I laughed it off a little and indeed I said ‘no, why would you?’ or something of the like. 

“Come on” he said and held out his hand and I felt a tingle in my chest. Of course I had dreamed of a partner carrying me somewhere but I also dreamed of donning cinnamon bun rolls on my head and leading the rebellion. I never imagined something like this would actually happen… and particularly not to me. 

I pride myself of being strong and independent and sometimes a bit too independent for my mother’s liking. Yet I took his hand this time and he chuckled and asked me to hop up (I am so short) and he carried me the few feet from the living room to the bedroom. It was truly the sweetest thing. 

I don’t remember how I became a habit but a couple of nights a week I will gently ask… 

“Will you carry me to our bedroom?” and if he’s feeling up to it (and funny enough he always is) he will say “of course” and ask me to hop up and carry me to our bed. Sometimes we bump into something and laugh, other times I ask him to throw me on the bed and we end up laughing until our stomachs hurt. Sometimes we come in the bed, kiss and make love… 

This routine has meant the world to me. For some reason something as gentle as being carried off to bed has made me feel closer to him. He is the first man who lets me be this person, the person who is strong and independent but that sometimes needs someone to hold her… and carry her to bed.

Nurses are heartbroken too.,"ICU nurse here. Today, I'm struggling to keep it together.

We're a pretty tight group. Our job is hard in too many ways, so we rely on each other for basically everything. 

Today one of our own is sitting in the ICU with their spouse who keeps getting worse. We all know the likely outcome. And it's hitting close to home. 

We often have a front row seat to unimaginable pain and misery. We have to detach enough to preserve our own self while staying attached enough to show compassion in your most horrible moment. We cry with you, then put on our best smile for our families. It's so much harder when it's your own. We're watching our coworker and friend fall apart, doing everything we can to fix it, knowing there is nothing else we can do. All we can do it wait and give the best care we can to all the other critical patients who need us. 

Sometimes the nurses are also dealing with unimaginable pain, while supporting you through yours. Please be gentle with us too. "
To the guy I met on the bus nearly four years ago:,"I know it's a long shot that you're on reddit, and on this sub in particular, but I have been wanting to say this to you since six months after we met.

I sat near you on the bus and you noticed I looked sad. You started talking to me and asked how I was. But you said it differently than anyone else; you actually cared. So, my story came out. The sexual and emotional abuse I endured from family, to getting addicted to meth at 15 with a 30something year old psychotic meth dealer boyfriend, to running from him and meth and my family at 17. I was high on crack when I met you. 


You invited me to smoke weed with you in a field near a hospital in Vancouver and let me vent. How I ran from my foster home because my probation officer told me my family choose my sex offender brother over me, and placed me there instead. How I wanted to die and was heading to Seattle, a city I had never been to and knew one person there, with no way to contact them.


You showed me genuine concern. You told me you'd smoke all your weed with me if I'd just go to the ER after and turn myself in. That it would get better. That there are people who care. That I would be an adult soon and this would make it really hard for me to get out of poverty and addiction.


Well, I wanted you to know that I did it. I went to the ER and passed out in the waiting room. I was transferred to a behavioral unit for children, then to another home. Then another. Then I was 18 and have held down a job and my own place ever since. I have been clean off of meth for almost four years. I still have some issues related to my upbringing, childhood addiction, and abusive relationship, but I am doing so much better. And I will continue to get better. 


I wanted you to know that you saved my life. You really did. I didn't want to disappoint the person who had been kinder than anyone I had met before. And I wanted you to know how grateful I am. Words cannot express the debt that I owe to you and the world. I continue to pay it forward. 


So thank you. Thank you so, so very much, you kind soul. I wish that I remembered your name.



Edit: Wow, I didn't expect this to blow up! Thank you all so much for your support and understanding. I do try to help all those who look like they need it. The world would be a better place if everyone did"
"I bake because I'm poor, fuckhead.","Not because I live a life of leisure, and have nothing better to do. Not to be cool. Or have people think I'm Susie Homemaker. I bake because I'm dirt fucking poor. It's cheaper to bake a loaf of bread than paying $4US for a single loaf. I can buy 5lbs/2.26kg of flour for $2.29, and four packets of yeast for $1.29, to make four loaves (and have flour left over). You do the math. I get my sugar, butter, rice and oats from the food bank. I bake an apple pie from scratch every week because there's an old apple tree in the yard that had a huge season this year, and I was able to freeze over 30lbs that I'll be able to stretch over months (plus my apple pie is fucking delicious and will last a week if refrigerated). I'm so tired of the ""must be nice"" ... ""wish I had the time"" comments. I bake because I'm poor. Yes, I have a job. A part-time job working 15 hours a week (there's nothing else out there for me right now, believe me, I've looked). After paying rent, I've got nothing. So, I don't do it because it's fun, or enjoyable. I do it because if I didn't I wouldn't eat... so I make the fucking time to do it.  
  
::sigh::  
  
Okay, I admit it. I do like making the pies.  
  
Edit 2: Second HOLY SHIT! I was just venting. I never expected this to blow up like it has. You people are amazing. I thank you SO much for your kind words, thoughts, ideas, suggestions, etc... I'm working right now, so I'll try and read all of your comments later today. Again, just, wow. 

Edit 1: Mandatory HOLY SHIT! I sign off to make a couple of pies, cook a couple of meals, and just, damn. I'm going to try and get through as much as I can before bed. Oh, and another holy shit... Thanks for the Gold! 
"
Fuck this country,"I’m tired of the US. It’s clear our government doesn’t work for the people. Education is a joke, healthcare is a joke, economy is a joke. But let’s go ahead and give tax breaks to the rich while spending more on the military. Our infrastructure is failing, streets decaying, poverty is at an all time high, people are complacent, too distracted to realize they are being fucked in the ass from every direction. I have lost faith in this country and I am not proud to be an American. "
"Fuck you and your fucking moral high horse, Reddit.","I'm posting this here because I try my best to be civil on Reddit, and this comment is not civil.  I apologize in advance.  For context, I am the author of [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1s3ltx/former_inmates_of_reddit_how_are/cdtlkky?context=3).  As you are probably well aware, my inbox is full of some really vile shit right now (i.e. rape and death threats), but it's also full of people telling me ""you're a sick fuck"", and ""the justice system isn't your form of personal revenge"", and, most importantly **""to forgive is divine""**.

Well, I've been thinking long and hard about these comments, Reddit, most especially that last one.  And I've come to a conclusion: you are just as monstrous as the 55 year old man who molested me when I was ten years old.  Why you ask?  I'll fucking tell you why.

When you tell me to forgive this pedophile, you're thinking in the abstract.  You're thinking ""oh, she should forgive him for molesting her"".  Fuck that.  I'm going to lay it out in explicit, concrete terms for you.  Ready?

You are asking me to forgive him for forcibly kissing me in my own bedroom when I was ten years old.

You are asking me to forgive him for singing ""you wanna make love to me?"" softly into my ear as he wrapped his arms around me from behind when I was ten years old.

*You are asking me to forgive him for fondling my chest in my own backyard when I was ten years old.*

**You are asking me to forgive him for SHOVING HIS FINGERS INSIDE OF ME ON THE COUCH IN MY OWN BASEMENT WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD.**

***YOU ARE ASKING ME TO FORGIVE HIM FOR THROWING ME ONTO MY OWN BED AND TRYING TO RAPE ME WHEN I WAS TEN YEARS OLD***

There is some shit that you *never fucking forgive* because you would be a *fucking monster* to forgive a pedophile **WHO RAPES CHILDREN**.

Fuck you.  Forgiveness is not always divine, Reddit, and you'd do well to learn that."
Shhh... my girlfriend is asleep,"I don’t know if this fits here but I just want to tell someone. 

As of right now, my girlfriend is asleep on my shoulder. Completely passed out. She does this every time we sleep together. In a way, it’s really annoying. We will be talking about something and without notice she will just disappear on me. 

And then she starts to snore. Sometimes it’s just little snores but sometimes, like tonight, it’s loud, earth rattling snores. 

Like I said, in a way, it is annoying that this always happens. I always think, “ Why can’t you just tell me you are sleepy and not just fall asleep while we are talking?”

But when I think that she starts to snore even more and I start to feel something else. I start feeling happy. Her snoring, to me, means she is fast asleep. She is so comfortable on my shoulder that she can’t help but drift off. It feels so good that she is so comfortable with me. 

Eventually I have to push her off of me so I can sleep to. But sometimes I just lie there for hours at a time with her sleeping on my shoulder because it feels so goddamn good. When I do push her off she makes sure that some part of her body is touching me. Even though she is asleep she still looks for me to make contact. I love that. It makes me feel so wanted. 

Her favorite thing is when I come up behind her and hold her against me. She shifts her hips around so that there is no space between us and let’s out this big sigh, kind of. I can feel her relax into me the same way I feel her body relax on to me like she is right now. 

The light from my phone screen doesn’t bother her. In fact, the noise from big trucks passing by on the street outside don’t seem to bug her at all. The only thing that wakes her is when I get up to go to the bathroom or get a drink or water.  The second I return she is on me again. I can’t even explain how good that feels. 

I can’t tell her any of this because she is asleep. And in the morning it’s just different. We wake up at different times for work. I never can tell her in the very moment that she is cuddled up next to me how good it feels and how much I like it. I don’t think she will ever really know for sure how much it means to me that she wants to be as close to me as possible. 

I just needed to tell someone. I have trouble sleeping and most nights are these miserable slowly passing hours of anxiety. But when she is sleeping next to me it’s like a vacation from my normal life. I don’t know what I would do without her. I try all the time so hard to show her how much she means to me even just for the little things she does like fall asleep on my shoulder. It never feels like enough. Not because she isn’t happy with how I show her but because nothing I ever do ever seems close to equal to what she does for me just by being with me. 

Edit - I don’t know why people complain about others snoring. When someone is snoring I figure it is because of one of two scenarios. The first is that the are sleeping poorly and I feel bad for them because I hate it when I wake up feeling miserable and tired. The second is that they are having a really good, deep sleep and I am immensely happy for them. Like right now my girlfriend is alternating between snoring and snuggling and historically when she does this she wakes up telling me she slept really well. So even though I need to put some earplugs in I feel really good that she is sleeping well. (It’s a little embarrassing to admit that it almost makes me a little excited when she is sleeping hard  - I always am cheering her on in her sleep as if she is winning some sort of sleep competition, if that makes any sense)"
do you ever write up a whole post and then delete it because you are too scared of being judged,I am new to reddit and struggle with social situations due to anxiety and i thought i could come to reddit to rant/get help. But i am still freaking out about speaking my opinion even though its completely anonymous 
Proud of myself,"At the gym tonight, I ran for a whole 5 minutes on the treadmill. 
I know to a lot of people this doesn't sound like much but I am very proud of myself. I used to be obese and lost weight from starving myself and dancing. 
The past 6 years my weight has fluctuated, I have struggled with an eating disorder and never did exercise outside of dancing.

So basically my health has always been poor in some way or another but I have built up the strength and stamina to run for 5 minutes straight.

I am proud of myself, I am going to keep working hard!

Thanks for reading guys ~

EDIT:  I went straight to bed after posting this and woke up to so many wonderful comments and messages. I really didn't expect such a response but I am so overwhelmed (in a good way haha). Thank you so much everyone for your kind words of encouragement and sharing your stories too. I am going back to the gym today and I am gonna go for 7 minutes :) I hope everyone has a wonderful day/night "
Fuck Donald Trump and fuck his dumbass supporters.,"Im tired of being told that I have to play nice with trump supporters, of not being able to call them out on their shit and i'm done. If you support Trump you are a racist, yokel scumbag and so is your dear leader. You are destroying this country and shaming us in front of the world. You are not a patriot you are a facist, you will be the reason democracy dies in this country. I will enjoy your suffering when you lose your ACA, your social security, your unemployment and all the other benefits you hate other people for using but are ok with taking for yourself. You deserve it for inflicting that fat orange turd on the rest of us. "
A 6yo cousin was raped by a 16yo autistic pedo at my family xmas party; all anyone cared about was the mother of the predator...,"We just had our family Christmas party, its a pretty ‘waspy’ mix of people, pretty posh house. When a dog ran out the door I saw one of my cousins ‘B’ sobbing hysterically while another ‘C’ was just sitting with a 1000 yard stare. After getting the dog we were all giving them distance and staying in the kitchen. It got around that the black sheep autistic kid had told ‘B’s daughter to take off her clothes and had assaulted her in some way, this was a super sweet and kind 6 yr old and she was found naked and sobbing. 

The autistic kid has had a history of being touchy feely with the younger girls, every single person knew that he was capable of this shit and they just kept giving him access to victims while downplaying his FUCKING PREDATORY BEHAVIOR. 

Its like their scared to say that this goes beyond autism, that hes just a fucking psychopath pedophile. And whats worse is that after hearing about the sexual assault of one of our family, they all just awkwardly stared and acted like it didnt happen. Me and another college aged cousin were just venting and they called us down to ‘be with family.’ 

Ive been sexually assaulted, and I know that it can fuck you up beyond belief, what happened to this innocent 6 yo is beyond horrifying. WHILE THERE WERE POLICE WALKING UP AND DOWN THE STAIRS WITH RAPE KITS they were laughing about medical bills and work. No one supported the mother and father of the victim except the younger cousins. 

On the car ride back, the cherry on top, they made it into an argument of how the reaaal problem is that they couldn’t institutionalize the autistic cousin. SO BECAUSE IT WOULD COST THEM A NOMINAL FEE TO PUT HIM IN DAYCARE ONCE A YEAR HELL BE BACK NEXT YEAR. This fucking pedo hiding behind autism is going to be in the same house as a bunch of cousins he could overpower and rape. They say “oh well just make sure hes not alone with them” are you fucking serious???

I thought this family was decent, but the more I see them act I realize this is a dysfunctional family. To them its all about making sure the mother of the autistic child can go to family gatherings, no one even cares about ‘B’ because shes the youngest adult and they have some petty drama with her. I want to just fucking vomit at this hollow apathy. "
Today I picked up our engagement rings,"Yesterday I got a text saying that our rings where ready to be picked up. 
My heart skipped a beat. 
We’ve been dating for almost two years but it feels like we’ve known each other for way longer. We’ve both went through heaven and hell with each other. Got our own apartment and talked about buying a farm outside of the city. We have two little fluffy kittens that keep us awake at night and we share many other things. 
But soon we are going to be sharing our lives together, “for real”. 
We’ve talked about it many times, especially you. Every time the topic came up I became more and more comfortable talking about it, and started forming my own opinions about it, since I didn’t have many, if any, at the beginning. 
I have an idea of how I want to propose to you, by placing the ring inside of a hollow console controller and offering it to you when we have our next game-night. 
Parts of me are scared, because this is new and something I’ve never had to deal with before. I’m tearing up writing this, since it’s so foreign for me. No one knows that I’ve bought these rings. 

But, I am certain that it will go well. After all, we complete each other in so many ways, it would feel weird marrying any one else. 

Wish me luck, and thank you for reading. "
My wife is gone,"My wife died from a car accident 3 days ago and I don't know what to do. I'm so confused and lost and feel like she's been gone for so long but still here. I need her back. I miss her so fucking much. 

Someone touched my shoulder today and I thought it was her. I keep having dreams that all this is a dream and everything is ok and we're happy together and she smiles and then I wake up. I wish more than anything that I could just dream forever and see her all the time, that this is all a bad bad dream.

She was airlifted to a hospital in Vegas 100 miles away from me. She sometimes worked late, and by the time I started getting worried, I got a phone call. She had coded twice already and was fading fast. I made it to Vegas a half hour too late, she was already gone. She died, alone. I promised I would always be there, but I wasn't and now she's gone forever.

I couldn't even bring myself to go see her and say goodbye. The bus destroyed her so badly they couldn't even use her as a donor.

Things seem so incredibly hopeless and I don't know how I'm going to live without her. She was the most beautiful, vibrant, amazing woman I've ever met and gave me the happiest 4 years of my life.

I'm sorry, it's midnight and I have no one to talk to, but her picture. 

I'm so fucking lost right now.

Edit: I want to thank each and every one of you. I wish I had the time and energy to thank you all personally. 

While things are still hard, and I find myself lost and hurt and almost without hope, you all have helped me.

Your stories of strength and kind words have helped me find the resolve I need to push forward no matter what. 

If anyone here, now or in the future ever reads this, and needs any kind of help or just to talk, please don't hesitate to send me a message. You are all  beautiful, and I wish I had the words to describe how grateful I am for each and every one of you."
I stood up to an abortion protest on my campus,"This was just earlier this week. Leaving my campus on a bus I saw them holding disgusting photos of miscarriages passing off as abortions. The fact that they were doing it smack in the middle of a busy intersection where new students, families etc were coming in woke something up in me. I got off the bus and walked over to the ringleader (unsurprisingly, a man) they were finished for the day but I was just getting started.   For what seemed like forty minutes, I argued with him on what he believes he is achieving by showing such pictures and what plans does have to do for : orphanages, the new sex Ed curriculum in my province, daycare centres (just want to add that here was a daycare not far from where the protestors were, where parents were signing up their kids for) and if they handed out condoms, advised on birth control, etc. And if he heard about Gerri Or Savita. These women and many others did not die just to have your mission make their deaths in vein. He kept reiterating that he doesn’t shame these women but he wants to generate a discussion. I said the only discussion there needs to be is between a woman and her doctor. Two other people joined in with me to discuss it, but I had to leave. I was just so tired of seeing shit like this, but I was glad to be the first one to take a stand.   EDIT: wow! Thanks for the gold! I can’t believe I gotten so much support ! But it’s not just me; speak for those who can’t or are going through something like this too"
Fred.,"The first time I met Fred, it was storming. I remember coming into the hospital in my scrubs, my first day as an intern, and having to track down a new pair of scrubs because mine were ruined from the rain. I spent a thirty-hour shift in wet shoes. 

Fred was always angry. My supervising physician called him Grumpy, after one of the Seven Dwarves. “Nothing makes him happy,” she said. So, needless to say, Fred wasn’t happy when a first year interning physician fresh out of medical school was assigned to his care. 

Fred was in the hospital waiting for a kidney transplant. As I read his chart, he seemed to be in perfect health—other than the fact that his kidneys were failing. Those were always the toughest cases; people randomly getting sick. Fred was lucky that his body was able to survive as long as it did without properly functioning kidneys. 

When I walked into Fred’s room for the first time, he immediately called out, “Who the hell are you!” before I could even open my mouth. I introduced myself in a robotic tone of voice (I was on hour twenty-four of this thirty). Fred let me have it. 

He threatened to call the attending physicians, the police, social workers—everyone. It didn’t help that I accidentally called him “Frank” due to a simple name mishap. 

I honestly felt like I was being hazed into becoming a doctor. Working with Fred was beyond difficult in the beginning. 

Fred was in and out of the hospital for my first year of internship, which gradually turned into a first year of residency. Somehow, I always got assigned Fred’s chart and responded to his (many) calls. 

The day we really connected was when I was cleaning one of his wounds. He had developed diabetes and was suffering from really nasty sores. He was in pain, but he didn’t want to admit it. He kept insulting me while I dabbed at the festering areas of skin. Against my better judgment, I snapped back at him. “Stop crying, Fred,” I said through gritted teeth. 

Fred had actually started crying, even though I didn’t know. He had tears running down his face due to the pain. I was shocked when I realized, and then a little embarrassed. He knew, because then his face immediately turned into this stupid grin. 

It’s not like Fred was nice to me after that, but he did change. We began to have conversations when I would see him; he actually asked me how my day was, what “trouble” I was up to. He became a gentle nuisance, I’d call it. 

Over the years, Fred was in and out of the hospital. Mainly because his kidney failure had caused several other complications that made his new kidneys reject the transplant. He developed a lot of health problems that made him chronically ill with periods of improvement. 

One thing that happened while I got to know Fred was a reconciliation with his family. The more I got to know him, the more I realized how alone he was—and it wasn’t by choice. His family was very unsupportive. His children had stopped talking to him for some silly things he had done long ago in his life. He never got to see his grandkids, whom he loved without even knowing them. I pressured him to reach out to his grandkids—who are all grown. With a little more pestering from me, he reached out to them. They were so excited to hear from him. 

Fred watched me grow from an intern to an actual doctor. Last week, I finally finished my residency and was offered a fellowship at a hospital across the country. Fred had just returned to the hospital for a complication with fluid retention around his heart. I told Fred about my new offer before I even told my parents. 

When I walked into his room, the first thing I saw was his granddaughter sitting on his bed, showing Fred pictures of a family trip they had taken years ago. Since Fred had been exiled from his children, he had a lot of catching up to do with them. That’s how he spent his days. Normally, his grandchildren would stay there from when visiting hours began until they ended. Even, once, I noticed one of Fred’s children (who had “exiled” him) leaving his room. 

I told Fred my good news, and his thin face was honestly lit up with his classic smile. His grandkids congratulated me. Fred told them about the Christmas two years that him and I spent together when I was on-call. We watched *A Christmas Story* five times in a row on TV. Everyone laughed about that, including Fred. I was part of his family. 

After talking with his family for almost an hour, I moved to leave. Fred grabbed my hand and squeezed it so tightly. He told me he was proud of me. With a wink, he let me go. 

As I was walking away from Fred’s room, I heard his laughter travel up the hallway. It was deep and loud and full of life. 

Fred died this morning of a stroke. It was sudden, but we knew it was coming. His body was failing. 

He was surrounded by his family. 

Thank you, Fred. "
My dad turns 72 today,"Today I’ve been feeling strange. I’m really tense, I don’t wanna get up from the couch, food tastes gross, the only thing that’s making me feel normal is listening to Eminem (?). I realized why.

Today is June 11, my dad’s birthday. He’s a couple miles away from my home, living in a nursing home. He has dementia, doesn’t talk anymore, barely eats, and really isn’t, by my definitions, living. I’m only 18 [F], so my dad is old enough to be my grandpa, but he was diagnosed when I was 13. And man, I would do anything, literally anything in the world to get back the fucking great dad I used to have just five/six years ago. So fuck, appreciate your parents while they’re around. Please. Send them a card, give them a call, visit them, be nice to them. All if you can, of course.

I’m baking him brownies and going over to visit him soon. Good vibes.

[EDIT]: I’m 18F, just to clarify!"
You waited 19 years to tell me,"Im a happily married man for over 15 years. Things haven't always been rises but it's a good life. Wonderful wife, amazing kids... great job. I try to be friends with everyone. Even some of my enemies have turned into friends after a while. Still friends with some of my ex girlfriends and so is my wife. But I was not expecting you to say what you did a week ago. You were the one ex that never explained why we broke up. it just ended. This Ex-girlfriend informed me the other night that, 19 years ago, when she broke up with me that it was because of her grandmother pressuring her mother to make the relationship end because she couldn't deal with her daughter dating a 'dark boy'. She tells me that she has measured every guy she's been with up against me. She tells me how she had always loved me but was young, still living with her parents so had to abide. And now that we've been friends on Facebook for the last few years after years of no contact... You tell me that when you see pictures of my wife and I, you wish it was you.

You bring up places we used to fuck. Specific times long forgotten. How I was the only guy that's ever treated you right. After 19 years, you wait until now... When I'm vulnerable due to my wife's illness... To divulge this info.

What the fuck.

You've made it where I've had to cut contact. I didn't want to. I enjoyed our friendship. It was distant. But it was friendly. But it was a line that should not have been crosses. I'm not about to wreck my life... For a fantasy that could never be reality. If you wanted to make something happen, maybe you shouldn't have waited this long. You don't get to roll through, try and make me question my vows... My feelings... My life. You simply don't. 

So... Sorry if we no longer chat... No more catching up. You've closed that chapter for yourself. "
"Thank you, my love, for one last gift...","My wife died in August of 2013.  I was left devastated (emotionally, psychologically, financially… etc…).  Here it is, a little more than a year later, and her mother calls.  Not to pry, she says, but did we ever file for social security benefits for our youngest?  I knew nothing about such benefits.  No one ever told me, and I didn't know enough to even go look for them.  I thanked her and went to the social security office and explained what was going on.  Sure, says the lady.  ""Your daughter is entitled to significant compensation.""  What does that mean, I asked.  

About $40,000, spread out over four years.  $40,000 that's going into her savings account that I'll never touch.  $40,000 that's being used to pay for her college.  

My little girl gets to go to college.  My little girl gets to start her life after college not up to her eyeballs in crippling debt.  

Thanks, babe.  The last gift you gave us was a doozy.  Thank you, thank you, thank you. 

EDIT:  Front page and gold?  Wow.  Thanks guys.

It's freaking happening,"I don't know if this is an appropriate place to post this...but I have to get it out.

It was a pretty normal morning. Woke up, kissed my wife, got in the shower, got ready for a brutal commute to work. Wife stayed in bed, it's her day off, she was kind of just casually snoozing, woke up and headed into the bathroom while I was showering.

Got out of the shower, dressed, let the dog out, ironed my shirt, put it on, went back upstairs. ""Hey, babe."" ""Hi, morning!"" ...she was laying in bed.

Opened the medicine cabinet to get my toothbrush. There's some weird plastic thing sitting next to it. 

""What is this thing?"" Pick it up. Turn it over. Pregnant. PREGNANT. PREGNANT!

Toothbrush fell out of my mouth and hit the floor. ""Is this for real?"" ""Yes.""

I cried. She cried. Been trying for six months since we moved into our new house.

""...did...did you pee on this and put it next to my toothbrush?"" ""Yes, I'm sorry! I didn't know what else to do."" Laughed, cried, hugged...craziness.

I'm not allowed to tell anyone. It's still too early. I have to keep my trap shut until November...but I figured a bunch of anonymous people on the internet don't count...! Still in a fair amount of shock. Well into my 30s and been working my whole adult life to lead up to this moment...and it's finally freaking happening...!

tl;dr: it's freaking happening.

I listened to my instincts last night and got to say goodbye to my dog.,"My 14 year old dog has been very sick lately. I’ve had her since I was in the third grade. 

I currently live with my boyfriend about 30 minutes from my parents house. Last night at about 12:30 I got this gut feeling that I needed to go to my parents house right away. I wasn’t sure if I should listen to it or if it was just anxiety, but I told my boyfriend I was leaving and did. 

This morning, my beautiful girl decided it was time to go. 

I’m so heartbroken, but thank god I followed my instincts and had the chance to say goodbye. 

Thank you for 14 years baby girl. I’ll love you forever. "
My wife doesn't like our son,"So a little background. We have a six year old son who wasn't planned. While I was delighted my wife less so. She had a bad pregnancy, she basically stayed in bed for 7 of the 9 months. My son was born and she had about 6 months of Postpartum depression. 

My son has ADHD and is very attention seeking, which I blame on her sitting on her laptop or her fucking cellphone browsing facebook instead of interactiving with him. I accept that he is difficult to parent due to some of his problems, but he is a fucking kid and very nice and sweet. She is always short tempered with my son and yelling at him for minor things. I can see the crushed look in his face when she yell at him for disturbing her when she is trying to get stuff done. 

So last night she was upset, she blames all of her problems on where we live and how much she hate motherhood. So last night she confessed that she didn't really like our son and she is sorry that she had him

Well fuck you lady. I do love you but I love him more, and I am this close to walking out that door with my boy to save him from such a toxic home life. "
"Be brutally honest with your Ex if they are asking closure. Dont tell them lies out of politeness... If you cheated on them. If you never loved them. Tell them. Let them fix their ""radar""",You said you loved me... but you never wanted to move away from Cali for me. You did for your new boyfriend. Maybe you thought what we had was love. Maybe it was fake. I just wanted the truth. I wanted to understand what made you take that decision so quickly. If it hurts me so be it... but I need the truth.
3 years today,"3 years ago today I purchased my last bag of crack.  3 years ago today I made a promise to a man I thought I loved to get clean so we could ""be together again"".  I never in a million years thought that in 3 years this is where I would be.  With the most amazing man I have ever known (ironically not the same man who asked me to get clean).  Almost step mother to 2 of the most amazing girls I have ever been lucky enough to watch grow up.  Being a role model.  It's insane and amazing and I think for the first time in a long time, I'm actually really happy.

Edit:  I want to thank you all for the kind words.  I honestly wasn't expecting a response at all.  I was just feeling kind of proud of myself and had to get it off my chest"

I'm so in love.,"I'm literally so in love with my boyfriend/fiancee.

I feel like my heart is bursting right now , I suffer with a huge amount of anxiety and the fact that he still loves and cares for me on my darkest days makes me so so thankful.

Love is so so beautiful !  "
I've heard my parents having sex for 3 years at least 2 - 4 nights a week and it fucked me up mentally,"I'm 25 now and it all happened when I was 6 - 9 years old. My parents were poor and we lived in a very small apartment and although I was sleeping in a different room than they did, the walls were very thin and not at all soundproof. I remember the first time it happened. I woke up to these strange noises. It was my mom and she was moaning. It was weird and surreal. I wanted to get up and ask if she's alright, but I somehow knew that she was enjoying it. I remember getting under my sheets, covering my ears and waiting for it to pass. It did and I went to sleep. Only to be woken up again the next night. And the next. And the next. And the next. Sometimes I didn't even fall asleep, because I was too afraid and anxious of what's going to happen. I would end up just lying there for a few hours until they started it and finished it while I was silently crying into my pillow. At first I've tried grunting and turning to indicate that I'm not sleeping so they would stop, but even if it did help, they would resume it 10 minutes later thinking that I'm finally asleep. I remember plucking up my courage and trying to speak with my mom during the day, but it was futile. I've explained that I heard noises and I've lied that I was worried something is happening to her and she just told me that I'll understand it all once I grow up. I longed for the nights when my parents had night shifts, because it meant that I will be able to sleep normally. After a few years my reaction to it kept getting worse and worse. I would cry myself to sleep, I was thinking about running away from home and I remember I once even touched myself to the sounds of my parents having sex, which is so fucked up I find it hard to even type it out. It finally stopped when my parents got better jobs and were able to afford a bigger house, but the damage was already done. On top of that, during Christmas, when I was about 11 years old, I was sleeping in my grandmas house and I actually heard my grandparents having sex. It happened just once, but it still leaves me astonished of how unlucky I was. This experience left me with a horrible misophonia (hatred of sounds) that effects my quality of life in so many ways. For example, I can't sleep if it's not extremely quite. Even the tiniest sound will wake me up and trigger an anxiety attack. I can't live with roommates, I can't open my window at night and I can't live in any places that have traffic outside the window. And the worst thing about it is that even though my parents are good people and they love me, I feel like I have this hatred towards them which I will never be able to get rid off. This is the first time I've typed this out to anyone."
Being Alive is Exhausting.,"I'm so tired. So much bad in this world. So much bad in my life. I just want to be done. 😪

Killing myself is expensive.,"A few weeks ago I tried to commit suicide by jumping off a bridge. I was rescued and taken to a hospital by an ambulance where they gave me some resources for therapy.

A few weeks later and now they’re sending me a bill for $2500. I don’t even have that much money in my account. I didn’t even have a choice to go to the hospital or not, the police made me.

Now I’m stuck with a bill I can’t pay and because of that bill, I can’t afford to go to therapy. I should’ve jumped."
I am no longer a Trump supporter,"As a daughter of a Marine and Vietnam Vet, granddaughter of a WWII vet, and cousin of a Marine who served in Iraq, I'm trained to study history and watch/read the news. People in the military these days aren't your average bear, since only 1% of the country serves. I can accept the multiple deferments but the disrespect towards a Gold Star family, former POW, and joking about how easy it is to get a Purple Heart shows he clearly does not respect the military. His lack of foreign affairs, questions about the lack of using nuclear weapons and proposing torture should frighten every American, especially those people of draft age. He seems like the kind of person who would not lose a minute of sleep sending your family member off to war."
After 8 years I finally finished my bachelor’s,"It’s been a close kept secret that I hadn’t finished my degree. I walked in the graduation ceremony in 2014 because I had enough credits, but my gpa wasn’t sufficient and I hadn’t finished all of my courses required yet. My 4 years on campus were really difficult as I struggled very hard with depression. Luckily, the university worked with me by refunding most of my tuition and let me withdraw from classes instead of failing me. I transferred to the online campus, but continued to struggle so I took 2-3ish years off. 

I restarted my course work in 2017 and five minutes ago I submitted my last assignment. All of the graduation requirement check boxes are green and now after the most difficult years of my life, I finally have my bachelor’s. "
My conservative father met his gay cousins life partner and adopted child for the first time.,"Last weekend extended family came into town; my fathers cousin, his life partner, and the child they adopted. We live in a southern state, very conservative family, and they are from California. We were instructed not to talk about politics or anything.

I was having dinner with my father last night and he told me ""Honestly, I was really unsure about meeting them. I never liked to idea of two people of the same sex raising a child together. But that little boy....I don't think any two people could give him as much love and attention as those two men do. After seeing a family dynamic like that with my own eyes, I really don't see anything wrong with it. I don't think there's any way that they could 'turn him gay', or that anything bad could come from that good situation. It surprised me"".

I couldn't be happier or more proud. "
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT!!!,"I know it's not your typical off my chest, but we've been trying for awhile, with at least two miscarriages this year. We're just so damn ecstatic, but with it being to soon to tell our families we had to tell someone! "
"Dear Hulu, fuck you, your commercials, your half seasons, and your punitive 30 minute wait when I forget my password... seriously you are not a bank you are a video streaming service. I unsubscribe.",That is all.
My husband might die for nothing,"Three and a half years ago I met my perfect match. This tall funny smart man who could tease me out of my  overly serious mindset. And who made me, who had never even had a crush before, fall head over heels for him at first sight. We got married a year ago last month, it was the happiest moment of my  life. 

And now I'm sitting here sobbing while he texts me from his work. He is type one diabetic, the kind that happens when you are a kid, and he has a heart condition. With insurance and insulin and two pills a day he can live a normal life.  Now thanks to this new ""health care"" plan we might lose everything. I don't give a flying fuck about our house, my jewelry or anything. God I just want him to be ok. Having the man I love cry telling me that we might lose everything and I might lose him god it hurts.  

How can politicians be so callous? How can they value making the very richest people ritcher over human life? God I am absolutely sick to my stomach and there is nothing I can do. Nothing I can say to help my husband feel better. Nothing I can do to convince politicians that he is worth saving. "
Maybe there's a reason why many guys have crazy exes,"They stop communicating towards the end and let the relationship fade and crash due to their silence and apathy. They go completely out of character.

The female gets confused and tries to figure out what's going on. Tries to get his attention. Ends up looking crazy and indecisive about holding on and moving on*.





*Not all relationships obviously"
"My brother sang today. A year and a half ago, his wife and daughter were killed in a car accident. Since then, he's tries suicide and barely spoken. Today he sang.","He's been loving with me and my family. He usually just sits in his room and cries or stares out the window until his doctor appointments.

Last week, my husband brought his piano from his house. My brother has always been a singer/musician. 

When he first saw the piano, he just silently broke down and wept. Today, as my husband and son and I were sitting in the kitchen cooking doing homework and opening mail, we heard the piano start playing and he started singing.

I couldn't believe it until I looked at my husband and son and saw that they heard it too. We all ran to the garage where he was.

He played and sang dream when youre feeling blue, which was his and his wife's favorite song. 

It was so beautiful. The birth of my son, the day my husband proposed, and today are the days I'll never forget.

Listening to him and watching him was like seeing my brother come back from the dead and give a firm and hearty ""Fuck you"" to his depression. 

I wish to Christ I could have recorded it. It was so beuatiful. "
They just dropped her off at the door and left...,"I work at a large hotel chain, and just had the damnedest thing happen. I was sitting in the lobby, doing paperwork, when I saw a cop car pull up, a woman and her two small children got out, got a couple suitcases out of the back of the cop car, with the cop shining his little light at them, and then stood there for a moment as the cop just got in his car and left.


When she came inside, I got the full story. She had been the victim of domestic abuse. Her boyfriend had started beating her, in front of her children, and she had only just managed to call the cops and get the hell out of there. She had just moved up from Florida to be with this guy, she had no family in the area.


And the cops just dropped her off at the door and pulled away. 



Her boyfriend had taken her credit card. She had $44 to her name. Her cell phone was dead, and they hadn't allowed her time to get a charger from her house.



They didn't even bother walking her in....



We are a large, busy hotel. We had a whole 2 rooms available at that point. Our rate for the night was $179 +tax.... for all they knew, we had no rooms. She had no car, no money, no phone....


And they just kind of dropped her off, like someone bringing an end table to the salvation army store, and then pulled away.



We have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.... I told her to tell me that the air conditioning unit in the room was too loud. Once that had happened, well, she wasn't 100% satisfied... looks like she gets the room for free. I'm, sure my manager will love that, but whatever.


Fortunately we're a hotel, so if there is one thing we have in spades, it's abandoned cell phone chargers. So I got her one of those too.



I can't believe they just dropped her off and left, without a second thought. What the hell is wrong with them? What if we hadn't had the rooms? What if I hadn't been able to get her the room for free?



Some days I really lose faith in humanity.




**** UPDATE ****


I just wanted to take a moment to thank everyone for their kind words, and offers of support. You are all amazing people. Thank you so much.


I wanted you all to know that we were able to get in contact with her family, who were able to get her a place to stay, with family friends in the area, until she could figure out what her next steps were going to be. Our hotel works very closely with a local independent cab company, and we were able to get here there for no charge.



As far as all of your offers of support, truly from the bottom of my heart, thank you for sharing your kindness. Unfortunately, while I had no issue breaking some rules to get her a place to stay, one thing I cannot do is divulge any of her information, no matter how good the intentions, nor can I use the information which she provided in order to procure the hotel room, in order to get in touch with her for non-hotel business. I just wouldn't feel right about that.


Rest assured though, she has been looked after, and brought to a place where she will be able to safely stay, and be provided for, until she decides on her next course of action.


Thank you all again."
I am 100 days clean of selfharm,"And I’m so proud! It’s been a rough ride but I’ll get there. This sunday I’ll turn 22 and I’ve been struggling with my mental health since I was 9 years old but lately I’m making such progress in selflove and recovery. Never give up! 

Edit: wow guys, thank you so much for all the love and support, I never expected this this! I just wanted to share because only my so knows about my new milestone. I’m really touched by all of you. I try to reply to everyone and don’t be afraid to ask things! Whenever I’m feeling bad, I’m just gonna read all of your comments and messages. Much love for all of you! <3"
This past week...,"...I watched my husband go out of his way to pick up garbage left behind by someone else, to give money to a stranger very much in need, and today he suggested we put together some food to donate to hungry families. These things were unprompted by others and without recognition.  He does stuff like this all the time- on top of which he never fails to be kind to those working in customer service or misses a friend’s birthday or passes up the chance to help an animal in need.

I just want to say, HOT DAMN, I’M SO PROUD TO BE HIS WIFE!
"
"I [25, female, UK] am going to get fired for a stupid mistake","For the past two years I've been working at a bank in my local town centre as a customer service assistant. I enjoy the work and get along with everybody there and am hoping to build a long\-term career here.

However, last week we had someone from head office come over to our branch. This has happened a few times before and it's usually nothing to worry about. However, this time they decided to send someone from head office who already lived local to our branch. This turned out to be Alice, who unfortunately I have quite a lot of history with.

Alice and I went to school together. She's a lot prettier than I am, and she loved to remind me of it. Her and her friends made my life hell to the extreme. She once put a knife in my bag and told the teachers, and as a result the police were called \(I live in the UK where possession of a knife is treated very seriously\). They persecuted me right up to the very end of school and got away with it.

I'm not that smart and scraped through school with basic grades and drifted through a variety of odd jobs before ending up here. Alice, meanwhile, went to a top university and got on to one of those ''graduate fast track'' things and works at the head office of my bank. I wasn't aware of any of this until she showed up last week and one of my co\-workers told me she was the person we were expecting.

I was horrified when I saw her, but I knew I had to let it go. When she saw me she recognised me straight away. She came up and said hello and acted really friendly, and given how high\-up she was, I wasn't about to be stupid and risk my job just so I could dig up the past.

I resolved to be civil to Alice for as long as she was here, but the friendliness of her initial greeting soon wore off. She didn't say or do anything outright malicious but she was very cold towards me and made a few snide remarks \(for example a co\-worker said I was a hard worker, Alice responded ''pity hard work doesn't equal talent''\). I decided to grin and bear it because I knew she'd be gone soon and it wasn't worth proving a point to her.

My colleagues and I sometimes go on nights out and had planned to do so last Saturday. On Friday, my branch manager, Laura asked Alice if she would like to join us since it was her last day and she was local. Alice agreed and I discreetly tried to pull out. but Laura and my best work\-friend Kim convinced me to come along. I hadn't told anyone about my problem with Alice, though she'd mentioned to a few people that we were at school together.

Anyway, the night was in full swing. There was a large group of us so it was pretty easy to stay out of Alice's way. We all went to a club and had a great time to start with. After a long time dancing, I was hot, tired and pretty drunk, so went to the toilets to freshen up. Alice stepped in a few minutes after me, and she was obviously pretty drunk too. I didn't say a word to her, but she suddenly piped up, saying ''Now I remember why I was so horrible to you, 'cos you were a *\*\*\*\*\**.'' I ignored her but she kept giggling and pointing at me.

Once I had freshened up I turned to leave, but Alice started calling me ''fat'' and ''ugly''. I told her to shut up and tried to walk out but she stepped in front of me and started calling me some of the names she called me at school. I was furious but didn't react, until she said something about my mother \(who is disabled, which was something she used to taunt me about quite a lot\).

I punched Alice in the face, which sent her glasses flying \(she's worn strong prescription glasses all the time I've known her and apparently can't see anything without them\). She started panicking and crying. I regretted it as soon as it happened and I'm not heartless. I wasn't just going to leave her stumbling around blinded. I found her glasses for her but they were broken, one of the lenses was cracked, and this upset her even more. She started shrieking that she was going to get me fired and that my career was over. I was scared and ran out. I said a quick goodbye to my friends and went home.

I went into work on Monday and nothing seemed amiss. A few people asked me what happened with Alice, but she doesn't seem to have given a detailed description about what happened. The week so far has gone by as normal, and I was hoping nothing would come of my actions on Saturday. However, I received a message on Facebook yesterday evening which turned out to be from Alice. She sent a picture of her black eye and her broken glasses which said ''You're in trouble now''. Obviously she's pretty high up in our company so she could have me sacked in a heartbeat. I regret what happened and I think it might be better if I went to Laura and told her what really happened before Alice takes action. I shouldn't have hurt her.

It's just that I love this job. It's the first job I've had that I really feel passionate and fulfilled, and my colleagues are so welcoming and friendly. If I tell Laura what happened my job is gone. I can't believe I was stupid enough to let Alice ruin yet another thing for me.

I'm heading into work soon and am terrified I'm going to be pulled into the office and given my marching orders. I know that what I did was wrong and I deserve it. I can't believe I could be stupid enough to throw my life away over a moment of madness.

UPDATE: Laura called me into the office this morning and told me that Alice had contacted her saying that I'd acted violently towards her and instructing Laura to dismiss me. She asked for my version of events and I told her what Alice said and did leading up to that moment. Laura said she understands and that she's not going to fire me because Alice has no actual proof that I hit her, thus no grounds for dismissal. She's willing to keep a secret for me because it didn't happen at work and Alice doesn't work at our branch, so the issue is unlikely to be carried on. However, she warned me that Alice is high-up and has considerable influence/connections within the company and could make things difficult for me down the line. I'm safe for now but I'm worried about the future."
I want to tell people what I did,"I stopped someone from killing herself last afternoon. 

I was on my way to the gym (I usually go it the mornings, but slept in yesterday) and was driving onto an elevated freeway. At the top of the off ramp there was a young woman crying and looking over the side. She could have been a hitchhiker or just walking but I had a bad feeling and got right off the freeway.  I drove to near where the onramp was, parked my car and ran. By the time I got below the freeway she had one leg over the side. I ran faster. I ran in front of cars until I got on the on ramp. I ran until I was 20 feet from her. She had one leg over the side and the other was on it way over. 

I tried my best to smile and said hello. She wouldnt speak at first she was just crying. I asked if she was ok or if someone was trying to hurt her. She didnt speak so I kept talking. I told her my name. I said I wanted to help her. I will buy you dinner, what kind of food do you like. I will listen to you for hours and you can tell me whats wrong just please come down. She looked over the edge and I grabbed her arm. You are beautiful. I love your shirt and your hair. What is your name? ""Jane"" (name changed for privacy) Please let me buy you dinner. she kept crying And then I started just rambling about my dog ( I was so scared). I told her about how sweet he is and how he was so friendly and he loves pets. I told her I bet he would love you. 

Finally she agreed to let me buy her dinner and came back over the railing. I held her hand and we walked down the on ramp. There was a CHP officer waiting at the bottom. She started to get scared and wanted to go back. I made her look at me and I swore I wouldn't leave her side. I would stay with her every step of the way. I spoke to the officer and sat with her while another officer showed up. They asked what happened and Jane had me tell them. They had to take her to an ER and wouldnt let me sit with her in the squad car so I followed after I gave her my name and number. 

At the ER she was poked(for blood) and questioned and x rayed. She asked that I stay with her through all of it. I listened as I found out her history. Rape, loss of a child, abusive relationship (back injury from bf throwing her down stairs), in and out of foster homes. In between doctors and nurses we chatted. I showed her pictures of my dog and we talked about childhood pets. We talked about our favorite salads. About silly things. Once about God.  She told me about the man she was scared of. The reason she was on the bridge. He had threatened her family because she left him. She thought if she killed herself he would have no reason to hurt them. She loves her family and spoke with great pride about their jobs and her niece and nephew. She loves animals and children. She said one day she wanted to have a job to help foster kids have a place to go to be safe. and so they wouldnt get into trouble. She spoke about being at a group home and helping with the little ones that came in. About a three year old with rashes from neglect (being allowed to sit in his own waste for long periods of time). ABout kids being abused and feeling like they had nowhere to go. She said that after she was raped she felt like she was a target because people knew she had been vulnerable. 

We spoke for hours. I left when the nurse brought in a bed for sleeping. I asked her to call me when they sent her to a new hospital and I will bring her dinner. I promised her on that bridge I would buy her dinner.

The whole thing is surreal. I had no idea what I was doing. I was barely keeping a smile on my face, I was so scared she was gonna jump while I was right there. I wanted to cry. I wanted to cry when she told me about the abuse. I hugged her but I wanted someone to hug me. 

I want to tell people what I did. I want to tell them how scared I was and how she opened up to me afterwards but wouldnt say more than two words to doctors and nurses. I want to say, I think I saved someone's life. I feel proud. I feel happy. It happened last night on the way to the gym. I listened to my gut and I stopped my life to help a stranger and she is safe now. 

edit: THank you all for your kind words. They mean a lot to me. My closest friend is also a coworker and after I told her privately she convinced me to speak to my supervisor and ask for the day off. I am still very shaken and emotionally drained. I keep replaying what happened over and over in my head. I feel anxious. I will update you all when I have more news about how Jane is doing. She is a sweet woman who has had a very hard life. The world is a better place with her in it"
My wife and I always lie to hotels that it's our anniversary.,"My wife and I do this thing where whenever we book hotel rooms we also email ahead and tell them that it's our anniversary. We always find it funny at the time, but most of the time the actual results are often embarrassing for us both.

The most recent time on arrival in our room they had made a small cake with handwritten ""Happy Anniversary"" on a slate, returning to our room later in the day we had a hand written message from the manager congratulating us with a bottle of champagne.

Later that evening after thinking that would be all the bar manager came over with two glasses of champagne and the whole bar clapped for us, this was probably the most uncomfortable I've ever felt.

Would we do it again? Hell yes, does it get any easier....not really."
Can I just brag about my brother for a bit?,"So I'm going to college in a different state soon and I'm really excited - it's the college I always wanted to get into for my passion, which I'll have a great chance of making a career out of if all goes well (though I'll try not to get ahead of myself). I'm also happy with my life, comfortable with who I am, and constantly trying to improve myself. None of this, and I think nearly every positive aspect of my life, would be possible without my brother Eric.


For context - I'm currently 18, he's 22. There's a four, almost five year gap between us.



So, I was born in a Conservative town full of Conservative people. This included my parents. And my childhood was a little rough - mom and dad liked a drink, occasionally a fight, money was tight. I was also a bit of an outcast - I didn't have alot of friends, I had slightly weird hobbies, and I was socially awkward. I know, great combination for a successful social life. But Eric was always my best friend - he encouraged my hobbies, would spend alot of time with me, and even gave me money and gifts from time to time (he always did odd jobs where we lived) which meant alot, because my parents kinda spent every penny on booze. He'd also wash my clothes, cook, and clean the house as best he could when our ""housewife"" mom didn't bother. He'd also encourage/help me with studies, which my parents didn't bother to do. Looking back, he also seemed to be the barrier between me and my parents in terms of physical abuse, and I probably would have been bullied at school if he hadn't been around.



So, yeah. Essentially, Eric was basically the best parent I had growing up.



So, you can imagine little old me being heartbroken when at 14, him having just turned 18, he left our shitwreck of a house, a run down old apartment in a terrible neighbourhood being preferable to him should tell you how bad our household was. Just before he left though, I was going through some shit - a bit of cyberbullying, self-esteem issues, and to top it all off I could no longer deny that I was a lesbian. He was my closest confidante, and the only person I felt like I could talk to.


I came out to him. Tears in my eyes, shaking all over, I came out to him. All he did was hug me, reassure me that I was his sister and he'd always love me and who I loved was who I loved. That might seem a little cringey on reading but honestly that was all I'd wanted to hear for so long. It was such a good feeling just to be able to open up to him.


But he moved, and for a few months my life was shittier without Eric around. He'd taught me to be fairly self-sufficent by that point and I thought I'd kinda grown impervious to my parents constant negativity and BS by then, but being alone in the house with them just became overwhelming and I was so stressed about everything all the time. I didn't see Eric much either because he was working alot, and sorting his new apartment out and was just busy, basically.



I came out to my parents the day after my 15th birthday. Like I said, Conservative people from Conservative backgrounds - you can imagine how well it went. I got screamed at, shouted at, accused of faking this to hurt them or get attention. Things got thrown at me, I got chased up to my room where I got barricaded in and just cried. I'd thought something like that would happen, but it just hurt so much at the time.



My mom was shouting and screaming for a while. Then I just heard - ""WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU KNEW!"" and I panicked initially but then I remembered - I'd told Eric already. And it's weird to say, but I just went calm and it might have bèen a little delusional but I thought I knew what was about to happen.


And it did.


Eric showed up in his gf (at the time)'s car about an hour later. I heard him screaming my parents down at the beginning, and when I ran to the stairs to see him he told me to get my things, I was going to stay with him. And that was basically it - I loaded up a rucksack full of things and ran out the door. He stayed behind to tear our parents apart while I sat in the car with his gf comforting me.



I started to live with Eric and it was just... awesome. I actually looked forward to getting home for the first time. I was living with my best friend. Things were organised, clean (or, cleaner - we were 15 and 19, cut us some slack). Eric gave me the bedroom, while he slept on a foldout  (I felt bad about that, but he always insisted). I had my own space, stuff. There were responsibilities, but we had gotten so good at dividing them up when we were young anyway that it was no issue. Eric basically murdered himself with shifts to keep the two of us going, so much so that I had to convince him a part-time job at 16 wouldn't bring my grades (which, funny enough, bumped higher when I moved in with him) down.



But more than all of that, it was just great to have someone who was there for me. Did I feel alone? No, because my brother was always there for me. Was I scared? Very, but he'd help me overcome it. Same went for confusion. Encouragement, compassion, guidance, he gave so much. He was a one-man safety net for me. And without that net, I probably would have plummeted into a pit a long time ago.



I love my brother so much. For all the things he's ever done for me, and for all he means to me. I want the world to know people like him are out there. I think every person should have an Eric in their life. Especially someone who's scared and confused and worried like I used to be."
A woman paid for my ramen noodles at the dollar store because she thought I couldn't afford them,"The truth is I didn't want the item.

My daughter and I went to the dollar store a few months ago, as I was about to pay I noticed I had picked up a brand that I don't like so I put them back along with a six pack of bottled water.   

I pay for my daughter's little toy and we leave the store. As I was backing out in my car she runs and stops me to hand me noodles and the pack of water bottles and says ""I got you these!"" I was surprised so the first thing that came out of my mouth was ""why??"" She then says ""because you put them back"" I said thank you and she runs off to her car. 

A couple months later I still think about this, I can't believe a stranger did this for me and I wish I could've been nicer instead of in shock."

*Edit:*
 thank you to all the encouraging words in the comments, and for some of you guys things are not great. For some of you guys, things are downright awful. Just know that I believe in you, and you can do it. I don't care if it's the fight of your life and you have the slightest chance of succeeding, I believe in you because you are a human being, and we sometimes forget that human beings can be amazing and do amazing things. It definitely won't be easy, but I believe that you can get through it and there will be happiness for you once the fight is over. You are all stronger than you know.

And it's okay to be proud of the small things. Cleaned your desk? Good job! Took out the trash? Well done. Went to work anyway even though you really didn't want to get out of bed? Damn you're my hero. Let yourself be proud of what you have accomplished, because I finally did, and it's the best feeling ever and makes me want to accomplish more. 

I know that it certainly isn't over and there's still a lot of work ahead of me, but one thing I thought of recently that keeps me going: if my parents and friends can be so awesome and are still hanging around and care for me, then hey I must be pretty awesome too."
I just waited 45 mins at a traffic light that wouldn't turn green,"Tried everything I could think of multiple times to get it to turn and it wouldn't. I couldn't turn with it red because there was a camera at the intersection and I didn't want a ticket in the mail. After 10 mins I called the township police station and asked how long I have to wait until I can go. She said I can't no matter how long, it has to be green or i'll get ticketed. She said give it a few more mins and see what happens. It was red for 10 more mins while I was in the phone with her. Then she said she had to dispatch an officer to come direct traffic so I could turn. I told her there was no traffic and I hadn't seen another car the entire time I was in the phone with her. She said it didn't matter. Then waited 20 more mins for an officer to come ""direct"" traffic for me aka wave me out in view of the camera. Im pissed.

**edit** lots of people are asking why I couldn't turn around and go another way, to answer your question I was on a road that leads out of a development so it was the only enterance/exit"
experiencing tolerance when i was 13 years old,....
I delayed suicide for over years just to see one movie,"Everytime I thought about harming myself, or killing myself, I'd stop myself because I wanted to see this one movie first.

I've been a lifelong Godzilla fan, so I decided to not kill myself until after this new movie came out...

The movie ended up sparking that childlike joy inside of me that I had long forgotten, and now the thought of comitting suicide seems silly to me.

I know it seems pathetic that I delayed suicide for Godzilla of all things, but I'm glad I waited. Because the movie changed my mind."
I thought it was just hot out.... NOPE!,"My town has had some pretty uncomfortable heat for the past couple days, so when I got in my car I cranked the AC on high.  Now, since it's an older car the AC isn't the best so I began to sweat.  I'm a bald man and I could feel the sweat running town my head and my neck.  I could feel drops of sweat running down my ears (?) and on my cheek.  Wiping my head, I turned onto the interstate.  My AC is good for knocking a couple degrees off the outside temp, but I just couldn't stop sweating.  I looked in the mirror to see how wet I was, and that was when I noticed that it wasn't sweat running down my head.  

At 65mph I discovered that apparently a nest of baby spiders had hatched in my car over night and now covered my head, neck, ears, and face.  

My screams sounded like a car alarm."
I wanted to brag about my wife a little bit,"I'm sorry if this is the wrong forum for this, but I have posted here a few times about my wife so I felt this was appropriate.

If y'all will indulge me, I'd like to brag on my wife a little bit.

Tonia, my wife, passed away on March 10th of this year due to severe head trauma caused by a car accident.  We never had kids, but we always wanted to.  Her functional organs were donated to save the lives of four people: her liver saved an 8-year-old boy here in Texas, her pancreas saved a 46-year-old woman in Indianapolis, and her kidneys saved a 58-year-old man in Texas and a woman (age and location unknown).  While I struggle daily with her loss, it brings me great comfort to know that my wife's caring legacy lives on in others.  I hope to get to know the four donor recipients so that I can tell them about the incredible woman that my wife was.

EDIT: I would like to piggy-back off of the response that this post received to pass along the following information.  I have had a few people reach out to me asking how they become an organ donor.  I only know for sure about how to do it in the US, so if someone could chime in about how to do this in other countries, I would really appreciate it.

I got rejected from the University of Oxford today.,"I applied to study languages, I was offered interviews and went through a 5 day long interview process, where I met dozens of wonderful people. I got to talk to some of the most intelligent people I have ever met and was absolutely blown away. I fell in love with the city, the people, and more than anything the university itself. Today however, I opened my email and found the rejection letter.

My aim now is to take a gap year, volunteer abroad to improve my language skills and gain experiences, and reapply next year. I understand that people are going through much worse in their lives in comparison, but I don’t know. It still stings. I feel like I was given a small taste of what my life could have been in like in those 5 days, and now that opportunity has been taken away from me, through no one else’s fault but my own. Next time I will try harder. And I will be better."
My wife is missing and I'm freaking out,"My wife, her mom and her best friend took a day trip today and they were supposed to be back to her friend's house 6 hours ago.  They haven't made it back yet.  We have called the sheriff and he is out looking down a road that google might have sent them on near where their cell last pinged, but I likely won't hear anything for hours.  She's my very best friend and has been for over 20 years.  I'm puking from just the thought of being without her.  Not dealing with it well at all.  They're in another state so I feel so helpless.  I don't even know how this is going to help except I feel like I need to vent.  Pray for them if you do that sort of thing. I need her and so do our four children.

Edit: They were just found, stuck in their car in mud and snow in freezing weather, but apparently all is well.  I'm ugly crying now.  

Update 2: I was able to talk to her and by the time I did, I was thankfully past the blubbering.  Seriously not fun.  Thankfully they did the smart thing and stayed in the car in which they were fairly well prepared, they at least had some food, water and warm clothing.  This was near the Grand Tetons and the worst part for them, other than being a bit uncomfortable, was that they were sure that we were freaking out, which we totally were...  Temperatures were in the low 20's so thankfully they had plenty of gas and turned the car on for a few minutes every 30 minutes or so but they were stuck there for nearly 12 hours.  I will be sending some feedback to google so that hopefully this might not happen again as it doesn't mention a thing about it turning gravel and then dirt.  Unfortunately they weren't in our car which had better off-road tires and the GPS tracker that I took from my teenager's car for the trip or it might not have been such a lengthily ordeal.  The crazy thing is that I wasn't worrying as much about her being gone as I was about her suffering somewhere from cold or being lost from a small hike or a grizzly attack or something.  The feeling of not being able to help was overwhelming, I'm sick just thinking about it.  I had a very large painful reminder of how much she means to me, good to reflect on coming up on our 20 year anniversary.  "
Im a grown woman and I just shit my pants,"I'm very drink at the moment. And it kind of just happened... I thought it was a fart BUT NOPE. I always hear on the internet that adults do it but I never thought it would happen to me. But SUPRISE I just shit me pants



That is all


Edit: Well everyone I'm awake and sober. I thought about deleting the post but then I thought ""fuck it"" I'll let drunk me have this one. "

I fucking DID IT!,"Today marks the day I am 6 months clean of Diet Pepsi.  I honestly don't care if its not a ""hardcore drug"", its addictive as shit. I was drinking up to 2 damn liters of it a day, and by no means is that even SLIGHTLY decent.  I have tried so many times to quit before but never have come this far.  Just wanted to put this accomplishment out there. Today is a good day.

Edit: Honestly, thank you all for these positive vibes and support.  I truly appreciate it."
I shot a mentally handicapped woman yesterday.,"I know Reddit has a thing against cops, but I just need to get this off my chest before it all blows up in my face, hence the throwaway. But I never in a million years thought this shit would happen to me, man. I'm fresh out of the fucking academy, just at the end of August.

Like the title says, I shot a mentally handicapped woman today. I was just talking with a tourist asking for directions when a woman comes up to me, demanding that I tell her where the library is. I point it out to her, after all, it's a god damn block away. Something struck me as odd on this one, almost as she was a schizoid or something. I talked to her for a few minutes afterwards, answering random questions and I got that persistent feeling that this woman *just* *wasn't* *right*. 

I'm no psychologist but she kept playing with her hair, almost to the point of nervously tugging it out. And kept telling me her fantasy about playing God with me. It creeped me right the fuck out, so I politely excused myself after another minute long tirade of hers and began walking back to my patrol car. 

That's when the shit started. This went down almost like in the movies now that I remember it. I had taken about ten steps when I heard some people to my left across the street begin screaming bloody murder. That's when I heard the gunshot. 

It felt like a god damn eternity before anything happened after the shot, but I do remember the feeling of getting punched in my lower back, just to the right of my spine. I stumbled forward and hit the concrete like a ton of bricks. 

I guess with the adrenaline kicking in, I was able to turn myself around and lo-and behold there's this crazy chick advancing on me with a fucking glock in hand, screaming at me more about some delusions of her being God. 

I panicked, Reddit. I feared for my fucking life. So as fast as I could, I pulled out my firearm and I shot her. I put just one in her stomach as fast as I could. 

She didn't go the fuck down. She kept advancing on me like some homicidal maniac. I can still see that fucking gun of hers with that barrel pointing at my fucking face. 

So I put another two shots into her, and she finally went down. I stood up and kicked the gun away from her and turned her over. She already had 3 gaping holes in her shirt and I couldn't find a fucking pulse. 

I blacked out. I honestly don't remember anything else, other than the feeling of pure terror. Backup said I was doing half-assed CPR on her when they got there. 

I forgot everything. I forgot to radio for backup, to call in for shots fired. I forgot everything in pursuit to save my own skin. And she died at my hands because of that.

I'm sorry Reddit. Please don't think less of me. I have no family and barely any friends I can tell this to. I just needed to say something. 

Edit: This blew up. Thanks to the stranger who got me gold. 

as an update to how i'm doing personally: I'm seeing a therapist now, and I've calmed down. My sarge gave me some time off work to get things settled and get my mind in order. Doc said that the bullet went through soft tissue, though I am going back in for a checkup in week to see if there's any side effects or problems with bleeding internally, but he said they were able to stitch me up. Bullet came only a few inches from my spine, which I think is the next scariest thing. 

I was interviewed the other day about what happened. I guess for whatever investigation they're doing. Apparently the lady had a mental history, they didn't tell me what, and just that she was on suicide watch. I've been told I'm a hero. But I honestly don't fucking feel like it at all. I'm just glad I'm alive, and wish she was too, she needed the help. I found out yesterday that she was pronounced dead at the scene. I hit her stomach on the first shot, her heart on the second and her sternum on the third. I'm not proud of what I did, but I'm seeing someone to talk me through this.

Above all else, I just miss my mom. Thanks for all the wonderful support guys, as a long time lurker, you guys helped me change my views about how I thought Reddit thought of officers. "
I just found out I am not dying!!!!!!!!!,"I had a 50% chance of inheriting the illness that put my mother in a nursing home at 39 and killed her at 49. I just got the test results back and I'm negative!!!! I get my life back!!! I can date again! Maybe even get married and start a family!!! I get to start a 401k or go back to school!!!! This is the happiest day of my life and I just had to share it with someone. I hope anyone reading this has a wonderful beautiful day :) :) :)

Edit: oh wow, top post! Thank you so much for all your love and support!! I hope you all find peace and happiness in this life like I have :):) and always make sure to check your genetics before having children! Haha"
"Because of me, my wife posted something to mildlyinteresting, and she got bullied for it because apparently it is posted often. Due to this, she decided she was never going to post to reddit again, so I anonymously gilded her post platinum and pretended it was the reddit fairy godmother.","I’m newish to reddit, so forgive me if my terminology is off. Also, please forgive me if this is not the right sub, but she follows the confession sub. The story is that we had just returned from the Mayo Clinic in MN. She came with me to visit a specialist there for my recently diagnosed rare blood disease. It was right before the polar vortex and our plane out of MN was delayed and our flight back to OH was delayed. It is 2am, we’re exhausted, and we’re waiting for our luggage, which actually never showed due to the delays. I went to the bathroom and I saw a sign in the bathroom that I genuinely thought was mildly interesting. My wife loves reddit and I wanted to give her the chance to post something, so I ran back to her and said “Hey! There is something mildly interesting in the bathroom, you should post it!” She went to bathroom, agreed, and posted it. Well, apparently it’s posted very often. I guess we didn’t know because these kind of posts are flagged immediately and taken down. Anyway, a few trolls were kind of mean to her about it. I felt awful because I know how much she loves reddit and it was me who convinced her to post it. So she basically says that she will never post on reddit again, which breaks my heart. My wife had just traveled to -20 weather, held my hand while I got a bone marrow biopsy, took care of me while I recovered, and is genuinely the most amazing person on the planet. And these trolls got to her because of me. They weren’t abusive but they still went out of their to shame someone who posted something they genuinely thought was interesting, even if the rest of the world had already seen it. This is especially crappy because it would be hard to know that since these posts are taken down immediately. So I spent the money (also happy to support reddit because I love it too) and I found her post and I gilded it platinum. Her first gilding. Then for the last few weeks I’ve had to playfully taunt her and pretend it wasn’t me so that she believed that posting to reddit wouldn’t always be like that. I asked her to show me the lounge and keep asking her who she will gild. She said she is going to pay it forward and gild someone who tried and nevertheless failed

So, joonbug, if you see this, forgive me but I love you and I’ll do whatever I can to be worthy of your love, even if that means something as silly as stealthily gilding your unpopular post. To the rest of reddit that just scrolled by her not mildly interesting post, thank you. 

To the jerks who were mean to my wife for literally no reason, and all the others who just troll people for no reason, fuck you. You kill creativity when you shame people for trying, so doubly fuck you. "
"My brother killed himself, but wanted me to thank you all","http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1xwouf/i_think_im_going_to_kill_myself_when_i_get_home/

My brother James posted this a few days ago, just before he committed suicide. All he left me was a short note and a link to the post on his laptop.

""I'm sorry little brother. Sometimes life is just too much for people, and even though I hope you'll never understand what I mean by that I do hope that one day you'll be able to forgive me for this. You're an amazing person who will do great things one day, I'm more sure of it than anything. Don't let yourself become jaded just because the people around you stupid assholes, there's really awesome people all over the place (in fact there's some people on reddit I'd like you to thank for me) I love you so much, don't ever forget that little brother.""

It feels like my chest is being slowly torn apart right now. I honestly don't know what to say I just wanted to carry out my brothers wish. thanks for trying everyone"
This is the last thing I'll be posting online,"In the early 00's, I signed up for MySpace, and did hardly anything with it. It died out. Life went on.

In 2007 I joined Facebook. In 2009 I joined twitter.

Now, it's 2018. After wasting literally years of my life constantly checking my phone and worrying about other people's lives, I'm officially done.

I had another reddit account but deleted it. This has been a last little hurrah. I told myself I'd be totally offline by the end of January 2018, and here we are.

My FB friends who are doing well make me feel like shit. My FB friends who aren't doing well are depressing in a different way. My FB friends who are never on FB seem to have their shit together the most.

Twitter is a fucking hellhole, a noisy bathroom where everyone is pissing everywhere and demanding to be heard.

LinkedIn is for sociopaths.

Reddit is a huge time suck too.

Since I got rid of Twitter and Facebook I've been a lot better, but it's not enough. So I'm done. While the world burns down I'll be looking at my family, not the latest post where some kid just  discovered that Steve Buscemi was a firefighter who helped out on 9/11. Off to write and hike and smoke weed and play with my family and watch baseball and swim and dance and not give a shit about anyone who isn't right in front of me.

"Despite all the bullshit thrown at my little brother, today he fucking made it.","My little brother has had some serious bad luck, some his fault and some not. Some consequences were little and some were big. 

He got fired from a job at a grocery store for eating one grape because they didn’t give him lunch breaks (kinda illegal).

He was sexually assaulted by a male manager but refused to consent and got fired (also illegal and immoral).

Some kid hit him and threatened to beat him up, so my brother said he would fight him one on one to settle the problem. The kid consented, and my brother beat him up. Unfortunately, the kids dad was a cop, and the kid said my brother sucker punched him. Because of the kids connections and our poverty, my brother got a felony conviction. That resulted in so many other problems. 

My brother’s friend brought weed in my brother’s car and forgot it there. Cops pulled my bother over and found the weed. More problems. 

During high school, he was in Special Ed and had a teacher tell him that he would amount to nothing because he had ADHD and could not focus well. 

Well, fuck all of that. My little brother, against all odds, went to school. He got his Bachelors, and then his Masters in the field he has loved since he was 5 years old. He chose a difficult field to break into - video game design. He struggled to find a job for so long but kept pushing and applying and learning and doing everything he possibly could. 

Today, that resilient, determined, good-hearted kid I call my brother finally got his break. He FINALLY got an offer to work full time at a AAA company to make the video game he’s been dreaming of working on. He’s ecstatic, and I cannot be more proud. Against all the bullshit and problems, he found a way to break through. 

I love you my brother, and I’m proud of you.

Edit: Thank you all for the kind words. This is why Reddit is the best! And thank you for the gold, I appreciate it very much!

Edit 2: After reading all of your comments, I decided to share this post with my brother. You guys are the best!"
my son's math team trip,"My son who is a senior in high school recently went on a math team competition at a university about 3 hours from here which involved an overnight stay last weekend. I get a call that a girl on the team and he separated from everyone else and went back to one of the hotel rooms, and she handcuffed him to the bed and was giving him a blowjob when they were discovered.

He's 18, she's 18 and I just do not give a shit. I'm honestly kind of proud of him. She's pretty good looking to be honest. 

I give zero fucks here. But the school is losing its mind. At first they tried suggesting she was a victim despite the fact he was handcuffed to the bed.

The school has been trying to figure out how to punish them in all sorts of ways. I threatened to get a lawyer and go to the media if necessary and pointed out they both are 18, and she was not a ""victim"" and things have calmed down a bit. 

Fucking stupid. 

Why the hell did this girl have handcuffs on the math team trip anyway? 

My main thought was ""why did something like this never happen to me when I was in high school?"" I didn't get any until college. "
Still in love...,"...after 30 years.

The woman I dated when I was 19 just reconnected with me on facebook. 

This isn't the first time we've reconnected. We've talked since then, write emails occasionally, and actually spent a week together a few years ago back in our old stomping grounds.

Today, I saw her facebook (didn't recognize her, because she goes by a different name in the country she's adopted) and my heart swelled to bursting. After all these years, ups and downs, multiple relationships, kids, her moving to another country, etc. She's no longer thin and young, (but she's doing better than me on that front!!!) and she's gone completely grey, but she's still shockingly beautiful to me.

Her eyes and her smile are unchanged. Holy fucking sheepshit. Tears of joy poured down my face at having this woman in my life. I've been really depressed lately, and I needed that.

No, I'm not looking to rekindle anything. She lives half a world away, and I'm not moving there, and I doubt she's moving back here. It was just a joyous experience to know that kind of love can last that long, even with little or no contact.

edit/update:

For  those who say that I need to buy a plane ticket, and try to start stuff  up, she has expressed zero interest in anything more than being  friends. Just because *I* feel a strong  love and attraction for her doesn't mean she feels the same way.  The  point of my post was that it just feels good to *have*  these emotions for someone that are so strong after all these years.  I  have no expectations that we'll be anything more than that.

Don't  get me wrong. The silly romantic side of me would love it if we ended  up together, but I'm realistic. I'm digging out of debt and depression  and supporting two of my adult children (one in college, one partially  disabled), and she's got her life literally on the other side of  the world from me.

another edit: Okay, so I checked and she's 1/3 of the way around the world (just short of 8000 miles). Nerd."
To the McDonald’s Drive Thru Girl,"You couldn’t be more than 20. It was a huge rush, around 7. I gave you a 20, the total was ~8.57. You gave me back 6.43. No big deal, I used to work at the drive thru in a Starbucks, where we made 8000+ days 5 days/week. I go inside and simply ask if I could have the remaining five. The attendant at the counter is flustered and looks scared. I tell her that “It’s not a big deal, these things happen”; she, replied with,”If she’s over or under 5, she can lose her job”.

She gets a manager. The whole process takes around 15 minutes, during which the drive thru girl goes to get drinks from the lobby soda fountain. She recognizes me and has a look of utter dread. A familiar, uncomfortable look on her face that I never wanted associated with me at any establishment. I’ve had that look many times — giving soccer moms who live in the suburbs absent problems their diabetes inducing ‘coffee’ for the day. 

The manager comes out. Again, not older than me, and probably under 22. The first words out of the manager’s mouth were, “I’m so sorry”. Really? This was the one part of my day where I could sit and think. I replied, “no no no, it’s a nonissue. I’m sorry that it took up so much of your time”. People shit all over fast food and service workers because they feel ‘better’ than them. Fuck those people. I NEVER will understand what compels a person to treat another like they’re ‘above’ them. 

To you, drive thru girl: I’m sorry. I hope you have a good weekend. "
I did it. I fuckin did it.,"I've been crying on and off for the last several hours because, this morning, at a truly ungodly hour, I got my emailed acceptance letter to my first choice law school. That was exciting enough as it was. I didn't even bother reading the whole thing until my dad asked me to send him a copy while we were on the phone. I started crying while I was still on the phone with him and when I told him why, he started crying too. I got a full scholarship to law school. To a nationally acclaimed, super selective, not quite Ivy but close school. This is everything I've been working toward for the last 8 years.  
  
So fuck you to everyone who discouraged me. To everyone who told me to not even bother. Who said there was no way. Who told me to just be grateful for what I have. My dad called me again after dropping off lunch to my mother at work to tell me she couldn't call me but she was crying and wanted me to know how proud of me she was.  
  
So fuck everyone who didn't support me or tried to tear me down or told me to not expect too much. Who made fun of me for spending all of my time in undergrad working or going to class and not going out. Who looked down on me for not having the money to party or survive without two part time jobs. I've made my family and friends and myself proud. I've busted my ass to get where I am, and I'll bust it again to get where I'm going. Just see if you can fucking stop me.  
  
Edit: Wow, holy shit this kind of exploded in a way I didn't expect. I really appreciate all the love and support. I definitely haven't had shit as hard as a lot of others have, but after six years in college racking up debt, and working a ton of different jobs that I could have easily gotten without my degree or that paid me way less than my degree was worth, this feels like the happiest day of my life. Knowing that I'll finally be able to move forward, and that it won't drive me even further into crippling debt, is such an incredible weight off my shoulders. Thank you guys, your kind words mean a lot."
I FOUND MY LITTLE SISTER'S FACEBOOK,"I haven't been able to see or speak to her since 2008. My dad cut off contact. I decided to see if I could find her and I did. I cried/fucking sobbed. I messaged her and was on pins and needles to see if she responded. She DID! She's so grown up and smart, gonna be a lawyer, going to ASU has a great lil boyfriend who runs track and is training for the Olympics and I'm just so fucking happy I keep crying and shit because fuuuuuck that was my other half my diary and my rock and I was so scared she wouldn't talk to me cuz of our dad. She's the same height as me and we both have the same hairstyle and she's so pretty.Everyone told me she would talk to me as soon as she was able but I didn't wanna get my hopes up. I just wanna ask her a million questions and hug her and cry and I really gotta get it off my  chest because I really thought I'd never hear from her again."
My 1.5-year-old cat died suddenly this morning.,"I was lying in bed early this morning, half-awake.  I heard one of my cats and called her, but she didn't respond.  I really don't know why I got up, because I usually wouldn't, but I stood and turned on the light and found my cat lying beside the bed.  At first I thought she was just resting, but when I when I spoke to her she was unresponsive.  Her breathing was strange, like she made a few heavy puffs, and when I looked at her I realized her eyes were quickly dilating and her tongue was sticking out.  She let out a final huff of air and went limp.  I knew she was immediately gone because this is nearly verbatim what happened when I had to have my senior kitty euthanized a few years back.  The thousand-yard lifeless stare, no breathing, tongue hanging out, no muscle movement whatsoever.

But this was an otherwise healthy cat.  She'd been spayed, had all of her vaccinations, was kept indoors.  She was behaving completely normally for the previous 24 hours -- I was even lying on the couch cuddling with her around  3-5 am when I woke up in the middle of the night.  The ONLY thing that was off was that she didn't touch her wet food at dinner time yesterday night, which is unlike her.

I've had this cat since she was 3 weeks old.  She was rescued by inmates, who told my mom the hawks typically scoop up kittens, so she brought her home.  She slept with me every night since she was a little thing.  I am home nearly 24/7 and spent almost every moment with her.  She was literally my fur baby, she was practically attached to my hip.  Or lap.  Or the crook of my arm.  She even had a way of talking to me in a ""mmrrrrwww?"" kinda way.  I loved this cat, seriously.

I have had cats my entire life.  I have never, ever had a cat just suddenly die in front of me.  Or just suddenly die period, without any obvious cause.

I haven't stopped crying.  I feel like it's my fault, that I was too dumb in the moment to attempt CPR, or do something, idk.  (I didn't even know cat CPR at the time, or even thought I'd ever need to know something like it. This happened in all of maybe 10 seconds.) She was either sick or she got into something she shouldn't have, I really don't know.

I know it's a part of life, but I feel like I've lost a kid. This little animal was one of the few things that made life a little brighter.  And now she's gone.  And I'm fucking heartsick.  I just keep crying and crying because she was just here, and now she's gone.

Edit:
Thank you to everyone for listening and for your kind words.  I've never experienced grief so overwhelming before, I've been sobbing off and on in bursts, and nowhere to put all these feelings.  But I feel a little less alone in it to have you here, to have listened, and to have been so compassionate.  Thank you for that. 

Edit 2: 
I did not expect this to blow up like it did. My heart is swelling with all of your love and condolences. To everyone out there who has lost a pet, unexpectedly or not, my heart is with you.

Last night, something dawned on my mom. She remembered when we first took Lily to the vet for her vaccinations that the vet listened to her heart and said it ""sounded off"" but this was common in Calicos because of genetics. I don't remember her making too big of a deal out of it, so we didn't either. Lily was our first Calico and I guess we didn't realize the risks they have genetically. So in consensus with what others have said, I really do think this was heart disease that led to heart failure. We can't think of anything else that would take her so suddenly and so FAST. It genuinely happened in a handful of seconds.
If you have a cat, make sure you get them checked out, the works. Apparently heart disease is the #1 cause of sudden death in cats. There's not much that can prevent it, but just knowing might help you to be more prepared and to cherish every moment a little more.

My heart will always have a special place for Lily, and all the love I had for her will always be here. I will love other kittens and cats who need it, because Lily taught me a kind of motherly love I won't ever forget. I've adopted a very sweet kitten from the shelter. She won't replace Lily, but my heart will always have room to love again. No name yet, I'll take any suggestions [she's a tortie!] but I'm going to take all this love I still have into giving her a better, happier life. 

Love to each and every one of you. ❤️ You've reminded me how kind people can be, and the importance of community. "
I was kicked out of the mall for the stupidest reason,"Throwaway because I don't want this to be on my main account

 I'm 17. Yesterday, I was babysitting my little sister and her two friends. They're all under the age of 6, so they were a bit busy, but I was having a great time. To entertain them, I took them out for lunch at the mall, then planned on seeing a movie, or getting them something at the toy store or something.

Well, turns out that some idiot who saw us walking around the mall decided that a teenage boy with three little girls is simply unacceptable. After we left the restaurant, I was approached by a woman, who seemed to be trying to usher the girls away from me. For their safety, I didn't let that happen, which only seemed to fuel her attempts to separate them from me.

She threatened to call the police if I didn't step away from the girls, and then tried to coax them out from behind me. They were getting frightened, so I wanted to get the hell out of there as soon as possible, for both my safety and theirs. I signaled over a security guard who was walking by, and tried to explain what was happening. Which was a little difficult, with the woman trying to speak over me and contradict everything I said.

I tried to explain to the guard that I was babysitting the girls, which they attested to, but that woman seemed to think I was abducting them, or grooming them for pedophillic desires. Neither of which are true in the slightest.

In the end, the guard asked me to call my mother and confirm that I was babysitting the girls. I told them multiple times that it was absolute bullshit that I was being required to do this, and that they were making me interrupt my mother at work.

My mom was just as annoyed as I was, for one that she'd been interrupted at work and for two that this whole scenario was even happening.

After all that, the guard told me that both the woman as well as me and the girls were required to leave the mall, or we would be forcibly removed. I had done absolutely nothing wrong, so I was pissed, understandably.

I brought the girls out to the car, drove to the other side of the mall, walked into the toy store, bought them some toys, and then left. Screw that security guard. And screw that crazy lady, too."
"I'm gay. My family and friends found out. I thought they would hate me, but nobody does.","I’m gay. I’ve known since I was a kid that I was different even though I didn’t know what gay was back then. When I got older and figured it out I kept it hidden. I went on dates with girls and pretended I was straight because I wanted to fit in and because I’ve never known an openly gay person in real life. My mom died when I barely a year old and I was raised by my dad. Now I’ve never heard my dad say something homophobic or anything like that but he is the epitome of a “manly” man. He works as a mechanic, plays sports and does outdoorsy stuff and home repair. He dresses in plaid and jeans when he’s not at work and while he does wash he is as far from a ‘metrosexual’ as is possible when it comes to grooming. My older sister, while she is tiny and looks very ‘feminine’, is in the military and is very rough and tumble. My older brother is exactly like my dad, they dress very alike and share the same hobbies. He works in construction and infrastructure. Now don’t flame me, I know gay people do these things, I’m just trying to show how I don’t fit in with my ‘manly’ family and how I feel like an outcast because I’m not like them even though I pretend to be. There is a gay club that I have always wanted to go to, but I would park across the street or walk up and down the sidewalk in front of it because I didn’t have the guts to go in even though I always wanted to.

Lately my dad, and to a lesser extent my brother and sister have been acting weird. My dad keeps mentioning gay people in the news without making a point and is being elusive. It has been really straining our relationship. I thought he suspected me I was gay and was upset. Last Friday he came over and was acting weird again. I couldn’t take it and confronted him. He was aloof and I accused him of not caring. He burst into tears and yelled that he ‘didn’t want me to kill myself.’ I am 23 years old and I have never seen my dad cry before, not over my mom, not when my sister graduated from boot camp or when my brother or I graduated from school. It just isn’t him. My ‘manly’ man dad wept in my kitchen and told me after hearing about all the young gay people killing themselves over the past year he has been terrified that I am going to do the same thing because I won’t talk about being gay and just hid it. Apparently I am not as good as hiding it as I thought because my family knows but didn’t say anything because they wanted to respect my privacy and let me come out when I was ready. But all this time my dad and siblings were so scared I was unhappy and suicidal. I cried with my dad in my kitchen. I called my brother and told him. He said “I know. And I love you”. My sister was out with some military friends and when I told her she yelled to everyone in the bar “My baby brother is gay and I love him!” I came out on Facebook and everyone was happy and supportive. On Friday my dad, my brother, my sister and my 3 best friends took me to the gay club I always wanted to go to. None of them mocked anyone, said anything hateful or complained about being hit on. My dad was pulled up on stage with a drag queen. They all danced. Everyone was celebrating the SCOTUS ruling. We all went to the PRIDE parade today as well. Today my grandfather called me. He is a retired Baptist pastor. He told me that if I ever married, he is coming out of retirement to perform the ceremony himself. I never thought this would happen. I thought everyone would hate me. But they don’t. They love me."
"My girlfriend's friend made me so angry, I changed my life.","Four months ago I was at a bar, while waiting for my buddies to arrive I overheard two of my girlfriend's friends, they we're going through their mutual friends and discussing those people sex lives.  

Well they got to my girlfriend and friend 1 goes ""she says he's pretty good"", friend 2's response was ""oh my God how? He's such a fucking squirly little weirdo"" she then went on to say a lot of other really hurtful things about me including that j spend all my time on xbox. this continued to the point that the first friend told her to stop and left soon after.  

I was...let's say, angry. I resisted the urge to say something to both my girlfriend or her friend. I confided in a good friend of mine who gave me the following advice: Be angry. Let your pride be hurt and channel it. Be better, showing her you can be better doesn't matter, she doesn't matter. But show the world you can be better.  

That's what I've been doing for the last four months, I've joined a gym and go four or five times a week, I'm eating better, working harder at my job, and most importantly I cut out alot of my gaming to spend more time with my girlfriend, and friends and to pursue more of my other hobbies. I'm in the best shape of my life, I've gone from being an ok employee to being moved to the fast track for a management position and I'm generally a happier person.   

A lot of good has come from a a woman I bairly speak to making a comment that bothered me more than it should have. I'd like to pass on the words that pushed me to be better in hope that someone else gets something out of this:
""Show the world you can be better.""
"
I'm engaged to the love of my life,"I'm a widower. I lost my beloved wife three and a half years ago. 

I've been a single dad since then. I lived for my daughter. I never ever imagined I would be with anyone ever again.

Then I met her. She loves me so much. I love her more. I have a new family. I have a new life. 

I am fucking thrilled. My daughter loves her. She loves my daughter. How lucky are we.

But wait, there's more. She's nine weeks pregnant. 

My wife was seven months pregnant when she died. I never imagined I'd have another child. A sibling for my child.

I'm an introvert and I hate parties. We're having a huge fucking party on Tuesday to celebrate. My fiancée is so excited. So is my child.

I'm fucking lucky. 

Nobody knows she's pregnant. Only you and me. I'm no longer suicidal. I'm fucking happy.

Thanks for reading.

"...I changed my birthday to April Fools as a prank, and my biological mother posted 'happy birthday' on my timeline.","...I've wondered my entire life about this woman. December comes, and on Christmas Eve, I get a friend request. I instantly accepted, knowing her name - I'd always been told she'd gone missing (I was her seventh child, she was 27 at the time. Do the math.) and trusted my parent's word. She drops me a message saying 'hey hon, its ur birthmom.' Are.. are you kidding me? I've been waiting my entire life, and that's what I get? Anyways, since then I've messaged her inquiring about her life with little to no response, and so I eventually broke the boundaries and asked her straight-up who my father was. Her reply was that she was 'at work' and couldn't talk. I messaged her over and over, but she just stopped replying. Last night I was chatting a friend, and we made a pact to change our Facebook Birthdays to April 1st as an April Fools Day joke to see the responses we'd get. What do I get? A serious looking message from my birth mother on my timeline, saying simply: 'happy birthday.' Fuck me.

edit: Wow, so.. I'm not really a big poster. But the few people that've left comments really hit me. So, if I'm gonna let that out, fuck it. I may as well rant a bit more, if anyone cares to read.

When I was younger, my parents now moved to this really, really rich, privileged, conservative town in California. There were like, 3 other adopted kids in my entire school system. And I remember telling people like it was no big deal, like 'hey yeah, I was adopted and stuff', and the other kids would react like I'd been shot 23 times and was going half-blind. But I'd always defend myself - 'no, no, my mother is perfect. I've seen a photo and she's gorgeous. She's so strong and brave.' so in December, finding out that the only reason she could send me a request was because she had gotten out of prison.. was disheartening. I was so angry. I told myself shit like, 'no, somebody planted those drugs. She isn't into that.' seeing as for her, her almost husband (who I thought was my father, but was told later that he had a condition that meant he couldn't have kids) had killed himself by purposefully overdosing on opiates.. a couple days before their wedding. And that's where I get my depression from. So her.. and drugs? No way. 

To continue the story, I was contacted by my grandmother while she was in prison, in about September. I found out all about my cool siblings - all the greatest bunch of people in the world. I remember hearing from my sister, the one closest to my age, and finding out how she's going to train with Cirque du Soleil, and has a successful modeling career. But unfortunately, she was the only one to be real with me: that my mother WASN'T such a great person. She'd abandoned all of my siblings in one way or another. She constantly fought with her own mother, who raised her children. I was then invited to go and meet them, and obviously, I took them up on the offer. 

I drove up to Humboldt County that September and got to meet people that kind-of sort-of looked like me (the lot of us had different fathers) for the first time. It was all so exciting. In fact, my siblings actually messaged me on facebook, saying 'Isn't your Birthday in September?' They remembered. And not the woman who was there on that day, shoving me out her uterus.

I guess what I'm trying to say is - it's so difficult, you know? To have to face up to the fact that she isn't even a hint of anything I wanted her to be. And maybe that's selfish of me. But to read these insightful comments, I do realize I don't need her in my life.. but it'd be nice if she gave a shit. I'm her daughter. And I'd like to know my father, whom she cheated on her almost-husband with (a very kind man, they met in rehab), in a hotel one night as the man apparently (we've no proof if what she told us is true) 'escaped because he was running from the police.' Seriously? What kind of story is that? Her mother/my grandmother believes the man was either just a bar stranger or a man running from murder charges seen around the area at the time. She also believes it was rape. What do I believe? That it feels so, so damn good to type this all out. Fucking thank you reddit. I underestimated you."
I'm taking my black knife and jamming it into my jugular after work.,"My name is Chris, I woke up today with a plan to commit suicide. I posted in this subreddit just as a way to voice my plan and get it off my chest. I did not expect the almost thousand PM's and the exposure this post got. I am not a troll, I was not looking for attention, I knew some people were going to say no, but the amount of replies was just overwhelming. I woke up dead set on leaving this day dead, but I didn't know so many people cared about what's going on in my life. Thank you, every single one of you, even the dicks. This is amazing and I love all you guys. I still have to face my problems head on and make a change because next time I may not post on Reddit.

I did it,"I'm just a junior in High School, and I know that my existence is sort of a whirlwind of hormones and planning for the future, but I actually managed to ask out my friend to Homecoming! I've liked her since Sophomore year. She's a amazing. She's beautiful, smart, and down-to-earth. And she said yes!"
I think I know what happened to my brother.,"I'm trying to write this in a way so that no one will be able to research and find out who I am (or my brother is). But it's the Internet and everyone's a super sleuth. 

My brother went missing years ago. And when I say ""missing,"" I mean that his case was declared one of those ""creepy unsolved mysteries."" It was on the news. I distinctly remember my parents interviewing for the news in our living room. 

I think I know what happened to him. 

I was very young when he went missing. I barely remember him, but I do remember that I loved him a lot. He would pull me around our block in a wagon. Most kids his age didn't do that. 

The days before he disappeared, I remember him staying home and babysitting me. I stayed in my room and played Nintendo 64. Throughout the day, a guy came over. I remember him. He was older, almost our dad's age. My brother made me go into my room whenever I heard the doorbell. 

Later, after the guy left, my brother would ask me not to say anything about the guy. With my brain only being focused on video games and extra dessert at that age, I agreed. I didn't care, nor did I comprehend the gravity of the situation. 

The day before he disappeared, I remember the older guy coming over. I was in the kitchen and remember looking up and seeing him kiss my brother. They hugged. They didn't care that I saw them. The older guy waved at me and I waved back, then I kept watching cartoons. 

I fell asleep on the couch and woke up to my brother whispering outside our front door. ""Don't worry, he's asleep,"" he said. 

The older guy said something I couldn't hear. Then my brother said something I couldn't make out, but I made out the words ""visit them"" or maybe he said ""visit him""? Either way, I know the word 'visit' was in his sentence. The man raised his voice and said no. Then I heard ""plan"" and ""city."" Then I fell asleep again. 

The next morning--the day he disappeared--my parents were at work. My brother was acting very strange. I remember he kept checking the clock. In the afternoon, I remember him picking me up and asking me if I wanted to go in the wagon. I was too hooked on Nintendo 64 and said no. He almost begged me and I said no again. Then he told me he had to run to our neighbor's house for something, I don't even remember what he said. I said okay. He reminded me to not open the door for anyone, only mom and dad. I shouted at him ""OKAY!"" because Super Mario was getting on my fucking nerves and he wasn't helping. 

He gave me a hug and told me he loved me and left. He never came back. 

All these years--decades--later and I think he was in love with that man. *I know* he was. The memories randomly came flooding back to me earlier, I'm not quite sure why. But it has been taking over my thoughts lately. I can't sleep because I keep thinking about it. 

I think my brother left with that man and they ran away together. Or maybe something worse happened. But I don't think that's the case. 

My freshman year of college, I was part of a sports team that got national recognition. I remember my team's picture was on ESPN and with our university's name. A few days later, I got mail at my dorm. It was a gift basket. I thought it was from my parents, so I didn't read the card. I threw it away immediately and ate what was in it, but it was nothing but candy. Nerds, jolly ranchers, Tootsie Rolls and Hershey's Kisses. I called my dad and thanked him for the gift basket and he said he didn't send one, neither did mom. 

Then I got to thinking: all of those candies were what I used to eat as a kid. Literally all I ate for the earliest years of my life were those candies. I tried to find the card, but I couldn't. Then I began to think about how my brother would wheel me in the wagon to the gas station close to our house so I could get candy after dinner, even though it was a punishable-by-death ""no-no"" from mom. 

Months later, during Christmas, I got an unmarked Christmas card. The only thing written on it was a :) smiley. Since then, I've heard nothing. No one I know sent that card. I have never responded. 

I wonder, every day, if he's out there. I have never told anyone this. When the police asked me what happened that day, I told them that he went to the neighbor's because that's all I remembered, honestly. 

It destroyed my parents. My mom became addicted to pain killers and my dad has had three extra-marital affairs (which, I know this tragedy is no way an excuse to cheat, but it sure didn't help). It has ruined our family, and maybe my brother knows what he did. Maybe he regrets it and knows he can't come back home. 

But if I could see him today, I would just want to tell him that he is always welcome in *my* home. I love you so much, brother. We have so much catching up to do. Please come home. *Please.*"
A stranger at my college made me cry today.,"I go to a very large state school in the Midwest. I still have no friends whatsoever despite tremendous effort. I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety about a month ago.

Anyway, having no friends I naturally eat by myself. I was eating in the main dining hall today as I usually do, no person sitting within 20 feet of me. Suddenly, a guy starts walking towards me. I started freaking out in my mind. ""Surely he isn't coming up to me, he's probably going to walk past me."" But he didn't. He shook my hand and introduced himself. My pessimism still persisted: ""he's probably going to try to sell me something or sign some dumb petition."" But he didn't do that either. He started asking me about what year I was and what I was studying. I couldn't believe what was happening. He told me he was a grad student and somehow we got talking about sports, which is my favorite thing to talk about. We talked about hockey and basketball, and he seemed so interested in what I had to say. I was actually having a conversation about my interests with someone I actually liked. I hadn't had that in so, so, long. After we talked s but longer he had to go. He said he and his buddies play basketball a lot, and I should play with them sometime. So he gave me his number and bid farewell. 

Right after lunch I went to my room. My roommate was there, but the moment he left I broke down in tears. This person made my month (school year, even) just sby simply initiating a conversation with me. I'm trying to keep myself together as I type this. This man gve me an indescribable amount of hope and happiness today. It reminds me that however depressed and even suicidal I am, somewhere out there there ARE people who want to get to know me. If people see someone eating alone, they feel the person maybe really odd or repulsive. But we just want to be talked to. Even if we are very introverted we still want company and friendship.

Thank you, random grad school stranger. Thank you so much.

EDIT: wow, front page!! Thank you for all of your replies/advice. It means a lot. And thanks for the gold! wow!!!

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with him. I thanked him and We are going to play on Wednesday afternoon."
"Dear Stranger, I smiled when you cried...","Yes, young 20-something gal in the Rav4, I smiled when you cried.  While I have no idea who you are, I've seen you many mornings.
 
- I've seen you drive ~60 in a 35 zone
 
- I've seen you do this over the crosswalk in front of my daughter's elementary school while school is in session.
 
- I've heard your honking behind my car when I refuse to speed over the crosswalk because CHILDREN are at the edge and want to cross and it's not a FUCKING race
 
- When flashing lights are up and the school zone speed limit is lowered to 15, I've seen you try to continue well above 40, only screeching to a halt in front of the crosswalk when the crossing guards are there frantically blowing their whistles and shaking their stops signs at your stupid ass to stop you from driving over a batch of moms, babies, and 7 year olds.
 
- I've felt the heat of your car when I was crossing with other families, lights flashing but before the guards' shift started, and you chose to speed past us, over the crosswalk less than 2 feet away from us.You've done this bullshit enough times over the past year for me to take notice of your car and your face.
 
So when the lovely young motorcycle cop stationed right in the middle of the crosswalk with the crossing guards today, his radar gun heroically pointed towards the oncoming traffic, and your fucking stupid ass didn't even see HIM as you sped up to blow through the crosswalk at high speed I couldn't have had a nicer morning view.
 
You stopped at the whistles and then it hit you. He stood in front of your car, leading you to the side street where he proceeded to write up your shitty ass while you sat in the driver's seat and cried like the spoiled little child you are. And I smiled.
 
Because, FUCK YOU. And SUCK IT.  
Love, a mom"
"""She's asking to get raped"" Fuck You.","Yesterday evening I went out with a few friends to get a bite to eat, it was really hot that day, close to 100 degrees. In all honesty, my outfit suits the weather. I wore a black crop top, skinny jeans and heels.

I'm waiting in line and I hear a group of girls talking about me. I ignore it at first, but then one girl says ""She has no self respect, she's asking to get raped""

Everything in me went cold. I was raped when I was 7 years old. The only thing I wore the day I got raped was a elmo sweater and jeans. I started to shake and told my friends I was going to walk home. I ended up sitting on the curb holding back tears. I wasn't asking to get raped yesterday or when I was 7. It was hot, I should be able to wear whatever I want.

Just because I choose to show some skin doesn't mean I have no self respect. I really wanted to walk back in and tell that girl off, but i'd be just like her. 


I feel better now that I got that off my chest.

I'm an oncology nurse. NSFW language.,"I work in an infusion clinic. When you get diagnosed with cancer and need chemotherapy, you come see me and I administer the drugs. I teach you about what to expect. I answer your questions with a smile.

 We form inside jokes. You tell me about your kids, and I tell you about mine. A few months down the road you  start to look like shit. The doctor has decided to change the regimen and try a new approach. I don't tell you that this is NOT good news. ... I just continue to do what I do. You still have hope... I notice you start bringing in spiritual books with you. You are more withdrawn... Our conversations now revolve around how you managed to eat half a sandwich on Tuesday.

 We bullshit about the weather, weekend plans, how busy the clinic has  been these past few weeks.  Small talk really. You see, I know it's coming.  It's inevitable. 

A few months later you're having trouble breathing and your hip has been aching. We do a CT just to be on the safe side. It's spreading. You don't have much time left.... Everyday when I go home and kiss my family I contemplate my own mortality. I'm faced with it everyday. My spiritual compass is broken. Maybe you notice im not as chatty as I once was... You see, im preparing myself. I know we don't have much time left together. 

You no longer receive chemo. Occasionally you get some labs drawn, or a bag of fluids to fill the tank. You've checked out mentally. The social worker comes over to let you know that the hospice nurse will be there this evening to set everything up.  You are but a shell of what you once were. 

This will be the last time you are in my care. I've already written you off, so our last conversation is very shallow. I'll tell you something generic like ""good luck"" or "" hang in there"" and you force a fake smile.  Im not being rude. you see I HAVE to do this. It's the only way I can keep some sanity and still function. Nothing personal. 


I'll get the inevitable news a few days later.  I got a new patient coming in at 9am though. She's scared as shit, talking in circles and she's obviously been up all night thinking about her first treatment. 

I work in an infusion clinic. When you get diagnosed with cancer and need chemotherapy, you come see me and I administer the drugs. I teach you about what to expect. I answer your questions with a smile.


EDIT: Thank you everyone for your kinds words, and gold to boot! It really means a lot.. "
I am a dude sitting here in my apartment wearing a dress and a pair of leggings and IDGAF,"I'm a dude. I served in Afghanistan (and ruptured a disc in my spine a month before I left, and still deployed anyway). I saved people I never got to meet. If I locked myself out of my apartment I could probably punch my way back in through the wall like the Kool Aid Man (although I'm sure my landlord would appreciate it if I just went and asked to be let in).

But right now I am sitting in my apartment wearing a black T-shirt dress, a black hoodie, and a pair of red leggings, and it's the most comfortable outfit I've ever worn. This is fine. I feel nice for a change. I only wear it in my apartment right now, but maybe one morning I'll wear it to coffee downtown. Maybe. Or maybe my idiot upstairs neighbor will start another fire, and I'll have no choice but to go outside in it.

But for right now, it makes me happy in a way that makes it feel like it should have happened a long time ago. I feel like I've laid down a broadsword I've been carrying for 36 years. Fuck it. This is nice."
I watched a movie with a stranger and it was awesome,"It was my dad's birthday, so I went with my family to the movie theater to watch Venom. We order some concessions and such and have a nice little chat with the cashier. He gives us some Venom posters as a thanks. As the movie was about to start, this happy looking girl came out of nowhere and sat next to me. There were plenty of seats around but for some reason she sat next to me. It was nice. We laughed together. We repeated funny lines to each other. At some point she took my drink by accident and we just laughed. Lots of laughing and a nice human connection. After the movie was over, I wanted to thank her for making the viewing such a positive experience. I realized I had those posters, so I handed one to her. I wanted to talk to her more because she seemed cool, but I was with my family so I just left after that. I doubt she is going to read this, but if you do, pm me! We should hang.

Edit: yes I'm dumb. If only there was some way i could've given her something that would allow her to contact me later. Like... A FUCKING PHONE NUMBER. Written on the back of the poster??? Welp. Whoops.

Edit 2: wtf is that a gold? Thanks kind stranger!"
I Fucking Found Him.,"On June 18th, I was rear-ended by a gray Dodge Ram.

I caught it on my dash cam, and the man who hit me appears on the video twice.

I got a picture of his insurance card, damage done on both vehicles, and license plates. He told me he would like to take care of this out of pocket, as he didn't want his insurance rates to rise. I was okay with this, I've done it before with no issues. 

The next week, I sent my truck in for an estimate. Up until this, we had been texting back and forth with no issues. I emailed him a copy of the estimate....and communication stopped.

After hearing nothing from him for 3 days, I called his insurance and filed a claim, because I'm not about to be jerked around. They came back in the same day, telling me he had stopped paying back in March, and so his insurance had been cancelled. They could not honor the claim. I was furious. I called and texted him relentlessly, with no response. He was not going to pay, and neither was his insurance, despite his insurance card saying it expired July 1.

I called my insurance, and even though I was at no fault, I have to pay $500 for repairs (Deductible). I immediately went to the Denver County Court, and filed paperwork for small claims, then on to the Sheriff's department to serve him paperwork.

The police were no help (shocker). The address he provided on his insurance was falsified, and after telling the deputy 4 times to run his license plates, he finally did. The same address was used to register his vehicle. 

There was no other way we could find him, and so I was hopeless. I was going to pay for this dickhead's damage, and he was going to get away with it.

Until this morning, I decided to do a few Google searches for ""his name, Denver"".

A ""ripoff"" review popped up - a man with the same name had redone a patio, and did a shitty job at it, fortunately for me. I thought I'd go ahead and call the company. I asked the receptionist for an estimate/consultation to do some yard work, and specifically requested (Name of dick face), as ""I heard he was great at this stuff"". She said he was great at landscaping, so I asked ""He's the one who drives the gray Dodge truck, right?"".

She said ""yes"". My heart stopped.

That was all I needed. I called the deputy who was attempting to serve him, and they're currently on their way to serve the paperwork at his company. 

I fucking found you, you piece of shit, and I'm going to make sure you pay me. The court date is August 12th. I'll see you then.



TL;DR - Got rear-ended, the dick face was evading payment, and I was better than the police at finding him. Also - everyone should own a dash cam. Seriously.

"Getting divorced, the size of my son's heart just broke me last night.","We told our kids last friday, my son is 10.  He has asked some questions, and i explained that his mom and i didnt get along, that we wanted them to have happy parents, etc. 

He asks last night ""Dad, have you and mom been arguing for a long time?  Like years?  And you kept trying to get along for me and (sister)?""

So I did say that yeah, we had but we kept trying to keep the family together, and taht we wanted them to have as much time with us as possible, but that we eventually realized that he and his sister would be better off seeing two happy parents every other week, than two miserable parents every single day.

And he said:

""Thanks, for trying for so long, at least we got this many years together as a family"".

It just killed me.  His life is being turned upside down, and he is still thoughtful enough to thank ME for trying so hard for him.  Kids can be very hard to handle at times, but then times like this, they make you feel so much love it's amazing. "
I am a 6 foot 6 black male and I am so tired of living like this.,"I am so exhausted with this life. Nothing in this world is for me. I'm not supposed to feel anything or be anything more than a freak for people to double-take at. Things like friendship and love and are not for me. People take one look at me and determine all my characteristics for me. Scary, unintelligent, aggressive, unfeeling etc. And it doesn't matter what I say or do to the contrary, because it's not up to me who gives me a chance. It doesn't matter if I try to smile or say hi. It will always be scary or creepy. The side-eye, the nervous laughs, the scared look when they see me. The only positive interaction I get from only the friendliest of people is the same stupid joke about whether I play basketball, and as soon as I say I don't, it's over. My hobbies, the way I talk, none of it ""matches"" in the eyes of society, which makes me a freak. I'm only supposed to like rap music. I'm not supposed to speak calmly or quietly. I'm not allowed to be me. I can only be what others see me as. I'm just the ""big guy"" for guys to bump fists with and for girls to nervously glance at. And it is exhausting to live like that. 

Everybody says they don't care about appearances. Everybody thinks they are that one special person who accepts everyone no matter what. I can tell you now that none of you are. You all judge by appearances and nobody reading this would even entertain the thought of befriending me if you met me. I might get support from strangers online, but as soon as I step outside my house it's a completely different game. And if you, reading this, saw what I looked like you'd probably be surprised that I am able to think or type these kinds of things. Because someone who looks like me isn't supposed to feel things or even type it out coherently. I hate that so much.

And don't say ""fuck anyone who treats you like that"". Because it's not just certain people. It's everyone. And people love to pretend like the whole world is as ""accepting"" as they are, though they themselves are not as ""accepting"" as they think. And then all the responsibility gets shoved on me to change how people see me. But I can't do that. I can only be me, and if nobody accepts that then there's nothing more I can do.

What is the point of living a life like this? When your personality, your interests, everything about you is determined by your appearance? I'm tired of living for the miraculous appearance of someone who can see past what I look like. Why should I even have to wait at all? I don't want to live like this anymore."
To the jogger who waved at me to slow down while I was driving by...,"I was driving through a neighborhood yesterday going about 25 MPH, which is the speed limit.   There is a fairly steep hill on this road, which obviously makes you go a faster while driving down it, but I was not about to ride my brakes the entire way down the hill in order to stay at the speed limit for the short time I would be on this hill.  

You were jogging on the sidewalk, and you waved your arm at me for me to slow down.  This caught me off guard, and out of pure reaction I touched on my brakes and slowed down to the 25 MPH speed limit. I was already in a bad mood after a really shitty day, and this made me even more mad, so I flipped you off.  *How could you have possibly known I was going above the speed limit?  It's not like I was swerving all over the road or accelerating, I was just coasting!*

As I got to the bottom of the hill, still riding on my brakes, I saw why you waved at me to slow down: there was a cop on a motorcycle hiding on the other side of a fence with his radar gun out, and there was no way I would have seen him in time to slow down.  You potentially saved me from a speeding ticket, which would have made my already bad day even worse.  

Thank you so much for waving at me to slow down, and I'm so sorry I flipped you off.  You were just trying to help a stranger out and I assumed you were being an unnecessary prick.  I would hug you if I could."
I asked her today and she said yes!,"I finally did it! I was so nervous to ask my fiance's 10 year old daughter if I could marry her mom.  She said of course and not only that but she gave me the biggest hug and told me I was already her dad anyway. Needless to say we immediately grabbed the dogs and went for ice cream lol. I've been in her life for 5 years and it's been long over due but me and her mom are finally getting married. It wasn't a question of love we just wanted to get everything on track and have a home before we paid for a wedding. Well I never officially asked her until I asked her daughter's permission first. Plus I wanted her comfortable with idea of me marrying her mom since she still remembers her dad before he passed away. Anyway they both said yes! And we've always been a family but somehow it feels official now, well legally it will be. I'm not my mom's boyfriend or my boyfriend anymore. I'm a step dad and a husband. I'm proud of my little home, my decent job, my man toys, my doggos and being able provide and give my 2 girls a happy life. They're my life and I can't wait to grow old and watch my little family grow,

EDIT:: OMG!!! I can't believe the response I got from this you are all amazing and so nice. I've been busy the last few days so I didn't see how much this blew up. I honestly just wrote it bc I was so happy! She amazing guys I'm a very lucky man to have such a loving and accepting step daughter. And her mom I could go on for days about her and how we met if you guys thought this was heart warming you'd really love our little cliche love story. I'm so excited you guys have no idea. I'm madly in love with my soon to be wife and her daughter is now our daughter and I am blessed she chose me, well blessed they both did lol. It's crazy how life turns out and the most amazing surprises happen in the most rare and odd situations. I just wanna scream it one last time. I LOVE MY GIRLS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I’m sitting here in a waiting room painted baby blue. There are pictures of succulents on the wall. Most patients brought someone with them but I am alone. I don’t know what to feel. I woke up this morning, drove to Atlanta with the morning sun shining through my windshield. To get an abortion.","It’s such a cliché. My mother had me when she was my age. And here I am making a decision she probably wishes she’d made. But after being probed and examined and after peeing into a little cup, all I can think about is what I’m going to eat for breakfast afterward. I was sexually assaulted. I knew from the moment I saw those two little pink lines that this would be my decision. I don’t think I’ll have any regrets. But in these character defining moments of life I find myself most alone. The people who are supposed to show up for you, don’t. And all I have left are these thoughts about where to get breakfast. "
I suck at being a detective.,"So I am a police detective.  It is very interesting and it feels great to catch the bad guys and help the victims.  

But I suck at it, or parts of it. To be a police officer, you have to be tough, you have to be able to not take things personally and sometimes even switch your emotions off.  I can’t do that at all, I just want to cry with the victims & hug them.  I get extremely upset whenever I see a dead body and I saw a lot.  Thank goodness I could surpress these emotions when needed.  And I am really good in a crisis, I am calm, collected and do what needs to be done.

But afterwards, I am a train wreck.  I can still hear the primal cries of this one mother, whom I had to tell her son was dead.  It haunts me, it was the worst thing I ever had to do.

Sometimes I visualize and count the dead people I have seen. When I forget one, I feel quilty and start counting again until I remember.

One day I broke down at work when my supervisor asked me how I was doing, I cried and cried.  I was taken off the job immediately and have been going from department to department ever since. I don’t fit in, I suck at being a detective.  I have given up so much to become a detective, it sucks so much, my confidence is at an all time low.  I feel stupid and inadequate.

There is good news.  Finally today, I got placed in a department that is perfect for me. Intelligence, so all research and analysis.  In just a few hours I got compliments how well I picked things up.  I am really good at this! I don’t suck anymore."
You killed my cat. And you're a good person.,"I came home late last night and found the garbage bins pulled awkwardly far out into the street.  Between them was my cat, Tom.  He was dead, and had been for a few hours.

I’ve spend the last 24 hours crying, raging, wondering what kind of asshole kills a cat and then drives off.  Wondering who could be so cruel.  I tried to assume you didn’t know what you’d done.  I wanted  to scream that it wasn’t fair.  Last night in the street, crying over Tom’s dead body, I probably did.
And tonight, I’ve been getting nicely drunk, playing with the kittens that we adopted to keep Tom company, trying to explain to them that he’s not coming back, when you knocked on my front door.
You said, “Did you guys have a cat?”
And I instantly forgave you.  Because you weren’t some heartless person.  You knew that you’d killed a member of our family, and you wanted to help make it right.
You told us that he’d been chasing a fox.  That you’d narrowly missed the fox, and that Tom ran right in front of you, and that you slammed on the breaks, and couldn’t stop.  That you’d moved the trash bins to make sure no one else hit him.  That he was gone instantly.  That you couldn’t sleep because of it.
That took so much courage.  You have no idea how much I respect you for that.  For coming clean and for trying to make it right.  It helped me so much to understand what happened, why he was in the street to begin with, and why someone just left him there.  You said you’d knocked, but we weren’t home.  
I hope you sleep tonight.  You’re a good person and I’m sorry that this happened to all of us.  Thank you for having the courage to talk to us.  Thank you.

Strangers stopped my birthday from being the worst day ever.,"Hey Reddit, it's my 20th birthday woo! But some things happened today. I was working this morning. I'm an adult now and can handle that, but I was training at a new job. I can handle stress at the new job, but my trainer couldn't. She FLIPPED whenever I made any mistake. For example, I reached over because I needed a cup (I work at a coffee shop) and she said, ""Um, say excuse me. You're being rude."" And that was just me reaching past. I'll admit I made mistakes, but I'm training. She got mad that I didn't know certain things and blamed me for a ton of crap. So I'm trying not to just break down and keep my cool. Finally my shift ends. I figure it's my birthday, so I get a peppermint mocha with 4 shots of espresso because SCREW IT IT'S MY BIRTHDAY. 

I go to the car and 20 year old me starts balling my eyes out like a kid. After about 10 minutes I decide to go to a nearby doughnut shop because I didn't want my birthday to be a total wreck. It's pretty empty except for two other people. As I'm ordering the two strangers give me their coupon for two free donuts and a coffee! I was really touched and thanked them profusely, letting them know it was really nice especially because it's my birthday. I didn't know until I got back to the car that my face was still showing how bad I felt. I was sitting in the car and trying to gather myself before I started the drive home. 

Enter strangers again. 

They come out and gave me a gift card to the place saying, ""I could tell you looked like you were having a bad day and wanted you to have a good birthday."" 

On the way home things seemed alright.

Dear strangers, thank you for saving the day with such an act of kindness. "
"Silly me, I forgot all men are pedophiles and can't be around unclothed children","I work at a daycare/preschool with 2-4 year olds. Today I'm in a class with all 3 year olds. One of my boys went to the bathroom just fine, but came out with his pants/underwear around his ankles and asked me to help. I pulled up his pants, buttoned them, and sent him on his way for nap time. 

Once things had calmed down and everybody was laying down, I was told by my other teacher that I wasn't allowed to do ""bathroom stuff"" with the kids, including helping them put their clothes back on after using the bathroom. Only the female teachers can do that. 

Silly me, I forgot that I, as the only guy employed by the organization, am automatically a pedophile and should not be allowed around kids using the bathroom or changing clothes. Even if some of the little boys prefer I help them instead of the female teachers, I can't assist at all because I might molest them and damage them forever since I'm a guy. If a kid needs help, they're just gonna have to wait till a woman shows up cause my automatically-a-pedo-for-liking-kids brain may snap.

**Edit** - Hey guys, thanks for all the replies.  I'll admit when I wrote this I was kind of drowning in saltiness over the whole situation.  Some really good advice was given and I appreciate every bit of it.  My plan of action is to go to the big bosses on Monday and discuss exactly what my limitations are and *why* those limitations exist.  I'm also going to get everything in writing and make a written record of the event today for my own usage.  Again, thanks for all the great advice and please keep the sexism out of the comments."
Being vegan sucks and I'm one avocado away from giving it up.,"Throwaway because I know I'll get a ton of shit from annoying vegans and dont want them blowing up my main inbox with tofu recipes.

(EDIT: Lots of vegans downvoting all the comments. I remain unsurprised) 
 
There, I said it. I hate being vegan.

When I first went vegan, it was strictly for health reasons. However, once I started becoming more active on vegan websites I switched my perspective from ""for my body"" to ""for the animals"". I watched documentaries like Earthlings and Cowspiracy, and I genuinely cried for how animals were being treated. I decided from then on that I would no longer eat any animal by-products or support industries that utilized animal testing for frivolous things (cosmetics, beauty supplies, fur, and leather, as opposed to, say, medicine and cat food) 

It was exciting, at first. There were so many new foods I had never even heard of before, so many new recipes and ingredients. Veganism marked my first foray into cooking, as I was just turning 19 and learning to really cook for myself. I had always been a bit of a foodie, so I turned to the more adventurous vegan cookbooks for inspiration.

Fast forward five years later, and I am just sick and tired of vegan food. 

The thing about vegans is that they are highly sensitive of anyone criticizing their food, but the fact is that it *just doesn't taste as good as meat, eggs, and dairy about 75% of the time*- if even that. 

Yes, you have some vegan substitutes that taste exactly like their meat and dairy counterparts- and then you have dozens of foods that simply cannot be replicated in vegan form: this includes good-quality aged cheeses, certain cuts of meat, and especially seafood. 

I'm just tired of delusional vegans with half-dead taste buds trying to convince me that buffalo cauliflower wings taste JUST AS GOOD as chicken wings or that Daiya or Follow Your Heart tastes JUST LIKE aged cheddar cheese. I'm tired of saying something like ""I miss smoked gouda"" and having 10 other vegans dogpile my post with ""just blend some soaked cashews in water and add some smoked paprika!!!"" These things are good, but they're never going to be as satisfying or delicious as an actual fucking chicken wing and the only people who think so are the people high on the vegan kool-aid.

Food is about more than just flavor, its about TEXTURE, and thats where about 90% of vegan meat replacers and recipes fall short. You can't capture the flavor of salmon with Old Bay Seasoning and vinegar! Most vegan cheeses- even homemade- are waaay softer that dairy cheese, and its off-putting for me as someone who loved fancy cheeses growing up.

I'm just tired of the limitations of a vegan diet. I love to cook, and its starting to frustrate me that theres an entire culinary world out there that I can't ever experience because of some moral choice I'm not even sure I give a damn about anymore. 

I'm tired of the circlejerk mentality that most vegan communities have where if you don't sit back and pretend that vegan food is in anyway a formidable substitute for foods with animal products you're met with an avalanche of condescending level 35 vegans who have been subsiding on nothing but beans, rice, and potatoes for the last 16 years.

Don't even get me started on how shitty it is to go out to restaurants to eat. I'm so fucking tired of other vegans telling me to pay 9$ eat a fucking loaf of bread covered in condiments as a meal or some fucking bland ass pasta I could have EASILY made at home for a fraction of the price like its NBD. If I wanted some fucking pasta I would have stayed the fuck at home and made it myself instead of paying $9 for it what the fuck. 

I feel so much better just typing this out. Probably going to start buying cheese again and work from there. 

EDIT: Spelling.

EDIT: My problem with vegan food isn't that its gross or bland, because its not. I just miss animal products and the variation and flavor they bring. There are lots of non-vegan foods that there aren't (currently) vegan versions of."
A few months ago I posted on reddit about killing myself. I just wanted to return to this account and let everyone who cares know that I'm alive and doing a lot better.,"Thanks to kindness from a few people, but especially a user by the name of u/yourfavoritelesbian, I've been able to find a few reasons to continue you on and hope for a better life in the future. 

I still have a lot of demons that I fight against on a moment-to-moment basis, but they haven't beaten me yet.

I'm open to answering any questions anyone may have.

The reason I'm making this is because I logged in today to just see if anyone else had reached out to me and lots of people have been sending me messages even up until yesterday asking if I'm still alive.

It would seriously take me days to respond to each of those people personally so I'm making this thread in hopes that they see it and know that I am still here and I am grateful for their kindness.

Goodbye for now,"Nine months ago, you received the news that you were in remission.


We were ecstatic.


Four months ago, you received the news that you had relapsed.


We were crushed.


Three weeks ago, you received the news that the tumour was shrinking.


We were excited.


Four days ago, I received the news that you were in ICU.


I was confused.


One day ago, I received the news that the tumour had spread and there were no treatment options left.


I was numb.


Today, I held onto your hand and played your favourite songs. The nurses told me that you were listening, and you squeezed my hand.


You were in my life for twenty-one years and that wasn’t enough. I’m struggling to think of all the years ahead of me without you in it. You won’t be at my graduation. You won’t be there to walk me down the aisle. You won’t be there for our father-daughter dance. You won’t be there to meet your (eventual) grandchildren. There are so many things that you’re going to miss, and I can’t help but think I’ve failed in not giving them to you sooner.


You have suffered a lot in your life, and I know that you felt, at times, that you failed in providing our family with the best life possible. I know it’s too late, but I just want you to know that you were all we ever needed. I can only hope that, wherever you are now, you’re at peace. I hope you’re eating a big well-done steak with a bottle of beer in your hand – and, hopefully, you didn’t set off the fire alarms while cooking it. 


There won’t be a day that goes by where I won’t think of you. I’m going to try my best to live my life to its fullest. I’m scared shitless that I’m going to forget things. Forget your voice, your face, our memories. But for as long as I can breathe, I’m going to keep your memory alive. You can count on me. You always did. 


I love you so much, dad. I hope we can meet again one day.


EDIT: Thank you to everyone who has reached out to me for your loving and kind words. I can’t express how grateful I am to have people from all around the world thinking about my father and my family. 


He passed away peacefully at 14:35 on 15 December 2017. I know there are many obstacles ahead of me and it is only with your messages that I have the strength to carry on.


To everyone reading this, I urge you to contact your loved ones. Spend time with them, share experiences with them, talk to them about anything and everything. Because, at the end of the day, it can all be taken away in an instant. Best wishes to all of you over this holiday season.

"$13,000 rape kit","Total, the overall hospital bills were a bit more, but the one with the rape kit was +$13,000. That's how much it costs to get raped everybody. So if you can't afford that, perhaps consider -oh I don't know- *not* getting raped. It'll save you both sooo much money *and* what's left of your sanity.

Honestly, I want to kill myself. I'm so tired of putting up with all of this months after it happened. Why I'm paying the literal and figurative price for a piece of vile human waste to have done what he did to me, I have no clue. But I'm so sick of bearing with it any longer. 

I'm tired. Tired of the nightmares and screaming, of being such a burden to everybody, of simply being in a constant state of agony... it's really hard to justify why I should even be here anymore. And I've tried so hard, but it never seems good enough. Medication, therapy, trying to work again, trying to *draw* again. And it's like everyone is expecting me to be over it by now. Cause I'm a ""strong"" young lady, I can tough it out right? 

But I'm not. I've fallen apart.

I met this girl who only wears one earring at a time...,"I met a girl a few weeks ago.  She has a beautiful tattoo, a crooked little smile, and legs a hundred miles long.  She smells incredible and she whispers things in your ear when you hug her.  She walks like she knows where she's going and her accent slips into little words occasionally.  

I don't move fast with people.  It takes me months to learn to like people.  

On our first date, I spilled milkshake all over my face and she laughed at me.  In a good way.  

But on our second date, she kissed me.  

And on our third date, we made out in a parking lot late at night.  I  still have a clean spot on my car where we leaned kissing.  

And on monday, she came to my house and made me noodles while it snowed outside.  We kissed and watched stupid movies and drank wine.  And by night time, it was too snowy for her to drive home. So she stayed.  We got naked and stayed up til 2 am talking and touching and fucking.  And the next day was a snow day, everything was closed, so she stayed again.   She gives me shivers when she touches me.  She pulls me in when she kisses me.  

She makes me really excited.  I've never moved so fast with anyone.  My pillow this morning still smells like her.  

And I feel SO, SO incredibly lucky that my friends and family and community are so progressive and supportive and inclusive that I don't have to keep this a secret.  There are still some places in this country where open gay relationships are dangerous.  Where I couldn't touch her in public.  There are countries out there where fucking another girl could get us both killed.  

I've always had relationships with men.  But when I called my best friend to gush to him about this new person I met, he didn't even so much as pause when I mentioned that I'm seeing a girl.  Not a flinch or a single question.  He just said, "" I'm SO excited for you, I can't wait to hear all about your date.""  I told my roommate that I was having her over on monday and he just plainly offered to hang out somewhere else to give us some space, not a single raised eyebrow or snarky comment about me having a girl over.  How incredible is that?  I've never come out as gay or bi or straight.  I've always appeared straight, but my wonderful friends are so open-minded that when I tell them I'm seeing a girl, they're totally okay with it.  And I know how lucky I am about that.  I wish all people had such freedom.  

It's a brave new world out there. "
I just looked back on my SAT scores from 2014 and cried,"I know it's stupid, but I feel smart again. Capable. Reminded of my own potential. I got an 1820. For my high school in the ghetto, that was a serious accomplishment. Life has presented me with many complications that have made college so difficult, but I haven't given up, nor will I. I made that 1820 happen, so I will make grad school happen too. There's a way out of no way. Always.


EDIT

WOW GUYS. I was not expecting this to blow up nor to recieve this much support. I love you all, and thank you so much for all the love and support you have all offered me. It really means a lot to me. 💜"
My childhood counselor during my parents’ divorce married my dad,"And that happened a while ago. It took me a while to accept it, and there have been some major issues with her, but most recently I found out she kept my file from when I she was my councilor, brought it home, and recently showed my dad. Last time I visited them for dinner, they made fun of me for it in front of my whole family. It’s kind of tearing me apart more than it should. "
Update: HEY GUYS! I'm that Muslim girl who ran away a few months ago.,"**Here's my first post for those of you who weren't around:**

http://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l5ssf/hi_reddit_im_running_away_tonight_and_i_dont_feel/
--------------

So I ran away 5 months ago. In August! And now it's winter and February and everything. I cannot believe how fast time has passed. It feels like only yesterday that I was sneaking my passport out their bedside cabinet. And now here I am! On the internet, in my own bedroom, in my own apartment parlayin' like some liberated she-devil.


I've settled into my new place completely. *It's wonderful*. I have wine glasses that I drink milk out of.  I have a new wardrobe full of pretty dresses that show off my figure and taste.  And I go to the grocery store after 6pm. Fucking metal. ヽ(´ー｀)ノ 


I stopped wearing black and started making eye contact with men and women alike. I still struggle with confidence and speaking up but it's really cool to talk to people like a normal person, and not an intimidated husk of a young woman. I've probably seen more eye colours in the last 5 months than I have in the last two decades.


Still have lots of areas to improve but I'm an actual person now. It's so freakin' weird. Is my life perfect? Hell no. I even miss being mollycoddled in a way. Looking back, I had warm food on the table every night - even if I had to serve it to the men first - and my rent paid. Now I have to worry about adult stuff like not blowing my rent money on cookies and perfume but that's okay!

 At least I can say that my life is *mine*. I have the freedom to fuck up now. I haven't *yet* but it's reassuring to know that I can throw caution to the wind without fearing physical violence and vague threats about marriage. 


Since my last post, they have disowned me and committed themselves to erasing every apect of my existence. As far as they are concerned, they are still perfect human beings and they never had a daughter named X, much less abused and belittled her.


As for me, I have committed myself to undoing all the mental damage they inflicted on me, slowly carving out the path they never wanted me to take. Lots of ups and downs, naturally, but I am thriving and I just wanted to let you guys know that. I was very close to giving up when I made that post. It would have been easier to keep my head down and bear it for a few years longer but I'm glad I didn't chicken out. 



Thanks for giving me that final shove, Reddit. I couldn't be happier. :)



**edit:** Whoa. I fell asleep, sorry to have blanked you all! I absolutely didn't expect so many wonderful replies. You guys rock!!


I wish I could give cake slices through the internet! <3"
"I've been living a lie for the past 6 months, today it paid off.","Last semester was meant to be my final semester at university, but I failed one of my units. Ashamed, I couldn't bring myself to tell my parents and friends, so I lied. I said I passed, but that I would have to delay my convocation ceremony to the next batch. I enrolled in a summer unit and finished it without anyone knowing. 

Since completing the unit, I've been feverishly checking my results, hoping that they would be released. They came out today and I passed. I finally graduated. 

The sad news is that I can't celebrate it with anyone I know, because I already did so 6 months ago. 

The lying was tough. I'm glad it's over."
Tomorrow I may go to Prison,"At 9 am I have a sentencing hearing, and I will either be sent home with my family, on probation, or be taken into custody and sent to prison for the next 2 - 3 years. I'm scared, afraid to leave my family behind, even though I've done all I can to prepare them and myself for the worst case scenario. I don't want to leave my wife, my 7 year old stepson, or my 1 month old son. But I've done everything I can, and now all I can do is take responsibility and accept judgment. 

Thanks for reading this, you beautiful stranger, I hope your life is bright and full of happiness right now."
To the guy at the end of the bar who paid for my beer..,"I'm sitting here, a disheveled stressed out mess because of finals, taking advantage of the local bars' happy hour, and after handing me the check I see they didn't apply the happy hour discount. Not thinking, I hand the waitress my card, but luckily I'm able to get her attention before she swipes it. I let her know because I only had 10 dollars in my checking account. and all was good, I was going to go on my merry way and stuff my nose into books until 4 AM. But while browsing reddit, the waitress lets me know she'll be getting me another beer from the guy at the end of the bar. You turned to me, just some older gentleman after work in a suit watching sports in a bar, and let me know you once had ten dollars in your budget, and you know how it feels. 


For some reason, it uplifted me. 

The warmth of kindness from a stranger, of people giving to others. It's nice to know there's still people like that out there. And maybe, someday soon, I'll be in a suit on my way home at a bar and be able to pass the favor on to another stressed out college kid. 
Thank you. "
I don't care that he's two. Stop being a dick.,"My two and a half year has decided he doesn't want to eat animals. He's been a sensitive little guy since forever, so I can't say it was a particular surprise. His older brother decided to enlighten him on where exactly his delicious steak came from, and that was the start of it all. The most memorable moment has been the encounter with the fish counter at the supermarket, and the tears and apologies to the dead salmon for it being killed.

My wife and I believe that he deserves to have his choice respected, regardless of his age. He's old enough to make his opinion known. It upsets him. Feeding him on a vegetarian diet isn't difficult, he's not a fussy kid and he eats pretty much anything put in front of him (except, y'know, animals). He is happy to drink milk and eat eggs. It's the start of developing his understanding of respect, and choice, and I think it's incredibly important we take him seriously.

Oh, but not my mother in law. She has spent the entire holiday season trying to force-feed him turkey and beef. She has called him everything under the sun, from ""a bad, spoilt little brat"" to ""overly sensitive with no hope of getting anywhere in life"". We are ruining him apparently. She tried to tell him there was no meat in the lasagna she was trying to give him and my 5 year old called her out on that bullshit. She doesn't understand why 'sneaking' meat to him isn't appropriate, and why she can't justify it with ""he's just a toddler, he won't know"".

I get that he is toddler, and that she is an adult. That's why I particularly don't understand why she is acting like a petulant child and refuses to give him even a shred of respect.

"Fuck you, motherfucker.","There were four of us in that worthless fucking city, in that worthless fucking building that day. Two of us were already dead, one shot in the neck inside and the other blown into paste by an RPG. You wound up hit in the side, and I was the last one standing, with at least 20 of them outside. I hauled your ass in back, collected your M4 magazines, leaving you with the one in your weapon, handed you my frag and asked you if you knew what it's for. You told me I should run and I told you it was nothing but a thing. I went back to the front of that building to fight and die for you. Problem is, I, no, we didn't. Help came and we left.

I killed at least 5 men for you that day. I fought until I was on my last magazine and told myself that that last round wasn't for me, it was for them. I would have fought them with my hands and teeth if I had to, because my friend was helpless in the back.

Years later what do you do? You kill yourself and become another statistic on combat veteran suicide. You worthless fucking coward. After what I did you owed me your life motherfucker. It wasn't yours, it was mine. Instead you off yourself like a worthless peice of shit. All you had to do was pick up the phone and call me, I would have done the same thing all over again to stop you. Instead you pretend like there's no one out there and go out like a selfish fucking tool.

I refused to leave you by yourself out there and here you leave me alone years after the fact to carry these bags of shit by myself. I don't want this worthless fucking award, I want the man I tore ass through Mesopotamia with and lived to talk about it despite all odds.

Fuck you. I should have fucking left you there."
"I saw a kid sit alone, hiding himself from the rest of the school.","High school is a fucking scary place, especially for the younger kids. I mean, when I was just turning 13, I was thrown into a building filled with kids/young adults that looks like they could kill me. I was really scared, and was a little shy. But what's even worse, is that the Australian Government decided to put 12 year olds into high school, instead of keeping them in their primary schools.

So that means there are 11 year olds (turning 12 later on in the year) walking around, surrounded by us huge mother fucking apes. So I can't comprehend what they must be thinking.

My group sits at the back of the school, next to a broken down elevator. Next to our little spot, there is a staircase people walk down to the wood work rooms, and we always say hello to them and make small talk. It's normally the same people, and we've become friends with a few of them.

Today, a little chubby kid walked down the stairs with a packet of Twisties and a LOL soft drink, naturally, my friend said hello to him and tried to squeeze a quick conversation with the kid. He didn't talk much, just walk towards to the woodwork room. 

We turned to each other to continue our conversation until we heard a can open. My friend who tried to start the conversation asked if he was only just around the corner sitting down. We looked at the reflection of a nearby window, and sure enough, the kid was sitting there alone.

I looked at my friend and we both knew what each of us were thinking. So we both walked over and wondered what was up.

""Do you want us to sit with you?"" my friend asked, placing his bag on the floor.

There was a pause until the kid opened his mouth and replied with; 

""I don't mind being alone.""

I threw my bag on the floor and began to spark conversation with the kid. Just about anything I could think of. What video games he played, what he wanted to be, what his subjects were anything. Soon enough, my group gradually walked over to us and sat with him, inviting him into our conversations and everything.

It really hurt seeing him sitting alone, and it's been on my mind all day. Mainly because that kid was me back in the day, sitting alone, just wanting someone to talk to.

Kid, I hope you find your place at this school. You can stay with us for as long as you want, but we're graduating this year. Good luck, friend.

Edit: Cool, I got my first gold. But really, this shouldn't be worth a gild. Should be a normal thing people should do. But regardless, listening to [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TeXatquVqAc) on repeat. Thankyou :)

Edit 2: A lot of you are thanking me for doing this. Calling me nice things and everything, and that's great! It's making me a smile so much it's beginning to hurt. I don't know why this kid was sitting alone, if he was just shy or if he was being teased. But either way, my principal has asked me, and a friend, to speak in front of our school because we're 'inspirational' kids. My friend was, as we like to call them here, a 'derro' and I was bullied back in my younger years. I'll be sure to update you all when that happens, I've got my speech written out, but I'm going to change a little bit of it to suit what has just happened. 

Another thing, if you think this is a good deed and showering me with compliments is the best thing you can do, don't restrict it only to me. Go up to someone tomorrow that looks like they could use some cheering up and do what I've done. Nothing is stopping you. Social status could be destroyed because you're talking to 'that guy' or 'the weird kid' you can easily win that back by showing that you do not give a single fuck what everyone else thinks. Where I come from that's a respectable badge to wear, be the first in your town pin it on your shirt with pride. Tell those judgemental mother fuckers to kiss your ass, because if they're putting you down because you're associating with someone *they* don't like, they are definitely not the sort of people you should be trying to impress.

Edit 3: I'm reading some crazy stories about how well people can relate to this story whether it's with their kids, their own experiences or have been the good guy. I really want to respond to you all I'm just a little busy at the moment, and probably won't get to get around to you all until the mid weekend. But anyway, until then, keep having a good day guys. Some of you have also told me to share this to other Subreddits, so I'll do that now then head off. 

Edit 4 (final edit?): Now that this thread has run it's course, and I've responded to a lot of comments, I just want to say thankyou for letting me talk and everything. It means a lot to both me and /u/Hudddysan (in case you haven't seen him rapidly commenting on your posts and him informing that he was the friend in the story, he's the friend in the story.) that you have all been touched in many way with this story. I hope you can all go out and do something similar one day (if not tomrrow!). Have a good life guys, I'll send you all an update in a month or two on my speech, how the kids going and how life is treating me. Until than, have a good one guys <3"
My uncle's 52 and he's been in prison since he was 18 for possession of marijuana,I just wanted to get this off my chest my uncle was the smartest kid he got two strikes one being possession of marijuana the others non violent crimes. His third strike was a combination with his second but they waited until we has 18 too charge him with his third strike. It bothers me that his whole adult life he's been behind bars and now rich white men are cashing in on marijuana becoming legal. The only reason they won't legalize it federally or make it a non criminal offense is because they want all he people is prison for possession of marijuana to die first so they don't have to review the sentences... It's really obvious and I hate what 1980s law enforcement did to him. I just wanted to get this off my chest it really does make m depressed just thinking about it he wasnt a violent person I feel sorry for him. 
I held my girlfriend's hand while she died,"My long term girlfriend passed away September 2nd from advanced stage ovarian cancer. When she was diagnosed last December I had a lot of thoughts run through my head, but none of them were as weird as it ended up being.


When someone dies of cancer it isn't anything like the bullshit romantic last words version we know from the movies. It's them being unable to walk. Then unable to eat. Then drink. Then talk. When the doctor gave us her final diagnosis it was for two weeks to a month. She ended up dying barely two weeks later. For the last few days it was hard for her to speak because of the pain medicine she needed. I don't know if she was awake under that fog, but I tried to reassure her and do my best. I was up with her one night because she woke up and seemed confused. She kept trying to ask me something but none of the words made sense and I couldn't figure out what she wanted. She kept repeating the same nonsense phrases and I could tell she was asking me something. All I could think was that she was going to die and I couldn't fucking figure out what she wanted me to do for her. God damnit I just wanted to get her what she wanted. In that moment everything is so fucked I would do anything do make her life 1% better. I started guessing and finally said, ""do you want to know what's going on?"" and she replied, ""YES"". I told her she had late stage cancer and that she was dying. She smiled and looked utterly relieved. She had forgotten what was happening to her and was scared because she didn't understand what was going on.


The next day she began having difficulty breathing. Hospice tells caregivers that the ""death rattle"" isn't painful for the patient, but it sure sounds like it is. I don't know what water boarding is like, but this doesn't seem far off. Constantly struggling for each breath. Like listening to someone gargle after brushing their teeth. Her family and I sat with her all night because we didn't know what was going to happen. And then all of a sudden something changed and instead of labored breathing she was gasping but nothing was going in or out. Like a fish out of water. I was holding her hand and telling her it was going to be okay but I don't fucking know what that was like. I don't know if she was even aware. Ten seconds later that was it. Everything stopped. She used to be right there and then she just wasn't. I could literally feel her hand getting cooler. I wanted so badly to keep her safe but I couldn't do anything and I have no idea what happens in that moment.


Her 25th birthday would have been two weeks ago. Life is totally random and I'm not sure if that makes me feel better or worse. I do know that everyone should live each moment to the fullest. There's too many things we can't predict.
"
My college girlfriend died a year ago and I feel like l can't talk to my wife about it.,"So I'm 36 and have been married since 30, and dating my wife since 26. Wife is ""Anne."" I love Anne completely and have never been such good friends with anyone. 

Girl who died, ""Kate,"" died last March from an overdose of alcohol and drugs. We dated from when I was 21 until 25.  On and off, always very tumultuous.  But I had real, intense feelings of love for her.  This one July afternoon stands out in my mind.  It was just her and me, the rest of the world could have exploded and I would have been happy.

Anyway.

They found Kate three days after she died, and had to break down the door to her apartment.  The only reason anyone knew anything was wrong was that she didn't show up for work.  She was 37.  

I know all these details because her ex-fiance called me.  I had been texting Kate up until the day before she died.  The last text she sent me was on a Sunday, when she asked whether I'd be visiting her city anytime soon.  I didn't respond till Tuesday or Wednesday, and then started getting calls from a strange number after I kept texting.  When I finally picked up it was Kate's ex.

What Anne doesn't know is that I was in regular contact with Kate up until the day before she died. Once a month or whatever, just to check in. On a trip to Kate's city about nine months before her death (don't worry, no pregnancy, just happened to be nine months) we had gone out to dinner.  I changed out of my suit in her apartment before we went out, and she gave me a blue plastic hanger for my dress shirt. That was the last time I saw her.  

I never ""got over"" Kate.  We stopped seeing each other because our lifestyles weren't compatible.  She loved partying, drinking, taking risks and experimenting with drugs. I used to love those things but got over it once I got serious about grad school. I don't think either one of us ""ended it,"" we just drifted apart.  I wanted to succeed in my career and start a family.  But I never stopped loving her.

Anne knows about my relationship with Kate and knows she died. She knows how she died. She even knows I'm sad. And she knows that Kate and I kept in touch! Hell, they even met a few times. And she's okay with it. Both Anne and I had previous relationships where we deeply cared for the other person and we're very open about it.

Anne doesn't know how closely I continued to hold Kate.  Or how often we talked. Or that we had dinner in the summer of 2016.  I worried about Kate and would talk to her often.  

She also doesn't know how much her death truly affected me.  I don't think I did either.  A year later I am having ecstatic dreams where I realize Kate is alive after all.  I find myself tenderly stroking her blue plastic hanger, which of course I saved and use on my favorite shirt. 

I am not sure why I feel the need to hold this all from my wife. I guess it's because I never really fell out of love with Kate.  Of course I am in love with Anne too and would be just as devastated of she passed away, if not much, much more.

I just needed to write this all down. I have been having these deeply painful moments where I realize that I will never speak to Kate again, or touch her, or smell her hair.  This was fine with me while she was alive but for some reason is now very emotional and painful after her death.

Thanks for reading all that... just writing it out makes me feel better.

My buddy came out to me...I don't think he saw my response coming,"I live in Korea...being gay as a Korean male is hugely frowned upon (I am not Korean) well for the past 5 yrs I've been good friends with a Korean guy. He's my brother, we know each other. I always had a suspicion that he batted for the other team...which was fine. He had several girlfriends, never was really into them etc. 

I'm having dinner with him before a night of partying and we are talking guys talk, dirty, shallow, guys talk. So he goes to me ""I think I found the person I wanna spend the rest of my life with""

Now I'm thinking ""WTF dude thought we where being funny here"" so I said ""So hows the pussy?"" he goes ""Its a guy"" I believe it took a split second to register and I said ""So hows the dick?"" he looked at me for a moment and it was a bit of time when he finally said ""I'm gay"" I fired back ""yea...no shit your partner has a dick...now hows the dick?""

He laughed said it was good

I then told him if his family finds out and disowns him he can stay in my spare bedroom. (This is actually kinda likely)

I don't know why he thought I was going make a big deal out of it.

All of three of us are going go party next weekend."
I refuse to get a day job.,"I work a night job between the hours of 12am-8am doing security and I absolutely love it! I could go get a more fulfilling job but those jobs would require me to work during the day.  Meaning I would have to get up early, and sit in traffic. Even on the way home would require 2 hours. Ugh. I avoid traffic & people. Its just amazing & I wouldn’t trade it for the world. I love sleeping during the day, then running errands while everyone is at work. Its just great. "
(f) I got attacked on the internet by ladies for not “supporting women”,"Some lady posted a screenshot of her husbands lock screen, which she had changed to his porn search history because he had been saying that he doesn’t watch porn and lied about it. She posted in intent to laugh at her “pettiness.” Mind you, this is a closed fb group that is female dominant and is not anonymous. 

I commented that it made me uncomfortable not because of the porn but that she went through his phone while he slept AND posted it for all to see without his permission. I don’t think you and your husband’s communications issues are funny. I don’t think humiliating your husband is funny. And if the roles were reversed you would probably feel the same. Work that shit out, enough with the pettiness. 

A bunch of the other women attacked me saying “what happened to supporting other women?” And “no one asked for your opinion” and so on. All the women were egging the poster on, saying he deserves this, you are hilarious, etc.

Just because you are a woman does not mean you deserve to be right and be justified by everyone else. Now my feelings are hurt because I didn’t join in on validating this random woman who I have no idea what their relationship is.

My husband is cheating on me (again) and I'm thrilled.,"Several years ago, I discovered my husband was cheating on me with a much younger girl on the Internet.  She also had a boyfriend and he tried to claim they were just friends, but I had seen most of their conversations and they were both emotionally and sexually intimate, even if they never met in real life.

Then he tried to argue that it wasn't *really* cheating... Because he didn't think if it was cheating, she was just a girl on the Internet, not much different than porn or a cam girl.  I called him on the bullshit, and he agreed it was cheating, but less than a month later he was back to ""it wasn't *really* cheating...""

I never felt like he fixed things.  He never made it up to me.  He never regained my trust.  I wanted to leave him, but for various reasons I didn't think I could make it on my own.  The more time went on, the more I wanted him out of my life and to start fresh, but I felt tremendously guilty.  I take marriage seriously, and my family is fairly religious, and I felt like I wanted to leave him because he was ashtray person, and the affair was an excuse.  The years passed and it ate away at me, so I said we needed to separate, go to marriage counciling, and work on things.  He moved to another state for a job opportunity, I was supposed to follow once he found a permanent apartment.

After only a month, he met someone else.  He doesn't know that I can see his phone call records.  He talks to her almost every night, for hours at a time.  I should be heartbroken, but I'm not.  I'm thrilled.  I feel like a weight has been lifted off of me.  I can divorce him with no guilt, no shame, no remorse.  He is a serial adulterer and scum.  I don't even feel like I need to take revenge or tell him I know.  I know he will get what's coming to him some day, and that's good enough for me.  I'm at peace."
I'm done with the US,"My whole life I grew up in this country. I remember doing the ""pledge of allegiance."" I still remember that indoctrinating bullshit. I was told ""This is the best country."" I never checked their source. ""You'll get the best education and have the most opportunities."" If you can afford it. ""You can be anything you want to be."" As long as you aren't black, brown, an immigrant, a women, gay, injured without insurance, anything but christian, get arrested, or trans. 

I'm a 28 years old, white, male, veteran. I've had a privileged life and paid some dues. And I fucking hate this country. What we are doing to our own citizens. What we are doing to people coming here for safety, for a better life! How we are literally killing the world. Trump isn't the cause he's the symptom. He's the embodiment of everything wrong with this horrible place. I'm done. I'm out. I'm going to work, as hard as I can, to get the hell out. I'm sorry to everyone who comes here and gets crushed. To everyone already crushed and stuck in the system. Good luck."
"Stop calling skinny women “disgusting”, or “gross” or “not real women”. We are people too and it hurts.","I am 5’10 and 114 pounds and 23 inch waist. I know this is technically underweight. But I am not anorexic and never have been. I eat a good 1500 calories a day, I work out, and I have no health problems.

I am also a fashion model, so keeping my figure is a part of my job. Its fashion week and just yesterday, one of my friend’s runway looks was posted on the designer’s Instagram. People called her body“disgusting” and that she looked like a walking skeleton. She doesn’t resemble a skeleton at all, and is in fact perfectly healthy. 

But those words hurt her. Its not just a one off occurence. People put down skinny women all the time. Remember that quote “real men like curves, dogs like bones?” It is so fucking offensive. And whats up with those ads saying that they use “real models” who look like “real women”. What even constitutes a real woman? Just because Im a certain BMI, Im not real?

I have even had strangers (e.g. makeup artists/stylists) try to put their hands around my waist while saying how tiny it is. WTF? How is that remotely ok?

I am fed up. It is impolite to tell a person how fat they are, or that they’ve gained weight, but its perfectly normal to tell a person that they are sooooo skinny? I hate that in this society you have to put down a group of women in order to make another group feel validated. How about we all agree that we don’t judge people based on their body figure? How about we agree that its not your BMI that makes you more or less of a woman??

TL;DR: Long vent about how society treats skinny people."
I cried at the shoe store buying new shoes for my wife,"I'm a full grown 36 year old man, two children, one wife.
I've seen a fair share of good times, and some significant deal of pain and misery in the past few years.
Yesterday, I could finally afford to buy new birthday shoes for my wife, as her only pair for the past 3 years is beyond worn out. We were at the store, and while she was trying them on, something got a grip on me, and it just broke me inside. Kind of this gigantic happiness / sorrow feeling at the same time, and I just broke a few tears. Something to do with providing for the ones you love when you have nothing left, and feeling like an absolute, unequivocal and complete failure.

TL;DR: Bought wife new birthday shoes. Cried at the store. Wimp.

Sorry, I had really no one to talk to, and this has been creeping on my head since yesterday. Carry on. Thank you."
I'm a fucking circus act...,"Last night I was browsing NSFW subreddits looking to get off, when I thought to myself, wouldn't a cock ring be great? It'll keep you hard and a little bigger than normal. The problem is I don't own any cock rings. No problem! I'll just take my keys of this key ring and it will do! Fit great. When I was soft. But now I'm hard, and I can't get it off. And the only way it will come off is if I am soft, but the ring is keeping me hard. Chicken or the egg. Fuck. 

After a couple hours I'm getting blotches on my skin so I get scared and go to the ER. Apparently extended erections are considered serious and I was quickly brought to an exam room. I'm hoping I get some old dude or woman so there's no sexual tension because I was embarassed enough telling my story to the triage nurse. Nope. In walk a resident and a nurse. Nurse was early twenties and the resident was late 20s. Thankfully they are courteous and polite so not too bad so far. They've likely seen worse anyways.

They first tried ice to get it soft but it didn't work. The resident then tries to bend out the ends of the key ring with pliars, to open it up enough for me to slide my junk out. She can't get a proper grip. ""No problem nursejizzer, we have a few more things to try. We're going to try some lube next.""

Fuck. This resident in her late 20s is now lubing my shaft and trying to tug the key ring off. This isn't stimulating me at all... no clearly not making me more aroused or hard...

Doesn't matter. Key ring won't budge. Her and the nurse leave and they come back with a drill that has a diamond tipped bit. They tell me this will cut the key ring off and I'll be good to go. WELL GUESS WHAT. Drills vibrate. So now I've got this nurse and resident taking a fucking vibrating drill to my dick. I could tell I was going to orgasm before much longer, but I'm in enough discomfort and the drill is too loud that I'm unable to tell them to stop. Yup. Eventually I got to the point of orgasm and I splooged all over the nurses scrubs. She had to go change. But they got the key ring off. 

My dick is purple and blue and hurts like crazy and has a few cuts from all the work the ER did trying to get it off.

I am a fucking circus act."
Can’t sleep after what I saw at the ER TODAY. Always wear your seatbelt or this can happen to you. Hope you can learn from this.,"It’s was probably 2:45 AM when a patient was rushed in. To my shock there was 2 of them in a stretcher a M & F. I though it was one of those case where a man’s penis got stuck in a girls vagina. But it wasn’t, instead it’s something much worst, that I can’t keep the images out of my mind, 

What I saw was the left side forehead of the girl was impaled by the mans upper teeth, his lower jaw was hanging where blood was dripping out,and his right leg was in a weird position, an arm broken, his feet was twisted GOD. The girls face was full of blood. They both have lacerations and bruises in their body, but the guy has more of them. 

After the surgery to separate the guys teeth from the girls skull, we quickly tried to resuscitate them. The guy. He was gone, we already knew during the surgery, there was no life in him anymore. The girl showed sign of life but in critical condition. She was moved in the ICU where she continued to fight for her life. Unfortunately she expired 6 hours later beside her grieving family & friends.

I later learned that they were involved in a vehicular accident. They were on their way home after a drinking session and partying. They were on the back seat of the car, the girl was wearing seatbelt but the guy wasn’t. In the front was their friend who is driving and his GF. The accident happened after the driver dropped of his GF in her apartment. While on the highway, reports indicated that they were running 40 mph over the speed limit, and the driver and the passengers were drunk. The vehicle veered off the road where it flipped multiple times. The driver survived thanks to his seatbelt. The guy not wearing his seatbelt got thrown around like a rag doll where his  upper teeth ended up on someone’s forehead killing them both.

So guys wear your seatbelts always and encourage other to wear them. Even if it’s just one person that’s not wearing their seatbelt, it can harm u and the passengers too."
I got pregnant too soon.,"I love my boyfriend and he loves me dearly. We've only been together for a year, but I think we can go the distance. We're planning to move in together in October. When his coworkers tease him about how he 'better put a ring on it', he says, 'I will'.

But we weren't prepared for this surprise baby. I don't even have a full time job. We both rent rooms in apartments where there is no space for a baby. I didn't know I was even pregnant until the third trimester. We decided that adoption would be the best option.

But then I went into labor, had an emergency c section, and gave birth to the most beautiful baby boy I had ever seen. He had my boyfriends nose and lips, my eyes and hair, and I fell in love with him at first sight. While I recovered from the surgery and we organized the adoption, we stayed in the hospital room. For 3 days, I nursed him and we burped him and changed his diapers. We laughed at the faces he made, marveled at how much he looked like us, calmed him when he was crying...

And then we gave him to his adoptive family. 

Its been two weeks, and I still cry whenever I think of our baby boy. I can't even watch a TV show that mentions adoption without breaking down. It is the hardest thing I have ever done. I only hope that in a few years, when I have a husband and a house and the time is right to have a child, I will able to look back at his adoption and forgive my past self for making this choice."
The sweetest thing anyone has done for me,"Tonight I was working at my delivery job and my girlfriend ordered pizza just to be able to see me and give me a slice and a kiss. Honestly it would be just as sweet but less of a big deal if we didn't live together because I had just seen her before work. but I just started this job and she was trying to help me out on a shitty night but I didn't get to deliver the order:( It doesn't even matter though, the fact that she would just do it makes me tear up. She is truly the love of my life and I just wanted to tell someone how happy it made me since I don't wanna wake her. Thanks Reddit."
My 10 year old son inadvertently came out to me this morning...,"My wife and I have known for a long time. Me moreso than my wife. I've suspected it since he was even younger than he is now. probably around age 6 or 7 is when I started noticing the more feminine side of him. 

**the past**: At first.... the fear. He is my oldest son. Was I not exposing him to enough ""manly things""? That's a ridiculous notion. But it was there. Was I not being fatherly enough? Maybe I should ""toughen him up"". I chalked a lot of that up to my strict religious upbringing. Perhaps it was just a phase. Did I even *want* him to grow out of this? No. I was better than this. 

A while ago, my wife and I took some pictures and video of our sexy times. My youngest (2 years old) got a hold of my wife's phone and has a habit of randomly scrolling through pictures, apps, etc. Of course HE doesn't know what he's doing... but my other kids.. they have a knack for technology and my 10 year old... well... he got a hold of the phone to politely take it away from the 2 year old. Well, 10 year old got his first glimpse at what oral sex looks like unbeknownst to us. 

He received a tablet for his birthday this year and is HUGE into minecraft. He loves watching Minecraft videos. Harmless, right?

**the present** This morning, he had gotten into a bit of trouble and he had his tablet put in time out. I went through and started looking at his youtube history (not suspecting anything but wanted to actually see the latest minecraft videos he was checking out)... harmless stuff... tons of harmless stuff...

And then a wild ""Sucking on Boy Cock"" search string appears. Followed by ""Naked boys"" and so on and so forth. 

**Deer in headlights**

Um.... Honey, it's time to have a little chat with little man. Am I ready for ""the talk"" already? Is my son having homosexual tendencies that I had already suspected? Am I going to have to have a double whammy of a chat with him?

Yes, yes and definitely **Yes**.

Now, some won't agree with me, but my this kinda screams the ""born this way"" argument. Why? Because my son has no idea what sex is.. STILL for the most part. After discussing the video that he saw (which had him very embarrassed), he tells me that he searched the first thing (sucking on boy cocks) because of what he saw on my wife's phone. He didn't understand ""why"" she was doing it.

After explaining the normal ""when two people love or are attracted to each other"" etc etc, I ask him about the ""naked boys"" searches, etc. Then I ask him ""Does your penis get hard when you look at stuff like this?""

""... yes""

""When you look at boobs?""

""...... yeah""

""When you look at a boys penis?""

""....""  ""... yeah""...

""... actually dad, not so much the first thing. As in... not at all"".

**And I will always love that boy.**

I explained to him that it was perfectly normal. It was SO easy to say. It was natural. I explained to him that his mother and I would support him 100%... always. I told him that if he truly grows up liking guys... that he may have some opposition, but if **anyone** ever says anything to him... that they have to come through us. from that moment, he eased. He was happy. He was the most open he'd ever been with me... then us.

I will always love my boy. And I'm glad that he was able to be so open with us this morning. Now... before he grew up a bit and felt like he had to hide it... it makes me happy that it's out of the way. I will always be frank, open, honest and supportive of all of my kids...

And that boy... as he grows into being a man... will always have me in his corner.

**Edit** Holy shit, I go away to work and check in on my phone and this has blown up! Whoever gave me gold, thank you! Wasn't expecting that all. I'm going to need to wait to reply to everyone tonight but I'm extremely flattered by what most of you said. I just want to be the best father I can be (cause like Shaq said, MY biological didn't bother...). I'll answer some quick common questions: 

* We removed the video/pics long ago... this happened a while back and he didn't know how to approach us about what he saw.

* We aren't going to be pushing him in any direction, we're going to let him grow into his own. I should have clarified. We wanted him to know that he can love whomever he wants too, man or woman... and that we'd support him regardless. We know it's open ended, we know he is young. 

* No we're not exposing him to porn now. That's a bit much.

* When I was 10, I knew full well that I liked boobs, but had zero concept (like him) what to do with my equipment... nor did I have a deep interest. I just knew that boobs were awesome.

I think I covered the most common questions.

**BIG DISCLAIMER** I DID mention to him though not to search for things like that, especially using the term ""naked boys"". I don't need Chris Hansen showing up at my door. He knows that's a no no... and is happy to research the latest minecraft mods and videos.

**BIG DISCLAIMER #2** No, he has not been molested!? WTF. His search was so descriptive as he was curious as tonthe nature of what he saw on the videobhe mistakenly found featuring me and the Mrs! "
"My (20M) girlfriend (18F) was raped at a party we were both at, feel like a failure.","I never thought about opening up about this but I need to get it out there or I'm going to explode.

Back in October, me and my girlfriend of 2.5+ years went to her coworker's Halloween party. They had just met, but this chick offered to take us to this ""banger"". Little did we know, it was actually a get-together of people who were already well acquainted. The liquor started flowing, the pot was broken out, and it was honestly a good time initially. However, there was a point in time when I was so drunk all I wanted to do was play Mario Kart. 

I hadn't even thought of where my girlfriend might be.

The party concluded without incident, but a week ago, my girlfriend confided in me that she was raped at that party. She says she was drugged, for she only remembers going in and out of the experience of getting raped. I know she's not lying to me, because after the party, she has become fundamentally more depressed. She has been relapsing into cutting and drugging, along with being way more irritable. It all makes sense, now that she finally opened up to me.

I feel like a failure. I was at the same party as her. I should've been watching her, should have been by her side. If I had just hung out with my girlfriend that night, instead of withdrawing and playing Mario Kart, this would have never happened. No one else would've been inside of her but me, and now when I try to go to sleep all I can think about is what she must have felt. Then the anger starts to set in... the seething rage.....

To whoever took the time to read this, thank you. Even if nobody reads this, at least I feel better now that it's all said. I just wish I could slowly torture and kill that motherfucking disgusting piece of trash excuse for a human being..... "
"I want to smack every ""christian"" at a local church. They are calling a 16 year old girl ""the devil"" for going to police about being assaulted by the preachers son.","I live in the suburbs of DC and a local church youth pastor was arrested recently for inappropriately touching a 16 year old girl and sending her explicit text messages. After reading the news article I wanted to see what statement the church may have released and went to their Facebook page. They of course deny the allegations after having ""conducted their own investigation."" They actually had John Grey come to their church this weekend, I believe as a distraction from what happened.  That did not surprise me. What surprised me and actually enraged me were the comments from the church's congregation. There is an OUTPOURING of support for this abuser and people are actually calling this little girl the devil! As a woman I am disgusted, as a MOTHER I AM ENRAGED!!!

I am not religious, my family does not attend church. But I have friends that attend that church every Sunday. Friends who's children were around this animal and could have easily become a victim. But NONE of my friends have spoken up for this girl. On the Facebook page I found less than a dozen messages of support/prayer for the victim.   

These are some of the comments: 

Praying for my church and church family during this time. We know this is the devil at work and that the truth will prevail

Praying for our Church family! No lies will prosper in Jesus' name! Jesus let your light shine in this situation and bring peace!

I hear the Lord saying OVER THE TOP GRACE for the Baird family. Let the Lord fight this battle for you. Rest in the Lord and let every lying tongue be silenced in Jesus name!

Satan certainly is attacking The Life Church because God is using TLC to save His children from him!!

I am just sad. Sad that a little girl was brave enough to come forward and tell authorities about a youth pastor she trusted took advantage of her but our community is bashing her online. I hope this girl is staying off of social media and does not do anything drastic like commit suicide or hurt herself.

He’s Going to Marry Me,"I’ve met the love of my life. 

We met in a college music class and bonded through our mutual love of jazz and Broadway. He helped me through an emotionally turbulent relationship, and he didn’t even make a move on me at the time. I thought we were just good friends, and that he would never have any kind of romantic feelings for me. But one night we were sitting in my car and he held my hand. And we have been attached to each other ever since. 

We spent the next few months together, and for the first time in my life I was supported and understood. One day, upon reflection, I realized our once separate and intangible futures had quietly woven themselves together. 

The other day we were standing in his kitchen, hugging and talking. All of a sudden he turned around and starting rummaging through his cabinet, only to pull out a ring sizer. He calmly took my ring size, thanked me, and continued the conversation as if nothing had happened. My heart hasn’t stopped singing since that moment. 

He’s going to propose. I don’t know when, I don’t know how, but he is going to marry me. This man, my best friend, my partner, my soulmate, wants to keep me forever. 

I know this is not an exceptional story, but it’s mine. I never saw my future until he showed it to me. And I will be grateful for the rest of my life. "
I finally did it.,"After a horrible breakup from her cheating, her calling me ugly, feeling like absolute shit everyday, abusing alcohol and almost getting into drugs, I finally made a decision 9 months ago that would change me forever. A decision that would produce a better version of myself.

I stepped into the gym, I pushed through all my obstacles, removed all the limits that my mind had put on me, pushed my body to the max. 5 days a week, every week, every month, no matter how sore I was, no matter how much I just wanted to give up, I pushed through it all. The only person every stopping me......was me and I beat the old me and produced a new me.

This journey has taught me alot about myself, my perserverance, my resilience, my motivation to never give up in anything that I do. If I was disciplined enough to lose 80 pounds of physical baggage  and ton of emotional baggage in 9 months, then I can do anything I set my mind to, anything.

So take that step. That huge f\*ckin step towards a better you. Do it for yourself, no one else.

Don't let those tears blind you from seeing your worth. Those thoughts chain you in darkness. Cut out all the voices that tried to silence you. Stand tall, unleash yourself, instill fear in those who always tried to keep you at bay. You are your greatest weapon. Now rise.

**THANK YOU:**

From the bottom of my heart, thank you all for your kind comments. I've always wanted to be a voice to reach people, motivate and inspire them towards positivity. Your comments have shown me that I am even capable of doing that :) 

To everyone who wants to get started at the gym and feel like they won't be able to keep it up: Do 10 pushups, every night before you go to bed.  Make this a routine, something that if you don't do, you just can't sleep knowing you didn't do it. If you're consistent with this for two weeks. Take the next step towards entering the gym.

Although we are all strangers in this life, we all understand what it means to be in pain, to be frustrated with ourselves, and to believe that we are insignificant in this world. But we are capable of soooo much more than we believe. It is us that stops us from pushing forward in achieving greatness. We tend to shackle ourselves to what we think we are worth. I'm telling you now that every single one of you are priceless. Even the smallest gear in a machine needs to be active in order for the entire system to function. Do things in life that will bring you joy and happiness, don't settle for anything less, and don't let any voice tell you otherwise. When we start to realize our worth, we become a powerful force, and when powerful forces group together towards something good, nothing can stop us, nothing.  I encourage those who were inspired by my story to inspire others with yours. You may think it is insignificant, but trust me, even motivating one person towards positive change is a huge step towards changing this world of ours for the better. I believe in all of you and I will be cheering for you. Know that you are not alone, I am here for you.

If anyone has questions or wants to talk to me about anything, please message me :) 

Once again, thank you :)"
My husband fucked my ass last night. {NSFW},"And it was fucking amazing. We have been together close to ten years, our sex life is perfect... I didn't think it could get better, but it did last night. I made a throwaway to post here because he told me I couldn't tell my best friend... but I just feel the need to tell someone. It was so wonderful, I just need to talk about it. Does that make sense? 



I have never felt so close to him or so loved by him than I did in that moment. He kept whispering in my ear ""take your time"" and ""I will stay hard all night...just take your time"" 



He was caressing my all over, rubbing my back and thighs and arms and was just being so gentle and loving. At one point I thought I might cry... not from the pain but from the sheer love I felt coming from him. I know this sounds so cheesy...but it was magical. I literally can't think of another word to describe it.



We work together and we have been giving each other googly eyes all morning. I feel like I'm 20 again! 


Anyway, thanks for listening. I hope you all have as good of a day as I'm having!

"
My sons's teacher is putting him on advanced curriculum.,"I was 17 when I had my son... you don't need to tell me how dumb I was.  I know.  We are now 6 and 23.  

I've made a lot of dumb mistakes as a parent.  And not just of the 'oh dear, I accidentally let the baby fall off the bed, I feel awful' variety.  I mean monetary mistakes.  Maturity mistakes.  I have put myself first several times.  I have not always been the most nurturing parent.  There are times I have severely regretted having him, I've never been able to give him what he deserves.  We are poor as shit.  We're at least 5 minutes late to school 25% of the time.  I'm kind of a mess, extremely disorganized, and my house is often a disaster area.  We've almost been homeless before, because of my mistakes.

But on the other hand... I can honestly say I have become a much better parent because of that regret I mentioned, my mistakes have forced me to look at myself and it lead to some uncomfortable but necessary revelations.  There are many good things I can say about myself as a parent- I don't ever hit and seldom yell, I am very calm and patient with him.  I make an effort to be emotionally available and to talk stuff through with him, to understand him.  I do my best to be involved in his schooling and take his education seriously.  And I am and have always been, very affectionate and loving towards him.  

And I have been greatly rewarded.  I've heard every parent thinks their kid is perfect- I do not.  However, I can see that he is a very kind, compassionate, and intelligent person.  The first signs of maturity are beginning to rear their head-the ability to logically reason with others, delaying gratification, learning social boundaries, putting others before himself, thinking before acting and speaking. 

Yesterday my son's teacher called to inform me that she was putting him on advanced curriculum for reading, spelling and math because he was way ahead of where he should be.  I was so proud I got choked up on the phone and kept thanking her.  When I got off the phone I cried like a baby.  I dunno, I'm not an overly sentimental person, but yesterday pride and confirmation of my not-totally-failing overwhelmed me.  I'm faced with the idea every day that my son and I are what's wrong with society, that we're the scum of the earth because I'm a poor young mom and he's my bastard spawn.  But he's not- we're not- he's a child as healthy and capable as his peers, and I am raising him okay.  Maybe it's not quite right, but it's okay.

**EDIT:** Holy crap, this really blew up.  I got off work to a big surprise.  I really appreciate all your kind words and comments, and a big thank you to whomever bought me Gold!  That was just so thoughtful, thank you.  I have to clean up and make dinner but I'm going to try to make time to respond to each and every one of your thoughtful comments.  I have such a huge smile on my face and just really don't know how to thank you enough."
I just ate four pieces of pizza.,"After trying -- and failing -- to recover from an eating disorder for the past three years, I just had four pieces of pizza and did not hate myself, feel guilty, or feel the urge to vomit. I'm proud of myself for getting this far! And boy, am I stuffed. :)

how many times did you touch me in the night?,"this is going to be long.

​

i am 15 and female. my oldest brother was apprehended by the police earlier this year. he abused me as my guardian. i stayed quiet about it for a number of reasons, and it only came out for reasons i will go into in dms if you want to know.

​

i dont remember much of it. that is, the times i was awake to even notice it.

​

what i do remember clearly?

​

i remember you commenting on how much my breasts had grown when i saw you, my oldest brother, for the first time in years. i remember you regularly lay on top of me, rubbing your dick onto my ass. or you would use my butt as a pillow or wear my underwear on your head. i remember you, asking me if id ever masturbated, and then telling me about how you would masturbate before you worked out as we lied there in our parents' bed. i remember the first time (the first time i was awake for it at least) i thought it was just some sort of accident. that maybe, just maybe, you really were just looking for the dog in my bed, in my bedroom with a closed door, at 1:30 am. i think i wanted to believe that instead of that you were just trying to peel my shorts back quietly. i remember the feeling of your disgusting trembling fingers prying into my underwear and the sound of you sucking your fingers off before disappearing into the bathroom, and the sound of the toilet flushing that stuff away

​

and you said that we were simply siblings. that there was nothing to be so antsy about. when i would shove your head off my ass and say ""stop it, its uncomfortable"", you would reply with ""what? why is it so uncomfortable? its comfortable for me haha"" stop it. stop it stop it stop it i told you already stop fucking touching me it makes me feel nauseous

​

you told me that you only wanted me to indulge your whims. what the fuck does that mean? you wanted me to indulge your whim to fuck your baby sister? that you wanted me to open up to you and talk to you about my feeeewwings? fuck no. im not doing that. how could i do that?

​

i refused to tell you about how more and more i would grow anxious about going home. how fucking nauseated i would feel thinking about you or being near you. how angry and helpless i would feel whenever someone said ""wow, you must be so happy and so grateful you have a big brother to take care of you while your parents are gone!"" i would just have to jokingly laugh and say ""nah he sucks"". i really think fingering your baby sister while she's asleep isnt a 'sibling thing'.

​

and the more i would ignore you, or refuse to open up to you, the more you would yell at me. you would grab me while you had your tantrums when you came home late from work. you would get a knife and slam it into the kitchen bench over and over again, destroy the cupboards. you would slam the front door and i would hear and watch you speed away in the car, heart beating a million miles an hour. you shattered our childhood photos because you were frustrated that our depressed brother would stay in bed all day. you would go through my things and look through my laptop and even our brother's computer which i used for a week.

​

i almost broke down in fear when i remembered you knew where i was eating dinner at with my friends the day you were being apprehended. i was expecting to see you arrive at the door, knife in hand. you pervaded my thoughts in a time i should have felt free and happy.

​

you said that i was dead to you because you were told i was having a crisis and was sleeping over at a friends house.

​

when our two brothers found out they broke down. they cried and cried, choked by guilt and shame that they couldnt do anything to protect me. and thats not even close to how our parents must have felt.

​

you stomped on the hearts of every single member of my family.

​

you are a toxic, sociopathic creature.

​

if i have to testify against you in court i hope i see you cry when the sentence is read.

&#x200B;

edit: thank you, all, for all the kind words and encouragement you've given me. you've made the day of some angsty teen lol. im dreading going to school rn but ive already missed the past two days so im going to drag myself over in an hour or two."
I found my person,I think I found the person I can see myself building a life with. It’s only been a couple months but I’ve never felt this way about anyone before.
Dear son,"Dear son,

I’ve wanted to tell you the story about your mom and I for some time. Perhaps it’s my busy schedule at work or the story’s length that has made me put this off for a while but I’ve finally found time.  We met as teenagers in a volunteer program.  It wasn’t love at first sight like she tells you.  We weren’t even friends when we started. It wasn’t until we graduated from high school that things started.  Her and I were talking and realized we were taking the same class in college.  Since she was taking the bus, I offered to pick her up and take her to campus to save her some time. And so we went to our morning class together. Administration of Justice is what we had. We yawned, I slept, and she did her work for other more important classes. 

Over time, we started to hang out more.  We would talk for hours and hours about the most random of things. I’d give her a ride home from school or our volunteer program and we’d just sit in the car talking. Our friends started accusing us of dating but we both told them we were just friends.  Nonetheless, we continued to talk and hang out as friends.  

During my second year in college, my family moved out of our apartment and into a house about 20 miles away. Being from Los Angeles, it was a 20 mile drive but a one hour commute. I got a new job with better pay. Things were looking up for me.  On one particular day, I didn’t have class and decided to go into work late. Whether fate or just coincidence, I got a phone call from mom. She was stressing out. Parking Enforcement placed a boot, a wheel lock on her tire to stop her from moving her car. Apparently she had unpaid parking tickets on the car she just bought. She was stuck in the middle of Hollywood with no clue what to do. For whatever reason, she called me. 

So I got ready for work, jumped into my car, and drove to pick her up. I took her to the parking enforcement office and then took off. I didn’t think anything of it. I was helping out a friend. So now I had to drive from Downtown LA to another county (55 miles, 1.5 hrs away).  I took off and that was that. 
Fast forward a few days later and she calls me. She invites me to go out with her friends from high school to a club. Your dad can dance now but he couldn’t side step to save his life back then. I hesitantly said yes and dressed as best as I could for the night. She introduced me to her friends and we all had a great time. It was the first time I had ever gone to a club. At some point on the dance floor, I looked at her dancing, smiling, and having a good time. It was at that moment that I thought I could date this girl. Heck, I could be in a long term relationship with her.  

After several attempts to ask her to date me, she realized I was the man of her dreams. Well, maybe not that far but she gave me a chance. I told her I wasn’t a typical guy. That I wouldn’t make a stupid mistake like cheating on her, making her feel bad, or anything to jeopardize a relationship. She trusted me and went with it.  We dated for about 6 months before I told her I loved her.  I was a dork back then. I didn’t do things right but she stuck along for the bumpy ride.  

It was five years after I asked her out that I proposed to her. She was expecting me to ask long before that day but I made her wait. Well, we made each other wait. She was starting her Master’s program, I was just starting a new job. Things were looking up for us. But she’ll tell you she patiently waited for me.  And that she did. So much so that she wasn’t expecting me to propose when I did. We had just finished dinner on a cruise. She wanted to check out the casino but I asked her if we could step out onto the deck for a minute. She hesitantly said yes since it was cold outside.  We stood near the rail and looked into the darkness. I looked up into the sky and saw the stars.  I was nervous but not because of the idea of proposing. I was nervous about the idea of the rest of our lives.  I started to tell her about how our friendship started and I thought we were just friends. And how it developed. I told her that I knew we would be the best married couple out there because our friendship was strong. That I knew our love would last. She said yes.  

Fast forward two years later. We bought a home, finished our education, and had amazing careers. We traveled to a few places but were eager to visit more. Then one day, she tells me she is pregnant.  Her eyes shined and her smile was the biggest I had ever seen it.  I was thrilled to start a family with her.  Our friends were also having kids. It was like everything was happening at the right time.  

I’ve wanted to tell you this story for a while. It’s been five years now. Your mom smiles but she’s not the same.  She thinks a lot about stuff and stresses a lot.  Her job doesn’t make it any easier since she works with kids.  She’s gone through a lot for you.  I’ll always support her because I love her.  I hide what I feel because I need to be strong for her. You see, I haven’t been able to tell you this story personally.  I’ve never met you. Five years ago we lost you before you were born.  And time after time we have tried. Doctors have tried helping and we still can’t.  And so I’m writing this to you so that you know that you are loved by a couple that wants nothing more than to hold you, love you, and watch you grow. 
 
Love always

Edit: Thank you for the gold.  I'd trade it for him any day."
Are you aware that I can hear you?,"Sitting in my apartment all alone, it's nice to see my penis again.  I've been fat for a really long time, and my belly is pretty big.  Although, not as big as it has been; I've been dieting and exercising intensely this winter.  I'd say I've dropped 25 pounds in six weeks.

In my living room chair, with my legs up and my back a bit reclined, I've been staring at my penis.  It's not erect.  I'm not masturbating.  I'm just moving it around, looking at it, like an old friend I haven't seen in years.  It's changed a little, but not much.  Still the same old dick.

Suddenly, I hear a noise coming from behind me.  It comes on quietly at first, airy and faint, but with a rhythmic insistence that catches my attention.  Soon it percolates through the wall with more intensity, and it becomes clear that my next-door neighbor is getting properly fucked.  She isn't overly loud, but when she comes, I hear it clearly enough that there's no mistaking its cause.

Of course, she could be masturbating, but the rhythm is so perfect, it's hard for me not to imagine another man pounding in and out of her, like a sexual conductor helping the orchestrations of her orgasm keep time.

Whenever I hear her, I turn my head and smile.  It's nice to think someone, somewhere nearby, is happy, and not as alone as I feel.  Maybe if I keep losing weight I'll find a girl to fuck me loud enough to send sounds through the walls.  Who knows... maybe it will be her.

I should put some pants on."
"My rapist named me in his suicide note, saying how I ruined his life. I don't even know what to say...","Oh, wait, yes I do

EDIT: Thanks for the gold and all the kind comments, as well as the PM accusing me of making it up. You're not the first one to do that bub."
"""Well every straight guy has said/thought this..."" No, fuck you, that's just you, you creep.","The following was brought on by people's response to Trump's latest fiasco. I don't really want to weigh in on anyone's fitness to be president because that's just not a discussion I want to have right now. 

I'm so sick of every time some dude gets in trouble with the press for his dumb comments about women, all these fuckboys come out of the woodwork defending him with ""Well any straight guy has had this conversation with his friends,"" or ""all men wish they could own women, it's just a matter of money""(actual quote). 

No man. That's just you and some people like you. You're a creep. When I go out, my goal isn't to trick or coerce or bribe women into sex, I just want to have a nice time. So you know what I do? I just treat them like people. And sometimes it works. And when it does, I don't brag about how easy it was, because I was just as easy. You don't have to put women on a pedestal, just treat them like you would any other person. Fuck's sake. Stop lumping me in with y'all."
bedbugs haunt me. and I can’t tell anyone.,"Hello. I am a college sophomore. My senior year of high school my parent’s house was infested with bed bugs. I had but no choice to live with them. I spent almost a year living with them simply because every time we exterminated the bugs came back and we couldn’t afford to move/burn everything. Going off to college was the best thing ever. Living bed bug free was so nice. In my freshman year however it turns out some followed me. The college paid for treatment and finally finally finally I was bug free! No sign of bedbugs until now, over a year later. I am home for winter break and I discovered one in my bedroom, the day i got back. 

I have always lived in a house that I am embarrassed to bring my friends over to. Everyone’s is so much nicer. I know it is not my parents fault, they try very hard... It is just so absolutely frustrating. We emptied out my room and bug bombed the house again. I am going to sleep on the couch tonight but....... I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. All semester I have been looking forward to sleeping in my bed with the door closed and no roommates, just being alone and comfortable. Now I do not even get to do that. I can not tell my friends because then they would know how awful I live. I feel like I live a double life sometimes. The real me, the poor me, and the put together me I present to my friends. I want to be home, I really do. It is just hard. 

Thank you for listening to my first-world problem whining. "
My last hour with my wife and I cant stop hoping I wont make it home,"My wife has been in the ICU for over a week now and she wasn't able to pull through, she passed yesterday but we've kept her body alive so she could donate her organs and hopefully improve or save other's lives.

Now I'm sitting in her room with her cherishing the last bit of alone time we will ever get, even though she's already gone. I just for the life of me can't stop hoping something takes me too, I don't know where to go from here, she's been my life for the past 5 years and she's only 31, I'm 28 and I don't know how to find my purpose again, hopefully I can find my way.

I'm not saying I'm going to do anything reckless, I'd never do that...I just wish I could still be with her after this and I can't... As I've been driving between home and the hospital these past few days I can't shake the faint hope that something happens, something that can bring me to her so I don't have to carry on with that hole in my heart."
I got the fucker,"He tried to rape me Wednesday morning. The past few days, I've wondered if I did the right thing by reporting him and have been hoping that I was wrong, and everything was really just a misunderstanding. I filed a police report Thursday afternoon. This morning, a different detective than the one I talked to on Thursday called me and left me a voicemail, saying that my case had been transferred to him and that he could explain why.

When I called him back, he told me that the reason my case had been transferred to him was because another woman reported the man who tried to rape me for assault. They would only be able to charge him with a misdemeanor in her case because they couldn't prove sexual intent. With my case, they can charge him with a felony.

I looked it up, and in my state, sexual assault is a class three felony, which means 2-24 years in prison. I got him. He is going to be put away. They can actually stop him.

The past few days I had been so torn, wondering if I was doing the right thing. When I talked to the detective and he said that the assailant had bruised the other woman's neck by trying to choke her, I broke down. It breaks my heart that he hurt her, and has probably hurt a lot of other women. He hurt her and countless others, and I can stop him. I can stop him from ever doing this again. I can protect anyone else he would have hurt in the future, and I can save the people he has hurt in the past. I got him, I can stop him, and I can't stop crying about it. Crying because I'm happy, because justice is being served, because I'm angry that he had the audacity to do this to people, because I'm angry that he hadn't been stopped sooner, because he hurt people, because I have a chance to protect people from him.

I got the fucker. I'm going to do everything in my power to make sure he goes to prison and can never hurt someone again. Even if he doesn't go to prison I'll have done everything I could to stop him, and will continue to try and stop him. I just can't believe I got him.

Edit: I'm shocked at how this blew up. Thank you to everyone for supporting me and reaffirming me. Anyone with the mindset that this should be reported is a hero in their own way. Too many people let things like this go for whatever reason, and it needs to stop. We, as a society, need to stop behavior like this. Thank you for everything you do or wish you could do. Intent is important, and anyone who wishes they could change behavior like the behavior exhibited by my assailant is the change that I wish I saw more of in the world. You're all heroes for helping me in whatever way you can, and I can't stop crying from how relieved I am that you're here. Thank you."

I euthanized your pet today,"Today i was the person you handed your ancient lab to now that shes too old and in too much pain to walk anymore. I am the person you gave your beautiful grey Persian to because her kidneys have finally failed. I am the person you gave your sweet little chihuahua to because the cancer took over. 

I want you to know that i kept giving her back her favorite cow stuffie whenever she accidentally knocked it off the table. I want you to know that we made sure to maneuver in her favorite carrier because she was more comfortable there. I want you to know that he loved the treats we lavished him with, and i made sure to break them up into soft bite sized pieces. 

I held them all, over the years, for whatever reason you gave them to me. I held them like i have my own when it was time. I'm sorry if i seemed worn and im sorry if i didn't have quite the right thing to say. Ive never been great at speaking. I just wanted you to know im doing everything possible to make it as calm and loving as i can.
And i cried the whole drive home like you. 

Edit: Woah, thank you everyone for the niceness and kind words! and I also very much appreciate the gold mystery redditors, i will learn about it forthwith. I wrote it as an expressing thing because i worry that people view us as faceless and cold when really we do see and feel each one as an individual and treasured family member. The sad but beautiful stories you told me shows me that's not the case. Thank you.

Edit: also, sorry for coincidentally making you guys cry at work.

I forgot about my suicide plan,"A few months ago I stole some chloroform from my lab incase I ever wanted to commit suicide. I wrapped it up and hid it away so that if I ever needed it, I could use it in the future just in case. Well, I honestly forgot I had it. And that makes me kind of happy. I wont get rid of it, but the fact that I've been happy enough (or not as depressed) to not think about a real possibility of suicide is pretty cool"
I just called CPS on my neighbors,"I still feel sick to my stomach. I've been on the fence about calling for the last few months but today I listened to a man screaming verbal abuse and hitting his little kids for 10 minutes straight. No one should have to live like that and I hope that whatever the outcome, these kids will have a better life.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone replying to this post. I mostly just posted here to get this off my chest, but I really appreciate hearing everyone's perspectives on this and I just hope things work out in these kids' favor."
My nephew tried to kill his bully. He is eight.,"For the past two years, my nephew has been tormented by this kid in his class, but since it has never escalated past childish insults and teasing it was not treated as a serious issue and apparently he went ignored.

Yesterday, at lunch, my nephew's bully punched him in the stomach. My nephew did as he was taught and went to a teacher for help, but the punch left no bruises and the teacher did not believe him. He was sent back to the cafeteria and the bully hit him in the face. He went to another teacher who essentially told the bully to behave, but did not punish him, and sent my nephew back to the cafeteria.

Apparently, my nephew was so afraid of going back to lunch with this kid that he bought a packet of peanuts, well aware that his bully is highly allergic to peanuts, and dumped them in his bully's food. He was caught and sent to the office.

The bully called his dad, who was understandibly outraged. The teachers started questioning my nephew about what happened and why he tried to kill this other kid. My nephew was scared and upset and ashamed; when he tried to tell the teachers about the bullying, he began to cry. They told him he shouldn't be crying, he tried to kill someone. They called him a murderer, even.

He is eight years old. He is a bright, gentle, intelligent, sweet kid. He is not a budding sociopath. What he did was terrible and wrong, but can't anyone see the bigger problem? He needed help. He was ignored. He did what everyone told him was the 'right' thing to do and it accomplished nothing. Things got worse and he was still dismissed. He felt so desperate that he tried to kill someone.

At eight years old.

My heart is breaking. My nephew has so much promise and potential. He is so smart, so kind and wonderful. He does not deserve this. He is suspended from school and they want to charge him with some kind of attempted murder for kids. His life has barely even started and it's already fucked."
i made it. it feels surreal,"first generation college student. grew up poor as fuck. went to a top private college on a full scholarship. surrounded by pampered, private-schooled rich kids. felt out of place as fuck and insecure about my upbringing. i was always trying to cut corners and feeling like i wasn't able to enjoy college life as much as my more well-off friends got to.

i just got a full-time job offer that i honestly thought i wasn't qualified for. i'll be graduating next month, and at 22 will be making more money than my parents ever made in their entire lives.

i made it."
My wife caught me doing something that I've kept a secret from everyone I know.,"I'm a grown man. 

I have a career, I own a home, and a child on the way.

I have a dark secret that I have never revealed to anyone.

I play with Mortal Kombat action figures.

I don't mean play as in set them up in my office. I mean I write stories. I make sound effects. I have voices for each character.

I literally play with toys. 

Today, my wife caught me. 

She apparently had been watching me the entire time. I turned around and thought she'd laugh at me and think I'm a weirdo, or some pathetic nerd. 

I explained to her why I kept this hidden from her and everyone else.

She said to me ""I married you because I love you. You should be able to trust me, I don't care that you're doing this, if it's a hobby of yours and you enjoy doing it, then go ahead. It doesn't change you or who you are. The only way I look at you differently know, is now I know when the time comes you're going to be a better father than I thought.""

she gave me a kiss and then left.

my wife is amazing


EDIT: For those interested, after my wife did this I really felt lucky. Needless to say we copulated for a couple of hours, and I've decided to take her to every capital city in Europe to their best hotels and best tourist programs. She deserves it"
My dad confessed that he's sexually attracted to me,"This happened last night and I have no idea what to do. I feel dirty and heavy now that I have this gross secret. I feel extremely alone and really conflicted about whether or not to reveal this to my mother or siblings.

To start, he is NOT my biological father but he's been in my life since I was a baby (I'm 24 now). Our family is pretty normal for the most part. I don't want to get into too many details but he's been having issues the past few years with cocaine addiction. We weren't on good terms for a while due to his habits but after a relative passed away, I decided it wasn't worth it to keep being hateful. He still does it but I decided it wasn't my business or worth the negativity to dwell on what he does. So over the past few months we've been friendly and all has been well. Until last night

We were texting each other about the hockey game that was on and I jokingly told him to drop off a couple beers at my apartment because I was bored. I didn't expect him to take it seriously because there's no way my mom would let him buy beer and drop it off. But he did show up and confessed that he lied to my mom about where he was. He also revealed he brought coke with him. I think he felt that because we were somewhat close now, I would allow him to do it (which I did, stupid I know). I told him I was uncomfortable with it but after a couple of beers, I confessed that I tried it once or twice at a party. This is when he offered me a line. I declined multiple times but he insisted. It felt wrong but I also felt very pressured by him. After that, he kept offering more. He was kind of pushy about it but I told him straight up that I'm not into it. It was all good. We talked for hours about a bunch of stuff, growing up, family, whatever. I wasn't feeling any weirdness from him, he never touched me, he was okay. Then he asked me what I think of him. I told him honestly that I thought he was a good person with flaws. Then he said, ""do you want to know what I think of you?"" I said I'd rather not hear it because I was expecting something mean. He kept bringing it up though so I told him that if it's bothering him that much he can say it. He said ""I hope you don't look at me differently but you turn me on""

As soon as I heard the last 4 words, it felt like the air got vacuumed out of the room. It felt like darkness set in and evil showed up. I immediately felt uncomfortable. I knew it was wrong. I couldn't believe that that's what I heard. What's fucked up for me is that he doesn't seem to see why I have an issue with it. He started to get upset that I was silent so I snapped that he should have kept that to himself. I told him to leave and he left with no problems. I also promised that I would not tell a soul.

My mind has been running a million miles a minute since that happened. I feel like my entire life changed the second those words left his mouth. I don't have a dad anymore. I can't look at him ever again. It baffles my mind that he can look past our history and feel this way. More than anything, I feel terrible for my mom. The more I think about the drama this will cause, the more I don't want to tell anyone. I also don't want to get in trouble for ever allowing him to come over for drinks. I knew better but I foolishly let boredom decide. I should have just went to sleep. Now I can't hang out with my family (which i frequently do) because he'd be around. I really don't know what to do. The more I think about it, the more suicidal thoughts creep in. I genuinely feel like dying."
What the fuck is a vacation?,"Today I had a eureka kind of moment about how much I sacrifice to pursue my dreams.

My boss and I are flying to Germany for a training thing, and our senior boss brought up our flight to Germany. I said ""Yeah! My first time flying out of the country!"" He replied with a, ""That's great, you guys can do some sight-seeing,etc."" I had act professional and say ""Oh, well we're focusing on the training and bringing back that knowledge to the team,etc."" Then he said,""Well, why not take some extra days and just have some fun? It doesn't have to be all work and so serious..""  


Then it hit me, I HAVEN'T HAD A VACATION IN OVER TWO FUCKING YEARS. I've taken days off for mental health and to just sit around the house and goof off. I've taken some days to travel down south(Texas) to see my family, but not a real getaway in so long. My last true ""vacation"" experience was a weekend getaway to Colorado and it was an amazing hitchhiking/backpacking experience. Hell, when I switched jobs two months ago I cashed out $2,000 in PTO.  


Why the fuck do humans live this way in modern society?"
I started crying when I read the employee benefits,"I just got an internship for a big tech company, and today I started crying while reading the employee benefits handout.

I always considered myself average.  Strictly average.  I never saw myself achieving anything big.  I figured big opportunities were for smart people, for hard-working people, for people who deserved it.  And I never saw myself as any of those.  I only saw myself scraping by college, taking what I could get.  Hoping that I didn't fall behind and disappoint my parents.

But now, I got this internship.  During the whole process, I was waiting for them to drop me.  I completed multiple interviews, each time thinking about how badly it went, and would just think, ""Oh well. It's not like I deserve this internship anyway.""

Even when I got the congratulations letter, I told myself it was because I'm a female in a tech field, not because I actually deserve it.  I told myself I was accepted as a claim to diversity, and that being happy over the internship would show that I'm too proud of skills that I don't have.

I continually put myself down, but for some reason, reading the employee benefits made it feel so real.  I realized that all the cool benefits that the ""super smart"" people at these big tech companies get were not some sort of unreachable level of life that I was destined to stay apart from since the day I was born.  I'm there.  I can be one of those people.

I've worked nonstop since I got to college and it really feels like it's paying off.  I feel like I'm breaking a barrier that seemed invincible.  I'm so thankful for this opportunity and I can barely believe it's my life.  But I won't tell myself that I'm achieving this out of diversity.  I'm not achieving this out of pity.  I worked for this.  And it feels so good to have hard work show results."
"I'm 27, dying, and I'm relieved.","I have a shitty job that I can quit and spend some quality time with my cat, doing all the boring shit I normally do. The more I've lived the less I've liked people, but I still hope for our future. The only thing is the guilt of having to tell my parents. I don't think they will handle this well, and I'm considering not telling them until I have to. I worry about who will take care of my cat, but I feel like someone I know will be willing to step up.

I plan on self medicating until it becomes difficult, but before the pain's too much I'll probably take a bus up north. I want to see the aurora borealis. I'd like to take a flask of brandy and go on a long hike. I don't even hike normally, but I'm actually excited about something for once.

I always used to be worried about knowing when and how, and now I know, and I feel better. I don't want to think about what I'll miss, just what I have left."
4 months cancer free!!,"Today is exactly 4 months since I’ve been told I’m cancer free! I’m slowly getting my life back. One day, I’ll be myself again. Today I feel good"
College ruins people.,"I have so many thoughts in my head right now. I don't know what to say first. 

Last night at 3:35 AM, someone knocked on my door. (I live in a residence hall and work as an RA -- resident assistant -- which essentially means I'm like a ""floor mom"" to all of the students that live there.) The person knocking on my door was a resident who I very much like. He's involved, nice when I speak to him, and he always asks me how my day is going when I see him. But when I opened the door he was frantic. In tears and shaking and shouting. He told me his roommate -- I'll call him C -- had overdosed and wasn't waking up. 

I ran down the hall, go into the room, and immediately see the pill bottle and C on his side, lips blue. I call 911, my boss, and I forced C's roommate to stand out in the hall. I sat down beside C and tried to get him to regain consciousness. He did, for the most part. He was mumbling and incoherent. It was slow, but I knew he was dying. He was scared, he told me that. He just kept repeating ""Scared... scared... scared..."" over and over again. I pulled him up into my arms and held him there until he eventually passed away at 3:58 AM. The ambulance got there three minutes later. 

C left a note. He detailed the reasons why he wanted to take his own life. He was in massive loan debt, he had been feeling depressed for months but no one helped him. He was turned away from counselors because ""he seemed fine."" I remember the police telling me that the letter discussed me -- and C thanked me for being there -- and he was sorry for doing it. He talked about his roommate and how much he enjoyed his company. He talked about his fraternity brothers and the extent of his gratitude for getting to know them, but in the end he felt alone. 

I met his parents at the hospital. I sat with them, let C's mother cry on my shoulder, and told them that it will get better. But I can't help but feel that C could have beaten this. He was a happy kid when he first came to college. The first semester, he was smiling and happily involved in everything, and I know that depressed people can suffer in silence and still be ""happy"" on the outside, but C seemed genuinely happy to me, but I did notice how he seemed run down as the semester progressed, but I just thought it was finals stress and made sure to let him know I was available if he needed me. 

But as an RA for three years, I've seen so many students come and go, and by the time they leave they are holding themselves together. They worry about the thousands of dollars of debt they have, the grades they haven't maintained to appease their parents, or other things that seem -- and may very well be -- the end of the world for them. 

I don't know what I feel. I've been going through the day in a daze. One of my residents -- a student, a person, someone's child -- died. They are gone from this earth. I feel numb. I want to cry and I want to scream. Someone tell me it's going to be okay. Could I have stopped this? 

**EDIT:** I am absolutely overwhelmed by the amount of support and encouragement I have received from Reddit -- which is completely surprising to me. I have spent the day talking with grief counselors and getting ""debriefed,"" and I have also spent a lot of time with my floor of residents, in particular C's roommate. They were both in the same fraternity and came from the same city. He is pretty shaken up and staying with his parents off-campus. 

My boss informed me that I may or may not be terminated from my position because, as a rule, residents who are injured/ill/in danger are *NOT* supposed to be touched under any circumstances -- not by me (an RA) or anyone else, other than emergency response -- and since I gave in my statement to the police that I held C, I am being investigated for not following protocol. It is part of my job, but everyone has been incredibly supportive of me so far. C's parents have invited me to the funeral preparations. I feel like I have been welcomed into their small family. 

I haven't taken a lot of time to focus on myself. It's 1 AM right now, I have exams coming right around the corner and then graduation. I'm staying with friends off-campus (as per request from my boss) to take some time for me to come to terms with everything. I cannot simply grasp what has happened within the course of a day. I don't think I will ever fully understand what has happened. Not in a month, a year, or in 15 years. I can't sleep. I've been texting C's roommate to check up on him. He seems to be calmed down quite a bit. I'm going to drink some coffee and keep studying. I'm going to try and reply to all messages/comments. 

ALSO, one last thing: to those of you who are RA's or have been RA's -- thank you so much for your service. It is a job that goes unnoticed or we have the reputation for being the ""fun police."" It's not true; we see the other side of college and we deal with all the shit to make sure everyone has a fun/safe experience in their college career. "
I didn't forget.,"Last year, while browsing offmychest on my birthday, I found someone post about being upset that not a single person remembered their birthday. I wished you and told you that i'd never forget because we both share the same birthday, today, February 4th. I deleted my old account (dapperoctopus) and have been trying to find that post to wish you again so you know that somebody didnt forget again, but I couldn't find it since it wasn't linked to my old account name. If you're reading this, just know that I remembered and that I hope your day is full of joy.

Love,

"I kissed a girl, should i be proud?","I just had the longest, most intimate and emotional kiss of my life. With a girl. She was so pretty, i love her perfect personality, always happy and she completes me in every way. I want her, only her!
Also im a girl."
"Today, I cried for the first time in 13 years","A bunch of my friends including my brother was going to be playing football today. So i thought that after I finish with the gym, i would step by and say hello to the guys. 

As I reached the playground, i saw my friends huddled over someone and there was ambulance and paramedics. I started getting very worried. I started scanning the faces of those standing, hoping that my brother would be one of them, and not the one laying on the ground. I thought that this is a very selfish thing to think, but I didn't want my brother to be hurt. I didn't find him among the ones standing. As I approached, i start thinking of the worst, until I find out that he was indeed the one of the ground. My friends kept telling me that everything is ok and there's nothing to worry about. I didn't believe them because that what anybody would say anyway. He was unconscious, so I kept staring at his belly for any movement that shows that he's breathing. I think it was because of the shock, but I didn't see any movement, so I thought he died. Not until the paramedics assured me that he's unconscious because of the drugs and that at worst case scenario, he has a broken arm, only then did I calmed down a bit. Minutes later he woke up laughing his ass off because he's high on the drugs, so I was relieved. 

I was supposed to follow the ambulance with my car. Not until I sat alone in the car, did it all hit me retrospectively, i broke down and started crying hysterically. A friend standing outside the car, saw me like that and came to comfort me and hugged me. It meant the world to me. Later on, in the hospital, i realized that we ""men"" are denied such moments. To cry and for someone to comfort us. 

At the end, we got home with bunch of painkillers and he was given some time off from work. He's in pain right now, but that's expected and its nothing too extreme. 

I'm glad it was just a broken arm 

Edit: Sorry if I wasn't so clear on the drugs part. He was not high because he uses drugs, it was something given to him by the paramedics for the pain"
Woke up laughing,"This is a first for me. I woke up laughing hard, so much that my Father came to my door to ask what was so funny. I answered that I didn't know why, it was a dream.

I got up and started moving around, then I remembered. I was in a car driving with my Mom, we were laughing as we usually did. 

She died almost five years ago. I have not laughed that hard since before she died."
To all the fatties at my gym...,"I'm glad you're here.  Don't let anything stop you.  From a former fat guy to all of you, YOU CAN DO THIS.  I know how bad it sucks.  I know you work until you feel your lungs about to explode.  I know how gross your sweaty workout gear feels.  But it's worth it.  Pay no attention to the stuck up fuckers who snicker behind their hands at you.  I believe in you.  You have so much more of my respect than they do.  I remember what it's like to be you.  And you'll know what it feels like to be me.  "
"Just a day ago I was thinking about committing suicide, and today he's dead.","I'm not depressed honestly, I would say my life is actually pretty good, but for whatever reason after a really bad week, at the end of the day I was lying in bed thinking ""I could end it all right here, right now; make life easier.""

But this isn't about me. Just a few hours ago I found out one of my best friend's boyfriend died this morning. He was younger than me, only 20 years old. He had so much to live for. It's unknown what his cause of death was yet, but his last text to my friend was ""I just want you to know I'm always thinking about you, and that I love you.""

This is the first time I've experienced the death of someone I knew so closely. My heart aches not only for him, but for my friend. She's so devastated. Words can't even describe what she's feeling right now. He was her first love, and they were so, so in love.

I feel so stupid and selfish for ever thinking how easy it would be to end my life. I realized today its not worth it, never worth it. I can't stop thinking about him, how one day there's a presence in your life, and the next day, it's gone. He was so good. He doesn't deserve to be dead. And I feel literally sick thinking about how devastated my friend must be. How she didn't even get to say goodbye. I hope he's resting as peacefully as can be."
My personal trainer told me he would help me lose weight and get more sessions only if I had sex with him.,"I started seeing a personal trainer. He was never inappropriate or tried to come off in ANY wrong way whatsoever. Due to financial issues I had to stop going to the gym and sessions with him. He kept asking why i wasn’t coming to sessions and that he believed in me and my goals. I always said I was busy, because admitting I didn’t have the financial resources to go anymore was embarrassing. I had a really bad day with my self confidence and he just so happened to reach out and ask how I was doing on my own with working out. I told him I had been struggling and I was just not doing well fitness wise. He told me he didn’t care about the money he just wanted to help me. I was thankful that he just wanted to help me but didn’t feel right about letting him let me pay him less or not at all. I went to set up my first session with him in months and he reminded me not to worry about the money. I got this weird gut feeling something was off. He told me he would give me what I wanted if I gave him what he wanted. I felt so sick that he would even have the nerve to say anything like that or even think like that about me. He knew i was down about my physical appearance and i had trusted him with my fitness goals and struggles and he tried to use them against me. I instantly blocked him and just felt so uncomfortable and disgusted. I just wanted to get this off my chest because it’s been bothering me a lot lately "
It goes both ways,"I’m on the tube heading somewhere and on the news screen comes up a story about how on a reality tv show a woman slapped the guy because he didn’t kiss her. Or whatever it really was, doesn’t matter. As a very strong feminist opinionated female, who is constantly being loud about unfairness between both sexes, I see this and I get so angry at how there are still people who think that it’s okay for a woman to slap a man. To slap a man also because he rejected her. I hate to have to admit how so many men who bring up the unfairness topic are often right, how so many pathetic women still abuse others emotionally and physically and people think it’s okay because they are women. It’s not okay."
My cat died,"EDIT; thanks so much for all the kind comments. It was a public holiday here in the UK yesterday so we had to wait until this morning to take her body to be cremated. 

Trying not to doxx too much but I should clarify that we just moved to a new area about 2 months ago so we decided it would be nicer to scatter her ashes in her old stamping ground rather than bury her here. Ironically, we moved to a much smaller place with less traffic. However, we live right on the main street now so it's a different thing altogether I suppose. Either way, hindsight is always crystal clear and we can't change the past. I feel much better now she is being properly laid to rest, although leaving her at the vets was pretty awful. 

We decided to keep her scratching post which she had her whole life and her bowls as a reminder plus we put up a nice picture of her in the new house but the final piece of the puzzle will be getting rid of her litter and food. Haven't had the heart to do it but we must as our little one is getting very confused. 

Anyway, we'll never forget her and maybe one day we'll have another cat we love as much. 

Thanks again for all your kind words. 

-//-

My cat just died tonight. Hit by a car. We let her out for a bit whilst we took our little one out for a pre bedtime walk and go get some milk. Found her lying on the pavement opposite our house when we came back. We were gone for maybe 30 minutes. Her eye was hanging out. I can't unsee that but at least I managed to prevent my wife and son going over to look. 

Of course I cried my eyes out. Had to run in, get her blanket and bundle her up in it. Snapped at the two women who came to ask me if I'm ok (I know I was wrong but, seriously, how many times do I have to tell you there's nothing you can do to help?) All the while my toddler is beside himself; ""what a matter, daddy?"" We both pull ourselves together and take him inside and put him to bed before we come down and deal with the cat, who I left on the kitchen table. I don't want my wife to look at her so she has to have a cuddle with the blanket before we put her in a box in the garden. The kitchen table is still warm where her little body lay. I wrap some of her toys up with her; break down again. 

Seriously, I'm an absolute mess over this. I actually feel physically ill and it's come at a time where several things have gone wrong recently. 

Not sure why I'm posting this to be honest. Just a bit of catharsis I suppose. 

I miss that cat so much, even if she could be horrible sometimes. I was in such a great mood despite everything when we left. We'd both bought treats to sit down and shut the world out with for the evening with a movie or something. Our cat sitting on me and purring would have been a huge part of that and then out of the blue she's gone. 

There were 4 of us on this family this morning, now there's only 3. 

RIP."
"This title sounds so inappropriate, but I don't know any other way to say it...my prostitute passed away","When I was 19 I solicited a prostitute and we had sex in the back of my Jeep Patriot. It wasn't my first time having sex, but it was my first time with an actual adult woman who knew what she was doing. Her name was Sandra. She was 27 and had Blonde hair that had been dyed black and contacts that made her eye color appear to be grey. Her look intrigued me because she looked like she was deliberately disguising herself, like a spy.  I would hang around that area sometimes hoping to see her. Sometimes she would be there, sometimes she wouldn't. Sometimes she would already have a date, sometimes she was available. It continued like this for another five or six months. For $150 I got her for an hour. Being 19 and a proper muppet, I would usually be done having sex with her after 25 minutes tops. 

But the next thirty minutes were honestly what I was paying for. We would smoke a joint in my car and she would tell me stories about her life, about living in big cities like New York and Chicago, about all her near death experiences and scary situations she had been in...her stories captivated me. For her part, Sandra was a great listener, which I assume was a quality she shared with many prostitutes, and was always willing to give me friendly advice about relationships and life in general. I felt safe with her, like there weren't any unknowns in life. I treated her like a therapist, and she had an answer to everything

I continued to see Sandra for the next year. After a while, she would start giving me discounts on days like my birthday or holidays. We had such a strange friendship, and I think we were friends. Sandra was hurt by many people in her life, but never by me, and sometimes I wonder if that's why she continued to see this dopey college failure for as long as she did. Well, that, and I always paid up front.

Sandra died in February, of a drug overdose. I found out when, having not seen her in over two months, I checked our city's obituaries. She was honestly one of my closest friends, and I wish I could have been more to her, because she was so much to me. "
I love my son.,"You're 4 but you can read and write.  You're genuinely witty.  You're more beautiful than anyone I've ever seen.  You come with me when I run errands.

When you knew I was sad you said you wished you could bring someone back from the dead and, if you could, it would be my mommy. 

You're so fucking creative with your drawings and Lego and blocks.  I was a Lego master as a kid, but I didn't have the forethought you have.  This car needs an extra wheel on the back in case something goes wrong-- YOU'RE ONLY 4!  

I literally had planned out my suicide when I found out I was pregnant with you and decided to live.  I sought therapy because of you.   I'm alive and successful because of you. 

You say you want to marry mommy, that mommy is beautiful and your best friend.  Kid, you're only 4 and those opinions will change.  But I'm so fucking proud of the person you are.

You were being bullied by a tall girl who hit you and broke the skin.  She wouldn't stop and I told you you could hit her back and you said ""no, I will never hit anyone.""  We argued and I told you that you are allowed to defend yourself but you insisted that you will never hit anyone.  While I was disappointed that you didn't take my advice, I'm proud of you for having a belief and sticking to it.

I think you will grow to be smarter, funnier, and more beautiful than me.  My biggest wish is that you grow to be happier than me too.  

Fuck.  YOU'RE SO SMART.  YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL.  YOU'RE FUCKING HILARIOUS. 

Even my childfree friends love you.

I can't say most of these things to you because I'm supposed to say ""I'm proud of you for working hard.""  And so that's what I say.  But damn, I love you so fucking much.  I am the luckiest parent alive.  You're only 4 but you're so headstrong and good.  I'm proud.

**Edit**:  Thanks everyone for sharing your kind words and your own stories.  To clarify, I regularly tell my son that I love him and that I'm proud of him.  Occasionally I let a ""you're so smart"" slip.  We try to praise him for his hard work, persistence, and creativity.  The one thing I'll never tell him is that he saved my life. No one needs that kind of pressure on them.  Maybe on my deathbed, haha.  "
Jerk neighbors apologize...apology not accepted.,"My son is an 11 y/o recently diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome (or an Autism Spectrum Disorder, if you prefer...the terminology is changing).  It's important to note here that his official diagnosis was recent, but we've had a pretty good idea that it was coming to that for over a year.  Anyway, long story short:  he's gotten endless amount of crap from nearly all of the people (kids and adults alike) in our neighborhood for being different.  He prefers reading to getting dirty, messing with computers to poking things with sticks, etc.  They teased him, laughed at him, called him names...there was even some physical contact.  Today, he mentioned to one of the neighborhood kids that he gets along with that he was just diagnosed and he was overheard by one of the adults who has been part of the problem.  I stepped outside to get the mail and the adult came up to me and apologized for the way they'd been treating my son and, if they'd had known about his ""condition"", they'd never have done it.  I don't remember exactly what I said, but the basic gist of it was, ""Apology not accepted.  If you need to know that someone has a 'condition' as you call it before you treat them with basic human decency, then you have some soul searching to do.""

Urg.  Rant complete.  Thanks for listening."
I was the asshole boyfriend,"I remember when we found out we both 'liked' each other. We went nuts. We were dating within two weeks.

And believe me when I say: Those first two years were the happiest of my life. I was dating my best friend.

And then I went south. Things didn't go south, I did. The honeymoon phase ended. I got depressed. I drank too much. I smoked too much weed. I got fat. But worst of all, I aged you.

I say that because that feels like the worst crime. I made my high school sweetheart realize that guys can be assholes. I was cruel in fights. You didn't deserve to be spoken to that way.

I know you didn't leave me for him. In a way it made it easier to cope if I told myself you did. But then I took a hard look in the mirror, and I knew why you left. I hope he gave you some happiness again.

This isn't me trying to get back together. This isn't some misplaced notion of penance. This is me challenging myself to be more.

I'm sorry."
"To my racist family, I will date who I want.","I have been... so fucking lonely. I haven't had a date since I was in college. I am 26 now. So, on a whim, I went on a dating site and decided to start talking to other lonely peeps, threesome-seeking couples aside.

Eventually, met a girl. She is black and I am white. So far, it's been really awesome! Similar interests, tastes in music, sense of humor. Good dating material! Eventually, news spreads in my family that I am dating and my mother asked if she could see a picture of the girl I am dating.

Now, I'm not saying I was... anxious to show a picture of the girl I was dating, but I had a nervous smile the entire time.

Holy shit, the fake smile as she said ""Oooooooooh! She seems nice!"" made me sick to my stomach. Regardless of how much I already liked her and the great things I said about her, no, all I got out of my mom was warnings. ""You know, you gotta be careful! They might just wanna date you because they wanna use you for kids or money!""

Are you fucking kidding me? She's a fucking person and I'm very fond of her and I'm going to date her and, hopefully, continue to date her because I like her very much. I don't give a fuck what you think about her or what bullshit racist reasons you give me for not dating her, I am -not- concerned about whatever fake bullshit you spew telling me that it's not supposed to happen.

TL;DR, Fuck my racist family, I will date who I want. 

**UPDATE** Date went well! :D

I feel pretty guilty just ragging on my family like that, but with it has been a constant, nagging thing with at least my mom and my brothers.

There is this 'veiled racism', as I like to call it, that's been around for as long as I can remember. Civil and cordial in public, but in private, oho, it happens. Black driver cut us off in traffic? There's a comment about it. Little things that pile up. Of course, every time I call it out, there's always 'What? No I'm not racist!'

Veiled racism is still racism, no matter how civil my family acts about it and it grates on my nerves a lot. I shouldn't *have* to be worried about showing a *picture* of the girl I want to date to my mom for fear of a condescending comment or warning after warning about how I'm making a mistake. That was brought up a lot, by the way, that I *could be* making a mistake.

Never straight up admitting it, but implying it, trying to make me second guess myself about it. Kinda messed up isn't it? A family with no LBGTQ+ members (at least out of the closet), veiled racism abound, and just subtle, almost cult-like prejudice.

I'm not a fan of that in my family. I'm not a fan of knowing I was raised around this. I'm not a fan of any of it and it just boiled into this Reddit post. I've seen a lot of question marks, a lot of support, and, kinda shocking to me, just a lot of eyeballs peering at me ranting on the internet.

So, **tl;dr 2** The date went well, family not-so-subtly trying to get me to second guess myself about it, we're planning on going to an apple orchard next weekend."
This is the letter I received from the mother of the boy who received my wife's liver,"I'm sorry if this seems boastful, but I just wanted to tell someone else about this.  I've posted here before, but for a quick recap: my wife was killed in a car accident nearly 15 months ago.  Her organs were used to save the lives of four recipients.  Here is the story of an 8 year old boy who received my wife's liver. (Names removed)

Dear Family,

There are no words to express the gift you have given us.  On March 11th, we will take a moment in silence for our Donor, our Angel.  I keep your loved ones in my prayers and thoughts daily.  At church, sometimes I can't stop crying.  People around me think it is because of my son, but it is for our Donor and her family.  I have been trying to write this letter for 8 months but even now, I still cry.  I hope that your family has found some peace after a year.

My letter is intended to give you some comfort, not cause more pain.  Last time this year, we went from the school nurse asking us to pick up our son to signing the paperwork for a liver donation within a few days.  It was all so sudden and extremely terrifying.  After a year, we are now just getting back to being normal parents again.  Everything scares you and the worrying never stops.

I want to tell you about my son, ----.   He was 8 years old when he went into acute liver failure.  ---- has always been healthy, we thought it was a stomach virus.  He is at that silly age where he tries to make us laugh by dancing or making faces.  He still plays with trucks, blocks, swords, and guns.  Sometimes he still lets me hold his hand at the store.  ---- has watched every episode of the Super Heroes.  If he could have a super power, it would be to teleport back and forth from the past and future.  If he gets a million dollars, he plans to hire me a butler.  Plus, when he grows up he wants to have 10 cats.  ---- wants to be a doctor because he wants to be rich.

---- knew he needed a liver, eventually figuring out that someone else would have to die so that he can live.  He asked me only two question and has never mentioned it again, although i know one day he will want to know more.  He asked what happened to the person who gave him a liver.  My response was that our donor is now in Heaven.  ----'s next question was if he got a girl or boy live, I told him he got a Super Hero's liver.

On March 11th, 2013, I knew my son was getting worse.  I didn't need lab results or a team of doctors to come tell me.  That morning before the transport team made its rounds, I went to the hospital chapel.  I had not been able to ask God to take the life of someone else's child so that my child could live.  I went to the chapel to ask God to take my child, to make him stop suffering.  I would be okay, I just wanted him to keep my son until I would be able to join him in Heaven.  When I came back to intensive care the doctors were still there.  I knew they wanted to tell me my child was getting worse and would die soon.  With your gift of life, an 8 year old boy was saved.  Many years ago I read this book called ""The Five People You Meet In Heaven"" by Mitch Alborn.  It is about the first five people you meet in Heaven, and how their lives impacted each other - even strangers.  My acts of kindness are based on this book; how a gesture, decision, or act of kindness can impact others for a lifetime.  In my heart, I truly believe that ---- donor will be the first person he meets in Heaven.  Your loved one will always be a part of our family and included in our daily thoughts.  Every birthday, every Christmas, every special even in ----'s life will also be our ""Super Donor Hero's"" special day.

Thank You and God Bless,

---- & ----

I wanted to share this not as a way to shine a light on myself.  I wanted to shine a light on my wife, the super hero who continues to live on in others."
i threw out his application file,"on friday we had interviews for a position at a company i am a supervisor at. usually there are two supervisors in each interview, but the other for my location was out sick so a district supervisor came over to fill in. 

we had two candidates. one, a woman, was extremely qualified and her interview was flawless. i wanted to hire her on the spot, but to be fair we had to interview the other guy. i was optimistic that he would be good, or maybe even better, than the woman. 

he was *NOT*. 

he knew the district supervisor on a personal level. apparently the district supervisor was his dad's fraternity brother in college and they had known each other since the interviewee was a child. i thought this was a severe conflict of interest and i made it known after the interview. the district supervisor cut me off and told me to ""go ahead and send his paperwork to HR. i want him."" i looked over his ratings sheets of the two interviews. the woman, he scored her excellently, but at the end he said he would not recommend her for hire. under the comments he simply said, ""Not good."" (??????)

for the OTHER guy, he didn't even RATE him, he just wrote in the comments: ""Great guy""

when the district supervisor left, i went through the guy's file (who interviewed) and found out he didn't even have the MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS to even APPLY for the position. we require a specific degree requirement from a university with a specific set of skills (or major field of study). he didn't even go to college and had not special skills. 

this area of work is VERY serious and we interact with very high-profile clients that bring in a lot of money. if we put someone like *that* guy out in the field, he would destroy everything--or else would require extensive training that we do not have the time to give. 

so i threw his application into the shredder. i shredded each piece of his application one-by-one because the district supervisor is not *my* supervisor. just because he works in a bigger building means nothing. we get paid the same to do the same work. 

if he asks me why the other guy wasn't hired, i'll tell him it's because he didn't meet the minimum qualifications--and i'm assuming he got him the job in the first place. 

and ANOTHER thing--the DISTRICT SUPERVISOR was a REFERENCE for the guy that interviewed. like what the hell!?!?!

OH MY GOD this made me so mad. 

i can't wait to call the woman tomorrow and give her this job. she deserves it. "
"To the girl who, until yesterday, I considered my friend:","You are the worst.  I have been friends with your husband since I was a senior in high school.  From the day he met you, he has thought of nothing but your happiness.  He is one of the most genuinely caring people I have ever met.  He always volunteers to help people move... Do you know how much people fucking hate helping other people move?  And yet he always hops up and offers to help right away, because that's just the kind of guy he is.

I understand that marriage is hard.  I know that you go through ups and downs, and that there are times that you'll question if you made the right decision.  Hell, I had some respect for you when I heard you had told your husband eight months ago that your relationship was in trouble and that you wanted to work on it.  I saw that man bust his ass to make you happy, because he thought that you had something worth fighting for. 

When you told him Tuesday you wanted a divorce, I'm sure he was in shock.  When you went through the house Thursday to divide up your stuff, I'm sure he was trying to be as amicable as possible, because he is over the moon for you and just really confused and lost.  So I'm guessing you read that as him not being upset enough that he's losing a prize like you.  Is that why you decided it was time to tell him not only that you had been cheating on him for seven months, but that you were going to marry this douche and wanted to start a family with him?  You just needed to twist the knife to make sure it hurt?  The sad thing is, he started defending you when he was telling us about this.  When my fiance and I said that we were behind him 100% he asked us not to choose sides because it would hurt you.  Even while you're running around behind his back, he's trying to protect you.  That's the love you're giving up on.  That's what you decided was worth less than a seven-month fling.  And that love has been constant for ten damn years.

Why the hell did you tell him that you wanted to work on things when you had no intention of trying?  Did you just want to feel good about seeing someone working so hard to make you happy? 

I've got some bad news, old friend:  You're going to find out the hard way that the reason most of your friends are friends with you at all is because we love your husband.  Your world is about to get really damn lonely.  And when you realize that you can't build a relationship of trust between a man who was willing to break up a marriage and a woman who was willing to cheat, you better believe that when you try to come crawling back we are all going to be right there, next to your husband, cheering him on as he tells you to go fuck yourself.  I just hope that he doesn't love you too much to say it when the time comes.

P.S. I'm sure it goes without saying, but you are cordially invited to kick rocks and are no longer one of my bridesmaids.  Screw you."
My mother got me a pair of jeans.,"My mom's a doctor. When I was growing up, she was super busy and not always very available, but believed that it was the best thing for our family (which it turned out, it was). 

Recently, my favorite pair of jeans, that I found on clearance at TJ Maxx on a whim, began to rip. It's not really a fixable spot, and I had worn these jeans for a couple of years already. My legs are kind of disproportional to my body, so these are one of the only pairs of pants I've ever owned in my adult life that fit perfectly. No belt or hemming needed. 

However, these jeans were from a designed brand, and retailed for a couple hundred dollars online. The specific jeans were also discontinued. I was very very sad about these pants, and had told my parents so. 

It turns out that my mother had combed through the racks at TJ Maxx one afternoon (there are a LOT of racks) and found a pair of jeans, in this brand, in MY SIZE, and bought them. It really really touched me because I never thought that she would do something like that, because it must have taken a really long time and been really tedious. It seems like it's her way of saying that she really loves me, and I feel like I will always come back to this moment.
"
I pretended to be Jewish so I could marry my wife,"Throwaway because my brother-in-law is a huge redditor and tends to read what I post and follow my account.

My wife is Jewish, and comes from a relatively religious family. Her parents have told her since she was born that she MUST marry a Jewish man, to ""preserve the Jewish people"" and ensure that ""Jewish culture is never lost"", yada yada yada. I was raised Catholic, and the day before I was to meet her parents for the first time (eight months after we started dating and two years before the wedding), I spent the entire day learning how to be Jewish (at least a little bit). The next night at Shabbas dinner (a large meal to celebrate the arrival of the Sabbath every Friday night), in addition to telling them about the typical stuff (where I grew up, what I do for a living, how I met their daughter) I told them all about my Bar Mitzvah, my Jewish parents and the Synagogue we attended on Friday nights (fortunately we grew up on opposite sides of the country), and going to Hebrew Sunday school. Her parents bought it, and her mom loved me.

A year and a half later, I proposed. Next challenge: my folks. My dad couldn't stop laughing. I will never, to the end of my father's life, live this down. My grandparents were the religious ones in my family, but they died years ago (I'm in my late 30s, my wife is mid 20s) and though my mom wasn't exactly thrilled by the idea of faking being Jewish, they agreed. Over the next six months, I worked with my parents on creating our new Jewish identity. Thankfully, my last name is not something completely un-Jewish, which worked out excellently. We bought a Mezuzah for the house, found a Synagogue that was in our area growing up that was believable, learned a bit of Yiddish, learned the basic prayers for bread, wine, and Friday nights. I learned how to read in Hebrew with my father, and though we we don't understand jack at least we can pass the most important test: the Jewish wedding. Learned about the Chupah (what Jewish couples stand under), about what the Rabbi would say, signing a Ketubah (marriage contract). Thankfully, everything went well (except that when the Rabbi said ""Pass the ring"" it sounded like ""Pass the wind"" and I giggled in front of a few hundred people) and I have just bought my parents tickets to Hawaii for a romantic getaway as a reward. Everything worked out: I have a hilariously awesome sexy wife, my parents think I'm crazy but were crazy enough to go along with my crazy, and my wife's parents STILL THINK I'M JEWISH!

TL;DR: I'm uncircumcised and my wife's parents don't know."
My best friend of 31 years in dying right now.,"I am 42 and my closest friend since I was 11 is being taken off of machines that are keeping him alive, right now.  I live about 1000 miles away and am direct communication with his wife and brother in law.  I am literally just waiting for the text to tell me he is gone.  

He has been sick for a while, but we all thought he would recover.  I talked to him a week ago and I really wish I knew it would be the last time.  I should have rushed down then, but we all assumed he would recover again.  A few days ago they rushed him back into intensive care, but still, this has happened a few times, no one knew it was the last time.

I just got a text that they are letting people in to say goodbyes.  

This is fucked.

"
Gizzy died.,"My wife called me at work today crying. She found our lovely cat dead under the stairs in the basement. She didn't know what to do and was totally freaked out. I told her to take care of herself right now and to take our son to her parents condo for the day. I'd take care of everything. 

I was also very distraught by this but had to keep it together for a few hours while I finished my time sensitive work. I couldn't let my sadness hold me back as I have a physical job (welder fabricator) and work in a very ""masculine"" environment. My emotions came out in burst of frustrated anger that I directed to inanimate objects and snappy comments to some of my more annoying coworkers. I confided the truth to my boss and he agreed to let me leave early, as soon as my assignment was done. So I buried myself in work. I finished early and drove to the house.

I think I must have bottled up my emotions deep and tight because I didn't even flinch as I walked downstairs. That is, until I turned the corned and saw him lying there. Poor boy... I lost my fucking shit. I fell to my knees and cried and cried and cried like a child. I remember trying to think while I was crying. Trying to remember when was the last time I cried like this. Trying to detach myself but I couldn't. I wept long and hard and messy. I'd never play with my Gizzy again. 

I wrapped him up in my old T-shirt and placed him in a box I'd brought home from work and drove him to the veterinary hospital. After some paperwork and a seventy dollar disposal fee I handed over my sad little box to the kind lady at the desk and she earnestly conveyed her condolences to me. I didn't say anything, I just nodded barely holding it together and I cried again in my car. 

I drove to retrieve my wife and son and as I walked into the condo we hugged. She had been crying already and as we hugged she cried harder. I cried too but no where near as intently as I had when I was alone. I held it back this time. I decided to try and cry less, I made myself bottle it down again. For her. To be her rock. 

I told her all the things I knew she wanted to hear to make her feel better- but they were really to convince me that it was going to be ok. We tried to act normal, we made dinner and watched the news. I played with my son and gave him a bath and put him to bed. 

We sat in silence for a bit not really talking about it and trying to ignore the sadness in the room. She hugged me and told me that the events of the day left her tired and she was heading off to bed. So here I sit alone telling strangers the events of my day so that I could feel the pain again and cry the way I had earlier. The kind of absent out-of-body crying that felt so true. It's the only way I can think of to honour Gizzy. Even though he'll never know it, it lets me know how much i really loved him. 

He was a good boy and I miss him terribly. 

Edit: Wow.. I'm floored you guys. I don't know what to say. All your kind words misted my eyes and made me feel so good. It helped to read your stories. I'll enjoy surprising my wife with this post when I get home from work. Thank you so very much for all the love! Hug your pets and give them a treat, they certainly are precious. "
My boyfriend is so awkward,"He's never been in a real relationship before so a lot of things that I would expect from a normal relationship, he doesn't do. Some things like putting his arm around me or holding my hands while walking, he tries to do them because he knows I like it and does it so awkwardly. What he doesnt know is that it's tenfolds cuter because it's him and he's so adorably awkward. "
I'm sick of living with my mentally handicapped brother and his sexual habits,"**TL;DR**:  Ever since I was born I've seen and hear my brother masturbate and I  feel like my parents just enable him. I'm sick of it and makes me  anxious/nauseous.

He's 34, I'm 23. He can't talk, his mental capacity is that of a  child and he's really dependent. Other than being heavily overweight and  not doing any exercise he doesn't have any kind of physical disability,  but he can't shower by himself and a myriad of other things.

We live with my parents. I don't move out because I'm a full time  University student and we live 10 minutes away from where I'm taking my  studies. Also we don't have that much money, so me moving before  finishing my studies would both be impractical and expensive.

I'm sick of living here. I'm specially sick of the way my parents  ""enable"" my brother to misbehave and just generally make our lives a  nightmare.

My brother is extremely aggressive sometimes and I still have  scratches on my arms from when I was a small kid and he scratched me  with his nails. He's destroyed multiple doors, TV sets, windows and  hundreds upon hundreds of handheld radios (something he likes and my  parents keep buying him, even though he uses them as ammunition to throw  at us).

What prompts me to make this post, and what is a source of constant  anxiety and stress for me is the noise. Either he has the TV running at  really high volume or he's aggressively shouting. Of course this is not  constant, the other half of the time he's calm watching TV or playing  with things like legos, but all the noise heavily outweighs the  calmness.

And something that really discomforts me and will maybe be mocked  upon, is the masturbation. I'm so sick of knowing when he's doing it.  And how would I know he's doing it? Because he turns off everything else  and starts flipping through porn magazines. My parents have been buying  him porn magazines weekly since before I've been born, and it makes me  sick. They say it's natural, but WHY THE FUCK do they have to provide  him porn? If anything they've made it completely non natural. Without  getting into details, I'm almost sure he's completely sexually  dysfunctional from the constant ""use"", but it's part of his habits. It  might sound silly but I really get anxious and almost sick when I'm  reading in my room or doing anything and I hear the damn sound of  magazine pages flipping because I know what is he doing.

And why would that matter so much to me, why would it sicken me?  Because it's something I've had to live looking at my whole fucking  life. My mother always goes to watch TV at night, and she brings it with  him. I used to watch TV with her as well, but I stopped doing it  because my brother would just be masturbating until he passes out and  sleeps. I don't even want to step into the living room when they're  there because there'll be a 50% chance of seeing him do it and I can't  stand it. Everytime my family proposed eating outside or doing something  that would involve getting in the car I'd refuse, because in  intersections and red lights my brother would get the hand under his  pants and start touching himself. I also get anxiety when we have to  take the car for something important and I can't refuse. I can't stop  thinking if he's touching himself or not (I sit behind and he sits  front, so it's impossible for me to tell). When I was like 12 we were in  my grandma's house for Christmas Dinner and he went to a lonely room to  masturbate and my mom sent me to him. For me to make him stop? No, for  me to be in the room with him to make sure he didn't break anything or  that our smaller cousins didn't go inside while he was doing it. And I  fucking obeyed. **What the fuck.** 

My parents are desensitized to it. My mother would sometimes shout  him to stop in the living room but most of the time she doesn't bother. A  few days ago I went to the kitchen and I saw my brother standing up  while masturbating and touching my mother's hair, while she was in a  phone call with family. I made a huge deal out of it but my mother just  tells me to shut up and start making a big deal out of it, that he's  just like that. Why the fuck do you buy him porn magazines and gloves (a  detail I forgot to mention) for him to cum in? Why the fuck would you  just let him masturbate 24h in front of you? And while touching you?  What the fuck is all this. I'm sure they haven't done anything like that  but lately I keep getting sick thoughts of my mom doing something  sexual to my brother and I'm feeling nauseous just thinking about it.

I'm so sick of it. I'm thinking of just making a big fuzz and telling  them they should stop with the magazines/gloves/let him do it in front  of them, but they'll just tell me the same bullshit about it being  natural and that he can't help with himself, when in reality they've  basically enabled him and taught him it's okay to do it. He's not  completely stupid, he has an understanding of social norm and tresholds.  In the outside or home with strangers he'd never do it, it's just with  us because he knows he can.

I'm just ranting, the post is too long. I've barely talked about this  to anybody else, so I just needed to vent off. Comments are welcome."
"I have good caring parents. They love me and make choices based on that love. But they made the wrong decision, and I paid for it.","When I was in the first grade had a tough time reading, so my parents got me hooked on phonics, but I still struggled, so they paid for a tutor, but I still struggled, so at age six they got me evaluated.

That was such an exciting experience. Adults were paying close attention to me for an entire day. Asking me questions and telling me that I was smart. At the end of the day they gave me puzzles to play with and they whispered with their heads together. I didn't think anything of t.

But by the 4th grade, I still couldn't spell. My parents would ground me when I brought home yet another failed test telling me that I just needed to put more effort in. I needed to be more careful. They pointed to my placement tests that said that I was smart and told me to work harder. I yelled and screamed back that they didn't understand.

In high school, I couldn't figure out the difference between the word gay and the word guy. But... it's because I'm lazy and don't try hard.

In college, I excelled at extra curriculars. I became student body president and ran events that got national awards. But I had a 2.7 GPA because ""I was a terrible, stupid person that could do great things except for my horrible, shameful lazyness.""

Then I took a data entry job; I made a mistake after mistake. My bosses would ask me, why don't you just check your work put some extra effort in, I felt too ashamed to say that I did. I felt the white hot self-hatred run down my back every time I found inverted numbers or a grammatical mistake.  ""I could be successful, my parents gave me everything, and I am failing at an entry level job. I am worthless; I should be ashamed; if I actually tried for once I might do something great, but instead, my lack of effort is ruining my life.""

I lived recklessly hoping that something might kill me. 

But last month, at age 28, my parents brought out my school file.  It had all of my report cards, favorite art projects, a couple of papers, and the evaluation that I got 22 years ago. At age six someone with a PhD in childhood learning said that I have dyslexia and ADD.

They knew, and they never told me.


"
My daughter was held at gunpoint at her school and I have no idea how to react.,"Today someone made a false 911 call claiming shots went off at my daughter's school. As you can imagine the cops swarmed within minutes with full swat gear, rifles, etc. They swept the school quickly. 

My daughter was with another student in the back of the school filming a 3 minute horror flick for her performing arts class. She had her hoodie up and was holding a fake machete when the police stormed into the room they were filming in. They were in a backroom that did not have a speaker so when the announcement went out to go on lock down, my daughter and her fellow classmate did not get the message. Her and her friend were held at gunpoint.

As anyone can imagine she's terrified. 

Had an inexperienced, trigger happy cop been there I'm not sure what would have happened to my daughter. I'm shaken, and if I'm this disturbed by this I'm sure she's even more freaked out. She's only in 8th grade. It's so fucked up that this is what reality is for school children these days..."
My wifes hugs,"I wish I could write a poem or something but I think she thinks its so nerdy so I have to post it here.   
I just love when my wife hugs me. There is something so special when she comes to me and hugs me. When she puts her head on my cheast and just rest it there. I love it so much. Its like time freezes. Everything else stops mattering. Its just me and her in that moment. Her hugs makes me never want to let her go.  I sometimes wish time would just stop so we could hold each other and never stop. I love her so much and I love holding her so much. I wish she knew how much her hugs means to me. Maybe then she would take more time to do it. I dont blame her. THe business of life often makes us forget about each other but I dont want us to do that. I want to hug her for a long time ever day. Just to forget about the world for a moment. Just to forget everything else and just hold her.

"I’m going blind, and I’m scared out of my mind","I’m 20 years old, and I got diagnosed with IIH, otherwise known as psuedotumor cerebri, a few months ago. I lost a significant amount of vision in my right eye, but this last week I’ve gone almost completely blind in that eye, and my “good” left eye, is blurred beyond belief. It was crystal clear just last week. There’s times where everything goes black,  and I’m in the hospital now while they try to save what’s left. I love to read, and I want to see my sweet dogs little face, and my boyfriends goofy grin, and I didn’t get to travel and see all the things I thought I’d have my whole life to see. I can literally see it slipping away, and I’ve never felt so afraid in my whole life. I just want my dog, and to be ok. "
"We Arab girls won't go to hell, cause we're already there..","I'm a 27y Arab girl, I live in a community where if you're a girl it doesn't matter how old you're, you'll always be treated like a 10 years old. 
A lot of girls in my society seem to be ok with it but I'm not. I mean I can get money if I want some, I have someone to drive me (but only to the places my family approves of), but I don't feel alive.. I'm forced to cover my face every time I go out, I can't even smile cause I know nobody will see that smile.. I have a master degree but I don't wanna work cause I'm too depressed I don't wanna go out looking like that, some girls don't mind covering themselves but it's really hard for me.. 
I once traveled for a foreign country where ppl aren't used to women covering up their faces and of course I was young and forced to, I felt like an exotic 
 pet, people rising their phones taking photos of me, and males in my family thought it was fun, will it wasn't for me, it was painful. 
In my country a girl must have a male guardian (father, brother or even a son) and if she wants to study, travel, get a surgery-even if it's urgent- that guardian must sign the papers..
Now if I decided to tell my guardian how I feel, he'll use his privileges over me.. even if a girl wanted to report something to the police, her guardian must sign it :).. so no way out of it.. 
my family are really good to me, they love me they think I'm happy cause they buy me all the things I want.. 
and I love them too, but it's killing me.. 
I'm also forced to act like I'm a muslim while I'm not, I'm not living this real life for an imaginary life after death! 
I can't tell anyone around me, I'm scared of their reactions, I can go to jail for being atheist.. My family might keep me in my room forever.. or worse. 
I'm not scared of god cause I don't think he's real, but I'm really scared of society cause it's real. 
I don't think I might commit a suicide but I'm not afraid of death. 
Today I was almost in a car accident and I didn't blink, I kept staring at the other car and part of me wished it took my life.. It makes me sad that I don't wanna be buried in a cemetery with the people who took my life, but again I can't even ask for that.. 
I look into their faces and I wonder what if they knew!! 
I can't pursue my dreams cause they're not approved by my family..
I don't see my future, I feel chained and my heart is heavy, I'm a hypocrite but this is the only way I can live.. If I decided to take a stand I'll only break my family hearts and I'll probably end up punished.. 
I'm really sad and I'm starting to have no control over my tears, it just hits me wherever I'm and they start dropping.. how long will I live this lie!"
Something no one ever tells you about getting sick,"You lose most, if not all of your friends. My husband turned 40 today. We invited over 45 people. Six people said they would come. Three showed up. One if whom was our upstairs neighbor who I texted and begged to come over because barely anyone had showed up. 

Five years ago we had lots of friends. People came to our parties, and we were invited to lots of events. Rarely does that happen anymore. After we found out he had stage four kidney disease people just sort of dropped out of our life. He is now stage five and waiting for a transplant. When he started dialysis last fall I send out a message to a bunch of our friends with the address of his kidney center and his dialysis schedule. I told everyone he would really appreciate visitors or even phone calls because dialysis is long and super boring. Not. One. Person. Has ever called or visited. 

Oh sure. When I post updates on Facebook we get lots of likes and ""prayers."" So it looks like we have a decent support network if you see that. But the reality is that no one wants to offer any more support than that. 

In talking with other spouses with seriously ill partners, this is not abnormal. This is just par for the course. 

If you have a friend who gets sick, visit them. Call them. Help them out. You may be the only one who does. :-(

Edit: Thank you to whoever sent the gold. :-) I believe I've sent our address to everyone who requested it, but send me a PM if I missed you. Thank you. "
I'm an ER doctor who had to pronounce a young child dead after a car accident and it's all I can think about,"You get very used to death in this line of work, but taking care of sick kids never gets easy. It's never expected for a child to die.

The charge nurse called me while I was trying to eat a quick snack between patients: 3 yo female, MVC, traumatic arrest. I paused. He had to be mistaken. ""3, Are you sure?"" ""3."" Already I was depressed. Cardiac arrest due to blunt trauma is essentially not survivable. Penetrating, sometimes, but almost never with blunt.

I waited in the trauma room along with all the staff. It was very solemn. No nervous banter like usual. The medics showed up, one doing compressions and the other bagging through an ETT. The one bagging had tears in her eyes.

We continued as per standard protocols. The little girl was in asystole the entire time. No pulses. It was clear she was dead. It's so hard to maintain composure in that situation. I started crying as I called the time of death. I went to the bathroom right after and bawled and bawled. I'm crying now thinking about it.

I have a little girl of my own near her age. I can't help but think of her. It's the most devastating thing I can possibly imagine. 

It's so difficult in the ER. I still had eight patients I was actively taking care of and there were 10 more in the waiting room. It's so hard to care about other peoples' complaints in the perspective a dead child. I try not to take it out on the other patients, there for minor complaints. It's so hard... I just want so scream, ""a little girl just died! I could give a fuck about your twisted ankle!""

But you have to maintain composure. The twisted ankle, the atypical chest pain, the hyperglycemia, the abscess, the chronic abdominal pain, the nursing home UTI... they all need care too. It's not their fault.

I just wish we were all allowed to stop and mourn. Even if for just fifteen minutes. But I have to walk out of a dead child's room and continue on without a break. I had to go right next door to her mom, who was the driver, and tell her her daughter died. She screamed and screamed and screamed. I cried again. And then I had to go with business as usual, trying not to cry while I was taking care of the guy with the twisted ankle. Having to force myself to focus on what he was saying.

This is so bad. I go through cases like this a few times a year... but this one has affected me to my core. It's been days and I will still randomly just go into a bathroom to cry. I can't stop holding my kids, I love them so much.

Thank you for reading."
Say her name. Please. For me.,"I despise those that treat my love’s name like a dirty word, to be whispered in hushed tones.

I want to grab them by the shoulders, shake them, scream her name in their face, so it rings in their ears.

That name is a symbol of something beautiful, something pure, something wild and free, and the love of my life. That name is not a dirty word.

She was not some crazy dream. She was here. I know she was, I loved her, I held her, she had our child. We laughed together, cried together, teased each other, made love every night, touched, kissed, smiled together.

Do not treat that name as if death defined her. For death was only the smallest part of her. She lived far before she died.

EDIT: Holy cow guys. I didn't expect this sort of reaction, not at all. Thank you ALL so much for your support and sympathies. You have no idea how much this means to me, really. You are wonderful folks."
My brother drove me to attempt suicide for popularity,"He’s a year younger than me and growing up we were the best of friends. I was 17 and a very popular girl in high school, he was not. He was the kind of boy who was sweet and funny, but he was always on the outside and no one really paid much attention to him. 

When I was 17 I lost my virginity to this other popular guy. We were dating and things were going fine. I was going through I really tough time at that point, having panic attacks and suffering from depression because of something that happened when I was younger. This guy made me forget about it. I didn’t love him, but I did like him and he was a nice distraction. 

One day at school I heard a rumour going round that this guy was sharing my nudes. He had been pressuring me for months to send him one, I was stupid and trusted him, so I finally caved and did. I felt so humiliated and violated that I tried to commit suicide that night. I didn’t go through with the act and didn’t tell anyone. School became a nightmare. I lost all my friends, I was labeled a sl”t and viciously bullied by the guy and his friends after standing up for myself and calling him out in front of the whole school. everyone else seemed to love knocking me of my pedestal. I have never, ever bullied anyone in my life- so I was shocked that people I had stood up for previously turned on me so quickly. 

Then my sweet little brother joined in. The popular boys, and others finally paid attention to him cause he was my brother. As my bullies, they took him under their wing to hurt me. My brother took the bait and helped destroy what was left of me. I would come home crying from school and he would report back to my bullies what happened at home. He would pretend not to know me at school cause he was embarrassed of me. When he did pay attention it was only to laugh alongside my bullies. They idolised him cause he picked the “lads” over his own sister. 

I had no friends. Was constantly on guard at school and now at home. I finally broke, overdosed, had a seizure, stopped breathing and was airlifted to the hospital in the city. I was hospitalised then send to a psychiatric ward for 3 weeks. My brother never visited me. I wish I could say things got better after that, but it continued till I left high school. By the time I left my brother was one of the most popular guys in school. I didn’t visit home my first year at uni cause he was there. 

To this day he is still embarrassed to be seen with me in his hometown. He barely speaks to me and still makes jokes at my expense. He has never acknowledged what he did. It’s been 3 years and I still hate my brother. When I next see him I’m finally going to confront him. I’m going to look him in the eye and tell him he may have broken me, but I put myself back together and that I won’t let him hurt me any longer. 

Edit: My parents had no idea what he was doing, I didn’t tell them at that point cause I still loved him and thought he would come round. When I first told my mother she didn’t believe me, it’s taken years of constantly reminding her about it for her to understand. No mother wants to hear that their child was so cruel. My parents didn’t even know I was bullied until after the attempt, i didn’t want them knowing why it started (with the nude) and was to ashamed to tell them. After my attempt I had a lot of love and support from them and my other siblings. I didn’t speak up about my brothers behaviour until I left for uni. I finally realised he wouldn’t change and I lost the last bit of love I had for him. 

Gold- thank you so much to whoever did this you are a very kind and beautiful person. 

Edit- I just wanted to say how touched I am by your words. Everyone I’ve ever told this too from my hometown have made excuses for him. For a period of time I really doubted myself, I felt that I was being dramatic for not forgiving him. Now I have amazing friends, a boyfriend who adores me and I’ve almost finished my degree. Life gets better, especially when I have nothing to do with those toxic people. Thank you all for your supportive comments and messages, you honestly have no idea how much it has helped me. "
"My soon to be husband is short, bald, unattractive and poor.","I love him so very much! I just want to scream it from a rooftop.


He got push around a lot by bigger men, being passed over for positions that requires leadership, some women even sneered at him when unintentionally exchanging stares (hints ladies, chances are he looks at something behind you), some punk ass kid called him turtle man once. Well turtle yourself kid, your parents probably got divorced because of you. How do you like that?


People just do not see what my BF is capable of. He is the kindest person I know. He has helped many people in the past, he never ever laughed at someone's misfortune. He tried often secretly to make this world a better place, a nicer place for others. He helped bullied kids in school (we went to the same school), he brought warm food to a former coworker's home who just got divorced and laid off almost at the same time, he stopped when people waved him on the street, he helped hitchhikers, he repaired toys when he could. I am lucky to have this man."
My future ex-wife cried about my new tattoo.,"Together for 9 years. She wanted the divorce. I didn't cheat on her, we didn't get into a fight or anything. She just came home from work and told me she wasn't in love with my anymore, and it was too far gone to fix. I begged and pleaded, tried to set up counseling appointments, but she said it was too late and she has no more effort to give to save our marriage. 

That was almost six months ago. I moved out right away. I've been going to frequent personal counseling sessions to work on becoming a better person, partner, and husband. Initially I was hopeful that she'd see my efforts and give me another chance, that she'd love me again. But as time passed, it became clear that her mind is made up. 

I recently got a couple new tattoos. One is a slightly modified version of Nietzsche's quote: ""The demand to be loved is the greatest of all arrogant presumptions."" 

To me, it means that I am (and people in general are) imperfect. I can do everything in my power in hopes that someone will love me. However, I can never make someone love me, and to demand or expect to be loved by that person is a somewhat egotistic mindset. I can't feel entitled to be loved, I have to earn the love by being someone that is deserving of it. 

She saw my tattoo and asked what it meant. I told her. She asked if it was about her. I told her that it is certainly relevant and something valuable I've learned in the recent months, but I think it's an important philosophy for me to keep in mind moving forward. 

She broke down and started to cry and told me, ""Loving someone and wanting to spend the rest of your life with them are different things. You can love someone but not want to be with them."" 

I gave her a hug and told her that I know she loves me, and she knows I love her. 

I agree with her that you can love someone but not want to be married to them. However, I have a hard time with the idea that you can truly love someone and not be willing or able to make an attempt together to try and fix things. Loving someone isn't simply that you want them to be happy, or don't want anything bad to happen to them. I do believe that she does love me. Just not in the way that I yearn for. 

There are different types of love, and the quote holds true for each one. "
The results are in...,...and I am 100% cancer free. I couldn't be happier right now. I'm going to celebrate with a box of chocolates and a film that will make me sob like a small child. I need the release. 
Found my mom dead in her sleep,"A little backstory
My mom had just gotten a knee replacement, she was healthy and had no issues (except high blood pressure which she has been treated for, and type 2 diabetes which she had under complete control) she and I were so close and had planned on doing a lot this summer anyways
On May 31st my mom woke up fine and a physical therapist came over as usually since her surgery, that went by fine, I went to work out came home at 3:00 and checked up on her, told her I loved her and gave her a hug, she went to take a nap, around 4:30 her alarm went off and I heard a moan and suggested that she get up, no response I just assumed she wanted to sleep longer, around 4:45 I went to wake her up but when I entered the room and asked her to wake up, she didn’t respond like she normally would instead she just lie there, I screamed as loud as I could and started crying (I’m 19)
I started shaking her and throwing her around like a rag doll, after about 30 seconds I called 911 and screamed for help, I calmed down and told them what happened I tried for 20 minutes to keep blood pumping with CPR when the ambulance arrived and the paramedics arrived I was begging them to save her
They took her to the emergency room and I contacted my dad who immediately started crying, the drive over to the hospital felt like hours, when we arrived they told us there was nothing they could do and she was already gone



I’ve been pushing as hard as I can but I don’t know how much further I can go "
So sick of explaining why I broke up with my boyfriend,"Because I wasn't happy, okay?? Because I am young and unsure of what I want out of life and I don't feel comfortable in the confines of a relationship anymore. Maybe that's selfish, but that's why the relationship is over as opposed to me stringing him along while not actually being into it. 

There doesn't have to be some big dramatic reason why we didn't work out. Nobody cheated, nobody abused anyone, nothing about the relationship was toxic. It just didn't work out. That's how it is sometimes, 2 nice people meet and they split and that's it. 

Whenever a friend hears the news they're quick to question me about why I would break up with someone who's so nice. What, am I supposed to marry every fuckin guy who's nice to me??? They start to make assumptions that demonize my ex because there has to have been something wrong if we just stopped seeing each other. 

My ex is a fantastic guy and I want nothing but the best for him. But I also want the best for me, too. Even if they don't understand it right now, I do. "
"Turns out: I'm not dying, and it sucks.","Two years ago, I was diagnosed with stage 4 brain cancer that had metastasized to my lymph nodes and liver. I was given one year with intense chemotherapy and invasive surgeries. My parents essentially forced me to get the procedures done. Nothing worked, and the doctors told me to ""prepare for the inevitable."" 

So I went wild. I spent most of my money traveling the world, getting shitface drunk every other day, having the time of my life. I still did weekly chemo treatments plus a clinical trial which made me disastrously ill, but I didn't care--I was dying soon! I was excited. 

However, after Year 1 passed, my doctor told me that my stage 4 was downgraded to stage 3a. Still bad, but not as bad. The cancer was responding to treatment--but at best, I had--maybe--one year (again). 

One year later, and I'm stage 1. I'm essentially in remission, except for one small nodule that's on my lung, which I'm going to have removed tomorrow. The doctors are shocked, but I'm expected to be in full remission a year from now. I'm only 25 and the doctors think my age helped the recovery, but... I'm upset. I wanted to die. Not suicidal, but the pain I've been through and the comfort of knowing I was *finally* going to be done with it all--now I'm stuck here. 

This sounds ungrateful, right? I don't know. I'm all confused. Now I have to start thinking about what I'm going to do with the rest of my life. I dropped out of grad school because I thought I wasn't going to live to finish. "
Thank you,"I was on my way home all alone on the bus, still silently crying because my ex just broke up with me and I guess you noticed, the bus was all empty beside you and me. When I walked out of the bus, sitting alone on the pavement waiting for my next bus to home you asked me if I’d rather come inside again because you said you weren’t going anywhere for a while and my bus wasn’t coming for another 10 minutes. You started small talking to me about everything and nothing and I am so incredibly thankful for that. You took my mind of things and you calmed me down even if you probably just had a long day driving around. I wish there were more people like you, and I wished i expressed my gratitude in some way. Thank you bus driver, you are a lovely human being and even if I might be reading into it too hard, that small token of care is something I still think about when I’m down. "
I stopped a rape today.,"I hope you'll put your judgments aside for a second, but this was at a gay sauna. For the uninitiated, it's a place where men go to have anonymous sex with other men. Admittedly it's decrepit, but as a gay man who had his first sexual experience at age 26 after half a lifetime of self-hate, it's sexually freeing, and it avoids the bullshit of dating apps.

I was sitting in the porn room -- imagine a big U-shaped black leather sectional before a group of TV screens playing different gay pornos (congrats if you made it this far in this post). To my left is a fit dude who is obviously unconscious. He's slumped over and it's hard to tell if he's even breathing because most of the place is intentionally dark. To my right is a guy who asks me bemusedly ""Is this an emergency or whatever?"", nodding to Mr. Unconscious. On the rest of the sectional there's around 6 or so other guys, doing whatever horny men do.

Then comes along Mr. Beady Eyes. He plops down beside Mr. Unconscious, realizes he's not responsive, then goes down on his knees to give him a blowjob. Mr. Unconscious still hasn't opened his eyes or moved at all. I look around the room in horror. Most of the guys are distracted with other things and it's hard to see who's actually observing this too.

It's a solid minute before I came to my senses, got up, kicked Mr. Beady Eyes off, and with the most 'bro' voice my measly self could muster, yelp out ""that's not cool."" Keep in mind that nobody really talks in these places - it's all body language in a background of pulsing EDM. He looks at me confused and slithers back to the hole he came from. I try shaking Mr. Unconscious awake to no avail. I'm feeling upset about the nastiness of the world so I decide to take a shower and head out. Before I leave, I see he's awake, groggy and drugged up as shit, talking to some staff members who probably wanted to make sure he wasn't dead.

Anyways, I wanted to get this off my chest because there's nobody else I would share this with. First of all, I feel like a guardian angel for the gays so feel free to clap your hands for me. Jk. Second of all, rape knows no gender and even in seedy places like this, you need to be able to give and get consent. Thirdly, I'm disappointed because I felt this place was some strange safe gay haven until today, however naive I sound. Finally, don'tdodrugsplz.

Thanks for reading.

**EDIT:  Hey listen up to those saying I could've done more:**

Did I leave this guy alone to take a shower like Blanche DuBois? Yes.

Do I regret not doing more? Yes. I'll stick around next time but I'd like to think I made enough ruckus to get a staff member's attention. Remind me next time to think straight (is this a pun?) amidst a deflating boner and EDM and sex sounds in the background.

Do I call myself a hero? No. Do I feel self-righteous? Fuck yeah because I did something that I felt was objectively good, even if small."
Dear 10th grader…,"I understand you’re new to High School and you try to act cool for your friends, but shoving into people during an empty hallway and pushing people older than you for Vine/Snapchat stories, and mocking them is completely uncalled for. You kinda crossed the line today when you decided to mess with me, especially when all of you pulled out your phones to start the video. I still remember your sly little grin plastered on your face once I realized that you slammed me into the wall, knocking one crutch from under my arm and I felt the sharp pain from my already broken ankle hitting the floor; which you twisted up again by the way. I also remember the shocked gasps that escaped from your little *carbon copies* when I retaliated on sheer instinct; so I don’t know why you acted surprised when I whipped around and clocked you in the face with my fist as hard as I could; breaking your nose in the process.
 I get it; you’re ‘*tough shit*’ and ‘*nobody messes with you*’ but you deserved that trip to the hospital and I hope you learn to respect other people.


Sincerely, pissed off 12th grader who needs to be in crutches until November instead of October.

*Edit* - Holy shit this blew up in a matter of hours; lol I didn't get suspended, in fact they did! Not all Canadian school systems are totally fucked, hah. They were a group of girls who have been doing this to everyone ever since school started a week ago, I was waiting for my friend because the halls were too chaotic for me and she watched everything and nearly pissed herself laughing. - Am also a female fellow redditors c:

I spoke Spanish today and I've never been more proud,"For starters, I'm a high-school student with relatively bad social anxiety and I've been studying Spanish for about 6 years now. I do okay in the class but I never expected something like this to happen.


I'm in New York alone for the next week (not exactly easy for someone with social anxiety) and I can't drive yet so I needed to take a shuttle from the place I was staying. When the driver came to pick me up, he gave me his phone so I could type in the address. I briefly noticed that his language setting was set in Spanish but I didn't make much of it. Because my destination was a little further away, he dropped off the other passengers first so it was us sitting in the front seat. This is when I remembered that quote from the movie ""We bought a Zoo"" where it said to give 20 seconds of bravery and something amazing will come of it...so I did it. 


The words “Hablas español” came out of my mouth as my driver looked absolutely astonished at the young chinese boy attempting to speak in his native tongue. After that, the next 9 minutes we had together felt like two old best friends who hadn’t caught up in forever. He introduced himself as Jose and he was from Salvador. I asked him questions and he delivered. I didn’t even feel like I was speaking a foreign language. He spoke slowly for me. He told me about his big house in Salvador, how he lost his parents and had to come to US for work. How he worked two jobs and was so exhausted that he fell asleep on the road and was hospitalized for a week. He talked about his favorite foods, his wife and three beautiful kids, and how his favorite pastime is sleeping on a hammock. He continuously told me that I spoke really well which made me happy and how important it is for me to learn more languages. At the end of the ride, I shook his hand and he thanked me and told me how he was honored to have driven me. I know this may not seem like much but this was close to the most genuine conversation I have ever had with a complete stranger in a language that I had only studied!

Tl;dr: driver is spanish; I speak spanish; Awesome conversation; I’m proud of myself

"My Dad worked with many Mexican folks over the years, both legal and illegal, and his story breaks my heart.","Went home to visit my Dad who's dealing with a heap of medical trouble (a story for another time) and out of nowhere, we got on the topic of immigrants, the current political clime, and his experience, which left me fucking enraged.  I had no idea he had such rich knowledge of the immigrant community.  I've been wanting to grab people in the street and tell them about it ever since... but I guess this will have to do.  Someone just needs to hear.  Or read.  Whatever.
  
The thing I remember most about my Old Man from my youth was that his hands felt like *rocks* from the work he did, straight up *rocks.*  Drywall, plumbing, construction, electric, painting - you name it, he did it. He worked with a variety of guys, busting his ass for years - Many of those guys were Mexican, and most would fight tooth and nail to be able to work with, and under, my Dad.  When I asked him why, he wasn't really sure.  He said maybe it was because he bought them espresso sometimes - said they missed how good it was back home, but it was $4 a cup in the U.S., and that was too much luxury.  ""Christ,"" he'd said, ""You'd have thought I bought them each a steak every time, just *thank you thank you thank you.*""
  
Another time, one of them genuinely asked him why he works so much.  My old man just says he's got bills to pay, family to take care of (the reality is he's got two kids he wants to send to college on a minimum wage job and a mountain of medical bills - again, story for another time).  His coworker didn't know much English, but he said ""You the only guy I meet work hard as me.  I work.  Send money home.  Maybe I have one beer.  Back to work.""
  
The day my old man lost his job, they all walked off the job with him.  They said ""We no work for them, we work for you.""  No one was more surprised than my old man, but he said he knew most of the other guys treated them like shit.
  
And just... Once my old man started telling stories, I got angrier and angrier at all of the entitled people I've known, at my ignorant American friends who don't know shit about hard work, let alone the type of work my old man had to do with these guys.  He mowed lawns, he dunged out busted septic with a shovel, he nearly got robbed and beaten in the roughest of neighborhoods, shot at, blowing though a bottle of Hydrogen peroxide a week just on random wounds from screws, hammers, nails, who knows - none of it was glorious, all of it was hard on his body, but he did what he needed to for his family, and I'm thankful for it every day - That's all any of these guys were, hard working men, busting their asses, hands like rocks, to take care of their families, and *why the fuck are people mad about that??*
  
Because ""they don't pay taxes?""  **Bullshit**.  Green card holders pay, visa holders do if they stay too long, and, hey, fun fact according to my Dad, most illegals don't work under the table.  Most use a bogus ss# and their employers take out taxes perfectly normally - but the hell if the guys ever *file for a tax return.*
  
Oh, so, it's because ""they take our jobs??""  
  
That's the biggest load of entitled bullshit I've heard in a long time.  What makes them ""our"" jobs?  The fact that we came squealing into this world on *this* side of some shitty river beneath Texas?  And who's ""they,"" a hard working guy who was born on the other side?  Why is he any different than my Dad?  My Dad's ancestors once came here for a better life, we're Americans, all of ours did (Barring our black friends, of course).  So who the fuck are we to bar someone else from doing the goddamn same?? 
 Who are we to *let* someone bar them from doing the same?  I thought we learned in elementary school that treating people different based on looks or language or where they're from is fucking wrong - but hey, if we wanna go there, lets talk about how my Dad was the only white guy on their crew, because he was the only white guy within 10 miles of the place who could swallow his pride enough to dung shit out of a hole for $10 an hour so his kids could have a better life - *Dad* didn't want that job, *they* didn't want that job, but they did it, they did it while paying fucking taxes, and trust me when I tell you, they didn't fucking *take* that job, from *anyone.*
  
What hit me the hardest was realizing that those guys didn't walk off of the job with my old man because he bought them fucking *espresso,* they did it because he was the only guy there that treated them with any amount of fucking *respect.*  Like the hard working guys they were.  Like humans, instead of second class citizens, and that's what this is really all about.  People don't want Mexicans out of the country because ""they're illegal, and you should follow the law"" or ""they don't pay taxes,""  or ""they're taking our jobs,"" none of that shit holds any water.  They want them out because they're different, and brown, and speak a different language, and they're from somewhere else, and that's icky.
  
I don't know where those guys are now, but god dammit I wish them well during this politically induced shit storm, busting their asses to take care of their families, just like my Dad did, only difference is they were born on the other side of a shitty river in Texas, meanwhile my country is trying to spend trillions on a fucking wall while kids in schools can't afford pencils.
  
Wherever they are, I hope people are treating them like decent, hard working human beings, but I doubt it, and it breaks my heart.
  
**Edit: the fact that this blew up some and so many people feel the same way has given me more hope than I ever realized it could. Thank you all. It's exactly what I needed.**"
"Go fuck yourself if you hate on Caitlyn Jenner, but are quick to come to Josh Duggar's defense","Bruce Jenner is now Caitlyn Jenner. She prefers to be referred to as a female, and if you had any human decency, you'd respect her wishes and treat her in a dignified manner.

Reassignment surgery works. It's an effective means of dealing with gender dysphoria that not only greatly reduces the likelihood of suicide, but makes the person dealing with it even happier with themselves.

So why take that away from her? Not even a month ago, people were defending that Josh Duggar piece of shit, who violated 5 little girls. Anybody of even a remotely sound mind understands that child molestation is unethical since it's not only undignified and defiling, but inducing long-term trauma into innocent victims. Child molestation is unethical in the most black-and-white sense to the point that many believe child molesters should get the death penalty. 

Yet, Josh Duggar walks free without enduring scrutiny to the extent that Caitlyn Jenner is. 

Caitlyn Jenner isn't disgusting. She isn't a monster. And she isn't a freak. Josh Duggar, on the other hand, is exactly those three things.

It's very telling when some people in society view a serial child molester as a better human being than someone who committed the heinous crime of confronting their long-term gender dysphoria with effective treatment that the medical community has vast support of. 

Transphobia fucking sucks. "
A kid walked up to me in the store,"I was carrying two jugs of cat litter; I had a carton of eggs between my arm and side. Behind me, I heard a kid say, ""Excuse me?"" I turned and saw he was carrying a basket. ""Would you like this? I saw you had all that stuff and thought maybe you could use it.""

I took the basket and told him, ""Keep being nice, man. World needs more nice people like you."" He couldn't have been more than 8 years old.

Made my day."
I’m cutting off a friend and it hurts.,"I’ve (21F) had this friend Dylan (21M) that I’ve known for 6 years. We were each other’s first good friends in high school freshman year. We got along so well and were inseparable for 4 years. We’d call each other almost every day after school and just stay on the phone while we went about our evenings and we’d hang out all of the time and he ALWAYS was the one to be excited and help me plan my birthdays. It was pretty cool to have someone like that.

Once we graduated, we stayed in touch but I went to college and he started at a technical school and over text, conversation just started to diminish. But we would meet up from time to time and things were just like old times.

However, I noticed that he became close friends with a group of girls that used to harass me in high school. He’d always post on social media about his best friends and how much he loved them all. It just kind of stung. He used to comfort me when I’d be really upset about my interactions with those girls. 

Over the past few months, we’ve talked maybe every 1-2 weeks and it’s always been friendly. We talked about my birthday a few times and he was excited to see me and catch up.

A week ago, I told him the plan for my birthday and he just said maybe he would come. Yesterday was my 21st birthday. He opened the two messages I sent, one of which was asking if he’d be there. Never replied. Never even wished me a happy birthday. Constantly on social media and hanging out with other people.

I just wanted to get this out because it fucking hurts, and I’ve been too embarrassed to mention it to my other friends. It may not seem like a big deal but I don’t have a huge circle of friends and I still considered him pretty important to me. I guess I’m cutting him off, there wasn’t really anything climactic that happened but I just feel disrespected.


Edit: I wasn’t really expecting much of a response on my boring story, but it makes me feel so good to know there are lots of people here that care enough to take the time and say nice things to a stranger. Thank you :)"
"Please, please don't drink and drive. I met a victim today.","I don't know if this is where this belongs, and I'm sorry if I'm a bit scattered. This literally just happened and I really needed to talk to someone about it. Also on phone, so yeah. 

I was at the grocery store when a man came up to me. I wanna say he was in his mid to early thirties. He said something along the lines of ""Hey, you sure are C-U-T-E"". Normally I don't like comments like this, but he seemed genuine and wasn't being a creep about it, so I smiled, thanked him, and went back to my shopping. 

Shortly after I ran into him again, and he said I was cute again, but in a different way. This time he told me he really hopes I have a good evening, again in a incredibly sincere way. At this point I get the feeling there's something off about him. 

Again I'm polite, thank him, and try to go back to my shopping. However this time he keeps talking to me. I'm not really sure how we got there, we were barely talking for more than a minute or two, but he introduced himself and he tells me he was hit by a truck. A drunk driver. He was on his motorcycle and had been in a coma for a while (I didn't ask how long). 

This is when I started noticing small scars and things along his neck and body. 

He introduced himself a few times, and told me the drunk driver story twice. He told me the specific type of damage he had, but I didn't know what it was so I don't remember it. 

When he talked about the coma, he was bummed but said that that was in the past. There's only the future. Then he smiled at me and said he hoped I had a wonderful future. 

This really really shook me. I obviously know driving drunk is bad, but seeing the damage it can do... Knowing his friends and family had to go through thinking he was going to die, only to have him come back as someone else. Someone who probably can't fully function in society.

All because some selfish person didn't want to pay for a ride. 

No amount of money or service is ever going to bring that man's life back. 

Maybe it's for the better. Maybe he was awful beforehand and now he's this incredibly sweet guy. But probably not. He asked if I had someone in my life, and I told him yes because I didn't want to have to turn him down if I told him the truth. I felt awful for it. He probably has a hard time finding dates. 

Ugh I'm rambling now. I feel silly crying over this, but I can't stop thinking about him. 

I don't care if you didn't have that much. I don't care if the Uber is expensive. You either wait that shit out or find someone to take you home. I don't care if it's inconvenient.

Don't do this to someone. Please don't take someone else's life from them. They don't deserve it, no matter who they are. 

And Dave, I hope you have an absolutely marvelous future. You'll never know how profound it was to meet you. Keep making people's days brighter with your happy smile and your sweet words."
"Fell in love with girl at work, turned down my dream job, called off my wedding...and it all worked out","This one's gonna be long, so bear with me.  Just needed to express how much relief I feel, and how happy I finally am. There are a lot of moving pieces here, so I'll start it back a few years ago.

I'd been dating this girl, I'll call her Carly, since high school.  She was the first girl I'd ever been serious with, and we went through a lot together.  I helped her get over her parents' divorce, was with her as she struggled in college, transferred schools, and then flourished when she found her passion at school.  When I graduated a year ahead of her, I made the decision to live 90 minutes away from my new job so that I could live with her while she finished school.  We celebrated together when she got into grad school (at the same university), and we were there for each other through life's stresses - her with grad school and not feeling smart enough, and me with a very stressful, demanding job that required long hours.

I tell you all of the above so that you understand the work and love we put into our relationship.  Things weren't easy for either one of us, and there were many nights when we would fight about silly things simply because our mutual stresses made it hard to get real quality time together.  Over time, as we grew into adults, I began to realize that we were very different people in many ways.  Carly was very loving, empathetic and was great with children, but could be very emotional, irresponsible and unwilling to compromise.  I, by contrast, am very logical and responsible, but can often come off as aloof or detached.  These personality differences, combined with a relative lack of mutual interests, made me start to have second thoughts about marriage - which, along with kids and a life together, had always been simply something that was expected to happen - after a few years of living on our own together.  Carly was a great person, but I wasn't any longer certain that she was the right person to spend my life with, and to be the mother of my children.  As the length of our relationship grew, Carly got more insistent about marriage and gave me a joking-but-serious ultimatum that if I didn't propose by X time, she would break it off.

I was struggling with this internally for a long time, because while I was confident that I could have a good, generally enjoyable life with Carly, I also knew deep down that she was not the best match for me, and that there would always be conflict in our relationship.  At the time, I was also feeling more and more ground down by my job, which was demanding longer hours and more weekend work all the time.  However, after talking things through at length with my best friend, and after resolving to find a new and better job, I decided I could make things work.  I proposed within the ultimatum time frame and things were good for awhile.  Everything seemed fine as we began planning a wedding, and I even started the interview process at a big tech firm for a prestigious new job possibility that I was very excited about.

A few months later, everything changed.

The first thing to happen was that, after multiple interviews and indications that an offer would be coming my way from the tech company, things went silent.  I found out that the person who would have been my boss was let go by the company, and it seemed like the department I would have worked in was in disarray.  I heard nothing for more than two months, other than vague promises that the role I'd applied for still existed and that I'd hear from them.

The second thing that happened was Andrea.

Andrea was a new hire at my existing job, and she immediately blew me away.  She was smart, beautiful, very opinionated and passionate (in a good way) and she shared many of my interests (heck, we had majored in EXACTLY the same odd program combination at the same college a few years apart).  In short, she immediately seemed to underline to me all of the things that I valued in a woman, and all of the things that Carly was not.  I was totally smitten with her; the only problem was that she had a boyfriend.  I found myself spending a lot of time talking to and working with her as a consequence of the nature of the work, and suddenly I didn't hate my job so much anymore.  I should mention at this point that Andrea had a boyfriend from the time she started at my company, and that while we got along great together, neither of us ever went so far as to flirt, spend extra time together outside of work, or go further than being coworkers.

However, these new feelings made me start to reconsider things with Carly.  In light of Andrea showing me ""what else was out there,"" did I really want to marry and spend my entire life with Carly when I had doubts that she and I were really right for each other?  Compounding this problem was that the tech company finally called me back and set up one final interview with me.  I went to the interview and aced it.  A few days later, the company indicated that an offer letter was on the way, for real this time.  

This sequence of events placed me in an internal crisis: what do I do about this job?  On the one hand, if I take the new job, it'll be a big career move, a big (as I found out after getting the offer letter) raise, and would potentially mitigate a big (though by no means the only) area of conflict in our relationship - my long hours at work.  On the other hand, and I recognize how dumb this sounds - I'd likely never see Andrea again.  Did I mention she had a boyfriend?  In my head, my choice thus boiled down to being between taking the great new job and resigning myself to marriage and a life with Carly, **or** turning it down, breaking up with Carly, and hoping against hope that Andrea would eventually dump her boyfriend and that I could be with this person that truly seemed to me to be my perfect match.  Guess which one I chose?

In the end, I had simply decided that while a life with Carly would be ok, I couldn't be content with that anymore.  I turned down the lucrative job offer with the tech company, and a few weeks later, I called off the wedding and broke up with Carly, citing the stresses of my job and the fact that I simply wasn't happy with myself as a person.  I'll note that both of these things were true at the time, though not the proximate causes of the breakup.  Many tears were shed, dozens of awkward phone calls and emails ensued to would-be wedding attendees, and I tried to work my hardest to make sure that Carly and I could remain friends.  I even continued to pay many of her and her disabled mother's bills for the next year-plus, since I knew that neither of them had the means to do so.  Carly moved out, and we began separate lives, though we would still hang out as friends now and then.  This was difficult, though we made it work.  Carly would often comment that she could never date again, that nobody would want her, and that it was too late for her (all of which was ridiculous, she was and is a great person, pretty, and by no stretch too old to go back to dating).  Neither of us dated for more than a year after we broke up - her for not wanting to, and me because I knew it would devastate her emotionally.

About 6 months later, Andrea walked into work with a diamond engagement ring on her finger. Well, fuck.  Now the truth all along, that I'm an idiot, was very apparent.

Knowing that my only reason for staying at the old job was now void, I began job hunting in earnest again.  It took a long time, but after another 7 months or so, I found a really cool position with a start-up.  It didn't pay as much, nor was it as stable or prestigious as the job turned down at the tech company, but it was a huge improvement in my quality of life while still being a pay increase over what I'd been making.  Shortly thereafter, another shoe dropped: my friend Eddie, who had been in a long, toxic relationship with his awful girlfriend, finally dumped her (Carly and I had always both hated her and wondered why Eddie put up with her).  Needing somewhere to go so that he wouldn't have to continue living with his awful ex, he came to stay with me for awhile.  I helped him to work through his emotions, and he and I and Carly began to have friend hangouts on a fairly regular basis (all of us had been friends in college, and Carly still lived fairly close by).  Eventually Eddie was able to get everything moved out of his old shared place and moved, finding himself an apartment closer to his place of work.  As it turned out, this apartment was in the same complex where Carly was now living.

You may be able to see where this is going.  Over the next several months, as I was making progress at my new job, Carly and Eddie began to hang out more and more together due to their proximity.  They are both goofy, fun-loving people that complement each other well, and honestly a far better match in terms of personalities and interests than Carly and I ever were.  In time, each approached me separately to sheepishly admit that they had feelings for the other, and to see if I would be ok with them trying to date.  Honestly, this was in no way surprising, and while I knew it would be strange with one of my best friends dating my ex, I couldn't have been more happy that two of my friends could make each other so happy.  I enthusiastically co-signed their relationship, telling them that while they have no need of my ""blessing,"" they absolutely had it.

One consequence of Eddie and Carly getting together was that I felt that I could begin dating again without hurting Carly.  So in the next month or two, I started dipping my toes in the dating scene.  After a few frustrating false starts, I met a wonderful girl that is 100% on my wavelength in terms of personality, who gets how I think, and who makes me smile every time I think about her.  We've now been together for almost a year, and neither of us has ever been happier.  We're looking at moving in together when she finishes with her current career rotation, with bigger plans to follow.  In the meantime, Carly has found a new and better job herself, is making more money, and no longer requires my constant financial support.

So there it is.  I turned down a dream position, called off a wedding and ended a many-year relationship to stay at a job I hated in order to pursue a seemingly-perfect but unattainable girl. While that inevitably blew up in my face, I'm now confident that I made the right decision in not marrying Carly, and we remain good friends (incidentally, she has now expressed to me that we are both better off and that our differences were too significant, which I take as a tacit endorsement that I did the right thing).  She and I are each now in separate and very happy relationships and now we both have jobs we love and that fulfill us financially and personally.  To top it all off, one of my best friends, Eddie, is happier than I've ever seen him.  Nobody but Reddit and another of my best friends will ever know that all of this was precipitated by Andrea, and with any luck nobody ever will.  But in the end, it's pretty amazing and gratifying how things worked out for everybody."
you fucking fuck,"How the fuck are you going to blame a 7 year old for wanting to have sex? I didn't even know what a dick was i didn't even know what the fuck was happening to me it took me years to finally realised i had been raped. i finally told you you were meant to support me comfort me you were meant to be a fucking DAD but no you fucking accused me of wanting it YOU FUCKING ACCUSED A 7 YEAR OLD LITTLE GIRL FOR WANTING SEX you sick bastard i fucking hate you so much im disgusted by the fact that i'm related to you youre fucking sick you sick fuck

Edit: i'm honestly crying right now, i didn't expect this many people to understand and support me, thank you all for your kind words it means a lot to me, you're all such wonderful beings."
I accidentally handed in the wrong assignment and got a 30%,"I just got my grade back for an assignment and instead of the A that I was expecting, I got a 30%. I had followed all of the instructions to a T and worked quite hard on it. This is my final semester of undergrad and 20% of my application to vet school this year depends on this semester, so I saw my entire future go out the window because of how badly I was apparently going to screw up this course.

I just went to the Prof's office to pick up my assignment and see where I went wrong, but before I had even gotten a chance to reach into the pile of papers to find mine, she called me into her office to ask me if I had submitted the wrong paper. I grabbed my knapsack and frantically searched through it, and lo and behold, there was my assignment. I had accidentally grabbed a very similar looking early rough draft from my bag the day it was due and hadn't realized.

Luckily I've spoken with the Prof before and had brought in said rough draft a week before the assignment was due and she had told me what to change, so she knew that I wouldn't have purposely handed in the bad copy. She let me give her the real assignment and she's regrading it. I'm so, so relieved. God bless kind and understanding Profs. "
to my nice neighbors,"i live next door to an older mexican women and she raises (I assume) her grandson. She doesn't speak any english, so I've never really talked with her other than a wave here and there. 

Occasionally her kid will catch me walking my dog (7 year old lab) and he loves to come say hi. The kid sees me taking out the trash the other day and asks where my dog is, I explain to him that my dog is sick (cancer) and inside recovering from getting a mass removed. The next day the kid and his grandma show up at my door with a little cake with a dog on it that the grandma baked and some unreadable get-well card from the kid. 

it was a really sweet thing to do and made me pretty happy. just thought i'd share"
He's gone. Widowed at 27,"I know a lot of people here followed the story that I posted. My husband was in an accident with an 18 wheeler. 
We made the decision to take him off life support last Saturday. He held on for a long time. His heart lungs and brain stem were in tact and good condition so it took longer than expected. 

Friday 9/12/14 at 915pm he passed away. I thought I was prepared. I wasn't. I cried so much and so loud I'm sure the entire hospice heard me. 

When he took his final breaths a tear rolled down his cheek.... I know he didn't want to go. But he had to. The choice had been taken from us. 

The pain I feel is like no other. I came home that night and everything in our home reminds me of him. His nightstand by our bed is the same as he left it. His glasses on the bathroom counter sitting right next to his contacts case. 

I find only a small amount of comfort knowing he is no longer in pain. 

We did everything in life together. And now I'm left here alone trying to wrap my head around that he is never coming home. Ever. 

I am so hurt and angry. Not sure who I am angry with but I am. 

While the nurses were cleaning him up after he passed, my family and I sat in another room. While sitting there the doors rattled. No wind. Clear glass doors. No one there. 

And then while I was sitting with his body the light above his body flickered 2 times. We had been there 5 days and they never had once flickered before. 

I also found out one of the icu nurses I had made friends with, his brother in law was a police officer at my husband's wreck. Small world. 

Our youngest is too young to understand. she's only 2 1/2. My oldest is currently with her father this weekend so she doesn't even know yet. She comes home at 6 today. 

I just needed vent a little. Thank you all for your support. I've received a lot of messages and comments. 

My youngest went to church with my cousin. I am making myself go out and visit with our horses. I find it hard to get out of bed at all. 

Talk to you soon reddit. Thanks for reading.

Edit - ty all for the responses. I went and rode for awhile. It really helped. I am taking it day by day, hour by hour. I've only cried 2 times today so far it's 10am. "
I'm lying next to the girl of my dreams,"She's asleep after a long night of cuddling and making out. I still worry that this won't last long, that what we have is fragile, but I still feel weightless. It's still early on in our relationship, but I want to say those three words so badly. I say them under my breath hoping she doesn't catch me, because I don't want to startle her with how heavily I've fallen for her. It's been so easy to fall for her. I don't know why she's so nice to me or thinks I'm attractive at all, but it makes me feel so fucking happy for the first time in my life and I don't want to lose that. Just something I needed to say or I think I'd exlode. She's so good to me.

edit: wow. this blew up more than I expected, and I've been spending the whole weekend with her so I haven't even checked reddit. Thanks for all the support, I'm going to keep taking deep breaths and try to do this one step at a time."
"I'm 23, only child and I just found out, I'm not my parents' real kid.","Hi! I have a story I wanted to share. It happened just hours ago. I have a huge extended family, cuz my mom and dad have many siblings. I grew up to this lavish (for me it is lavish but we are not rich) lifestyle. I went to private school from kindergarten till college. I have a good life I would say. I'm very happy with how huge our whole family is and how they treated me like a diamond. I feel special every time I'm with them. My parents would give me the world even if I won't ask for it. Even if we can't afford it, they would always find a way. But I didn't grew up to be a freaking brat haha i love my parents so much yet I don't really know why I felt this ""lacking"" feeling. It wasn't a big deal to me, yet it was there buried somewhere in my mind. I don't know what it is, or why is it etched in my mind? It's a small worry that would pop up in my head when I'm about to sleep. I can't even explain it, it was like worrying about an imaginary problem. You know it doesn't really exist but why am i thinking about it? (Idk if that made sense) It was a feeling that something is kinda missing in my life (im gay btw and nope it's not a man that's missing lol). Then this morning, my mom came in and told me a story out of no where. My mom works at a hospital, she's a midwife. My mom and dad tried so hard to have a baby yet failed due to some problems. Until the night she dreamt about having a baby boy... that's why my nickname is Dream Boy (dont laugh) I always have a great attachment to the hospital my mom works at. Basically bcuz I was a sick kid back then so I spent my childhood days confined in this hospital. All of my God Fathers and God Mothers are doctors, nurses, custodians, guards and chefs that works in this hospital. I don't mind it cuz I love them all. Then my mom continued her story, 23 years ago, a baby boy was discovered in one of the hospital cribs who was left by his mother or someone. When one of the staff saw her she basically fled the scene and was chased by the guards yet she was gone. At that time of the night the hospital doesn't have a midwife on duty so they called my mother in. The baby didn't have a place to go, no records, no everything. So my mom took the baby home. Gave the baby the love and care of a mother would. Even my dad stepped it together with the hospital staff and took great measures to find the baby's parents. Yet nothing was found. 23 yrs later, the baby boy grew up to be an amazing talented person. A digital artist and photographer.

That's when I snapped, IT WAS ME.  The baby boy in the crib.

I cried so hard. Everyone in my whole family knew and yet they all treated me like their flesh and blood. I'm the only child of my parents who raised me. I didn't hate them for keeping this from me. I was actually glad that GOOD PEOPLE took me in, gave me food, water and shelter. I will be forever grateful to them. And yes all my god fathers and god mothers were all the staff of the hospital who were present the day I was discovered in the crib. Idk what to write now haha maybe just end with I LOVE MY PARENTS SO MUCH. I LOVE MY FAMILY. and to my birth parents, Whoever you are, I hope you're both ok or if i have any siblings, i hope ur all doing ok as well. Thank You for not choosing abortion over me (idk if i was made out of love or something else) thank u for not leaving me in a trashcan or a public bathroom where i might have been found dead, thank you cuz in all the places you could leave me, you chose a place where strangers would definitely take care of me. Thank you.

❤️ sending my love to all the moms, dads, daughters and sons. 

Edit: someone message me why I'm using a beautiful girls photo in my profile, lol that's me, hehe sorry if i look like a girl cuz im very feminine. ❤️❤️❤️ the irony of being nicknamed Dream Boy 😂 "
To the boy who stood up for me,"Thank you. We must have been about twelve. I wore the same jeans every day. The same shirt, too, though I switched jackets. 

I wasn't poor. I could have had more clothing. Dad spiraled out long ago; Mom never left her bed. Hygeine doesn't grow on trees and I didn't yet know to care for it. 

I had drawn peace signs and hearts all over my jeans. We were in English class. Asshole kid says, ""do you ever change your pants?"" Tween girls with too much make up and push up bras snicker. 

The boy in front of me turns his head slightly and says, ""so?""

Everyone shuts up. 

We had never spoken before and never spoke again. I'll never forget you. 

((My grammar is fucked. Just wanted to get this out there.))"
Fuck this 'pedophile acceptance' movement. (TW),"Edit: I regret making this post. I suppose I should have just continued to keep quiet about this.

Also please I fucking beg of you, post whatever you want but do not send me messages telling me I deserved it or that I just need to get over it and stop being a pansy. *Please* do not fucking do that.

I have been seeing this a lot on the internet lately. I have kept quiet, because I did not want to aggravate people. Now, however, I am angry enough to say something.

Fuck you. Fuck all the people who think pedophiles are 'just like homosexuals' and should therefore be allowed to ""come out"" to society and be accepted. Fuck the people who think we should start calling pedophiles ""pedosexuals."" Fuck all the people who try to defend themselves by saying 'children are cognitive enough to give consent at 9 or 10,' or that 'this used to be acceptable, it's only recently that it's become taboo.' Yes, because it's only recently people have realized *how much childhood sexual abuse fucks children up.* Fuck those who think it should be okay to watch childhood pornography because 'they're not actually hurting children.' *Where do you think that pornography came from?*

Especially fuck those who think by not wanting to accept this and make it become common place, our society is 'in the dark ages.' If this means we're in the dark ages, then I want to stay in the fucking dark ages.

Yes, I know not all pedophiles are sexual offenders. I think pedophiles should have access to good mental health care, absolutely. I do occasionally see posts from pedophiles lamenting the fact that they are afraid to go, but do want to get better, and I think that option should be readily available for them.

What I don't think is that it's okay for them to become accepted, to integrate into society, to become accepted as an ""oppressed sexual minority."" You do not belong in GSM groups. Pedophilia is not a sexuality. It is a paraphilia. Children cannot consent.

Repeat after me:

Children Can Not Consent.

This is not fucking okay. 

Signed,

A victim of childhood sexual abuse who is tired of seeing all these people who think it's all right for people like my abuser to be integrated and accepted into society. Someone who does not want this to happen in fear other children will experience the same thing she did. 

Also, you know the phrase ""just because you didn't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there?"" Yeah. Just keep that in mind.

Reddit is not the entire internet..."
Me and my daughter,"I’ve been told all of my daughter’s life that she looks just like me. I hardly ever see it but maybe it’s because I don’t want to. This morning as she and I were getting ready for work and school and sharing lipstick I looked over and saw a smaller version of me. I made her take a picture with me and studied it. Same eyes, same nose, same smile and teeth, same chin. She’s me in so many ways that it’s scary. 

So why wouldn’t I want to acknowledge it? Maybe it’s because I am riddled with self esteem issues. Maybe it’s because I have a rocky relationship with my own mom and always hated when people say I look like her. Maybe it’s because I see all of my flaws and I see none in my daughter. Maybe it’s because whenever someone says that she and I look alike I cringe a little hoping she’s not cringing thinking why do I have to look like my crazy mom. 

This is the first time in her eleven years of life that I’ve acknowledged the real reasons why I cringe when people say we look alike. I posted the picture on Facebook and got several compliments ranging from gorgeous to beauties. I never believe any of them (about myself). I wish I could see what others see in me. I hope one day I will. 

I’m two years out of an emotionally abusive marriage with a partner who never complimented me. He always looked at me with such disgust. How in the world am I supposed to move past that and see what people see in me? Will my feelings about myself ever change? Clearly I need therapy....

So nice to be able to vent. If you’ve read this far, thank you. "
"I thought I was gonna get a $500 raise, but I was wrong.","So I love my job. I'm finally doing something that makes me happy, and I am very lucky that my place of work appreciates my self-study and experience in place of my lack of degree. Specifically, they are happy that I have learned 2 foreign languages to fluency, and some others to a lower level of functionality that is useful for this job.

Anyway I was hired on a 6 month probationary period nd told at the end I would get a $500 raise. I thought and extra $500 per year is nice and would help me out greatly. I was wrong. I just found out today that my raise is not yearly, but rather monthly. This is not a $500 per year raise, but rather a $6000 per year raise, on top of a salary that I already thought was generous. My life is finally getting better and better."
I was being ironic... you weren't....,"Today I gave you a magnificent sponge bath, complete with your favorite facial cleanser, lotions and shampoo.  As I always do, being your caregiver, I chatted about all sorts of things I thought might interest you.  Though you can not talk... in fact, you can only occasionally, using all your physical strength and focus, nod to the affirmative, and all of your muscles have now failed due to advanced MS, I said a few things that obviously got your attention.  My essentially one sided conversation wandered around to my kids.... and the pain adult kids sometimes cause.  I paused, and looked to you again, and said ""You are a great listener.""  And you mustered your very best affirmative nod.  I realized after it had come out that I was being a little ironic... of course you listen well.  You're a captive audience.  And you... well, with those very wide eyes and that incredibly firm nod, you made it so very clear that you hear me.  You hear me, and you made me feel very special.  I'm honored to be your friend, though you've never been able to say so much as a word to me.  Though your face and body is almost completely frozen... you made me feel validated and heard."
Finally letting a 'close' friend go,"I've had the same best friend since I was 12. We're both 23 now. She was never a good friend, but she was all I had (she still is). 

She got married earlier this year, I threw her the most bomb bachelorette party, despite her not making me the MOH, and despite there only being 3 of us. I organized everything, I paid for everything, I drove, I decorated her place, I gave her gifts for her big day. She tried cancelling the night before. Thankfully, all went well.

I actually got ordained to sign her marriage certificate. After that, we've been the furthest we've ever been from each other, emotionally.

I've tried calling, texting, everything. Sometimes she'll answer and say ""hey yeah sorry i've been so busy"". Other times, i'll just get no reply. But I see her. I see her hanging out with other people. I see her making time for others and not me. I see her, posting on social media but ignoring my texts. I see everything.

I finally decided, it's not worth it. It's not worth it to keep getting hurt. I wanted to talk to her, and tell her my feelings and say my peace. But it's not even worth, it. SHE is not even worth the explanation.

She doesn't deserve me. She doesn't deserve me being there through her parents divorce, her grandfathers death, her boyfriend of 5 years cheating on her. She doesn't deserve me being her last minute homecoming date, even though I went to another school. She doesn't deserve me driving her dog to the vet to be put down at 4 am because nobody else cared. She doesn't fucking deserve any of it, not from me. 

She's put me through ENOUGH hell. And if I have to have ZERO friends because I don't have her, well, then i'll have zero friends. It's better than being hurt by her selfish fucking self."
My girlfriend committed suicide.,"I still can't believe it. I never thought she would do something like this. I thought she would make it. I didn't think the pills she took would be lethal. I just took it for granted that she would survive, because she had attempted before and always survived. This time was different. I wish I would have stayed at the hospital with her until the end. I was going to go back the next morning. I didn't think she would ever attempt suicide ever again, not while we were together. I have no idea what to do. I got the news about two hours ago. I still haven't processed it yet. She was the love of my life. We were together for 1 and a half years, but it feels like it went by in the blink of an eye. I feel like my whole life has been a thunderstorm and Christine was just a few seconds of sunshine. I'm alone again. She was everything to me. Now that I don't have her, I don't have anything. I don't know what I'm gonna do. I loved her so much. I just loved her so much. "

"
I ran into the girl that made my life in high school hell.,"I graduated 10 years ago. Class of '03. I've tried to put high school out of my mind. I had a horrible time. 

I was the chubby girl; pimples, weird hair, too tall, I never felt comfortable in my own skin. There was one girl in particular who made sure to point out all of my flaws and announce them to the world. This girl was what you would consider a stereotypical mean girl. She was blonde, curvy, and pretty attractive. She was a ""good Christian"" girl that, coincidentally slept her way around the school's male population. 

I don't know why she did it, but she really had it out for me. That girl was the reason why I cried myself to sleep some nights. She was the reason I made myself throw up dinner once or twice. She was the reason why I wanted to transfer schools. 

Senior year, she had it all together and I was a mediocre student headed for community college. She was on her way to a big private university. 

When we graduated, I managed to get admitted to a local state university. I pulled myself together and lost a few pounds. I grew into my awkward height. I graduated in '07 with a degree in Human Resource Management. I'm now working with a great company and going back for my Masters soon enough. 

This morning I stopped for breakfast with my fiancé, and our waitress was that girl. She had gained quite a few pounds. In fact, I didn't even recognize her until she started the conversation with, ""Hey, didn't we go to school together?"" Yeah, we did, bitch. You ruined it for me.

But I just smiled and carried on a pleasant conversation. She told me that she went to that private school but dropped out a year later. She got pregnant and had two kids. She's taking online classes to get a degree in teaching. She works two jobs. Single mother. I went through the motions and told her that that all sounded nice. 

When it was time to go, I debated on tipping her or not. Inside, I couldn't believe it had turned out the way it had. My mom always used to tell me that in high school, the people that think they're ""all that"" end up with the short end of the stick. I never believed it, but it actually happened. 

I ended up leaving her a $10 tip. I'm by no means ""OK"" with what that girl did to me, but I shouldn't punish her for it, either. That makes me no better than what she did to me. I can tell she's tired. She has a family. I secretly hope her children have a good life. I hope their mother finishes her degree and doesn't have to be a waitress anymore. 

I forgive that girl I knew in high school. Because, let's face it, high school sucks ass. We all grow up at some point. 

All the best to you, sweetie. :)

**[edit]** Wow guys! I wasn't expecting this to blow up in the way that it did! I'm so happy that so many of you have shared your own stories with me via comments and PMs. I'm not going to pretend I'm some saint, but just try to be good to one another. And if you have kids one day (or you do now), PLEASE listen to them when they tell you they're being bullied. I wish my parents would have done something when I told them. Thank you guys!!"
I've just deleted my Facebook and do you know what? I'm so fucking glad I dont have any friends.,"No one gives a shit about me, no one messages me and no one knows how I'm getting on, all of my so called friends fucked off to do their own thing? Fine, fuck them. 

Its like now I don't see peoples shite now on a daily basis, I was getting fucking sick of people being happy with friends or a SO. Bollocks to all that shite.

I might sound bitter but I honestly do not fucking care anymore. I'm done. No social media other than Reddit. I need to stop drinking alone and get out there but I've got zero motivation to do any shit like that. Maybe I'll go on anti anxiety meds, I have no idea.

I need to get out of this shitehole town and reinvent myself.

EDIT: Bloody hell, this exploded overnight. I'll try and reply to all the advice given, cheers."
"Why is it so hard for people to believe that I love my body, just because I'm not ""skinny""?","I will never be the size zero girl. But let me tell you, I do not hate myself. I am 5'3, 145 lbs and I love this body. I go to the gym 6 days a week, my thighs are strong and yes, my ass IS big. My tummy is still soft, but these arms can curl 20 lb dumbbells. In my eyes, I am the perfect amount of feminine and strong. Yet somehow, everyone else still needs to comment on how I look, and how my body looks. My best friend told me, ""you go to the gym a lot, you just don't have the body to show for it."" I would never say anything mean to her, but she's coming off a 4 year battle with an eating disorder. Not all of us have an unhealthy relationship with our bodies. Just because you have problems with yours doesn't mean you can comment on mine. My father told me I need to stick with working out because I'll ""never be fat, but you'll never be skinny either"". I wish people would just let me live, and stop commenting on my body. They think because I'm not ""skinny"" I MUST hate my body. No. I love my curves, I love my ass, my hips, my soft tummy, the way it looks when I walk, everything.  I'm done hating my body just because society tells me to. I only have one body, I am not going to spend my life wishing it was different. "
Euthanasia should be legal everywhere and anyone should be allowed to choose a safe and guaranteed death,"As it stands right now, we have a system where people are brought into existence without their permission, and then they are forced to attempt a risky suicide if they want out. The suicide will usually come as a shock to family. We need to be more open about death and the right to die. As a society, we would rather force someone to live, even if they have a terminal condition, have exhausted treatment options and want to die."
I screamed.,"It was Sunday. When I went in, I was alone. The lift went over on top of me. And I screamed. I fucking screamed louder than you have ever heard anyone scream. 

And then I knew it, I knew that I was alone. Nobody will be in any of the offices in this little business park. My legs are crushed under this piece of machinery. The initial slow stunnedness is wearing off. It's been about 15 minutes. I started prioritizing my condition. Forklift on top of me, crushed my feet, forklift ROPS on top of my upper ankles. 

Look closer, just before you fell, you twisted your ankle. When it hit, it finished inverting the foot. That is the top of one foot and the bottom of the other you are looking at. 

I fucking screamed again. It's been about 20 minutes.

There is gravel under my feet. Pry. Pry. Pry. a miniscule pile of dirt is starting to form beside my feet. Suddenly realize that I may bleed out as I relieve pressure on my feet. Stop prying. My fingernails are turned back. I hadn't felt it in my state. I have to be more careful. It's been about 30 minutes.

My feet are utterly crushed. I estimate the height of my feet inside the boots to be about 1/2"" high. But I could not get my head in a position to assess the situation better because the steering wheel has pushed my hips into the ground. But there is some give there. I wiggle it a little. Stop. Take a breath. Look around. 

Where's my Nextel? Out through the mast of the forklift, I see it. How far? About a body length. Fuck. My feet are pinned but not the shins. Maybe 35 minutes.

**This might become graphic. Please do not come in if that makes you uncomfortable. I have to write this down. I may fucking puss out and erase it.** 
"
To the pharmacy employee today....,"thank you. Last night I found out my girlfriend of a year has been cheating on me for the past four months with a guy who just tested positive for HIV. I went to get an oral HIV test, and was so nervous I couldn't find the kit. I quietly asked you where it was and you immediately and discreetly found it for me. You let me pay for it at a separate counter, away from everyone else. You told me that regardless it'd be okay. You told me that you'd gone through scares before and things had turned out fine. And, in the midst of it all, it made a difference. So thank you. I have no one I can tell this too, but I hope you read this and understand that the small efforts you put in made a huge difference for me at a time I really needed it. "
That's a fucking person,"Throwaway account, for obvious reasons (ie, political bs)

Rn I'm staying with family for a wedding. There are a lot of people I haven't met here, but since we're all going to be family in >24h, it's no big deal.

Someone turns on the TV and its Fox News which is a headache. I dont care if you're Republican, or at least I respect your right to be, but please, for the love of god, get your news from a reputable source. Anyway, I bite my tongue bc 1) I'm in the minority here, and 2) it's a family event, I'm not trying to be an asshole.

Suddenly, Chelsea Clinton, or someone who looks very much like her, is onscreen, and someone says, ""someone ought to just take her out back and shoot her in the head."" And I'm just blown away.

That's a fucking person. You just said that about a PERSON, a human being, because... what? She was born to two people you dont like? Because she has a different opinion than you on how the country should be run? What the fuck! How the fuck did we get here? Where everyone is so proud to hate, where respect and compassion go out the window over a difference in ideas... its fucking embarrassing on both sides. I'm just frustrated and exhausted that we treat each other this way.

What a fucking mess."
My boyfriend,"Today is my birthday. My boyfriend and I are (very) long distance. 

He is in Australia I am in the United States. 

For my birthday he contacted my friends to get me flowers and little gifts. While it's not a huge thing it just makes me love him even more than I did before. 

We've only been together 8 months (apart for 6) and it feels like I'm falling in love everyday all over again. He made the sweetest post for me on Facebook as well. I've never been shown off or treated like this before. 

You can ignore this post but I just needed to say that I really love him even though we're 9000+ miles apart "
My parents paid off my student loans today,"My parents stopped paying for college 3 years ago when I stopped caring/trying in school. After that I had to take out loans & start paying out of pocket to continue classes. I don’t blame them for this, it has definitely made me more responsible. I now work 2 jobs (50+ hours a week) & I just graduated with my degree this month. I’ve been saving money for a new car & started making payments on my student loans as well. I went to a community college so they weren’t extravagant loans, but it was still enough that I was nervous because I would be paying on them for awhile, while also starting out in my field/getting a new car/moving for my job.

Today at our family Christmas, my parents gave me a check to pay off my student loans & told me they were proud of the person I have become. I cannot stop crying. I never expected this in a million years but I am so grateful to them for this. So so thankful. "
My Craigslist hookup just proposed to me.,"So three years ago I was a sexually frustrated gay guy living in a city that had little to no gay dating scene. What did I decide to do? I posted an ad to the ""m4m"" casual encounters section on Craigslist hoping to get some relief. I was a bored college senior. 

A guy replied to my ad, and both of us were in the same boat: still closeted, shy, scared and afraid to really make the first move. He was a student at my university. We decided to meet up for coffee before we ""sealed the deal."" 

Our coffee date actually turned into a real date. We went out six times before we actually had sex. He became my best friend. 

He proposed to me yesterday. Three years later. I can't believe this. It's funny and weird and kind of gross (craigslist personals sections are pretty sketchy). But I would not want to be with anyone else but him. 

Thank you, Craigslist! Lol 

***edit*** literally what the hell i'm laughing so hard that this is at the TOP of this sub. like omg this is ridiculous omg "
I broke down today. Hard. And my gfs mother made me feel safe. I wish she were my mom.,"My gf was raped recently. And since the day it happened I have been with her and am spending Christmas with her family. 

It's been strange being in someone else's home but her family welcomed me with more love and kindness than I had any right to expect. 

Today my gf and her father went out to lunch together and I opted to just stay at the house. 

I told them I had a headache but in actuality I just felt like I was going to explode. 

I'm not good at dealing with my own emotions and I usually keep things bottled in until they erupt in some destructive way. Today they came out. I sat in the basement and I was literally shaking. My mouth got dry and my heart was pounding harder than I've ever felt it before. 

I was so full of rage I started to cry and I bit into my lip to try to remain quiet.

And then I felt her start to rub my back gently. She told me it was okay and to let it out. She told me I was safe in her home and that I could just purge it all and that she'd stay there with me. 

Guys I have never in my life felt someone be so genuine. Her voice was like a lullaby in a storm. 

And it all came out. I screamed and I told her everything that I felt. How badly I wanted to hurt the guy. The things I wanted to do to him. I fell to my knees and just rocked back and forth and she got down there with me and wrapped her arms around me.

She just kept saying ""I know, honey, I know. It's okay."" 

This woman who hasn't known me a month took me in her arms like I was her own son and let me cry like a big baby. 

She thanked me for being there for her daughter and she told me she'd always love me for that. She wiped my tears away and she sat there on the floor with me and talked to me for a while. She even did some breathing exercises with me.

Regardless of how long my gf and I are together, I will never forget what her mother did for me today. She's an amazing lady and I'll be thankful for her forever. "
"In most days, I am constantly torn between ""treat other how you want to be treated"" and ""treat others how they treat you""","I always followed this sort of ""rule"" where I wish to treat everyone with dignity and respect and hopefully they will eventually treat me the same (most people do in actuality) but there are those out there who I often feel that they do not care about how I wish to treat them and still do the opposite and I sometimes want to give them a taste of their own medicine to see how it really feel like to be in a short end of the stick everytime.

I know that sometimes the ends do not always justify the means but the temptation is often very high 

I often restrain myself because it either gets me into a lot of trouble and I learned throughout my life that sometimes it either not worth it or not worth retaliating or reacting towards someone else's behaviour out of anger or spite because it will surely make you either biased or not able to think clearly

(being angry is human but how you deal with it makes a difference)"
Why is it SO FUCKING HARD to understand SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE.,"I am a Christian, I believe the Bible. I believe everyone deserves the right to practice their religion in peace as long as they do not infringe on others in any way by doing so. 


That being said, I am SICK and tired of EVERY SINGLE FUCKING ""CHRISTIAN"" I KNOW not understanding the separation of church and state. Why is it so hard to grasp? All of these conservatives are all about defending the constitution - until it comes to this. Then it's an attack on Christians. But wait. No, no it's fucking not. Can you still go to Church every week without being persecuted? YES, YES YOU CAN. YOU ARE NOT BEING ATTACKED. You still have the freedom to attend church and to talk freely about your God without putting your life in danger, so SHUT THE FUCK UP.


Also, prayer does not belong in public schools. NOPE, it is not an attack on your religion, just the way things should be for everyone. It's only fair. If someone wanted to start practicing literally ANY other religion in public schools everyone would shit themselves, but nope, it's Jesus, so it's okay. You want your kid to go to a school that talks about Jesus? SEND THEM TO PRIVATE SCHOOL. 


I live in the South and i am surrounded by these idiots. Even my own family, and a couple of my friends. It's disheartening to see such ignorance.

"To everyone on this planet, please don't treat me differently","I'm Muslim. I'm not really a practicing Muslim actually. I'm more like in between agnostic and Muslim. What happened today is going to have a huge effect as it is the worst mass casualty shooting in America. 50 dead...53 injured..How do we see the light in so much darkness? 

And to add, Donald Trump is going to have vastly higher chance at winning the election because EVERYONE is gonna go be crazy about this fucking situation. 

Fuck. I'm not a terrorist. We aren't all terrorists. Please don't treat me differently."
A PSA for everyone going out to eat this weekend.,"Today begins the bombardment of restaurants all across the world for the Valentines Day weekend. As a former server, I have one request for you all: treat your waitstaff kindly. Many of them have their own valentines that they won't be able to see, because restaurants pull ALL available employees to work. The day starts incredibly early and ends incredibly late. They've put their lives on hold to let you celebrate with a loved one. Please thank them for helping to make your weekend wonderful!!"
I watched my fiancé die.,"He was only 22 years old. He had severe asthma and went through 3 inhalers in a week. After we had sex, he couldn't breathe. The memory of him sweating and crying, looking at me and saying ""I'm scared"" won't get out of my mind. I pinky promised him that I wouldn't let anything bad happen to him. He told me he needed to go to the hospital because his inhaler ran out. I didn't even get a mile down the road and he passed out, I called 911 and pulled over. They told me to try CPR. I pulled him out of my car and he turned white and his lips purple. The cop wrongly accused us of being heroin addicts and I was put in a cop car and interrogated for 4 hours while they searched my car & apartment for 7 hours. He's my best friend and my soul mate and now he's gone. I have PTSD from it and although I seem ""fine"", I'm destroyed. I don't want to live anymore. It's been almost 2 months and I keep getting worse without him. I'm scared."
Sitting in an airport on the other side of the world waiting to meet the person I’m in love with for the first time in 22 years.,"Ok, so I’m well aware of how weird this story is. But I’m sitting in an airport in a country across the globe from the one I come from, waiting for a flight that leaves in about an hour. When I get off the plane my best friend of 22 years and sort of love interest of about a year will be on the other side. We’ve never met in person before. I know, I know.

The simple version is this: we’re both in our mid 30’s. We ‘met’ online 22 years ago, back when the internets was just a baby. As were we, really. We kept in touch from the initial chat rooms to ICQ/IRS to My Space and Livejournal and FB. We both have histories of trauma and addiction but because we’ve known one another so long we’ve gotten each other through. We know things about one another no one knows. We’ve been friends all this time but in the last year or so started video chatting every day and it became something else. I know how weird it is to say you love someone you’ve never met, but it is what it is. Sometimes on video chat if I fall asleep he reads for a while or does is own thing because he knows I have nightmares, and if I wake up he reads to me so I can go back to sleep. When he fell off the wagon I talked him off a ledge and into rehab. We talk for at least an hour a day, sometimes several hours if we’re both off work.

So I had occasion after all this time to visit his country for work. Which is done, and here I am, at the airport, waiting to go to his city and... see what happens. Not gonna lie, I think I may throw up in my own mouth. 

Update: so I got to baggage claim where we arranged to meet (my flight came in early) and he was on a bench not looking in my direction. I slid onto the bench next to him and said ‘whatchya reading?’ and he smiled and said ‘something a friend sent to me’ and it was a book I send him years ago. We grinned and now I’m sitting on his bed smoking a cigarette and he’s taking me out to dinner tonight. No awkwardness at all. Four more days, then back to the real world. I think it’s going to be a good four days, guys. 

Update 2: Thanks for being so supportive folks - it really helped when i was scared out of my mind! A few people have asked for an update - I leave in 4 days and if you’d like one let me know and I’ll ping you in an updated comment when I leave on Wednesday 

Final Update: As requested by some of you in my last post, I promised to update once my trip was over. 
Guys, it was... amazing. We just slipped right into being comfortable with each other, went to dinner (he took me to his work to ‘show you off’), went walking across the bridge at night to show me the lights, introduced me to some of his friends who were lovely, dinner with his parents - also lovely. Went to the local bar and put a bunch of Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, Cannibal Corpse and Joy Division on the jukebox in amongst all the R&B that constantly played, and giggled like small children when people got mad and a little confused. In between those things we just stayed in bed, binge watching Black Mirror or sleeping or reading to each other. 
My flight left at 7am on the last day so we had to be at the airport at 5, so the last night we just stayed up. He didn’t want to talk about my leaving. I heard him say at one point to himself when I was packing ‘I’m not ready for this’. I slept through the night for the first time in years. When I did wake up with night terrors on other nights he told me it would be ok, and I went back to sleep. 
He took me to the airport and was shaking when he walked me in - I could feel it in his hands. We stood for too long than was polite in the airport forehead to forehead, sometimes kissing, sometimes just breathing in each other’s breath. Then I left.

And now, over 24 hours and 5 flights later, my plane is about to land back home and I’m silently but ugly crying on the plane while I type this. I don’t know what to feel about the whole thing. I don’t know if or when we’ll see each other in person again. I asked him if he wished we’d never done it given how much it fucking hurts now and he said absolutely not - that he wouldn’t give up those days for anything. 
 I dunno, guys. I didn’t want to leave. I want to go back. But I can’t, and I guess that’s just the hard side of adulting and responsibilities and life. I know this is a little sad in tone but I’m, well, sad in tone and it’s been a couple of days since I’ve slept. We’ll video chat tonight as we do every night, and see what happens next, I guess. Thanks for all the lovely words - it was a beautiful time "
I'm Fucking Livid,"My buddy just got an email from the Army Corps of Engineers that his start date for his new job is put ""on hold"" because of Trumpfuck's hiring freeze.

This was his dream job. He got an offer, accepted it, gave notice to his current employer and was anxiously awaiting his start date of Feb 6th to finally get going on his career. 

Today he gets this crushing email saying it is out of their hands and all of a sudden all the shit that Trump has been doing and that I've been laughing at hits me right in the face.

I'm shell shocked. I can't imagine what he is feeling right now. And I can't imagine what many across the states are feeling as Trumpfuck slowly chops away at anything good. 

Fuck this guy. Fuck him in the ass with a hot, rusty, rod of cast iron.

Edit: he just got a phone call that he is ok to still go in to work because he had his start date before the 22nd. So,  he's lucky.  

But of course there are plenty still affected by the freeze and many more who will be negatively affected by other shit the McDonald is doing and will do,  so my rage is not settled. "
"To My Son, Who Reddits","I know life pretty much sucks right now, and I know you're pissed at me.

But let me tell you something:

I love you. Being your mom has brought me such an amazing amount of joy (and occasional angst), and it's an honor to watch you grow up. It's really painful to let you fall down, make mistakes, be hurt by those about whom you care, and it's painful just to watch you hurt.

It's balanced by the glee of laughing together (the old lady YouTube was tops!), random dancing, you Vining me when I have no makeup on, awful jokes, your amazing mind, your sense of humor, your freckles, and your cute toes. (I don't care how old you are, you will always have cute little toes. So there.)

Sometimes I want to make it all better when I know I should just step back and let you make decisions, even if those decisions will suck. My goal is to make sure you grow, learn from your mistakes and live with compassion and joy. I overstep my bounds, nitpick and bug you, I know. And then...you ask me to make you scrambled eggs or come give me a hug, or amaze me with your maturity, and I know you're on the right track.

You rock, and I just wanted to tell you that. I also like the girl who came over for Thanksgiving, and am so proud of you for seeing who she really is. You two are a great pair. In time, things will work out with her, I think."
Went on a Tinder date,"He kept bringing up his ex. So I started talking about my ex. So we just talked about exes for about two hours over Chinese food.

My life is so dumb sometimes."
She fell asleep on my shoulder,"For the first time in almost a year, she fell asleep on my shoulder. It wasn't because she was exhausted because she normally would wait to talk her mom before falling asleep. It wasn't because she was forced to, because she wasn't. She fell asleep on my shoulder because she trusts me now. She looked my in the eyes and said ""Love you, Tom"". She's never done that before, in that way. That gapping hole that was torn into her when her baby's dad was killed is starting to finally heal. And I am glad that I can help her heal. I'll never replace that person in her heart, but I can certainly make sure she doesn't feel alone again. Her or her daughter. :)"
"""I Couldn't Feel It.""","I'll try my best to not write a novel here, but I got a lot. 

My first and last relationship ended because I was not sexually fulfilling. Which, I can understand. People have needs. It's good to be honest about these things, I know. It's a major part of a relationship. I can understand that.

The first time she and I had sex, it was a wreck. I remembered her telling me how happy she was that I was virgin, and then not ten minutes later looking down on me with a look of confusion and concern, reaching down. ""Already?""

Yeah. She looks down then, for the first time, and then I see something click. Something in her posture maybe. She kept me company for the night, which I was grateful for, and then I did something dumb and said it was great for me. She just stayed silent. I asked how it was for her, and, ""I couldn't feel it,"" comes mumbling out.

To her credit, she stayed with me for three months after that. We had a system of sorts, I'd go down on her until she came, and then  I got my part, but in retrospect, I should have known that wasn't enough. To be slobbered on and then a quickshot pump. No sex can survive description very easily. She had a certain adventurous streak, she wanted me to perform on her in bathrooms, parks, places like that. Sometimes, if I was confident I wouldn't get caught I would, but that hurt her. I think that's what broke the camel's back as it were, that I worried more for image than her needs. 

So, a week ago, over breakfast, we finish pancakes, she looks up, carefully sets fork and knife to the side, and tells me we need to talk. It was hard to hear her, over the noise of blood rushing in my ears. We talk, about bullshit. She feels I'm too critical of her writing, that I'm not emotionally available enough, and that I'm not fulfilling her needs. She hesitates before she says needs, but in that small span, she and I both knew what she was saying. I just couldn't please her like a boyfriend should. I wasn't properly equipped. I nodded, said I thought as much. She breathes out in relief, and only then do I realize how stiff and tensed she was, when she relaxes at my agreement. I was a weight off of her back. She was very proud of how maturely I was taking it. She always liked my maturity. My ability not to get so worked up over things like this. We smile at how amicable we all are, she assures me she thinks the best of me, she goes gets her things, we share a last (too short) kiss, and she goes to the front door which I open for her she walks down the stairs and I shut the door and watch her get in her car and go down the road and I turn and kick a hole in the wall.

I'm really angry. I shouldn't be, but I'm really angry. I'm so god damn angry. She did the reasonable thing, I know, logically. I just love her. She had a burn scar on her right arm she got in chemistry back in her high school. I loved feeling that, pulling up her sleeve on her sweater, running my finger down it. She hated the sight of it, but I loved it. All the little pockmarks of a life well lived. The scar on her lip, the gap in her teeth. I loved the sight of it framed by her smile. I miss it. I miss her boredom, the moments when she would just roll her eyes at the bar or the table, or the inane conversations, look at me with half lidded eyes, and arc an eyebrow. I miss her story, the one she wrote partway, that she swore up and down she would finish, the one that was finally not fucking fanfiction that I'd been begging her to write. I miss the way she'd lean into me, resting a cheek bone on my right clavicle, always my right. I miss her grudge against Livy, and all the things she'd blame on him. I miss being able to hold her. I love her. I still love her, and I miss her, and I wish I could have done better but I don't know what the fuck I could have done better with this tiny cock. 

She has someone new now. Someone that looks nice. Some stats major. I'm doing my best to avoid her, him, them. Because he seems nice. He probably is nice. Probably loves her scars too. But I hate him. I hate him so much. I hate him and I hate her and I know I shouldn't because it's just life, and she wanted to feel someone that could fill her up, and I never, ever, will be able to do that but I just wish to god that I could go back somehow and find a way I could have kept her with me. 

Just another story. Same old same old. Sorry for all of this. I should fix the hole in my wall. "
"I'm 25, going on 26, but...","Better late than never.

Last night, it happened. I finally soberly kissed a girl, although it only lasted about 5 seconds and it was a goodnight kiss, it's taken almost 26 years for this to happen. 

She and I actually both like each other, and we both know it. That's never happened either.

I've never had a girlfriend before, but that's about to change.

The smile on my face hasn't come off yet.

:D"
"To my wife, thank you","Thank you. 

Thank you for everything. Everything I have, everything I am, i owe to you. You were my light, and I cherish every moment we had together. 

I remember when we met. It was during freshman year, and I was messing around with my friends on the field. We were stupid, my friends and I, punting the ball as high as possible. It eventually was punted high into the sky, and as I ran, I managed to drag my knee into your best friend's nose. Through taking her to the sick bay, we talked, and I was smitten. 

Cue the new week. I had done some intensive math training during spring break, and had been moved up in classes. The teacher, a crazy balding eagle, was obsessed with alphabetical order, so we ended up next to each other. I was so nervous, as you were amazing. But just like that, you gave me that stunning smile of yours, and I gave you my heart. 

High school flashed by so fast. We were inseparable. Everything was great, from studying/debating in our special grassy corner of the school, to me taking my best female friend to prom and you taking your disabled friend,  and us being perfectly great with it. I remember our history trip to China, and the picture of you standing on top of the Lijiang mountains still draws such raw emotion from my heart 15 years later. 

I remember us fighting about going to different colleges. I remember us being furious with each other before making up and crying that we loved each other. We broke up to 'experience life', but my life was already complete, I just didn't know it.

I'm home. That's what I remembered. The image of you walking towards me in Portland International; long flowing hair, shriveled leather jacket, worn eyes from jet lag,  struck a cord within me. We were inseparable once more, and we married in Summer. The wedding, on the beach, was unforgettable. The way you glowed, the way you laughed as we wrestled in our wedding gear in the sand, and how we all spent the ceremony in the water. 

You were barren. That's what I remember. I held you as you shook in my arms in the office. Should we have had a child? Maybe. Maybe not. 

What I do know is that you didn't deserve what you got. You didn't deserve it at all. Diabetes Type 1. The killer. You collapsed during work and hit your neck on a table side. Your spine cracked and you lost about 90% of your basic motor functions. You passed away 4 days later.

You once told me something. It was corny as hell during our first few months as teens, but it's what stood out for me as the most significant. We climbed the local stadium's roof, and watched the sun rise. We lay under the rise of the glorius sun, and you turned to me and spoke. 
' I pray to God everyday that Death takes me first so I don't have to endure a day without you'. 

What about me? What do I do now? We had no children, no legacy? You were my soulmate. I every night wake up shaking, feeling for where you should be. You're not there. When we were apart, I knew that as long as you were happy, so was I. But now you're gone, and now, 
I feel alone. 

Thank you Sarah, for everything.

UPDATE: I just wanted to say thank you to all you people. I just came here to vent and say goodbye, and the support I got was overwhelming. It makes me hopeful to encounter people such decent, supportive people. Although I've lost someone dear to me, I know the answer; her legacy lives on with me. Your support has meant so much to me. Thank you all "
To the man that killed my husband:,"Dear You, 

The police officer told me that your court date is set for three weeks from today. You are going to prison at the age of 22-years-old. I was told that You had straight-A’s and were on track to go to medical school. You are handsome and put-together. When You cried to me after I came to see you at the police station, I knew that you were a good boy; your parents were there with you, just as horrified and grief-stricken as you were. 

But I don’t know if I can ever forgive You. You chose to drive drunk. Your fraternity brothers tried to stop you, but you just left anyway – shame on You. You hit my husband head-on. He didn’t even stand a chance. I always told him to never drive late at night, but he always had to run to the store to get something. He was a very nice man. I think you would have liked him a lot. He loved football, mainly college football, and we were at every home game. There’s no telling how many times I ran into you while we climbed up the stands to our seats. I probably touched shoulders with you and didn’t even know. 

You killed my husband. You know You did. And I am so sorry that your life is going to be what it will be; you will be in prison for a very long time. You will live with guilt, rage, regret. I know this; not by experience, but by inferring from what I was told about you. According to your frat brothers, you never were the one to get drunk; you were always the designated driver. And the one night you decide to have fun, no one had your back the way you had theirs. But that gave you no right to do what you did, but oh well. That has happened now. 

I do not believe in God; I do not believe that this is all part of His divine plan, but I do believe in time. I believe that time, unlike God, can heal almost anything. A while from now, I will forgive you. I will visit you and give you a hug and tell you that I forgive you. You will grow older and you will see the world from its most evil perspective. I am sorry for you, but right now I am glad you are being punished – but I do understand that your life is essentially over. 

In my eyes, not one person died that night – two people did. For You, I will say a prayer to the clocks on my walls and the calendars on my desk that soon you will heal as I hope I do too. 

To You: I do not forgive you now, but in time I will. Just give me some time. 

Sincerely,

Me"
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH,"ARGHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

AAAAAGAGGHHHHHHHHHHHHH"
To the cyclist who I saw 30 min ago....,"Fuck you you total piece of shit. You ran a red light and knocked over the elderly gentleman crossing the road. You didn't even slow down, that man (who you would know is lovely if you'd had the decency to stop and help) was moving fairly slowly as he has a bad hip. I helped him up and chatted with him for a while, I would have called an ambulance but he insisted he was fine...you're probably lucky he was so insistent or I would have called the police. Fuck you asshole, you could have seriously injured an entirely innocent stranger who waited for the lights to change and then tried to cross the road, all because you think the rules don't apply to you. I hope you crash (into a wall, not another innocent person). Fuck you, you selfish prick, no wonder people hate cyclists when some of you behave so terribly."
I got stood up on a date and had one of the best nights of my life.,"So picture me, 21 years old, waiting at a bar for a girl to show up. After about an hour of no response or texts from her I decided to leave. Now there's a line of bars that all exist within one block of each other so after leaving the first one I decided to head over to another that was known for its dance floor. I figured I get drunk, well more drunk than I already was, dance my ass off and then head home. I live in a college town so the center of downtown in my city is crawling with kids my age who are having the time of their lives from September to June. 

I'm not usually one of those kids, I don't go to college anymore and I'm just working to keep a roof over my head and food on the table. It's weird that two people of the same age, in the same city, with many of the same desires I'm sure, can live such different lives. But I digress, like I said, from September to June it's a college town so there are some bars that get hit up more by the students than others. One of them is a ""nightclub"" in the loosest sense of the word, that's below another bar. It's called ""The Rat"" (Inviting nickname right?) 

There was a line to get inside and I don't know why but I figured, ""life begins at the end of your comfort zone, right?"" So I decided to wait in line to get inside. And it's going okay, I'm sipping on some water soothe my stomach a little to make sure I didn't throw up. At this point I'm feeling just a little bit tipsy when a girl try's to but in front of me in a subtle way. She notices me looking at her and apologizes and says I can get in front of her. I tell her I don't care and that it doesn't really matter to me. She's cute, I ask if she's here with anybody, she says she's with friends and she has a boyfriend, but he's in the Air Force. It's a little sudden but we got it out of the way and I respect her forthrightness. I figure ""Well that's the last I'll see of her"" And go inside.

I pay the cover, walk downstairs, and....I kinda hate it. The place is overly crowded and I'm paranoid of a fire breaking out. The  music is loud and shitty, with the same EDM build and beat drop playing over and over again. The dancefloor stinks of BO, Budweiser, and desperation. I realize that most of the people in this club probably are members frats or sororities, and if not that than groups of other students meeting up for a fun night. This isn't made for somebody to go solo. I'm thinking about calling it a night. But for some reason I stick around for a little while. 

Then I see the same girl from the line on the wall opposite from me. She smiles and waves, she's with a friend. I figure why not at least try and talk to somebody for a little bit. We'll make some polite conversation and then she'll go on her merry way. But, that's not what happens. We start joking around more, I learn her and her friends names, Rachel and Sam respectively. I don't know who suggested first but me and Rachel and Sam end up going over to the bar. I was already planning on buying a girl drinks tonight so why not give these two it instead since my date bailed. Rachel offers five dollars, I take it. I keep waiting for the moment when these girls decide to ditch me or something or get bored. But it doesn't happen. We keep drinking and talking, I start flirting with them, there's lots of touching involved. Then Rachel says we should go over and play beer pong. We do, or at least we try, nobody's willing to give up a table so all three of us decide to go over to another bar and play pool. 

At this point I think I must be dreaming, I've gotten both of these girls numbers, they're both flirting with me, *and* they want to keep hanging out with me? It's nuts. All the times I've walked past groups of pretty girls during my midnight walks through the city I always hoped in some distant part of my mind that something like this would happen. But I'd also like to walk on the moon and I knew that was never gonna happen. Anyways, we play pool and drink some more, i'm buying this time but not because I'm trying to get into their pants or because they're manipulating me, but because they're making a night that was shitty into something amazing. We're playing pool and two other guys try and come in and hit on them and me without even trying, for some reason, manages to hold their attention and interest the whole night. It makes no sense.

Rachel brings up the fact that she doesn't have a debit card to take out money from an ATM to pay me back. She asked if I smoke weed, I say yeah, she says she'll pay me back with that and I can crash on her couch, so we end up walking back to her place, Sam goes home. 
I hang out with her and her apartment mates who all happen to be guys. 

We smoke and then she says that she could pay for an Uber for me and I say it's fine. I call a friend for a ride, and eventually leave. Though I feel like it's kind of in an awkward way, she doesn't really say goodbye and I feel like I gave off the wrong vibe. I knew she had a boyfriend and I wasn't planning on doing anything. But it just felt sooo nice to be wanted by people that I wanted as well. It's not a feeling I'm used to experiencing. I texted both of them this morning and, based on the fact they never mentioned us hanging again when I brought it up and said I'd be open to it, I have a feeling that they both kind of feel like that was better to be just a one night drunken hangout than something that develops into something more real. That's a little disappointing but I can't fault them for that. They gave me one of the greatest nights of my life. It was a taste of what I always imagined college would be like. And I know it will never happen again. Sorry for the wall of text and thanks to anybody who read this.

Shut up. Disney is not poisoning my child.,"This one's to my older sister.

Look, sis. I'm a single dad. I've got four kids to take care of and a full-time job. So I really am grateful for the little bits of happiness that my kids can find on their own. 

So it really sucks that since my youngest (my only daughter) was old enough to talk, you've been on your whole ""She'll-grow-up-expecting-to-be-treated-and-spoiled-like-a-princess"" jig just because you've read a few articles that somehow prove your point. Yes, I buy her princess movies. Yes, she watches them constantly. Yes, we have several Ariel and Belle shirts (at least she hasn't bought into the Elsa craze.) Yes, sometimes she plays out the movies and ropes her brothers into playing Flynn Rider or Gaston or Dr. Facilier or whatever male role she needs at the time. She'll also go right into a game of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles with them, no questions asked. She'll chase her brothers around the yard with a lightsaber. And she'll be wearing her Ariel costume the entire time.

So no, she is not buying into gender stereotypes. Sis, she's fucking five years old. She doesn't know the difference between boys and girls, much less that her beloved movies are condemning her to a life of being waited on or some shit like that. She gets herself dressed and teeth brushed every morning. She helps with some of the dishes. She picks up her toys without complaining. Does that sound like ""princess syndrome"" to you?

No. It sounds like a normal fucking five year old.

Look You can whine all you want about princesses to me, but don't come down on my daughter.

After last weekend, I'm really hesitant to have you over again.

Let's look at the things you did.

1.) Complained about her singing like Snow White when she took the dishes to the sink. 

2.) Immediately after the above, brigade her. ""Sweetie, why are you singing that song? Oh, it's from that movie? Do you want to grow up doing all the cleaning? Do you want people telling you to do all the cleaning?""

3.) Berated my son for playing The Little Mermaid with her. Not many seven year old brothers will do that willingly with their sisters, much less be the one to suggest it, like my son did. And the berating came again. ""Why are you Eric? Do you want to always save your sister? Don't you want her to save herself? Why don't you guys play something else?"" Sis, let my kids have fun.

4.) Turned off the TV when my daughter was watching Tangled and, later, suggested that I take that ""spoiled-teen-attitude trash"" out of my house.

5.) Shot me down when I told you that I was surprising my kids with Disney for a long weekend over the summer. God, that was a mistake. ""You should take them somewhere that isn't plastic-molded. All that ""magic"" is man-made to cater to your children. Take them somewhere constructive. When my baby gets older, I'll actually be taking her somewhere real. Your kids are going to expect this all the time. You're spoiling them."" 

Sis. It's taken me two years to save up for this vacation. My oldest is ten. I want to take my kids to Disney while they're young. I want to see them having fun.

I know we weren't really Disney kids. But every day, hundreds of people take their kids to Disney. I can assure you most of those kids will turn out fine. Every day hundreds of little girls watch princess movies. Most of them turn out fine, too, and if they don't...well, no young woman has ever ended up in a therapist's office saying, ""It all started when Ariel sold her soul for a man she never met.""

So shut up and let my girl enjoy her goddam movies."
"I got ""ogled"" for the first time in my life. It was awesome.","So, apologizes I just got back from a bar and have had a few smokes from a bong. Do Off your Chests have to be serious? I dunno, I don't really wanna read the FAQ and if this gets deleted, eh. But I just had a really cool thing happen tonight. For the first time in my life (I'm a 21 year old male) I got eyed by a girl all night. Like from the second I sat down in this group she was looking at me and asking me all these questions. I've never had a girl be this outwardly interested in me. To be frank, I feel kinda awesome. I've never had this happen before and feel really good about myself/handsome. So yeah, I got ogled and it was great."
"Yes, I'm Gay. No, I don't want to be your ""GBF""","Dear women of western civilization, 

Stop. No, I don't want to spend all day shopping with you and helping you pick out outfits. No, I don't want to braid you hair. No, I don't want to be your best friend just because I'm gay. Telling me about ""how you've always wanted a Gay Best Friend"" is not cute, and not a compliment. Furthermore, stop telling people I'm your ""gay best friend"". Why can't you just say friend. Why do you have to treat me like your accessory. We're humans, not pets. The worst thing is, You think you're so supportive and open, but really you're just as bad as the other homophobes.  




**Edit:** yes, yes, not as bad as other homophobes. I get it. I worded it wrong.

My girlfriend loves me,"I grew up thinking I was unattractive. I tried early on at a young age to make up for it by accumulating success and practical skills. I am, by far, more successful than my friends but for some reason that has never played a part in me getting into a relationship. I've grown so used to be lonely that I was ok with it for a long time. Until Fran showed up...

Fran showed up in my life ironically, as a form of punishment. I had forgotten to turn in an assignment and had to make up for it by tutoring other students at my university. Fran was one of those students. She was all by means, gorgeous. She had very soft features that were contrasted by her strong personality and sharp mind. She requested me by name every time she appeared for tutoring. These hints of courting went right over my head as I was too focused on my career to be worried about a pretty girl that I possibly couldn't get with. I was so flustered when she asked me out directly that I starting mumbling, stuttering, and turning beet red. She set a time and date without my input and the rest is history. We've been going out for a year now.

Fran loves me. She **loves** loves me. I can't even fathom how someone can love me so much.
It reminds me of a scene from Knocked Up when Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd go to Vegas and are talking about relationships while high on shrooms. Paul tells Seth that he doesn't understand how his wife can love him that much. He doesn't even like himself that much. Suddenly, I'm becoming more and more... happy? My work has improved and my grades have shot up. People want to be friends with me and coworkers want me to attend parties but I'd rather much have a drunken night in with Fran watching Futurama. I wake up every morning and see her sleeping and have to reach out to touch her to make sure that I'm not dreaming.

I'm so fucking thankful she came into my life. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the compliments. I realize how fortunate I am to be with Fran and I hope everyone finds that one person who'll love them the way I love Fran "
To the prick who laughed at me today,"Fuck you. 

Yeah I know i'm fat and overweight, and I look stupid riding my road bicycle, but god damn, I'm trying my best. I've been on a hard diet for nearly a month now, and have been riding at least 4-5 miles every day since (further at weekends). I know that you, being a middle aged skinhead in a 90's Volvo saloon have a lot going for you, but you can keep this kind of shit to yourself. I'm sick of being nervous and stressed whenever I want to leave the house because of people like you and the concern that i'll be mocked. Maybe worry more about your own life and stop being so bothered about everyone else's.

In the past I would have let this get to me, and probably would have given up. But not this time. I'm changing for the better and I'm not going to take shit from people like you any longer. I'm going to get fitter and healthier and I don't give a fuck what you think.

edit: Wow thanks guys. Can't reply to every comment, but thanks so much for all the support. I won't let these guys get to me, I will get there eventually!

edit2: gold? Wow, cheers haha! I really am glad to have this sub to vent to for things like this, and you guys have given me so much support. Thank you!"
Life just curb stomped me and took a massive shit on my face.,"I'm awkward, physically unattractive, and boring. In short, a loser. Therefore when my friend introduced me to his attractive mutual friend during class, I didn't even try to impress her because I knew my chances were subzero. So any attempts at wit and charm were tossed aside and I just treated her as if she were some guy who knew my friend. Then, one day my friend didn't attend lecture, but she did, only I didn't see her, so I just took a seat with strangers. But then, she walked up to me from her seat in the back and wanted me to sit with her there. I just thought, sure, and we sat in the back. We talked normally about mundane things, and once lecture ended, I intended to just part ways and go home. 

However, surprisingly, unbelievably, miraculously, she asked that I not go home and that we should walk around campus to hang out. Over the course of the last 4 months, we developed feelings for each other. We were each other's missing jigsaw piece. Every passion and interest we had meshed together in beautiful lockstep. I couldn't believe it, a girl this beautiful was not only perfect for me, but I was actually perfect for her too? 

I would never have known about this hidden harmony had she not made the advance towards me, so I questioned her one day why she made a move towards me. The gist of it was that she was attracted to what she described as my ""down-to-earth vibe"" and how I seemed ""genuine"". Whatever she meant, I could only think, holy shit, I did something right. Literally, two nights ago, I lay in my bed just thinking, wow, my life is getting together? Apparently so, which was not okay with the universe at all. Nope.

She died yesterday. Drunk driver. Great move, universe. Not only am I back to square zero, but I also get the joy of losing my mind because of this. Thanks life, and fuck you very much. Oh and the driver survived. He was fine."
"Its a Dad thing, but..","Daughter, you are the best thing that has ever happened to me. You are the most beautiful girl I have ever laid eyes on and the smartest kid I know. It's hard to tell you because you're two, but I am so proud of you, baby girl.

Love, 
   Daddy"
You didn't answer the door. The blonde did.,"I rang the doorbell and a tall, Victoria's Secret angel like blonde  answered the door. I thought I'd surprise you with coffee, some  donuts and ask if you wanted to hang out today. I heard your voice in the background asking who was at the door.... and then our eyes met.

I held back the tears. I just stood there like an idiot, with breakfast for two when you were busy cooking breakfast, for the two of you. I know who this girl is. She's the one you told me about, from a couple of years ago; the one you were madly in love with but who moved across the country. I guess she's in town. And she was in your bed last night. 

I couldn't breathe. I couldn't speak. I muttered sorry and ran as fast as I could, spilling coffee everywhere. The reaction of a 7 year old who just saw a ghost. My eyes exploded with tears and my heart is now shattered in 20 billion pieces. We'd been hanging out all summer but hadn't had the ""talk"" yet. But there had been bike rides. We went to Coney Island and overdosed on hot dogs. Dog parks and ice cream. So much Amorino's. You asked me if I wanted to be your date to your brother's wedding in August on Long Island.

It's not like you cheated on me. You weren't my boyfriend. Not yet at least. I guess I'm the idiot. I believed you were. I showed up unannounced. I don't know what to do with all this pain inside of me.  



EDIT: Oh my goodness, thank you all so much for the support and kind words. I took an Advil and passed out like a narcoleptic trying to forget this entire morning ever happened. Thanks so much, I'm heartbroken but a little less sad knowing so many people can relate to this and are wishing me well. "
For the classmates parent who took pictures of me as a child,"You were the over zealous pinstrest mom of the early 90's. You chronicaled our kindergarten class at important events on the days parents were invited.  At the end of the year you made laminated placemats of each child with a cute poem about growing up and things we did that year.

These are the only pictures I have of me as a child. And I'm so greatful. THANK YOU. 

You see,  I was sexually abused. When my parents divorced my father (the abuser) took all the pictures of me as a child. Except he forgot the placemat. 

It is me being a child and I cannot find words about how important or is to me to have those pictures documenting the normal days of childhood for that year. 

Edit: spelling.


EDIT: Wow, i didn't expect this many upvotes. Say Thank you to all those who do community work big and small for me. :) "
Today I cried because someone added me on FB,"Yesterday I went to a bike seminar where they taught us how to change a flat tire. I'm a 31 year old female with no friends in the town I grew up in that has 150,000. I went out of my personal comfort zone and tried talking to a complete stranger. Today I had a facebook notification that she added me as a friend, completely out of the blue. We hadn't even exchanged names but she found me through the events RSVP list. I honestly cried. I don't make friends so to see that someone actually thought I was worth it to add me on FB was a big boost. It also made me realize how terribly sad it all was that I was moved that much by a single FB friend. It reminded me of the South Park episode. I hope that maybe I can make more friends someday. 

PS. Sorry for the terrible formatting and grammar, I'm on mobile and I tend to create short sentences as I type them out. 


TLDR; Made a friend, cried.


Edit: Thank you all so much. I am really moved by all the comments and advice. I posted this thinking that not many people would see it and I am blown away by all the support and love and good feelings. You all are awesome!"
My thoughts on my wife.,"This time last year I did not know that she existed. I went to a new land on the other side of the world seeking adventure and challenge. Little did I know that I was in for so much more. 

When I first saw her in that church, I was completely smitten I knew instantly that she was an incredibly special person. I felt I had to know this person. Initially I said no to myself, because I didnt come to find love. But fate had it differently, we started talking and I gave in and asked her out. 

She changed my life. I fell completely in love with this woman, Her beauty, smile, support, kindness, strength and wisdom all left a profound effect on me, she made me feel welcome when I felt like an outsider due to my skin color and upbringing. A few months later we started talking of marriage, we knew we wanted to be together and couldn't bear to be seperatef by borders and oceans. We married early, and she made a huge step by coming halfway around the world just to be with me.

She is the most beautiful creature God ever created she is so, so beautiful. I love waking up and kissing her on the cheek. I love tucking her into bed and helping her keep warm at night. I love supporting her and being her rock. I love putting her before me, because she is the love of my life and my most precious treasure this side of heaven.

 We've been married for a week and a half and I know that we will never regret this. I cannot wait to continue this wonderful adventure with her."
I thought I'd be dead by Christmas,"I'm sorry if this is poorly written or incomprehensible, I've just been crying a lot and having a hard time organizing my thoughts. If you know who I am from this, please please don't share this with anyone, it's very private. I have a few friends and acquaintances on reddit, so I made a throwaway for a reason. 

I have a seriously neurological disability that's equal parts embarrassing and debilitating. Over three years I slowly lost the ability to work, drive, clean my house, do my laundry, and more recently, bathe myself. I've lived on my own for 6 years and it was looking like I'd have to move back in with my parents just so I wouldn't die falling in the shower. I was living the life of an 80 y/o woman in my mid 20's.

I was getting ready to undergo a radical treatment that had about a 50/50 success rate. It was a last ditch effort, nothing else had worked. If it didn't work, I'd be stuck like this forever. The specific form of my disease was very rare and hard to treat, so there was very little research being done on it. This treatment was the first breakthrough in 50 years, and it was actually only approved for a different, more common ailment.

My surgery was exactly one month ago today. The doctors were very upfront about the risks, and the potential of no change in my condition. This is where it might get hard to read, sorry, I didn't tell anyone this and I'm crying a lot now just being able to say it. I told myself I was going to end my life if the treatment didn't work. I had dreams and aspirations that I could never accomplish with my disease. I couldn't bear the thought of living 20, 30, 40 more years stuck between 4 walls, having to be chaperoned everywhere like an unruly teenager.  I told myself that if my condition didn't improve by Christmas, I'd kill myself. I drafted a POA and a Will for the few small things I had and my pets. This wasn't the suicidal ideation I had dealt with in my late teens, this was practical and methodical. As much as I knew I had to do it, I was ashamed.

But I don't have to be ashamed anymore because I'm not going to kill myself. The surgery fucking worked. I get to chase my dreams and have a family one day and it's almost too overwhelming to think about. It's been a month now and I'm so deliriously happy every single day that waking up feels almost fake. Like I get to wake up and be healthy and whole and productive in this world.

Sorry if this made no sense or is too rambling, I'm just so goddamn happy to be alive. Aaaaaand now I'm crying again. 

EDIT: I went to bed right after I posted this and I just came back to an explosion of messages and comments. I'm reading every single one of them and I'm crying again goddammit. You all are wonderful, wonderful people. I'm so happy I get to be here."
"My freaking cat, man.","I have the best cat. I know everyone thinks their pet is the best, but come on. You guys should see her. She knows I'm frustrated and can't sleep, and she's literally petting ME. Whenever I'm feeling down she brings me her favorite stuffed Iron Man toy like it's her job. Just now, I made a sound of frustration and she put her little face in mine and booped my nose. I love this cat."
She's not my daughter but I fucking raised her..,"I'm a 39 year old man, 9 years ago, my now 30 year old sister got pregnant. At 21, she was a college dropout, a drunk, a drug addict, and a womanchild. She had no job, no savings, no future. The fuckhead who knocked her up didn't want the kid, and pleaded, more like demanded for an abortion. My mother (the only parent in the picture) has wanted grandchildren since forever, so she overruled this dick boyfriend. So far, this has nothing, absolutely NOTHING to do with me, and it never should have. But, being her only sibling, and the product of a overbearing mother, I helped her. I took her to her OBGYN appointments, I went to her birthing classes. I was more of a father during her pregnancy than that scumbag excuse ever has been. 

For a small bit of backstory, my family line has always been poor. My father worked 2-3 jobs up until his untimely death. Same with my grandfather. I was the only one who made it to college with a full ride. I built a career from the ground up and I'm proud of that notion, but it has made me financially susceptible to my lazy family members. My sister has always asked for money, ever since she was a teen. My mother is the best guilt tripper the world has ever seen. And I'm stuck in between them. 

I digress. When the baby was born, I was there, in place of my niece's father. I was the support and to be honest, I was happy to be. New life is an amazing thing and I wouldn't take back the experience. And damnit people, I fell in love with this child. From day one. I was so smitten by it, I felt an overpowering sense that I needed to protect her. I stayed with my sister the days after. Her father showed up and I wanted to punch him. How could he miss out on something so beautiful. If he didn't know how I felt about him before, he knew now because I lit him up, and I don't regret a single word. It made me want to settle down and make my own family, a feeling I had never felt before. 

Fast forward about 9 months later. The deadbeat father just up and gave up one day. My sister was back and forth living with him and my mother, and one day the constant fighting came to an end, and he kicked her and my niece out. During the process of her moving in with my mom, and trying to find a job, it was clear that my mother couldn't sustain my sister and the baby living with her. So she turned to me, and I couldn't say no. By this point I loved that little girl, and I wanted to help. 

So my sister moves in with me. And I take care of her, and my niece. For **nine. fucking. years.** That's right. For the past nine years and I have fathered this child. I changed her diapers, I took her to the doctor, I **PAID** for those appointments, I helped her through her first day at school, I took her to her first soccer game and cheered for her when she scored her first goal, I bought her her first guitar, I cried the night she told me that she wanted me to be her dad, I had to be the one to tell her that the scum that is her real father has that honor, but, to her, I WAS HER FATHER. 

To my sister's credit, she cleaned up her act. Maternity made her a fantastic person. Now at 30 years old, she has a career, an income, she's engaged to a great guy, daughter approved. And I have to sit here, while she takes my little girl away. It's only been a few weeks since they moved away but I feel so empty. I miss my sister but no one will leave a bigger hole than her. Ella, I love you. My door will always be open, sweet girl. 

EDIT: Okay, so I am overwhelmed with the responses. Thank you all for the advice and kind words. It's helped tremendously. Thank you all."
I'm black on Reddit...,"Reddit is a wonderful forum, for the most part. I feel like I'm a real part of the community here. Until a story with a sizable racial component breaks out. Then suddenly people start using ""they"" to describe me and others ""of my ilk"". Then another black guy creates a video that blames fellow blacks for not doing enough to destroy the negative stereotypes that stalk us, and unanimous applause for this ""brave guy who goes against the grain"" ensues. Almost like ""he's one of the good ones"". And so I stay out of the discussion, and I watch the black psyche analyzed by mostly well-meaning whites. And so I feel, for the most part, like a partial outsider, never to be a full member of this great community.

EDIT: I appreciate the supportive responses to my post. I vent here because despite its weaknesses, Reddit is arguably one of the best forums for intelligent discussion on the Internet, and hopefully our efforts to improve it have potential. 

And to the stranger who gilded me, thank you and may you meet Tina Fey or Neil deGrasse Tyson or Chris Pratt!"
I found out who it was.,"For the last four years, someone has been leaving me random gifts on random days throughout all seasons/times of the year. It started my junior year of college and has persisted through my conclusion of grad school. When it first started, I just assumed that it was my best friend -- but she swore it wasn't her and she found it a little odd. So I assumed it was some secret admirer that would show himself in time. This time never came. 

What is strange about this is that these gifts continued even after I moved halfway across the country. I would be mailed flowers and items to my office. I never thought it weird, but my curiosity began to grow. These gifts had just become a part of my life. 

I posted a facebook message asking the person who had been doing this to come forward so I could thank them for their generosity and kindness. 

And then I got a surprise visitor one day while I was at work. My father. (My father never had anything to do with raising me. My mother said he ran out on the family.)

He told me that he had found where I worked because he was an Associate Dean at my undergrad institution and was shocked when he saw me. He didn't want to be too forward, so the gifts were the only things he knew to do. I've never been so full of different emotions in my entire life. I'm meeting a man who I have so long wanted to meet, he's an amazing human, and I've finally answered a huge question I have always been asking myself -- and others. 

I just needed to get this off my chest. 

**EDIT: Oh my god! I wasn't expecting this to blow up. I'm getting a lot of messages right now and I'm trying to reply to all of them, but I need to clear up a lot of things that I left unclear in this post.**

**1. My father knew that I existed, but I have been talking to both him and my mother to get the full story of what happened. When I was born, my father was halfway through graduate school and was in offered a job a few states away. My mother was about to start working in our hometown and did not want to leave. This led to a huge argument and my mother ended up giving him a choice: either he stays and they try to work it out, or he leaves and that's the end -- she was giving him a choice to walk away. And so he left. He has regretted it every single day of his life, he told me.**

**2. I first met my father my junior year of university because I worked for a volunteer organization on campus which he just so happen to work for as well. He was the director and I did not know this. We had several interactions together and I had no idea that this man was my father. We became facebook friends because our work group had a facebook page that we gave information through and I just so happened to add him one day. Now that I look back -- all the signs are there that this man was my father by how he acted toward me, I just wasn't paying attention.**

**3. When he saw the facebook post, he decided that it was time. This may sound dumb, but he had this whole idea that I would ask to find out who sent me the gifts. He laughed when he told me that he didn't expect it would take me four years. He told me he always imagined me asking about the gifts while I was working for him or something, but I never did, so he just assumed I didn't care. He was terrified to step out and claim his role.**

**4. I have been spending the last few days with him. It's amazing how much we are alike! We sit the same, we eat the same (I kind of hover over my plate and he does the exact same thing!). I found out that he likes Star Wars vs. Star Trek and I do as well. All of these little similarities are incredible to me. I have a father! I'm not angry that I never got to know him, because I know life happens and people make mistakes or do things they think are best for them. I have all of this time *now* to get to know him! I'm very grateful.**

Thank you all who have messaged/commented with good wishes!

I fucking hate the circle jerk of military worship in the US.,"Sitting waiting for a flight. Boarding starts being called. Old people and babies. First class. Priority. Regular shit. Then he stops and says I want to take this opportunity to let our military men and women board. They get up and there are quite a few. But the part that really annoys me is that everyone just randomly starts clapping and whistling for these people. These are not battle hardened vets coming home. These are nothing more than recent seaman grads who just finished naval academy. 

We wonder why all these idiot kids have inflated egos."
"I don't fucking speak Russian. And quit ""correcting"" my name.","I'm Ukrainian. My name is Ukrainian. I have nothing against Russians, but if you know anything about the history of that part of the world, you know Ukraine has been repeatedly invaded and fucked over, mostly by Russia. My family certainly did have a few understandable grudges after the USSR years, so I never learned to speak Russian and I left Ukraine before I was old enough to learn any. The two languages are similar, yes, but just different enough that I don't understand a lot of it when someone speaks Russian. Think about speaking Italian to a Spaniard.


1. When I tell (mostly) Americans, where I'm originally from and they start throwing Russian words at me, it can range from funny to disrespectful. The latter especially when I've already explained I only know Ukrainian. Would you say Konichiwa to a Korean? I fucking hope not.


2. Russians, quit correcting me about the spelling and pronounciation of my name. I spell and pronounce it the Ukrainian way because I'm Ukrainian. Shut the fuck up with your imperialistic bullshit.


That's it. Thanks for listening, reddit.

"I'm telling my husband tonight, I want a divorce.","We've been together for 13 years, no kids. 

I can't keep going like this any more. 

I care about him a lot, I love him as a good friend, a brother. I hate having to break his heart.

But I'm done settling for less.

I'm done having to live with a man, who doesn't do his share of the household duties. A couchpotato, who never wants to do anything. A man who needs to be escorted everywhere, even for buying groceries. A relationship without attraction, as he's asexual. A relationship where I am forced to suppress my sexuality.  A relationship where I don't get back up in my attempts to get healthier and fitter. A relationship where my attempts to get healthier and fitter are sabotaged. A relationship where I feel like I am a mother, and he's a child. A relationship where I long for the moments he leaves the house, or I can go elsewhere for a weekend. 

I'm turning bitter, old and grumpy, in an age of 34. I can't see myself live like this another ten years, so now it's time to tell him. 

It won't be easy. I still care a great deal for him, but I'm done. I've tried telling him of my troubles, I've tried to ask for changes, I've tried to communicate. It's like talking to a door. 

The next chapter in my life starts now. 

_____________________________________________________________________

Okay, update time. I'd never expected so many comments as I've gotten. Thanks a bunch for all the well wishes and whatnot. 

So, I've told him. 

It was fucking hard, to say the least. Pardon my language. 

I saw the man I've been with for 13 years, cry for the first time today. My husband -never- cries.

He sounded so heartbroken. I've cried nonstop for two hours, and used an entire kitchenroll blowing my nose. 

This is where we are now: 

I have agreed to couples councelling. He promises to make an effort and alter things. 

I don't believe it, but I will grant him this one last chance with therapy. He has made plans, lists and promises before, but they never carry out. 

I promised him, I'll do my best to secure him financially if we lose money on the house, since I earn better than him. I promised to help him through this, and that we'll sort this as friends. I won't leave him hanging. I feel like shit for hurting him like this. But I'm glad I did. I still expect us to get divorced, once we've been through couples therapy. I hope it can help him cope with the situation though. 

________________________________________________________________________

Good morning out there. Once again, thank you for all the replies, your words of encouragement means a lot to me, no matter if your views leans in one or another direction. Thank you for sharing your experiences. Also, thanks to those who gives constructive advice, books, movies and suggestions on how to deal with this. I never expected this to blow up as much as it has, but I thank everyone of you, for your kind responses. 

Another update from me.

After a restless night for both of us, we both went to work.

My husband seems to have gotten the message for now. 

- We have contacted a marriage counsellor. 

- He has bought a book on ""motivation and procrastination"" which should help offer him some tools. 

- I have offered him, that we pay for a personal trainer, a psychologist or whatever he might feel could help him. I see it as a good investment, if it can help us save the marriage. 

- He told me, he'll start picking weeds in the front garden this afternoon. A thing he never did before, even though I've struggled a lot coping with it due to osteoarthritis in both knees.

- He has suggested we go for a ride on bikes this weekend, 20 km route. We haven't biked together like that, ever. I've asked for it several times though.

If we can make it work? I don't know. It's mainly up to him now. If he manages to go through the changes, then I'm willing to work for it. If he slides back into old habits, then I'm out. 

I'm going to respond to a few of the questions, which has been repeated several times:

People ask me if he always were like this: He was always an introvert, a thinker, who reacts inwards rather than outwards.  He's gained 40 kg over the years, I've grown really concerned for his physical health. Although I don't care about his looks, the weight is adding to his inactivity. He has definitely grown more and more inactive over the years. I've tried to drag him to train with me, to get him into activities with me, something we could do together, but with no luck. 

People ask me, why I married an Asexual: This one is a complicated one. If nothing else was an issue in our relationship, I could cope with this. No relationship is perfect, but naturally, when more things are wrong, it all sums up. As to why I married him despite being Asexual... well I wasn't looking for hot sex when I met him. I had gone through several things, including rape and a violent abusive ex. I didn't believe in romantic love, I didn't believe I'd ever find a ""true love"", I didn't believe I deserved such. He loves me, and was a safe choice, I love him as a friend and brother, and figured it could work. I still love and care for him, in our own platonic way. Naturally it has been an issue over the years, but we have worked through it. 

People ask me, if he's depressed: While I surely can understand why you would think so, I don't think he is. He was diagnosed with depression by a regular doctor once, but stopped the meds after a while, as they didn't do anything for him. He doesn't believe he's depressed, and won't get help. He does not feel sad, down or depressed, no tunnel vision, no ruminating. He's ""just"" an inactive introvert. We both know depression first hand, so we know what to look for.



"
My Best Friend is Pregnant...,"It's kind of dumb that she purposefully got pregnant with a guy she's only known 6 months. Its also kind of dumb that they're talking about getting married. I can try to look past this guy's Facebook profile picture that is of him wearing a wife-beater and pointing a handgun at the camera while trying to look like a badass.

But this is where I just can't take it anymore. She told me if the baby is a boy they are going to name him Einstein.

Einstein Cosmos. 

Wtf. I just can't support this anymore. "
The way guys talk about girls is disgusting,"Before I start, I’m not saying every guy does this. But I have heard stuff like this a lot.

Today we had a substitute teacher. She looked around 20, and at the beginning of the hour she seemed like she was really happy/excited to be there. But 3 minutes in this guy behind me said “damn I’d hit that” to his friend. His friend loudly said “she has a nice ass but she needs a nose job to be hot” and a few other guys laughed and said they agreed. The teacher looked over when he said that and you could just see all the positivity she had get knocked right out of her. She spent the rest of the class looking really sad.

This sort of stuff drives me crazy. Why do guys always need to be judging how all girls look like that? Obviously everyone has opinions on who they think is hot or not, but it was one of the first things they thought about and said when she started teaching. I’ll admit that I can be a little judgmental of guys features (I’m a gay guy), but whenever I meet or see someone I don’t immediately start thinking about if I want to have sex with them. I just wish there wasn’t this acceptance for the constant sexualization of girls in movies and conversations and stuff.

"
Tinder is giving me a place to sleep at night,"I'm a young and homeless woman living out of my car. It's super cold right now so sleeping in my car has been difficult, not to mention I'm kind of tall and my car is small so it kills my back. I got an idea to go on tinder and just Netflix and chill with people so I have somewhere to sleep at night. I can be quite the charmer I guess. So far, so good but I already know this is going to catch up to me mentally. I don't have anybody to turn to though so this will have to suffice. Thanks tinder. 

EDIT:
I had no idea this post was going to take off. It was a quick offmychest post but the fact that so many people are reaching out is blowing my mind and I can't stop crying. 
I'm gonna answer some quick questions that I get inboxed about.

Where am I from? Florida
Am I working? I'm trying to get a job but in the meantime I've been doing odd jobs on craigslist like bulk junk removal and maid service 
How old am I and how did this happen? I'm 21. I grew up in an abusive household and have been pretty much on my own since 16. I lost my job and haven't been able to find another one since and I can't afford to rent anywhere (expensive area) so I just sleep in my car and do odd jobs on the side to get by. I'm a hard worker the job market is just tough so I do what I can for the time being. 

EDIT 2: THANK YOU ALL!! It means the entire world that people from around the globe are reaching out to help me. I didn't expect this reaction at all but it's refreshing to know that so many people care to reach out and try to help me. Just thank you. I've been going through the darkest time and I've lost so much hope and your kind words alone are enough to get me by. Thank you guys ❤️ sorry if I can't reply to everybody I've been busy but once again thank you, you all are amazing "
"As a Gen Xer, I am so tired of hearing how lazy and entitled the Millennials are.","We late Baby Boomers and Gen Xers were the most selfish, shittiest generation ever. We are responsible for the decline in unions and not getting rid of the right to work state laws. We are responsible for not raising the minimum wage because we can't figure out that the $3.35 per hour we made in 1981 had more buying power than the $7.25 we pay now.  We inherited the most robust manufacturing force on the planet and then sold them off overseas to trim the fat off our balance sheets. We are responsible for the US debt and also, allowing our infrastructure to become a mess because we refused to pay any more to fix it. AND after jacking up the price of a college education, we started for-profit colleges and predatory education loans and began saddling our kids with tremendous debt right out of school with few high paying jobs to make that debt manageable.  The one good thing we did was to give birth to millennials who are doing a great job at trying to fix our mess. (See Bernie movement, socialism no longer a dirty word, activism, environmentalists, philanthropy, human rights etc). I love this upcoming generation and have a lot of hope for it. I don't think they are self serving and spoiled at all. I think they are clever, creative, ambitious, globally engaged and I hold out a lot of hope for them. (Once the baby boomers and Gen Xers die out and take our ""conservative"" bullshit with us. I.E. I've got mine, so you go get yours. Even though we made it twice as hard and we pay half as much). So to all you millennials, I'd like to apologize and say on behalf of many of us, we are in awe of your passion and your desire to do right. You're doing a lot better job than we would have being handed the same crappy cards. Godspeed. "
Ellen Pao is still a person.,"Throwaway because this is the most unpopular opinion on this site.

I'm not going to lie. Ellen Pao, as a CEO, is doing a terrible job at managing reddit and its business interests. But some of the comments I've seen are just absolutely horrid. People have seem to forgotten she's a person just like you or me, and she has feelings too.

Before anyone brings up that sexual harassment lawsuit thing, yeah, it was shitty. But that's her business, and has nothing to do with her position at reddit.

Just remember there's someone on the other end of the keyboard."
Faced my rapist in court - made it to cover of largest national newspaper.,"Yesterday the lawsuit against my rapist finally took place. I sat 2 meters behind him in court. I gave a speech on how the rape impacted my life. Today I woke up, the story, my story, made it to the front page of the largest national newspaper, was picked up by politicians through Twitter and in parliament. He shouldn’t have been out on the streets. 

The public prosecutor demanded the very very maximum, in two weeks we will know the sentence. 

Edit: this is a selection of the news articles, for those interested. They aren’t in English but Translate goes a long way. 

So this one was on the front page (like the actual newspaper): https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1910078/woede-om-blunder-justitie-verkrachter-slaat-toe-ondanks-enkelband/?utm_source=whatsapp

Inside there was a big article with drawings and my speech: https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1910080/linda-werd-urenlang-verkracht-in-haar-eigen-bed-je-bent-mijn-slaafje"
My name is Elsa,"And ever since the movie Frozen came out everybody's keep asking me if I want to build a snowman. And when I say my feelings about it they will just say, ""Let it go, Elsa. Let it go."". Now winter is coming and I can't just imagine how many people will ask me to build a snowman."
I just had my last cigarette after 14 years of smoking.,"I don’t know if anyone will read this, but I just need to get these thoughts out. 

Maybe 3 people in my life know this, but I’ve been smoking since I was 12 years old. I don’t talk about it because I hate being judged for it by people who haven’t lived the type of life that I have lived.
I was so young with no parents in my life or anyone else who cared. Both of my parents had abandoned me, and I was on my own, bouncing from place to place, each person making it clear that I was just another burden in their life.
It was so incredibly easy to start smoking.
Cigarettes comforted me. 
Cigarettes couldn’t reject me, or abandon me. Cigarettes were always there for me. 
The harder life was the more I smoked, the more I depended on them, and more they became a part of me.
I’ve been smoking for 14 years now, and I don’t know who I am without cigarettes. I don’t know what I’ll do without them to rely on, and it’s absolutely terrifying.
I need to quit for my health, for my finances, really for every reason under the sun. 
However, the real reason I’m quitting is because of my Niece. She is my heart and soul, and she turned 4 years old today. 
It’s not just that I want to be there for her whole life (which I do and is a huge motivator), but I don’t ever want her to think that it’s okay to smoke and then end up struggling the way I have...and am. 
She is the reason that I’m facing my fears and finding out who I am without cigarettes. 

Tomorrow is my quit date (the day after her 4th birthday) and I smoked my last cigarette about an hour ago. I have a whole quit plan worked out and have my nicotine patches ready to use. Still, I am deeply terrified, but I’m going to think of my niece and pray that I get through this and never touch a cigarette again."
Something awful happened to me in the girl's locker room today. My body was exposed to many people and posted on Snapchat.,"So, the girl's locker room in our school is somewhat open and if you turn away from your locker, you can see most of everyone. My locker is like right in the corner of the locker room by our phy ed teacher's office.
Now, there are some really horrible people in my class.
After phy ed today, I was taking my shirt off to change back into my everyday clothes, duh. I wasn't facing the middle of the locker room but I had most of my body turned outwards and people can see. Then all of a sudden I hear someone kinda whisper ""one.. two.. three"" behind me and giggle but I didn't really take notice of it, I just continued to lift my arms up to take my shirt off. Before I knew it, my bra was un-hooked and on the floor. Someone purposely un-hooked my bra. Lucky for me it was strapless and fell right off. At the same time there was a second girl RECORDING this. I couldn't really cover myself right away considering the fact that I was in the middle of taking my shirt off... As quickly as I could, I grabbed my shirt and covered myself. Now, the female gym teacher doesn't really pay attention much and is either chilling in her office or just not in the locker room at all because as a phy ed teacher, she's not really supposed to pay attention to her students changing. But, another teacher (one that actually knows me quite well, she teaches math) was leaving said phy ed teacher's office (I'm assuming they had to talk or something like that) when my bra was un-hooked. Math teacher went OFF on those girls, I'm not kidding. Everyone just kinda looked at me with wide eyes and I was clenching my shirt to my chest, literally petrified. I still am. Then, I grabbed my bra and the rest of my clothes and booked it to the bathroom. There's no way I was going to put my bra on in front of everyone who had just gotten flashed.
After I left the locker room to head to lunch, I was in tears. Said math teacher pulled me aside to talk to me about it and told me it was not my fault and everything and that the principal and social worker will probably meet with me sometime after lunch. At lunch the video of my bra getting taken off was on said girl's snapchat story. I don't know how many people saw it. Now, the principal and social worker met with me and the girls separately.. The video was also removed from Snapchat, and I'm pretty sure they were forced to delete it if they had saved it. Right now I am unaware of what her punishment is (I'll probably find out tomorrow) but the staff of the school are on my side and everything.
But, aside from all of that, I honestly just want to die. Like ugh.
To have that many people see my bare chest makes me so upset. I'm a pretty modest person and I'm just still so... Shocked. I just don't want to go to school tomorrow because of what happened. Like, I just really don't want to deal with this and I just want to crawl into a hole and disappear. :/

UPDATE:
Alright, so today is Tuesday and the whole event happened yesterday.
First off I just want to say thank you for all of the support you guys have been offering me. I’ve gotten a lot of DM’s and it’s hard to respond to most of them(I’ve been busy.) So even if I haven’t responded just know that I have read it and I do greatly appreciate your support.
Secondly, I have some stuff to share.
Today my parents and I met with the dean of students, principal, social worker, and school liaison officer before school. The two girls mainly involved in what happened were expelled for the rest of the year. As well as that, they were confronted by the liaison police officer both yesterday and today.
Some of you have mentioned that there are mandated reporters in the school and what they should’ve done and whatnot. They DID call my parents and notify them last night (after I had posted this) as well as getting the liaison officer involved. Just know that my situation is in very very good hands at this moment, I 100% my school’s HR and staff and I am so grateful to have such amazing support from them. I can see why you would be concerned though, considering there are many schools who don’t have the best of staff.
As far as pressing charges goes, it’s up to us. The liaison officer was very honest with the girls and thoroughly explained to them that if I press charges, their lives could easily be sent into a downwards spiral.
Though, I am not quite sure how I feel about pressing charges. I know that many many of you are urging me to, but I need to think on it. My mom is supportive of me whether I press charges or not. She says it’s up to me. In my opinion I think the liaison officer did his job and practically scared the life out of those girls. They deserved it and really, they should be scared given the severity of what they did.
All in all, I will be OK.
I am still very upset. I do know it will get better. But that’s just something you don’t want to happen.
Of course, there are people at my school gossiping, but that’s going to happen regardless of what I do. I’ll live through that part.
I think the most painful part of this is the fact that I was sexually assaulted last year (non-school related, it was a LOT more serious than this) and this just kind of set me back in my healing process.
It may be hard to explain but healing from a trauma like rape takes a very long time.
I know, “don’t worry it was just your boobs” but still, being exploited and exposed like that especially given the fact that I am still healing from previous traumas is very painful for me.
I’ll figure it out though. I’m sure I’ll be okay, even though it hurts a lot now.
I’m trying to keep my head up, thank you."
Please stop saying he was insane,"You're supposed to be journalists, but there is no actual evidence to suggest he was mentally ill instead of just plain evil (there is a difference, believe it or not), and calling him insane or crazy or saying he had an evil voice in his head (per entertainer Jimmy Kimmel) does real harm to people who suffer from illnesses like schizophrenia. The stigma and misunderstanding and fear directly contribute to the fact that we are 11 times more likely to be VICTIMS of violent crime, rather than the perpetrators. 

His father was diagnosed as psychopathic, which is not the same as psychotic. To be psychotic means you suffer from hallucinations and/or delusions, etc.  It does not mean that you're dangerous. The vast majority of people with severe mental illnesses are no more violent than anyone else. Only between 3-5% of crimes can be attributed to the mentally ill. 

To discriminate against those of us who suffer from a disability is *ableist*. 

There's a much stronger correlation to violence if someone is male and young. Shall we treat all young men like they're inherently dangerous? Of course not. 

There's a strong link between depression sufferers and mass shootings, so do we use depression as a club against others and ostracize them as monsters? No. 

If we believe an individual is a danger to themselves or others, we should facilitate them getting the help they need, not throw hate and ignorance at them. 

People on Facebook are declaring it to be ""open season"" on us! THAT is sick. Or to be more correct, I should say it's evil. "
I caught two of my male coworkers having sex while on the clock and they offered me $100 to not tell anyone,"And I took the money and bought groceries for the week 

edit: To everyone who keeps saying I should have tried to get more $$$, they are waiters"
"Just because I can speak, doesn't mean I am not Deaf.","Today I went to the mall as a treat. I've had a rough week, I thought what the hell. Usually when I'm out, and alone I sign so I don't have to speak. Sometimes I need to speak.  I was signing to a man in a store, explaining I am Deaf etc, and I realized he couldn't understand me and I had a question so I chose to speak. His eyes grew wide, and I read his lips ""there is no way youre deaf! You speak too well."" I explained I only went deaf 3 years ago at the age of 21, so I CAN still talk but don't like to. He proceeded to laugh and say he doesn't believe me. I just walked away. I'm using this experience to teach. Deafness comes in different forms. Some don't like using their voice. Some can and do use their voice because they have hearing aids and are comfortable with it. Then there are people like me, who usually sign only but use their voices when needed. I hate using my voice but sometimes it is necessary because society (for the most part) doesn't deem Deaf people are worthy of accessibility and comfort. We are too much of an inconvenience to communicate with. So please, I beg you to be considerate of Deaf people. We have a rough time in a hearing world! That being said, I'm proud to be deaf and I've loved being integrated into the culture over the past 3 years. "
I spent 13 years trying to figure out if I was in an abusive relationship...,"You'd never hit me. You very rarely call me names. You aren't prone to raising your voice. I don't feel like a victim. 

So why does everyone give me 'that look'? The one that says, ""You poor thing, you're in trouble and you don't even realize it."" I've had people slip me post-its saying they'd help me escape. 

Escape from what? ""It's not like I slap you around,"" is what you always say when we argue. ""I'm not a drunk. I don't sleep around. I'm not a mean person."" This is all true. If someone isn't meeting any of these values, then why? Why do people always assume I'm a victim? 

Because you isolate me? You hate me having friends. We get in fights if a male coworker even dares to comment on a Facebook post. You drive people away from me, so subtly. You pop an attitude. You make it clear they're not welcome. You're aggressive. And at the end of the day, you have me all to yourself. I have no friends anymore. You don't even like my family. I have only you. 

Because you don't work? Not because you're disabled or just having a hard time, but because you self-admittedly just don't want to. Everything is about your comfort. If you're upset, I'm upset. I work only to provide for you. You take and take, and you never give. I can't even get you to wash a dish. I'm living with a teenager.

Because you want sex and affection on your own terms? When you're not busy. When you're bored. When there's nothing better left to do, there's always me. I'm a back-up for when the WoW servers go down. I'm a comfortable and convenient hole. 

The night after my mom died, you sat there and watched me--you, who do nothing all day, who hasn't had a job, who hasn't even kept up a pretense of looking for one, in *eight fucking years*--watched me clear the bed of laundry so you could lay down. You sat there and *waited*. While I folded clothes, put them in the drawer, all the while in a state so grief-stricken that I may as well have been a zombie. ""No no, don't bother yourself, I've got this,"" I said to you, sarcastic. 

Your reply? ""I'm not a mind-reader. If you needed help, you should have asked."" 

So this is what we are. Not a partnership. Barely roommates. I'm not to expect help from you. I'm not to even expect help unless I *need* it. Because you do the bare minimum to keep the peace, nothing more. 

And suddenly, I see it. I see us how others must see us. Isolated, me always cleaning up after your messes, figurative and literal, me making excuses for you, you never seeming to go out of your way to make things easier on me, just you. 

Just you, using me. 

And now, 13 years later, at 30 years old, completely terrified of leaving because I've been under your imposed isolation since I was only *16* and have no idea how to exist in the real world, I can finally see you for what you are: a coward and a user, and you *can't* love me. You just simply cannot. I don't even think you have the capacity. I think I've dumped 13 years of my love and service and loyalty and effort into a black fucking void. 

But I'm 30. It's not too late for me. I'm smart. I'm a hard worker. I'm funny and creative and have passable grammar. 

And I'm hot. 

I'm so fucking hot. I'm way too fucking hot for your 39 year-old, lazy, freeloading, hanging-gut, smelly-armpit, gassy, tangled-hair, MMORPG-addicted, Doritos-eating, snotty-nosed, ashtray-breath, jock-itched ass.

Abusive?

""It's not like I slap you around,"" you say. 

The day that I allowed, ""Doesn't beat me,"" to become my only standard in men is the day that I abused *myself*. 

Trust me, man. 

I'm ready to love who I am.

You'll hate it so damn much.

**Edit:** Wow, I'm really overwhelmed by the response this has gotten! Thanks so much for all your support and well-wishes. 

To answer some questions, yes I was 16 and he was 25 when we got together. It was just barely legal here in SC. Of course there was grooming, he's completely shaped the person I've become. How could he not? It's been almost half my life. I don't think this was intentional on his part, it's just how it worked out.

I'm saving up my money to get out. I don't want to leave and then end up running back out of necessity, just because I don't have a place to stay or don't feel secure and get seduced by old complacency. I want my feet to be on solid ground, so I'm planning this carefully. I have no family left, they're all either dead or 'might as well be'. No friends. I have to be my own safety net.  

I'm also studying to get my GED, maybe someday finally go to college for the BFA I've so badly wanted, but I'm focusing on one goal at a time. I think he sees all these little signs and knows shit's about to go down. I don't feel in any danger from him (honestly, harming me would take more ambition than I believe he's even capable of at this point). I expect a fucking epic tantrum. I'll bring his parents in to make sure he doesn't harm himself, as he's been prone to threaten, but I've been told that a local police escort is totally attainable and that I should take advantage of that, so I probably will.

Anyway, I'm probably a long way out from taking real action (saving money is so. fucking. hard.), but I'll be sure to update when I'm free. Thanks again for the support. This is just the confidence-boost I needed to make it through a particularly rough month. "
"Mom, Im so glad you never sent me this","Your iPad didn't charge this morning, I gave it most of the day to see if anything would change, but after 8 hours of no cord, no outlet, nothing being able to charge your iPad, I took it to the Apple Store.
After the longest wait of my life I finally got some help from ""Raul"" who simply scraped all the crust out of the charging port, and did a factory reset on the iPad to make sure it wasn't anything else. It still works and you didn't have to pay $299 for a replacement! Thank god.
I took it home to you, and due to your lack of knowledge with technology, I set it all up for you :) after worrying you wouldn't have any of your old apps or data on the iPad because you never backed it up on iTunes, it gave me the option to use a backup from iCloud, the ONE time iCloud has ever been useful amirite ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I told you I needed your iCloud password, and you tossed me your phone saying there was a folder in notes with all your passwords. I found that easily, but along with that I also found a letter you wrote to me in notes written in January of this year. I read it, and could barely stand to hold back the tears that so desperately wanted to burst out right in front of you as I was ""getting your iCloud password."" In the letter, you apologized to me, and confessed how rough those past few months were on you. you told me you loved me and that everything was too much. These last few years have been so hard on us mom and I'm so sorry they brought you down to writing a suicide note to me. As I was fixing your iPad, I responded to your note within the same folder, and dated it with today's date to show you when I saw it. I told you how much I love you, and that I'm SO glad I was never sent that note. You're the strongest person I know and I love you so much. I don't know when you'll see my response to the note, but when you do, I pray you tell me, so that I know if you were reflecting on that note, or feeling that way again. I don't know what I would've done without you here to see me as the lead role in the musical my final year of high school, or graduating, going to college.. thank you for never sending me that note."
"I defended my PhD yesterday and not one of my family/friends showed up. Not even my fiancé. I know I'm a horrible person for it, but I never want to see any of them again.","I'll try to keep it brief.

Yesterday I defended my PhD in a STEM field at a highly prestigious program. Unlike many departments, my department's defenses are basically celebrations. You present for 1 hr to anyone who wants to come, your PhD committee asks you a few questions, and then you drink champagne and celebrate.

I created a FB event for it 3 weeks in advance. My immediate family and very closest of friends all said they could come. These included my best man as well as two people who were to give toasts at the wedding. My fiancé was going to take work off to come as well.

Then yesterday came. I knew two of my co-workers couldn't make it because they were out of the country, but I wasn't prepared for what happened.

I presented to a nearly completely empty auditorium. Only my advisor, two committee members, and a few members of nearby labs showed. It was so incredibly embarrassing that I almost couldn't make it through my defense.

After my defense, I looked at my phone. I only had one message from my mom, saying my family wasn't going to make it on time because they left too late. I called my fiancé twice with no answer. It wasn't until 10pm last night that she called me back. It turned out that her best friend from college (who've I known to be quite selfish from previous situations) had tried to kill herself because she found out that her boyfriend had cheated on her. She knew my defense was yesterday but begged my fiancé to visit her all day in the hospital.

My fiancé didn't even say congrats.

No one else has called or texted to congratulate me since I defended yesterday.

I barely held it together on my call with my fiancé but I'm now so upset that I'm considering calling off the wedding, taking a job, and never contacting any of these people again.

I know I'm a horrible person for this, but my big day was completely fucking ruined by their inconsiderate actions. 

EDIT: Thank you all so much! This means a lot. In reading your responses and generally calming down, I think I'll call my fiancée and family

EDIT #2: I did not expect this to blow up as much as it did. Seriously, thank you all for your wonderful support. I'm taking today and maybe even tomorrow to just rest on this before I talk to my family and friends. You guys are giving great advice! 

EDIT #3 (~4:30 p PST): I'm heading out to dinner now but I've decided I'm going to call tomorrow. I'll try to update you if anything gets resolved (or if it doesn't!)

EDIT #4 (5:46 a PST): Holy crap... This got a lot of replies. I'll update later today but I wanted to address a few responses suggesting that either a). this situation is reflective of me not going to their special events or b). that my family/friends aren't obligated to show.

a). Yes I have gone to and planned special functions for others. One of the friends who told me they would show up defended her PhD a few weeks ago (but from another group). I of course showed up to her defense. I also helped plan the happy hour afterwards. I also helped plan another invited friend's surprise birthday last year, which was huge because she turned 30. So while, I understand why people might think that I'm expecting something while giving nothing to others, I just don't believe that it is the case here.

b). Of course my family/friends aren't obligated to show. Had they said they couldn't come (due to work, etc.), I wouldn't be upset. Had they ignored me, I probably would have just interpreted that as a ""can't come"" and still would be ok. But my closest friends made it a point that they would be there, and then didn't show. That's what got me upset.

**MAJOR UPDATE (~10:30a PST):**
This morning my fiancée called me after I was more or less incommunicado all of yesterday. Because I had calmed down, we were able to have a rational discussion. It turns out there is ALOT to the story that I was unaware of (because I'm a doofus) ;).

First things first. My fiancée and I are just fine!! 

She began the conversation with an apology. She explained that while she was in shock on Friday about her friend, she realized immediately after our call that she had completely ignored me and my defense all day. She knows me well, and knew how upset and angry I was. She thought i had every right to be angry but gave me a day to chill out.

My fiancée is now extremely pissed at her friend. Previously I had implied that her friend was extremely selfish not only due to previous actions but also because she called my fiancée and begged her to visit all day, even though she knew my defense was that day. Many criticized my feelings about this and, as of early this morning, I thought that I was wrong to feel the way I did. I should have been a bit more sympathetic. But then my fiancée told me what happened yesterday. For about 2 hrs yesterday, my fiancée visited her friend in the hospital again. Her friend was feeling a bit better, so my fiancé began to ask about the cheating boyfriend in a bit more detail.

It turns out that her friend did not find out about her boyfriend cheating on Friday. She actually found out the Saturday before. And she had actually suspected that her bf was cheating MONTHS ago. That Saturday, he finally admitted it to her, after she saw him receive a snapchat of a naked girl, yet she did nothing about it because she didn't want to lose him. In other words, she lied to my fiancée about when she found out he was cheating. What pissed my fiancée off the most was that during this past week, my fiancée and her friend talked twice over the phone. Neither time the friend even mentioned it. While I understand that she may have been bottling up her feelings, or may have been embarrassed, her previous actions an things like engagement parties and dinner parties casts some doubt on this. 

Regardless of my feelings, my fiancée is incredibly angry with her because she had all week to talk about this, to have her help her deal with this trauma. But she didn't. She waited until the exact most inconvenient time. In my fiancées words, ""Trust me. This wasn't spontaneous. She chose to have that reaction on that day.""

We are unsure as to what to do about my fiancées friend and the wedding. She is currently a bridesmaid, but maybe not anymore.

About my family: yesterday morning, my fiancée called my immediate family and asked what happened. Sorry but the answer is boring. It was just another case of my parents being incapable of getting anywhere on time. My fiancée advised them not to call me yesterday because I was very upset. My family all texted me this morning ad apologized profusely. They would have called me Friday night after my defense but they honestly weren't sure if I wanted to talk to them.

About my friends: also yesterday my fiancée called the closest of my friends that were invited. These friends, I know for sure, wouldn't lie to my fiancée. Half of them forgot and were deeply mortified that they missed it. I'm told that they will call me later today. It turns out that my best man blacked out Thursday night after originally only going out to grab a beer. And the rest were a combination of ""something came up"" or ""I was sick."" Although in one case the person was very clearly ill and anyone could tell from talking to him over the phone.

So that is basically it. My fiancée really pulled through in calling everyone. She didn't have to do that and I'm very lucky to have her. Before I start my job, we will have a real party that is sure to be fun.

Thank you all for your support, kind words, and even critical words. You guys rock!

I don’t get why women in public restrooms get so offended by smelly poop.,"Dear lady that just glared at me and said “peew” to her friend while walking out of the bathroom:

I am a human. I poop. Sometimes my poop stinks. And when I’m at work, the only option is the public toilet, or my pants. I also have gastric problems, but no need to get into details. Just, what I don’t get is why you expect a poop room to smell like roses. 

There’s a great book called “Everybody Poops” that my dad read to my little sister as a kid. Maybe you should read it.

Sincerely,
An employee who needs to poop on a regular basis.


Edit: Hehehe, the top post I’ve ever made on Reddit, in my history of reddit, is about poop. Thanks, Reddit! Also, I have been made more than aware what poopouri is now. Thanks, Internet. Guess I should talk about poop more often... people seem to like talking about it too!"
I FUCKING DID IT!,"EDIT: From the bottom of my heart, I want to thank all of you guys for the kind words! You guys are amazing! :D

I really don't have anyone to celebrate this amazing news. So random strangers in the internet, I want to say ""I FINISHED MY LAST SEMESTER OF NURSING SCHOOL!!!"" 

Oh my god! This is very crazy news! I am not the smartest person. Seriously, in high school I was going to be like my mom and collect government checks for the rest of my life because I was too stupid to get accepted into college or a job. Younger version of me would be shocked that I actually got into nursing school.

I feel so dam proud of myself! Now that I got accepted to RN program and I'm going to spend more time in school. But I am so fucking happy I am done my RPN program! "
How many more celebrities have to kill themselves until we take mental health seriously?,"I'm going to be honest here, I absolutely hate times like this because mental health and depression becomes a fad that everybody talks about for the next few days and then set aside when Trump does some ridiculous thing or when that new Netflix documentary comes out.

The statistics are fairly conclusive. According to Statistics Canada, for every two people that die by homicide, between five and seven die by suicide. (This excludes some of the northern territories, where the homicide rate is higher). The last time I checked, the United States has a similar ratio – slightly worse because people have access to firearms that allow permanent solutions to split-second decisions. 

In any case, for every tragic celebrity death, there's thousands of people out there quietly suffering. 

What bothers me most about this is that, in Canada at least, there are all these token gestures that people and organizations make in order to appear as if they care about mental health. ""Let's Talk"" and ""Awareness Month"" – it's so shallow it borders on being condescending.

But when it comes to *actually doing something*, nothing really changes.

I'll use a personal anecdote that happened to me literally yesterday:

I would at a large company, and I'm pretty friendly with most of my coworkers. We joke around and get along great. Anyways, after work, everybody decided to get drinks and they invited me to come.

I declined. Politely and repeatedly, I might add. But they continued to question me about it. ""Come on, man. Everybody's going to be there. It's rude to decline an invitation like that.""

So I finally told them the truth: ""Being around people all day is exhausting. I need time to recharge."" I didn't say it this bluntly but I got my message across.

For the way they reacted, I might as well have told them that I loved the idea of the Third Reich.

That's what bothers me the most about all of this. Companies will set up ""safe spaces"" and colouring stations and bring in pets and all this other meaningless bullshit, and people will talk about this tragedy and that, but the moment it *inconveniences* them, you see through their actions how they *truly* feel about all of it. In most cases, bringing colouring stations and pets to the workplace for mental health is like bringing in a treadmill to a cigarette factory, and still wondering why people are dying.

But the thing is, nobody is ever going to phrase it like that. Most people don't say ""your depression is bombing everybody out, so we're going to stop hanging out with you."" That usually gets phrased as ""you don't exactly fit in with the culture around this workplace.""

Because *real* mental health awareness is allowing postpartum depression to be an excuse for that two year gap in your resume. *Real* mental health awareness is allowing am employee to take the rest of the day off to simply recharge. *Real* mental health awareness might actually mean paying your employees better. *Real* mental health awareness might mean that, even after doing all these things, they might still have a problem, and no amount of money or notoriety can help (in the case of these recent celebrity suicides).

*Real* mental health is inconvenient, and that's why it will ever really be taken seriously. Sure, people will talk about it for the next little while on social media and the news, and then people will move on like the issue was solved – until the next time somebody famous kills themselves, then the cycle starts all over again. "
I've never told anyone what my tattoos mean,"People usually ask why I have my father's & grandfather's names tattooed on my wrists.  I always say it's because I love them, and they mean the world to me.  They do.  But I've never told anyone the second part of it.

I am constantly held down by depression and fear.  A few years ago it got to the point where hurting myself felt like a very real possibility.  Instead of telling anyone how bad I was, therapist or otherwise, I got the names of two of the most important people in my life tattooed over the arteries on my wrists.

The tattoos are a constant reminder of the damage that would be caused if I did anything permanent.  They have helped me out of dark moments more than any therapist, doctor, or medication ever has.  Whenever I feel the need to exit this world, I just look at their names and am reminded of why I shouldn't.  The tattoos are the most important tools available to me when everything else seems hopeless.

Today I am melancholy but confident.  I am looking at their names and know that today, I will not try anything stupid.  They mean too much to me, and I know I mean too much to them.  I want to thank them for all they've done for me, for all the times the memories of them have saved me, but I won't.  No one else will ever know exactly what these tattoos are and what they mean, but they mean everything, and they've made all the difference.

Dad, Gramp, thank you for always being there to save me."
You're tired of black people talking about racism? I'm tired of experiencing racism.,"I had a date with a white girl this weekend. We'd already had three great ones, she was interesting and cute, and there was a ton of mutual attraction. She asked if I wanted to hang out with her and some of her friends. I said sure. I was excited to see her again.

I get to her place (everyone is already there) and one guy, Douchebag, gives me a ""look"" (every black guy who's dated a white girl knows what I mean). I don't think one funny look is enough to judge someone, so I let it go.

We're drinking and talking and having a good time (played kings, etc). Douchebag is a lightweight and kinda immature, and I notice that he looks uncomfortable whenever, say, my date touches my leg. Whatever. Maybe he had a crush on her. U mad bro?

Then he refers to some other people in a story as ""my n---az"". Everyone gets quiet, my date looks mortified. This isn't the first time this has happened, so I politely but firmly tell Douchebag that what he said isn't okay. A white person needs to be *very* close friends with me to say that, even in jest. He seemed to get it and I was ready to move on.

We wound up going to a bar. It was so packed that everyone was standing nut to butt, and I counted one other black person there. Douchebag is now seriously drunk and he's getting belligerent. I went to order, and I accidentally bumped into him. He turns around and SCREAMS: **""quit pushing me, you stupid fucking n----r.""** Everyone nearby stared. That was enough. I found my date and told her that I wanted to go, I didn't want to deal with Douchebag any more that night. She agreed to leave and said goodbye to her friends. I suppose they got Douchebag home somehow.

When we got outside, the first thing she said was that Douchebag ""isn't like that."" I replied that he *just was* like that, to my face, repeatedly, and that I knew she had seen some of it. I added that I didn't like it that Douchebag had just called me a ""n----r"" in front of a bunch of strangers and her first concern seemed to be that I might, *just might*, think Douchebag was a racist. I said this calmly, because I'm not stupid enough to get into a shouting match with a petite white woman, at night, downtown, in a big city. But I still was furious, and she was in tears. We didn't spend the night together.

The next morning she called me to apologize (edit to add: apologizing by phone or in person is *always* the right way to do it, not by text), and said that I was right to be angry. What I told her had clearly sunk in, so I accepted and told her I hadn't meant to make her cry. We'll probably keep seeing each other. But for every white person who is willing to listen there are as many who dismiss us, as if they know better than we do what it means to be black in America. If you don't want to hear black people talk about racism, then recognize that anti-black racism affects every black person in America, listen to our voices, and when you see racism speak up. Allies are great. ""Allies"" are not.

**tldr** I was having a nice night out with a girl I'm seeing. A racist prick who couldn't accept a black guy dating a white girl almost ruined it. I hope at least one white person will read this and learn something.

Inb4 ""he was drunk:"" Please, alcohol doesn't inspire you to call a stranger ""n---r."" It just makes you express what you really feel.

Inb4 n-word privilege/double standards complaints: I've heard them all. It costs you nothing to just not say the fucking word when we ask you not to. I don't get what bothers some people about this so much.

Inb4 ""sellout:"" Fuck you.

**Edit**: ""judge someone one"" -> ""judge someone""

**Edit 2:** Wow! I wasn't expecting such a response. This has been great. In the last day since I posted this she and I have spoken a bit and here are my thoughts. She's still horrified and embarrassed by this, and as a lot of people here have suggested, she was shocked and trying to save face. ""Fuck, AFBG is gonna think I associate with jerkoffs like Douchebag, I have to convince him that I'm not that kind of person"" was how she said she felt at the time, and shock plus panic plus alcohol plus being in a situation that she won't ""get"" (South Park was right about this) meant that she handled it badly. I understand. I also get the sense she hadn't even liked Douchebag all that much (easy to see why, besides the racism he just seemed immature and like a bit of a creep) and it sounds like this was the last straw for her with his behavior. Honestly, it was a shitty situation for both of us to be in and she's apologized sincerely and listened in good faith to what I had to say. Listening is the big thing I ask of people."
To the person who said I wasn't fit to be a parent...,"Fuck you! Just because I bought my sister shorts and a tank top along with a candy bar doesn't mean I'm a bad parent to my sister. You were staring and I asked ""can I help you""...and you said ""I just don't think a fit parent would be buying those things for their child. And you look way too young to have a daughter that age."" Well lady YES I am too young. My parents died this year and I've had to drop almost everything to raise my sister. I work 2 jobs now, one during the week and one during the weekend. I keep my sister fed, clothed and happy. We've had each other's back during this hard time! Fuck your nasty comment! I'm a damn good parent to my sister!"
I finally found him.,"I know this sounds stupid and I've tried to type this out a million different ways.

This weekend, I finally let my boyfriend of a full year stay at my apartment for the first time. He's seven years older than I am. He has a career and I have a job. We're both pretty broke -- him because of student and medical debt, me because I'm 23 -- but my apartment is REALLY shitty, even for a broke girl. Like, basement-level, old carpets, shower that won't ever look clean. For a year, I wouldn't let him stay over in my bedroom. I always stayed at his. I was honest about how much money I make, but I was also ashamed to live in such a shitty place. I love him so much and I knew in my heart of hearts that he didn't care, but my pride got in the way.

This weekend, due to extenuating circumstances, we HAD to stay at my place. When he woke up the first morning he was there, without saying a word, he began fixing a door that had been broken since I moved in. He thought I was still asleep, but I woke up when I felt him get out of bed. For a while, I just laid there and watched him struggling with this massive floor-to-ceiling closet door that had long since been off its rusted track. I'd tried innumerable times to set it right, but never could. I lived in this apartment for over a year with an ex who never tried to fix anything at all after moving into my place. I've had dates over to pick me up and even spend the night. No one had even mentioned the door.

I don't want you to think that I need someone to fix things for me, or that I love him because he does the ""manly work"" so I don't have to. There was just something about this that honestly made me cry, in a really good way.

He did it without saying a word, without waking me up, knowing he didn't have to, and never announcing it afterwards. Never tried to take any credit. He just did it because he wanted to. I've never been treated this way before. I've never felt so safe or so loved in my life. I'm sorry if this was rambling and stupid, I just... had to share with someone. I'm in love with him.

Edit: Wow, this really blew up overnight. Thanks for all of your responses. I'm glad that people were able to share in the happiness that this story brought me. I've also had some time to reflect on why that moment meant so much to me, and I think it's because the door was broken for so long I forgot it was broken at all. For those of you telling me to keep him around: don't worry, I'll try my hardest. "
I got caught in the rain this morning.,"Normally I always carry an umbrella with me, even on days when it's a perfectly cloudless, sunny day. This morning when I woke up, I saw the sun shining outside my window. It just felt like it was going to be a good day. As I picked up my backpack, my umbrella fell out of a pocket. I just told myself to forget it, that it was a perfect day out and I wouldn't need it. 

As I was walking to class, I stopped by Starbucks to get some coffee. The twenty minutes it took me to stand in line, get my coffee, and pour a packet of sugar in it, a massive, sudden thunderstorm rolled in and the rain came down in stinging sheets. There wasn't time for me to wait around for it to subside. I just said ""fuck it"" and began running as fast as I could. 

But about halfway to class, I realized there was no point in running. I was still going to get wet. And I wondered why the fuck I didn't bring my umbrella. It was so ironic to me, and as I was walking in this torrential downpour, I realized that *I was going to be okay.*

This past year has been horrific for me. My mother passed away, my boyfriend dumped me, I'm having financial troubles, and life has just been generally bad. I try to measure and prepare for every sort of major bad event that would/could possibly happen in life, but I've realized that I can't. Sometimes, people die suddenly on their way to get groceries like my mom did when her car hit a patch of ice and she skidded off the road. Or maybe you lose a scholarship and it sets you back in ways you never expected. 

Or maybe it rains when you don't think it will and you've found yourself without an umbrella. Yeah, you're going to get soaked. You're going to be drenched. Your shoes are going to be ruined, your backpack is going to be soggy, and you're going to look like you just swam laps in the Pacific, but you know what? 

It's just rain. All of this -- it's just rain. "
To the homophobic police officers that were prepared to let myself and my roommate die:,"I hate you. I fucking hate you. 

My roommate is a gay male. I, myself, am a gay male. We are both college students in our early 20's and live in a nice townhouse in a college town. We both work full-time and always keep to ourselves. We enjoy going out to bars on Saturday night with friends, getting fucked up, and occasionally puking in flowerbeds outside of Waffle House at 3am. Oh, and we also like to have sex with other men. 

Three months ago, my roommate woke me up at around 10:30am and told me that he met a guy on Grindr (a gay app, mainly used for hookups) and he was coming over. My roommate just wanted to let me know so I wasn't surprised when I saw a guy roaming around in our house. I didn't care; I was used to it. 

About 20 minutes later, I hear the doorbell, I'm still half-asleep. Then I hear a shout and the unmistakable sound of a gunshot. Instinctively, I lept out of bed and locked my door. Then I grabbed my phone, dialed 911 and went to my balcony to see if the guy had left. I heard him run up the stairs. 

It was about 25 ft. from my balcony to the ground. I jumped and broke my ankle. I ran/limped out to the street and stopped a car. The police came 5 minutes later and questioned me about what happened. My roommate was shot at point-blank range in the chest. He died twice in the ambulance. 

I told the police exactly what I just typed above. About Grindr, the hookup. I could see their faces change to disgust. One even rolled his eyes. Then he told me, ""You have to understand that it's technically your roommate's fault."" Then they asked me if I had any conflict with my roommate/would I have cause to be angry with him. Then I realized they were looking at *me* as a suspect. 

Forget the fucking messages they had on my roommate's phone of the guy coming over. Forget the obvious robbery of our house. Forget ALL of that. 

The day this happened was the day what little shred of confidence I had in the police disappeared. Not even the police, but the justice system. 

I cannot possibly tell anyone this because the culture of police officers is now ""either support them or you're a cop hater/killer.""

I heard the officers call my roommate and I a ""couple of f-gs"" living in ""Gay Times Square"" (that's what they called our housing complex). 

I heard all of their comments. Hateful, deplorable. I heard you. I will not fucking rest until I humiliate you, expose you and degrade you in the same way you did to me. 

To you, the homophobic police officers: fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I'm so fucking gay and I'm proud of that. I'm proud of my identity and you will never fucking change that. Fuck you. "
My best friend told me she's gay,Holy shit I might actually have a chance with her
To the lady who told my wife to leave me...,"Last Saturday you sat next to us at Andaman Thai Restaurant in Denton, TX.  

I noticed you staring at us for the whole time you were there.  

As you were leaving, you whispered into my wife's ear, *""You're so beautiful. You can do so much better than him.""*  

Technically I do agree with you. Luckily my wife of 14 years doesn't.  

I can only assume that you aren't into the whole viking look (long hair and full beard). But maybe you should consider that you don't know anything about who we are, or our lives together, or what we've been through together. You might consider the fact that you are a rude person. After all, you were a complete stranger."
I threw up on his penis......... mid-blowjob,"Omg...... we were Netflix and chilling and I was giving my fuck buddy some head. I was in the mood I was feeling my self thinking that I was giving some good head. He kept pushing down on my head and I was using no hands and all the sudden I vomited. I have never been so embarrassed in my life, all I could say was I’m sorry and I was so disgusted with myself and all he said was “it was some good head though”. "
The world lost a ray of sunshine last night,"My grandmother was a beautiful woman, inside and out. She grew up in a world where women were told to sit down, shut up, and be the homemakers. You know what she did? She went to college in the 50s. My grandma, who was as poor as dirt, went to college. My grandma, who's father made her pay her way through *high school* because he believed women shouldn't be educated, went to *college* when the world was against her. 

She was cheering me on when no one else was, she paid for me to get my Phlebotomy certificate because she always said that education is the most important thing for a woman to have. She taught me how to do long division when I was a kid because my mom struggled with math and couldn't teach me. She shared her liver and onions meal with me when I was a toddler and last week shared her plate of strawberries with me. 22 years old and I was still eating off her plate.

She never ever ever ever let anyone go hungry. If all she had was half a bowl of beans, that hungry person was getting half a bowl of beans and a seat at the dinner table with the family. It could've been anyone from her siblings to the homeless man that slept in the gutter down the road, all they had to do was knock and ask for a meal.

She was the poster child for making the world a better place. She was 85 and not jaded by the world but instead hopeful for it's ability to be improved with love and compassion. Everyone could learn something from her."
Having a disabled kid has made me a believer in eugenics.,"If I dared to say this outloud, people would think I am this heartless monster.......but I actually think there are merits in eugenics with the severely severely handicapped. I'm not the second coming of Hitler or anything. I'm not talking about euthanasia for mild disabilities, like a missing limb or even conditions such as high functioning autism where treatment can substantially improve the person's quality of life. I'm talking about cases where the person is basically little more than a drooling vegetable with no hope for recovery.

Like my kid with severe low functioning autism, an underdeveloped brain and a heart defect.

My kid is basically a drooling 10 year old vegetable who wails day and night unless asleep and will never recover.
And to be brutally honest, keeping him alive just so we can say 'we are a better society than one that kills its disabled' is just......pointless to me? He lives in a care facility (the polite word for institution) because he needs round the clock supervised medical care and expensive machines to breathe and he'll literally never function above the level of a 1 month old infant. Thankfully I live in a country where we have excellent healthcare largely funded by the government and our contribution is a nominal couple of hundred Euros a month.

I sound harsh but I don't even feel anything for him because he is literally incapable of bonding with anyone. So like. How am I meant to feel love? He's literally just a very overweight vegetable (because he can't walk, all he can work out is kicking, punching and biting) who can't do anything but lie in bed hooked up to machines, and bathing him takes nurses over an hour. He kicks them, punches them, screams at them too. He is a drooling 10 year old vegetable who has literally no understanding of anything or anyone. What's even the point? All this taxpayer money being spent on medication, nurses, doctors, machines, maintaining the facility etc etc. It's a fucking waste. He'll never get better, he'll never be even remotely independent. If we knew this was the case before he was born (like how you can tell with many conditions), we'd have had an abortion, but once they are here, there is this expectation we have to keep them alive no mater what. It's so fucking stupid.

There is literally no point keeping this child alive. As brutal as I sound, it is one huge waste of resources and money on someone who will never ever be able to do even the most basic thing for himself, let alone contribute to society. It is a pointless drain on resources.

If I had the option, I'd tell them to unplug the machines, give a lethal injection and let him painlessly die. I honestly think it would be better for everyone - he is put out of his misery (his constant machines and heart surgeries are painful to him, he doesn't understand shit, he just knows it hurts), we can basically 'mourn and move on', which is hard to do with this....limbo situation where he is kept alive just for the fuck of it in an institution where we rarely visit because....well, what is there to do other than just looking at him, the nurses/doctors who can for him can be freed up to work with children with conditions that can be helped or even children with terminal conditions who have cognitive understanding, the building could be used as a library or something, and the fuck on of money spent to keep him alive could be put into the school system or redistributed for children's health services for kids that can be helped in some way. It just feels like a colossal waste of money and resources to literally keep a vegetable alive on machines.

We have a DNR for him, and as horrible as I sound, I keep hoping he just dies already. He's basically dead already, just kept technically alive with a machine and keeping us in limbo.
And this sounds selfish, but the 350 Euros my wife and I pay a month to contribute to his care? I get that I made the kid and need some responsibility, but at the same time......that money could be used to improve the quality of life for our two other neurotypical children who will grow up one day to contribute to society. I have a 12 year old daughter who really wants to learn Spanish - with that money, we could get her lessons. It feels like a better use of resources to develop her intelligence and skills when she will one day be able to work and pay taxes and actually understands being alive. My 12 year old son (they are twins) loves and enjoys football, that money could pay for a football camp for him - he'd actually understand it, enjoy it, have fun. Yet the money gets pissed against the wall to keep a vegetable who understands nothing alive.

Honestly, eugenics might be looked down upon, but when you have people who will always be vegetables, or will never be more than a toddler in an adult's body....maybe it can be for the best.
You have to remember that in many of these cases, that very low functioning autistic toddler you see now having a meltdown and is kicking the parent restraining him will one day potentially be a 30 year old 6'4 man having a meltdown and lashing out violently........where does that leave his 75 year old 5'7 mother? Getting punched in the face and knocked out trying to shower the kid? People are quick to talk about THE CHILDREN, but very rarely consider what happens when these people are no longer cute looking kids but grown ass adults with the mind of a baby/toddler and pose very real physical threats to their families.

I know I sound like an asshole, but honestly, I think it is time to discuss eugenics and to acknowledge that sometimes, keeping someone severely handicapped alive is pointless and a massive drain on society.

Just to make this clear to people reading who do have a mental or physical handicap - if you can read this, I'm not talking about you. I'm talking about instances where the person will never ever have cognitive abilities and be able to understand their own name, not someone in a wheelchair or someone with aspergers. If you can read and type, you are way way WAY more better off than the level of disabled I am talking about. I am talking about ""vegetables""/""permanent 6 month olds"" here."
My wife just told me that my 3yr old son was sobbing in the living room looking at my pictures.,"This is my third day in the middle of a 66hr work week. When I left for work this morning all I wanted to do was cuddle up with my kids, something just felt like I needed to but I didn't want to wake either if them up. My wife called me and told me about what my son did and my heart is broken. If ever there was a reason to quit my job and stay at home, it's so that my kids could spend more time with their Daddy. I'm not afraid of work or doing what needs to be done but to be honest, work can go F**k itself, I just want to play with my kids. That's all.

EDIT: Should have said this sooner, but my wife also works full time with the same company but in a different department. She was getting the kids ready to take to the sitters for the day and called me after she dropped them off. The two of us have great communication and don't hide things from each other, you know like how relationships should be. I couldn't make it through life without her."
The boy I married 3 weeks ago,"I love him so much. 
And he’s my husband. **My husband**

It feels so strange writing it out. 
"
"My dad, a marathon runner and expert skier, was diagnosed with ALS about three years ago. He battled like a champion for as long as he could, but in the end he took his own life after months of being confined to a wheelchair. I miss him very much.","The suicide was not spontaneous. My brother and I talked with him about it in great detail. Neither of us have any illusions about life - we are finite beings - and neither of us wanted to see him become a vegetable, either. Once diagnosed, my dad would half-jokingly say, ""As soon as I can't wipe my own ass, I'm outta here."" 

We all knew it would happen eventually. I was away at college for most of this, but I had my fair share of heartbreaking experiences watching him struggle to move, watching him sob while crawling up the stairs, lifting one leg after the other and refusing to let me help him. I watched him break. But I also watched him pull himself together, and he was at peace with it in the end. 

He died painlessly; he got this sort of ""dome"" that goes over your head but doesn't create a perfect seal, and hooked it up to a tank of helium. Turned the valve, fell asleep, and passed away. I can almost imagine him chuckling a high pitched helium chuckle as he drifted away from this painful world. 

He told me he would tell me when he was going to do it. I expected a call, even just a text so that I could say one final goodbye. I had gotten my goodbye hugs and tears before I had left for school that year, but I wanted that last goodbye. 

He didn't call me. I'm not angry about, I don't blame him at all. He raised me right and he knew I'd be okay. But it still makes me sad. I just wish I could hear his voice one more time. 

The crazy part, and some of you might not believe me but I don't really care, but the crazy part is that I knew when he died. I literally felt it. I was walking home from class on a sunny day, thinking about preparations for the concert I was going to see that night when PANG! My steps faltered a little and my mind was flooded with a sense of urgency and pain and a myriad of memories that flickered by too quickly to comprehend. But I knew. I didn't want to know, I told myself everything was fine and it was just my anxiety, but I knew. 

Three hours later I got the call from my younger brother, who had been with him through all the months of struggle while I was at school. I will always look up to him. 

With tears in his voice he told me what I already knew, and I sank to the ground and wept harder than I thought was possible. 

---

If you took the time to read this, thank you. But please don't be sad. He was an amazing man and he is off somewhere in a better place, and his family is here to be his legacy. I just needed to write about it. It helps me to cry sometimes. 

I miss not being able to call him when I have questions or when I need advice, but it's okay because papa didn't raise no fool and he taught me how to be my own man, make my own decisions, and live with the consequences. I like to think he'd be proud of me, even if I do still drink too much (college, whatcha gonna do?)

Rest In Peace, Old Man. I love you.

Edit: this got way more attention than I ever anticipated. I'm completely blown away and humbled by all the kind words and wishes. Thank you all so much, you are all amazing. To those of you that shared bits of your own stories, stay strong and never lose faith in yourself. 

I'm truly at a loss for words. Blessings to all. May the stars shine brightly upon you and may Peace forever reign in your hearts. "
"It isn't healthy to say these things in a marriage, so I am going to say it here",I told you so. I told you so. I told you so. I told you so.
My infant son died,"Edit: Thank you all for your kind words.  Someone has given me gold and it feels very weird, but thank you.


Hi, I'm very new here, but not to reddit.  I've heard about this subreddit quite a few times and that it was a good place to go for this sort of thing, so here I am.


Early this year, I had my second child, my son Isaac.  He was beautiful and healthy, he even scored nines both times they gave him the apgar test.  My whole family was overjoyed, and my SO and I were (and are) very happy and grateful for him.

A month later, he suddenly died in his sleep.  His father was working the night shift.  It was the first night he slept in his crib.  I changed and fed him, snuggled him to sleep, and laid him down.  I went about my evening, our other child was already asleep.  I made and ate dinner, I showered, I even messed around on the internet.  I started to watch netflix... and I started to worry.  It had been two hours, and my little guy was a good eater.  He would wake up every two hours to eat, without prompt, without fail.  But I ignored my instincts.  It was time for him to learn to sleep alone.  It was time for me to not hold him every second.  I was doing exactly what everyone says to do to avoid SIDS.  A firm mattress in a crib, no smoking, no drinking, no medications, wrapped tightly but not too warmly.  

Not fifteen minutes later, the urge to check on him was too great.  So I went into his room.  It was quiet... silent.  I knew then, I think.  I went to him, touched him, and he was already cold.  Not breathing.  I called his name, I wiggled him around, I panicked.  I unwrapped him and pinched his leg.  I called 911.  

Have you ever called 911?  I have, before, for someone passed out on the side of the road.  It's almost frustrating how calm and collected the dispatcher is, although I know it's best that they are.  It seems an eternity to tell them your address, what your emergency is.  But as soon as you say ""My baby's not breathing""...  I could hear her panic too.  

She told me how to do infant CPR, and I carried on for... forever.  Pink foam came out of his nose during chest compressions.  I knew he was dead, I already knew.  I wanted to lay down and die with him.  

Fire rescue got there first, they're less than a mile away.  But it was too late, and even they seemed to know, because they walked down the hallway so slowly.  They ushered me out of the way, but it was the police that had to make me leave the room.

I called his father, unable to say the whole truth.  I told him I had to call an ambulance.  The police asked for my information, they took things from Isaac's room.  His sheet, his swaddling blanket.  Packaging from diapers too, I think.  Covering their bases, but I wanted to poor acid on them because of the implications.  

We drove to the hospital with our daughter strapped in her carseat, blissfully unaware.  My SO kept reassuring me that Isaac was going to be okay.  Later on he admitted that he knew too, but he couldn't say so because then we'd never make it to the hospital.  It was almost midnight, I think.  We had to park a few buildings over because we didn't know the area well enough, and it was cold outside.

We made it to the front desk of the emergency room, and when the lady figured out who we were, she showed us a small private room with couches and a door, because 'no one can go back there yet.'

I won't lie, I completely lost my shit.  I knew, I knew, I knew.  And I screamed and shouted it, sobbing, uncontrollable.  I knew then terror, emptiness, and rage all at once.  I still know it.  

After awhile a nice lady with a clipboard and a chaplin with a lavender file came in to tell us that they were very sorry, and that the EMTs and doctors did every single thing they could, but our son was dead.  It was my turn to be stoic while his father cried.  We asked to see him.

He was in a room with a closed curtain, wrapped in white linen on a full sized bed.  He had a plastic tube sticking out of his mouth.  I hadn't realized how red his hair was turning.  He didn't look as blue as before.  He was sort of pink and they must have warmed him up, because when I held him for the very last time, it was as if he was sleeping.

I loved my son.  I loved my baby.  We took care of him and did everything we could for him.  He was wanted and well cared for and nothing, no one will ever replace him.  I still dream of him, of his little feet and his skinny little butt and how he tried to grip my hand when I fed him.  I miss him more than anything in the whole world.  I've had terrible things happen to me that I've never told anyone about, terrible pain, but no pain has ever or will ever come close to losing my sweet baby boy.  I'd do anything to have him back.

Thank you for reading this.  I just needed to talk about it.  I can't say I feel better right now, but maybe later."
My friend has a dog,"I can’t tell anyone this, but I have to tell somebody this. One of my guy friends, who is like 6’4” and giant, has this little dog that he really loves. He works from home so the two of them are rarely separated for long. He is your standard dominant sort of guy who does not get emotional or anything, so the bond between this hardcase dude and this timid, sweet little dog is already strange and adorable. 


Anyway, the other day him and his girlfriend are on a flight home from vacation, and he is super drunk with his headphones on. Girlfriend looks over and sees that he is crying. She asks him what’s up and he tells her he’s listening to this really sad song about someone getting a puppy and then the dog dying. So she is all “awww, it’s okay” and pulls one of the earphones out of his ear, to listen to what’s playing. She’s expecting some Sarah Mclachlan/Celine Dion hybrid heartbreak ballad that should play on a Humane Society commercial. But no. It’s a Mr Bungle song. This giant drunk dude is sitting in an airplane seat, sobbing to carnival music. She somehow manages to hold in her laughter, gives him a hug, tells him it’s okay, his dog is okay, and that they’ll be home soon. An hour later she looks back up from her laptop and he is once again bawling. It’s the same song. He has had the song on repeat for over an hour, just crying. He tells her he’s never leaving his dog behind again. 


She told me this in confidence and now I can’t go over to their house because I cannot stop laughing. If I see him I will not be able to hold my shit together. Dude just really loves his dog. 
"
I [22/F] just broke up with my cheating boyfriend [24/M] of 3.5 years in the most satisfying way.,"So I know this isn't THAT dramatic, but I just wanted to share.

I met my boyfriend in my very first semester of college, we started dating. We're both Japanese-Americans that came back to Japan for university, and have been living together in Tokyo for the past year.

The trouble I think started when we decided to stay in Japan for a few years after graduation and began job-hunting, which in Japan starts at the beginning of senior year. I managed to land my dream job at a major IT company and had lots of options, while he (most likely b/c of his grades) wasn't able to get any of the jobs he wanted and became stuck accepting a job he didn't really want. At first I was supportive, even when he was resentful and lashed out at me and started drinking more, going out more with his friends, etc. I kept encouraging him to go to his part-time jobs but he'd ditch, and he eventually got fired, so that I had to start paying about 80% of the rent.

I suspected he was cheating on me when I got home from my part-time job and found hairs that looked longer than mine all clogged up in the shower, and also that my bottle of perfume I always kept on the top shelf was moved onto the sink, and also looked like it'd been used while I was gone. Over the course of the next few weeks, I discovered other signs. I was so angry at this point, I'd tried everything I could to support him, worked longer hours to pay the rent, tried to comfort him, help him with applications, that I just waited until I was sure it was happening, and when, and didn't say anything.

I made arrangements to move in with my brother who also lives in Tokyo, and who happened to need a roommate. I slowly moved a lot of my things to his place, not the furniture, just clothing, etc. I quit my English school part-time job b/c my bf sometimes worked there. I threw away all the things he's gotten me in the past. I went into his laptop while he wasn't home and deleted anything and everything I could find related to myself: playlists, pictures on Facebook, pictures in general, games I'd gotten him, etc.

Then, today, I blocked him on all my social media accounts, and came back in the middle of when I was supposed to be working my 1 ~ 9pm part-time job at a restaurant. Sure enough, I hear a girl laughing inside, a freshman girl (probably like 17 years old) we both knew from a class. They were in bed together and at first they didn't seem to realize what was happening. I announced that I was only here to pick up the backpack that was the only thing I had left to move into my new place, that he could have all the furniture we bought together b/c it was too much of a hassle to take it with me, that I'd deleted myself from everything on his computer, that I never wanted to talk to him again, and threw him an envelope containing three months of 80% rent money so he could pull his shit together even if he couldn't find a new roommate. Girl is hiding underneath the blanket this whole time. At this point he looked like he was gonna cry and started blubbering about how she was just a distraction and really he was just sad and lonely because I wasn't giving him enough attention. I just said, ""I'm working my ass off every day to pay the rent so you can have time to fuck other people and go drinking and YOU'RE the one that's sad and lonely?"" and left.

Right now I'm sitting at my brother's place which is actually way cushier than my old place, having drinks with him and his friends, supremely glad and feeling refreshed that I got out of that mess.

**TL;DR**: Boyfriend's fragile ego couldn't handle my getting a job much ""better"" than his, he throws prolonged temper tantrum, I plot silently on how to leave him and eventually do."
My deceased uncle's passwords...,"My wife's uncle passed away last week, and my IT skills were called for to get access to his phone and laptop, in order to get info about his financial affairs. I found a popular password program on his laptop, which will be very helpful to us.  And...also found credentials to a popular free porn site.  Being a good nephew and not wanting to cause my wife and her mom (uncle's sister) distress if they found the account, I deleted the entry. And removed it from deleted history. Secret is safe with me, but had to tell someone.

EDIT - Ok so this kinda blew up...of course it's on a throwaway lol. Thanks everyone for the comments. Just to clarify, the saved credentials were not in the browser. Browser was clean with no history. Instead, he'd used Lastpass, saving probably 100 various web credentials. Amazingly, neither Lastpass or the phone were password-protected.

Site was xvideos btw, and he had a free account, so the credentials don't really benefit me. Additionally, I try valiantly, not always successfully, to stay away from the stuff - it does negatively impact one's marriage, I found."
The last day I spent with my wife and daughter before my wife was killed by a drunk driver.,"I can't sleep. Today's therapy session is sticking with me. I miss my wife so much. I'm just laying here alone and praying and wishing she'd walk through the bedroom door. 

I know this will never happen, but I'd give anything for it. 

But I'd like to just talk about her for a minute because talking about her has been helping me to feel better.

The day before my wife was killed by a drunk driver was a day I'd have forgotten about had the events of the next day never happened. But now that day is cemented in my mind.

It was a lazy day. School was out for our daughter and my wife and I both took the day off just to relax and decompress. We got up around 9 that morning and I made oatmeal and turkey bacon for my wife and daughter. I've always had trouble eating in the morning. It makes my stomach hurt for some reason.

So I cooked for them and sat with them while they ate. Maybe I'm romanticizing it because it was my last day with her but I remember her looking so immaculate. She was so beautiful. Long, thick brown hair, big hazel eyes, olive skin, and the cutest freckles. She'd taken our daughter to get their nails done the weekend before and I remember noticing how good her hands and feet looked.

She had her hair up in a messy looking bun, a tank top, shorts, and her burgundy robe on. She sat with one leg on the floor and the other folded on the chair. She was saying how she was going to braid our daughter's hair later on that day because it was out of control. (My wife was extremely proud of having learned from my sister how to braid hair.) My daughter, who my wife gave the nickname ""mixed nuts"" because my wife was hilarious, started whining because, like me, she's tender headed. The girl still jerks and twitches when she brushes her own hair.

My wife joked and said that she was going to tame our daughters hair before she brought another mixed child into this world. After breakfast our daughter, Jasmine, and my wife, Angela, went to go get dressed for the day, but Angela ended up deciding to comb Jasmine's hair so it would be easier to braid later on in the day.

You may as well have told Jasmine she was going to fight at Stalingrad. Then the battle between squirming daughter and determined mother ensued. Angela had learned well from my sister and immediately locked jasmine into place using her legs to wrap around her waist while they both sat on the floor- a veteran move. 

Jasmine knew she couldn't move ebeough to effectively deter her mother from combing her hair, so she came up with another, equally effective strategy. Cry for ""daddy"".

Now, I'm an idiot. Because my daughter stopped saying ""daddy"" and started saying ""dad"" around the time she was 5.5 years old. But she'd also learned that doing that made me putty in her palm. 

So she starts lightly whining for me. And, again, Angela is hilarious. ""Your father is not going to save you from a well combed head, Jasmine. Just tap out right now. You're not getting out of this."" 

But I knew Angela well. A little bit of laughter and an appeal to her logic was enough to end Jasmine' torment, or at least put it off til later. Afterall, no need to comb the hair now when you're not gonna braid it until the afternoon. 

I still laugh when I think my back to the devious little grin jasmine had on her face as her mother released her from the leg vice grip. That little girl knew exactly what she was doing. 

So we all got dressed and went off to run some errands together. It's kind of strange to look back on my life. Since I was a kid I always had a searing hate for running errands, but it was probably one of my favorite things to do with my family. Even today I love a trip to the grocery store with Jasmine. 

We went to pick up the stuff for Angela to braid Jasmine's hair and then to the mall to buy some new shoes and pants for Jasmine since she was outgrowing her old clothes. 

Angela looked awesome that day. She had on a nice long sleeved blue shirt, gray yoga pants and ugg boots. I'm a fan of the way she dressed. Plus she was really fit so everything just fell on her very well.

So we went to the stores for my daughter and our $200 budget turned into a $500 shopping spree. Angela insisted she got a deal on everything. 

Then we walked past Victoria Secret and my wife went in to buy some underwear and a few bras. I never let my daughter go into that store. Little girls go in and grown women come out. It's like an on-the-go Bat mitva without all the old testament laws. Nuh uh. Not yet....anyway...

After we left the mall we went to get lunch at Jimmie Johns. Angela ordered a number 9 no onion which was weird because she likes onions. 

Once we left there we went to the grocery store and we always had a great time at the grocery store. Idk what it was. Maybe because we never had a lost and just bought whatever we saw that we wanted or maybe it was just because we were together but some of my fondest memories of our family are in grocery stores.

From the grocery store, we went home. And Angela had her eyes set on braiding Jasmine's hair. Jasmine pulled the ol' ""I have to go poop"" and then sat in the bathroom for an hour hoping her mom would forget. 

Angela sat Indian style outside the bathroom door with a comb and the Bobby pins sprawled out in front of her on the floor. She kept asking in the most gentle and set voice ""you okay in there, mixed nuts?""

Jasmine realized her plan wasn't working and said she'd be out in a second. Angela told her to take her time. I can't really explain but the way she said that was hilarious to me. I was laughing out loud. Angela had some of the best comedic delivery.

Sort key thereafter Jasmine came out if the bathroom and the battle for scalp supremacy ensued. It was a war of attrition. For every braid Angela completed, Jasmine would lean iver in a different direction forcing Angela to bend with her. 

It was really something to see how focused Angela was. She was zoned in on those braids. 

Eventually, Angela finished and she did a great job. Jasmine really looked beautiful witb her hair braided like that. It really made her eyes ""pop"" and it was really flattering to the shape of her face. We took some pictures to put on face book and then sent Jasmine off to bed. 

I gave Angela a massage because I knew her back must have been hurting from trying to keep up with jasmine. This is probably jy most cherished memory. She laid face down on our bed and I sat next to her and massaged her back for about an hour and we just talked about nothing. 

We laughed and enjoyed each others company. I distinctly remember thinking to myself that I absolutely married the right woman. I couldn't have been happier. We talked about having another baby. She said that it better be a boy so that she could just cut his hair off and be done with it. 

She showed me some funny youtube videos and told me about what she was doing at work. It was just a night spent with my bestfriend. I miss her.

After the message we went and took a shower, prayed together and then got in bed. We cuddled up against each other and briefly talked about making plans for a vacation before we both drifted off to sleep. 

I woke up at 5am the next morning. Her alarm went off to wake her up so she could go for her jog. I went back to sleep while she got dressed and just before she left she came and kissed me and told me she loved me. 

This wasn't out of the norm because she always told me that but she usually didn't stop to do it before a jog. After she kissed me she just looked at me for a few seconds and smiled at me. She was my wife and that smile still gave me butterflies. She got up and walked out the door. Said she'd see me later.

A few hours later I was about to call the police because she hadn't come back and she wasn't answering her phone. And before I could call them they knocked on my door.


**Edit: Guys I should have made it clear in this post that this all happened 5 years ago. I'm just beginning to go through a healthy grieving process in therapy and I just felt the need to talk/write about my wife and that day lastnight. Sorry for any confusion as it wasn't my intention to deceive you folks.**"
I got all A on my last semester.,"I have no one to tell. Thanks for reading. 

It's a big thing for me.

Edit: Holy crap. Thanks guys!!"
I murdered my cousin's friend when I was 16.,"When I was 16 years old, I walked into my household around midnight  to hear shouts of agony and misery, my cousin was screaming at the top of her lungs for help and to call the police.

I run up to her room and see her mascara drenched face contorted with her eyes bulging out as she shrieked at the top of her lungs "" HE'S FUCKING RAPING ME THROWAWAYXXXGSA, HELP!!!!!""

Not even truly understanding what was going on, I ran up to him and started choking him out with the most pure anger i've ever felt inside me.

There was a struggle, and he punched me a few times but I kept my hands there until he fell to the ground, lifeless.

Called my parents,  called the police. Charges were never filed, it was ruled self defense.

I've bounced around since then, therapy hasn't helped, I still see her face screaming everynight.

I should be happy, my professional fighting debut was last week and I won by TKO. The anger flew into my soul that day and never left.


My cousin committed  suicide 10 months later later. She was like a sister, and lived with us for years. She was the kindest person i've ever met, it was the first and last time I ever heard her scream or curse.


Only 3 people know about this.

My disabled 2 year old sat up for the first time today!,"Today is 9/11. For some it's a day of mourning, for others a day of self reflection. For me 9/11 is a day of triumph- because on 9/11/2013 my child who we were told was not going to survive through his first week. My child who we were told was going to be a vegetable. My child who we were told would never be able to feed himself (and does). My child who is all his meeting cognitive developmental milestones. My child who we were told would never walk (and does with assistance)- my Ian triumphed again, this morning as I was getting ready for work, I look over at the crib, and there Ian is pushing himself up into a sitting position. Ian sat up today all by himself and I'm so proud of him!

"Today, I made a difficult decision that may have changed my life.",I got paid today and I could have bought drugs. I sat on my bed for a minute and thought about it. I have a history with drugs but got off of them. Today I chose a different life path.
"I'm a straight dude, but I just cried over the SCOTUS decision, when a close friend became immediately engaged.","In a former life, before becoming an ardent atheist, I was a Pentecostal Christian.  One of my closest friends from those days was a girl (we'll call her Karen).  Karen's family left the church for another church, and we didn't see or speak for a while.  Then I got out of religion altogether.  

Later, I found her on FB and she had changed a LOT.  Buzzed haircut (from Pentecostal hair, which isn't to be cut), wearing guys' shirts, and ""in a relationship"" with a girl that looked just like her.  I was so happy for Karen.  We haven't hung out, but for the past couple years, we're close online, etc.  I've been telling her to go to NM and get married if she wants (we live in TX) and it'll eventually be legal, but she just held on.  

This morning, right after hearing the news, I logged on to FB and saw that they had changed their status to ""engaged"", and I couldn't hold it in.  

Beyond happy right now.  

Edit:  I asked Karen how it all happened, and she said, ""We just became officially engaged today, no proposal or anything.  But we've wanted to get married for 10 years.""  TEN YEARS!"
i asked for a girls number at the school bookstore.,"so... about four months ago I went to my college orientation to get a feel for the campus and all that. some time in the middle of it I notice this girl, brown hair, really nice smile, really nice everything. As the day goes on the orientation groups break off to attend optional meetings. I go to one of them, and then they give us the option to skip the next and go to the bookstore. Since I wasn't really too interested in the meeting topics I chose to go to the bookstore and kill some time. while Im there looking through racks of tacky college t-shirts I can't help but notice some eyes on me. As I look up to see who it is, of course, it is no one else but the girl. I swear to you, when I looked in her face the first time it was like the the sun was shoved in my face... so bright. I was baffled, honestly. She's beautiful, and I feel like I have known her forever.
I told myself that if I did not get her number, I would be kicking myself the whole way home, and probably a little bit longer after that.
long story short: I did. I was intimidated, but I did it.

even better: a few weeks after hanging out when college started, we took off on a whim to NYC and spent 36 hours exploring the city before scrambling back home. also, I have gotten so used to sleeping with her that sleeping alone now feels foreign. this is so crazy. i am so happy. "
To the man I rear-ended in traffic last night..,"I know I was at fault. It was rush hour. You stopped suddenly and I didn't notice because I was looking at the on-coming traffic at the yield sign. I got out and offered you all of my information to take. You looked at your car; there were some scratches. 

But you said ""Don't worry about it, it's the holidays. Your insurance will go up if we report it. Just drive safely.""

It was my first ever accident. I know this wasn't proper protocol, and I don't know if this will bite me in the butt or not, but your kindness is truly appreciated. Thank you so much.

Edit: Holy shit, this blew up. Thanks for all your interesting, rear-ending stories, reddit!
"
My boyfriend died yesterday and I feel nothing.,"And I don't mean ""I feel nothing"" in the sense that I'm numb with grief; I mean that I feel nothing in the sense that after I got the phone call that his car was crushed under a semi-truck, and that after the doctor walked up to me with a sagging face and said, ""We did everything we could..."", I still feel nothing. It's almost as if I don't care. Actually, I don't think I do. 

Do I feel bad about this? Eh. 

I dated him for two years. The first six months were sublime; we were both fresh out of college and had met at work. I knew I loved him. But then he began to show his ""true"" self. After about a year of dating, he told me that I was not allowed to ever have kids (because he didn't like them), I was not allowed to see my brother (because he was gay and he didn't like ""gays""), and he sometimes beat me. I say ""beat"" making it sound like he almost mangled me, but it was usually just a slap in the face or a kick in the stomach. 

I broke up with him a few times over the last 2 years. I always brought my brother over to say ""fuck you"" to him (my boyfriend). He realized that I wasn't going to listen to him. But I still stayed with that piece of shit. I don't know why. He was violent and disgusting and smoked weed more than he breathed in air. He couldn't hold down a job. I hated him. I was about to end it last week, but then he died. 

I really don't care. His mother called me, sobbing and distraught, and I did my best to comfort her while watching Scandal on Netflix. God, I love Kerry Washington so much. If you haven't watched the show, you totally should! 

Anyway... yeah. I have to go to a bunch of family shit tomorrow. His family. I haven't even told my parents yet that he died. No one really liked him, including my friends. I know this is disgusting and awful, and most of you are probably thinking, ""Wow, she's a disgusting bitch."" And I'm sorry you think that. 

But oh well. Thanks for listening. "
I didn't want to have sex tonight....,"....but my boy did. I don't know why I'm not feeling it, normally I love having sex with him. But my stomachs upset, my head hurts....just not in the mood.

But I was going to clench my teeth and do it anyway. Because that is what *you* beat into me. You're the one who always made sure I knew that if I didn't put out, men had no use for me. If I told *you* no, you'd beg and plead, and then you would get mad. You'd throw things across the room, you'd call me terrible things, and if I still turned it down, you'd just hold me down and take it anyway.

You trained me like Pavlov. I never say no to sex, not until tonight. Because I *knew* if I didn't give it up, it would be taken anyway. 

And now I'm with my darling sweet boy. I've never told him no, either, because he is the best thing that happened to me, and I couldn't bear the thought of him deciding I wasn't worth anything when I don't spread my legs and bite my tongue.

Until tonight. I laid down, opened up, and he just looked at me. He said I didn't look like I really wanted to do it. I told him I didn't and held my breath. And then he said ""Oh, well I'm going to go play some games then, let me know if you need anything. *Love you!*"" And that was that.

I guess you were wrong."
Didn't expected the womans march to be so heart breaking.,"Today, I went to woman march and had a great time. Although my city is fairly small, it is tightly knitted and surprisingly large number of people showed up. It was a great atmosphere that leave me feeling proud of my city. 

I was still overwhelmed with joy as I stepped into a cupcake shop to grab a cupcake and coffee. Just as I start to browse the selection, I saw someone stepped in. I turned to look at them. There was a older man (I'd say late 40s or early 50s) carrying a folded up signs and two girls around age of 10ish or so. 

I can tell right off that they were from a lower income family. The girls have on what is obviously a second handed clothes. The man have on clothes as if he was trying to look his best, but it look like a cheap good clothes that is rather outdated and a worn out jacket. 

The girls looked like as if they were at Disneyland. It was clear they were really excited about the whole cupcake store. 

It suddenly hit me that they are standing for the girls' future and well being so they don't have to be in the situation they currently are in. 

Have grew up in poverty, I knew how rough it was. I quickly ordered a coffee and pushed a $20 bill into worker's hand and told her to use it to pay off whatever those people want and use rest for tips. I then grabbed my coffee and walked out as I don't like attention or wanted any. I then paused outside of the door to make sure that they got the treats at my expense instead of the worker secretly pocketing the change. 

The man's face shown that he was surprised. Before he could look for me, I stepped away as my eyes welled up with tears. All I could think of is how many people live in similar situation as they does. The girls probably know they aren't as well off but just doesn't and cannot quite understand why yet but are more than willing to work hard for a better life and have a great hope for the future. 

The man probably was hoping that those two girls would be inspired by the march and see that women can do whatever they want and those girls would go on to make something of themselves. "
I have practically zero friends.,"Here I am sitting in my college dorm while my roomate is out at a club and here I am sitting alone with no one to talk to. I feel like i can't make friends and I don't really know how. I have a girlfriend and she loves me tons and I love her back but sometimes it feels like I am lonely and I don't know what to do about it.

Edit: Wow guys this blew up! Thanks for all your responses, you're awesome! "
Met a New Girl,"We went on a date. Our second date to be exact. I took her to the top of this hill that I like to watch the sunset on. Usually I get fast food and a drink from the gas station and head on up. While I was in the gas station I thought that maybe she'd want a chocolate bar, she mentioned that she likes chocolate. So I grabbed it and paid for it and when I came back to the car she thought it was super cute that I had thought of her. Then it happened...

""this has nuts""

Fuck. She hates nuts. I knew she hated nuts. I wasn't paying attention because I was trying to rush back to the car. I could go back in and buy her another one without nuts. I should probably do that. I'm dumb and an idiot for not paying attention. Then it happened...

""Aw it's ok, I can just eat around them""

And this wave of relief washed over me. Not only was she grateful. She didn't even yell at me or belittle me. It was the most wonderful feeling I've ever felt. A huge weight lifted off my shoulders.

I finally realized that I was in an abusive relationship before this and I'm glad I had the strength to get out. I could never admit that I was in an abusive relationship because I'm a guy, but fuck that. I know better now."
CHURCHES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY TAXES.,"I understand that we have a separation of church and state in our country, but I think all churches should have to pay taxes. I also understand that there are a lot of members of the clergy who help others through counseling and sermons. Some may even help others in financial need. However, there are so many members of the clergy who are corrupt and are harmful to others. They all seem to live in luxury because they con members of their congregation to give up a percentage of their paychecks by calling it an “offering to God.” It’s really an offering to their bank account. The people of their congregation could be working three jobs just to make ends meet for their families, but still feel the obligation to give away their money to someone who drives a Mercedes and can afford to go on extravagant vacations to exotic places. It just seems crazy to me. One more thing... 
Why do churches not believe in the separation of church and state when it comes to issues like abortion? They feel comfortable condemning people for having them, and then give a sermon on not judging others on Sunday. It just seems incredibly hypocritical on so many levels. "
I finally pleased my girlfriend,"So last night I (19 M) was in bed with my girlfriend (20 F), we’ve been together for a few months. 

I’ve not done anything sexually before with anyone before getting with her, and it was getting me down for ages that i never made her climax, but obviously she could do it to me. 

But last night i finally did it, she was so happy afterwards and it was a huge relief for me. It wasn’t as tough as i had thought in my head but now i know what to do i feel so much better. 

Might sound fucking dumb but it was really getting to me that i couldn’t 

That’s all, cheers "
I'm sick of hearing my 16 year old sister having sex in the room next to me.,"When I was 16 my mom was under the impression I was smoking weed and hiding secrets from her and no one trusted me or even believed what I had to say. 

Now you're telling me it's ok for your 16 year old daughter to fucking have her boyfriend sleep over(fuck) literally every night, shower together, have weed-booze bonfire parties in your fucking backyard, drive your car(while probably wasted) and you're the fucking one buying them the booze????

You know what was happening when I was 16? I got yelled at for being on the internet too much. Thank god I'm only here for 3 more weeks. I've had enough of this bullshit let me tell you. When I move into my new house you can all suck a fucking dick. "
Finding friends as an adult is brutal,"Oh sure, you've got work friends, who you never speak to again (even though you swear you will) when one of you gets a new job. You've got the ""former partner"" friends that leave when the relationship ends. Maybe a couple of ""parent"" friends if you have kids with whom your primary bonding is over your children. But finding another adult for whom none of those things apply AND you live close enough to hang out AND you have shared interests AND you don't dislike their partner AND your schedules match well enough you can socialize is brutal.

Which is why I was so glad to find a person like that five years ago. We hit it off from the start and it was awesome. She's my youngest kid's god mother, she lived with me for a while when she got divorced, we had girl's nights and cookouts, we knew that the other would pick up the phone anytime and would show up no matter what.

Until she got a new partner. We went from multiple texts a day, to one, to every other day, to once a week, to holidays. She'd swear she was busy at work or had her kids and couldn't break away, that she was run ragged and had no time to socialize, but then post photos of dinner parties or hiking trips or whatever. And I let it go. New relationships can be like that, right?

Then yesterday I get a text from her. She's gotten married. Had done it last week at the courthouse across the street from my office. I hadn't even known she'd gotten engaged. It hit me then that we're not BFF's any longer. I don't even know that we're friends. Maybe acquaintances, maybe not even that. I'm sitting here feeling (again) like the kid who didn't get invited to birthday parties, the girl who never got asked to a dance, the weird kid that was...weird and easily dropped when someone better came a long.

I'd thought that I was too old for this feeling. I thought I had out grown the need to be wanted. I thought that I was more important to her than this. But I'm not, and it sucks, and I don't have a best friend to complain to about it. I don't know that I can do this again, this dance of finding a platonic soul mate. I don't know that I even want to try."
I beat up my fraternity brother and I have zero regrets.,"My cousin and I grew up like siblings. She's the closest thing to a sister that I have and I love her dearly. She's one of my best friends.

I'm sure that you can imagine my anger and surprise when I found out that one of my fraternity brothers had been passing around creepshots of my baby cousin. It's not like my cousin had sent him nudes herself, but this creepy fuck instead decided to wait outside of her dorm and take photos of her getting dressed. And he was stupid enough to send them to other frat brothers and expect to get away with it.

It didn't take long before creepy fuck came over to the dorm to party and that's when I lost it. I told him that he could either hand his SD card over, or he could get his ass beaten. He chose the ass beating, but we made sure to take his SD card for good measure.

He didn't fuck around with a single woman again until after graduation.

**Note:** This story happened a few years ago, but I was reminded of it last night and spent all night tossing and turning. Just had to get it off my chest today before I went crazy :)"
I haven't self harmed in 50 days,"I just wanted to share the news with someone. I have self harmed for 11 years and after getting on an antipsychotic medication, the need is gone. I'm happy. Thanks for reading

EDIT: thank you everyone for the sweet comments!"
I Want to Steal my Neighbors Kids,"I'm a 19 year old college kid home for the summer. Suddenly my neighborhood has gotten an influx of families with young children. 

The situations of each is abysmal , and the kids have meltdowns about their home lives every time I'm with them. I can hear the parents yelling and screaming and cursing at all times of the day at these poor kids.

I've always loved children. Ever since I was a toddler I would take care of kids a year younger than me. I've always identified with children. 

The next door house on my left has a second grader who just failed the grade and can't read.   So I've been reading Harry Potter  to her and having her read Frog and Toad to me. She has improved greatly in just a week. She is a very smart 8 year old, she is a good listener, and I've been teaching her some basic manners and science. 

She has been exposed to sexual ideas and a young age. She admits they plague her thoughts. It's from older cousins (they were a 9 year old girl cousin who told her). She says she can't look at a boy or girl without picturing their private parts and it disgusts her. I cracked open my biology textbook and let her look at the section on human evolution. I explained that she possesses the knowledge, but not proper context and that's why it disgusts her. I told her it was innapropriate of her cousin to say that to her.

 I told her that it's better once you know these things to look at them not in an innapropriate way, but as a scientist. That breasts don't have to be sexual or disgusting, and I showed her diagrams of various mammals breast feeding their young. We then talked about cells and evolution. This all seemed to really help her. By the end of the conversation she stoped crying, and instead was interesting and engaged by the textbook. 


 Her father is in jail for heroin addiction, and she idealizeds his return in a few months even though he has relapsed several times. Her parents constantly yell at her and treat her like a burden. They also overfeed her, and she is clearly self conscious about her weight. 

I try to get her to drink water while she is at my house  (Her parents dgaf where she goes). I've yet to discover any vegetable or even fruit she enjoys.

She told me "" I wish you and your mother were my mom. Cause like my parents don't listen, they aren't polite, they don't take a moment to hear each other or me. They are always just on their phones.""

As she said this she had tears weling up, and obvious anger. I told her that the important thing is for her to learn to be a good listener herself. 
 
There are so many other things wrong with her situation, but nothing I could call the cops about. Even if i did, her extended family seems to be even worse.

I grew up homeschooled, so it was normal to have friends older than me. This really helped me become who I am today. I know she loves hanging out with an older girl, but also just spending time in a quiet and safe and clean environment. I let her try on my high heels and hats, and I do mermaid makeup on her. 

I set boundaries of course. She isn't allowed to knock unless it's an emergency, she can only come up to me if I'm outside. ( she was knocking 5+ times a day.) She has to use her indoor voice, she has to sit nicely.

 I know some people may find me to be over involved, or think I'm being intrusive.  Honestly I don't care. She doesn't have anyone else, even the other neighbor kids are mean to her because of her weight. She wanders up and down the road. If I can give her just 15 minutes of her day that is peaceful then I will. 

I just hope I'm making a difference. 

Edit: the textbook showed the following: a Darwinian evolutionary line up from ape to man and a picture of 'LUCY ' the monkey Neanderthal lady. Not the reproductive system. 

Edit 2: Of course 'steal is hyperbole. I already have a dog to look after. "
O shite on me arse,My wife is in labor and I'm nervous lol. 
I DID IT!!!,"I FUCKING DID IT!!!! I got into the IT traineeship I really wanted to get in to!! 

It feels completely surreal. I applied a few weeks ago, which was already a step for me because I had to tell myself to go for it even though it was scary.

Monday I had to do an analytical reasoning test which was really hard. When I first started practicing I completely sucked at all the types of exercises and felt like I wasn't improving at all and wanted to give up so many times, but I pushed forward, practicing every day after work and the whole weekend. It was only a week but it was super intense. When I did the test I didn't think I'd passed, but yesterday I got a call inviting me to the assessment day TODAY.

I was super nervous and scared but just tried to stay myself, and surprised myself by being really open and sociable, and feeling quite comfortable the whole time despite nerves. Half of the 8 who started the day didn't make it to the end, but at the end of the day I was one of the four who was offered a place!!

I'm just SO proud of myself. I worked my ass off, didn't give up as much as I sometimes wanted to, didn't get put off by fear or self-doubt. And it paid off!! I did it!!!

EDIT: Thank you guys SO much for the comments – and the Gold, wow!! It's so amazing and touching that people read this and wanted to reply, honestly I feel so touched (cheesy but true). Thank you!!"
My life changed completely about an hour ago,"My mom and step dad just had a huge fight. Police were called, things were broken, it got physical. They are going to get divorced. It’s inevitable. The thing is, my step dad makes a lot more money than my mom. We rely on him more than any of us are willing to admit. 

We have a house that we are renting out to his daughter that we can go back to. She still has a steady job. I remember how things were before we moved in here though. It was not good. The house won’t get cleaned, we won’t eat anything good for us, and no rules will be enforced. 

This wasn’t entirely unexpected, I’ve been fearing it basically since they got together. 

I also have a part time job, so I can contribute, but I know my mom won’t let me. I’m going to ask for more hours at work, but she probably won’t let me buy much. Maybe I can secretly restock our food or something to take the burden off.

I’m the most worried about my little brother though. He’s 13, I’m 16, and we both have a history of mental illness and stuff. He acts strong but I’m scared this might hurt him a lot more than he’ll let on. At least school is out now so it can’t interfere with other parts of our lives. 

I just need things to be stable by the time school starts again. I’ll be in grade 12 and I’m looking to go to university. I’ll need scholarships but I can’t get them if I’m busy supporting my family. I can’t drive yet either so that’s gonna be a priority now for sure. 

Thanks for reading, I just need this all down and organized so I can say I have a plan somewhere."
I watched my mother brutally rape her boyfriend.,"When I was 7, I watched my mother rape one of her fuck buddies with an air freshener can. She was 37 and he was 19 at the time. They were in a huge fight over who was going to vacuum the apartment, and she attacked him with a cast iron frying pan. I remember her hitting his head with a huge amount of force. He dropped to the ground hard, and I honestly thought he was dead. My mother yelled at me to get the zipties out of the drawer. I regret to this day that I complied. She tied him to the radiator, pulled his pants off, and violently began to shove the air freshener can up him. His screams and sobs were so incredibly horrible. There was blood dripping onto the gray carpet. I was screaming for her to stop, but she kept going for a long, long time. There was a look of complete defeat and fear on his face. His sobbing was so awful. I wish I could have done something, but I was so shocked that I just stood there screaming. I was so scared. She finally stopped, and the look on her face was horrifying. When she untied him he sat there crumpled on the ground shaking. I still can't get that image of him on the floor out of my mind years later.

I saw him working at a gas station a month ago. I'm 15 now, so he is probably about 27. He asked if I needed any help working the shake machine. I couldn't figure it out at all, and apparently he found this immensely funny. I must have looked rather dumb. The whole time this was going on I was praying that he didn't recognize me. Miraculously, he didn't. We laughed about my stupidity with the shake machine, and he ended up paying for my shake. I'm not sure what to think. Life is weird.

"
To the guy who saved my family from being sued into oblivion.. Thank you,"This is a story from 2001 to express my gratitude for the kind stranger. God fucking bless you 9000x.

I was a 17 year old high school senior leaving school to work at the movie theaters. I had just left school in my Acura sedan when I noticed a vehicle in front of me making a right hand turn. For some reason I looked up in my rear view mirror for a split second when suddenly I saw the same car veer immediately back into the intersection by doing a U-turn instead of a right hand turn. 
I slammed on my brakes and t-boned the driver. When I got out of the car I was in shock. I had struck a girl that attended my school – and was in fact also in my class. 

Description of what happened (the red boxes are stop signs) http://imgur.com/9nzK0PD

She was ambulanced out of her vehicle, hospitalized and returned to school in a neck brace and a new car. I was shunned by my peers as ‘the guy that hit a girl with his car’, lost my car and lost my job. Her parents were successful lawyers who owned their own firm and sent her to daily chiropractic appointments. My parents were full time social workers that could barely afford the mortgage of the house we lived in and saved every penny for my older sisters college education. 

Then we got sued. 

My parents don’t have much. So when they took out an insurance policy they had only took out 50k in liability in the event they were in an accident. And because I was under 18, it fell on them. And with $150,000+ of medical bills coming our way (years of her PT, chiropractor and various extra stuff), my parents were convinced we would lose our house and everything else. 

I know what everyone is thinking .. “It’s her fault. She made an illegal U-turn and went through a stop sign”..

That’s what I kept repeating in my head over and over again. But when you are in the court room facing an arbitrary lawyer and you watch the girls lawyers and the “unbiased” arbitrary lawyer wink at one another and rule in the favor of the girl – you lose all hope.  You become depressed. You watched your parents STRUGGLE and WORK overtime, day after day, just to lose it all because you caused an traffic accident.

As a 17 year old boy, it ruined me. It was at this moment I realized life wasn't fair. My parents were now fighting every night about money and blaming one another for not updating their insurance policy. I became defensive – and still to this day react overly defensive for no good reason. I literally have PTSD from this.

I began HS with no reputation and finished it with a horrible one. I had no friends. Everyone sneered at me. And at least a dozen times several guys from my HS would take it upon themselves to be white knights, in what they felt was right to do, and bully me. They crowded around me and punched me until they laughed and got bored..  because they thought I was at fault for hitting the popular girl.

But then you came forward. Literally out of no where. No one really knew you but you witnessed everything. You were there walking by.. and you even took pictures. You probably didn’t even think you did much by saying “she made a U-turn”. But that’s all it took! When we appealed, your statement aided our win in trial and without you our family would have literally fell apart. 

I graduated high school in miserable fashion. I even contemplated suicide because the world was too unfair. But because of you, here I am. I owe so much to you. Because of your honest and small statement (which I realized you actually took time off from the Army to make), my older sister was able to finish college. I was able to go to college. My little sister was able to go to college. My parents were able to keep their house. And most importantly, our family is still together. All because of you. Thank you.


EDIT* As someone commented, pay it forward. This hero of mine probably has no idea the IMPACT he made by taking a few minutes to make a statement. So when you see an accident, please pull over and exchange phone numbers or call 911 and let them know who you are and what happened (how my family later discovered that a witness was available).

The more I use Reddit the more I realise how much content is blatantly stolen from here,"I find it quite amazing really
I follow numerous meme pages and such for example ladbible and unilad and others and the amount of content just taken and copy and pasted from here is ridiculous 
I see things on here one week and the next week the exact same content is plastered all over Facebook and Instagram hundreds of times without any recognition for where they stole it from and try and pass it off as their own 
Just frustrating and stupid I suppose 
But it's all for the likes so it's okay "
To the woman who hit my dog,"Thank you for getting out of the car. Thank you for holding Lily as she passed. 
Thank you for not just speeding off and forgetting about it. 
Thank you for calling my home and telling me what happened, rather than just leaving her for me to find.
EDIT: thanks for the support and the virtual hugs you guys, it means a lot. <3"
"The ""let's arm all teachers"" argument for stopping mass shootings makes me want to cry.","Gun violence has been bothering me for years. I'm 23, I was in college when Sandy Hook happened. I remember going home for Christmas that year, watching a memorial on TV, and crying with my Dad. For the years since then, these mass killings/ shootings happening in the US have been unbearable for me (and I think a lot of people).

The ""solution"" I keep seeing on my social media feeds is ""Oh, we'll just give every teacher a gun and that will solve all of this.""

This ""solution"" makes me want to cry. Do you think it is realistic to expect all teachers to be armed and trained to use a gun? There is already a teacher shortage. They are already underpaid. Being a teacher requires patience, understanding, and special skills to be able to teach many different types of students. They have to grade homework, create lesson plans, and (depending on the funding of the school) buy their own classroom supplies. 

So now we want all teachers to have a gun on them at all times and use it? We add this to the list of their responsibilities? This should be a requirement for someone to be a teacher?

If you take a step back and think about all the teachers you know, do you think they want this burden? Is it realistic to require ""weapons training"" on a potential teacher's resume? Think about all the teachers you've had in your life. Would you have been happy that all those people had guns, or would it have been vastly inappropriate for some of those past individuals?

I feel like I'm living in a Crazy Ville USA where people would rather add more guns to the problem than admit that some of these high powered semi automatic rifles are unnecessary. I feel so hopeless and lost. 

TLDR: I really can't stand the idea that arming every teacher is the solution to school shootings. I don't feel like it is realistic at all."
I got fat on purpose and years later I regret it.,"This is a throw away because I'm ashamed to admit it. I got harassed a lot when I was in my teens. I was a tiny little thing that had large breasts, my hair is naturally black, olive skin. I was beautiful (although at the time as a teenager I wouldn't believe it aha).

First I was molested by my best friend. He was my friend for so long I trusted him and we had a sleep over at a mutual friends. In the middle of the night he was laying on me, crushing me. His hands up my shirt and I could feel his erection.

Next time was the babysitter that hired me, he became too friendly. Would get me to sit on his lap and tell me about how much he wanted to fuck me while his wife was gone.

Regular cat calls from fellow students, random cars pulling over and asking if I wanted to ride with them, co-workers talking about me like I was just a sexual object.

I began to eat a lot. Food tasted good and I felt better. Then I realized if I eat a lot and be happy from eating a lot, I will also not be bothered by people. So I gained weight, and people bugged me less.

What a stupid solution. 15 years later, I've been with my boyfriend/savior for almost 10 years and I've literally carried this weight all of this time. I feel horrible but I feel like I haven't been able to stop. I want to stop, but its a pure addiction. It is my runaway when I've had a stressful day/week/whatever. I'd rather be healthy and attractive again than to be what I am now.

I want to learn how to grocery shop, make food, be healthier. I'm currently trapped.

Sorry for the over share. I just want to be where I want to be physically and mentally to celebrate our 10 years together and I'm failing.

Thank you to those who read this, I hope you have a great day.

TL;DR: I got fat to stop being harassed and now I feel trapped as a fat person.

EDIT:

Thank you for the responses folks, I won't be responding to each one of you but please know that I read them all and will carefully consider the approach I take to losing weight. I also want to thank Kducky for the addition of good mental health too. I think that is important too so I will take care of that as well. :)

No thanks though to the guy who PM'd me telling me that I could have just got breast reduction. You suck and you know nothing about me.

Gonna log off this account and start my journey. Thanks again folks :) "
Doing something nice for your girlfriend does not make you 'whipped',"Yesterday I took my SO out for dinner. We walk to the restaurant because it's not far from hers. She wore flats and took her heels with her because the walk is uphill. We get outside the restaurant she asks if I can do her shoes up for her, because her skirt is tight around her waist and it hurts to bend down.

Sure, I'll be a gentleman and do it for you. Then these people outside in a house across the road start making 'whochoo' like whipped noises. How am I whipped? It's called being a gentleman and maybe if you tried it instead of being crude and childish, you'd be taking a girl out for dinner also instead of sitting outside in a shitty garden drinking warm fosters."
"So I just pulled an all nighter and watched the sunrise with this beautiful girl. Awesome time. But I was finally able to fart after she left and it was like, 15 seconds straight. Literally.","And you know, I just wanted to tell someone. My night was awesome, the sunrise was awesome, and that was probably the greatest fart I've ever produced. I'm sorry if that is totally gross to you guys, but I laughed my ass off at the immense relief I felt after holding it in for so many hours and I really wanted to share. I hope it made you laugh!

Edit? I showed her this thread and I think I broke my own record for how hard I made a girl laugh. I'm so glad people can have a sense of humor when it comes to flatulence. You people are awesome."
"When I see someone saying ""Reddit sucks now"", I want to tell them about subreddits that are awesome, but I don't, because I don't want people like that there.","I know there are good subs. But I'm not telling people who complain about ""may-mays"" and ""fee-fees"" where they are.

A teenage girl was rating guys as they walked by,"She said ""5/10 wouldn't date, sorry honey"" as I walked by. I just kept walking and said ""Like I give a fuck.""

I got the job!,"AFTER 2 AND A HALF YEARS OF APPLYING FOR LITERALLY EVERY JOB, I FINALLY GOT ONE!!!

I interviewed in the morning and they called me in the afternoon telling me I GOT THE JOB

so much pressure, stress and weight has been lifted off of me because I GOT THE GOD DAMN JOB and its PERFECT FOR ME

I never thought I would be useful again. I thought that i would be turning 26, crying lying in my bed but no. I'll be turning 26 on the last day of my training for this job. depression can go fuck itself, my dependency on xanax can go fuck itself, my nonexistent self worth can go fuck itself. they WANTED ME.

you guys. I. GOT. A. JOB."
I fucking hate being in the military.,"If I don't say this somewhere, I am going to burst. I have been severely  depressed for the past 2 years and just want to get this off my chest.

If you have never been in the military and hated it, you definitely won't understand. I am not afraid to say it, I hate the military and I regret signing my contract everyday of my life. I was 23 and ran out of money for college and I didn't want to rack up school loans but I almost wonder if I should have just done that instead of join. I hate it for a multitude of reasons, but the biggest reason is that it is full of fucking idiots. 

In the civilian world, if you're a fucking idiot and are lazy as fuck at work, you will most likely get fired. Not the military. If you're lazy, all your subordinates have to pick up YOUR slack and then they are lectured that they need to work harder. And this is why people stay in. They see that they can get away with fucking MURDER and still get a paycheck every two weeks. It doesn't take a fucking genius to advance. People join the military because all you need is two brain cells. One that is easily brainwashed to learn how to bend over and take it and the other to keep you breathing.

This is fine for someone with absolutely no work ethic. But I am not one of those people. I have dignity and pride in what I do. I work harder than most people I have met so far. And yes I am fucking bitter about it. You would be bitter about it too if people took the credit for your hard work.

In the civilian world, you can quit whenever you want to. Not in the military. My mental health has deteriorated because I hate it so much and I constantly kick myself everyday for ever thinking it was a good idea. I haven't learned anything positive. Just how shitty people can be.

Oh, and if you think soldiers are fighting for your freedom, you are either stupid orr blind. Soldiers are just victims of the system. They were brainwashed to believe they were doing a good things. Sucks for those who died or come home with PTSD. But I don't feel bad for them. Your ignorance landed you in that position and you sacrificed your health/life for people who honestly don't fucking care and will continue to live their day to day lives. The world didn't stop spinning for you.

I hate living in housing. I hate being surrounded by military families that are so gung ho about their lifestyles but we all know the spouses cheat on each other when they're separated. Every single member I have met has cheated on their wives. So don't be naive.

I wish I could vent to my partner about this. But she is the type of person that meditates and listens to Wayne Dyer. I just wanted to get this off my chest because Lord knows if you talk shit about the military to a dedicated member, they'll go crazy. It's a fucking cult and you all know it.

Downvote or whatever, I don't fucking care. You can take your precious patriotism and shove it up your ass.

Edit: I did not expect the overwhelming amount of responses I got. For what it is worth, I am a female, not that it should matter but in the military it does unfortunately. No one takes me seriously and I am surrounded by men. So it gets lonely. I should have stated this earlier but oh well. Hopefully most of your supporting opinions stand.
Thanks for all of the responses, even the people who were rude and/or disagreed. I will finish out my contract of course, for the people telling me to suck it up. I just wanted to get it off my chest. Or am I using this subreddit incorrectly?"

I'm 25 and I'm going to die because of America's health system.,"I have crohns disease. I was diagnosed when I was 19. Over the last 2 years, I've been off my medication. $270 a month (with insurance) was too expensive for the pills. I'm still on my parents insurance until September. I was hoping my body could push through, so there would be no evidence of crohns disease when I applied for my own insurance. But I couldn't. I went to the doctor today. The medication they want me on now is $70,000 a year without insurance. I can't afford the $500+ a month the insurance costs for someone with my condition. If the ACA is repealed, i will never even be accepted by any company. I require colonoscopies every 4 months, MRIs annually, and invasive blood work every 3 months. That's just for my Crohns. We also suspect I may have some endocrine issues, we did a ton of blood work today $250 with insurance, $500 without. 

My estimated medical bills for a year will be around $100,000 without insurance. That's just for the medications and testing. No company in their right mind would cover me for something I can afford. I make $43,000 before taxes. $31,000 after taxes.

I'm 25 and I'm going to die because of America's health system.

Edit: I am on tears right now from all the support I am receiving. Thank you so much. I found a savings card for one of my meds, Lialda, that brings the cost down from $1100 a month to $30 a month. I'm looking for some stuff to cover the $70,000 stelara as well. 

As far as the medical marijuana: I do not live in a medical state. But I have been smoking regularly for the last 2 years to control the symptoms without medication. However the side effects were really affecting my mental health (which I also have serious issues with, but it's less expensive than crohns management.) Also, my job requires on call several days a week and I have to stay sober for it. I love marijuana and I use it when I can, but it's sadly not a long term solution right now.

Edit #2.) I just bought a house last August. I have a lot to lose if I can't afford that mortgage. if I just up and move I would have to sell it (can't rent it out totally for the first 5 years I own it) and pretty much lose the life savings I threw into it."
M 36...had the best date of my life.,"TLDR: reflections on an amazing first date. 


Online dating is a drag.  We all know this.  Every swipe right slowly diminishes in pleasure the more we are seeking. I’ve been on one of these sites for the past few months with little to no expectations and every match came with a commensurate amount of dread and hope. 

People would come and go; I got ghosted and ghosted others.  I met professional victims, angels and decent but lonely people who i didn’t connect with emotionally.   It was heartbreaking seeing so many different worlds end before they could start because human beings are so fickle and particular.  

So let’s get to it.  on New Year’s Day I match with a beautiful woman.  I have a checklist and she matches most of them of if not all them. Has an education, loves the Simpsons and she’s a nerd.    She likes the fact that we can make references and we get the context and maybe the episode number.  

We text sparingly despite my penchant for immediate responses.   But I trust the situation. She likes that I write in complete sentences.  We text more.  I ask if we can talk on the phone.  She says yes.   One conversation is 10000 texts.  We talk for a week.  We talk about our lives and understand it hasn’t been peachy for the both of us.  

We agreed to meet yesterday.  We made a plan for breakfast and A matinee.  We talked while waiting for the table.  We talked at breakfast. We had time before the movie and talked while having coffee.   We visited a bookstore and talked more.  We are fast walkers.  We are out of shape but we walk fast.   We are both winded but still talking. 

It rained in the early morning and the rest of the day was crisp blue sky day with that wind that feels like a new world.  We loved the movie and talked more.  It was late afternoon and the sun was setting.  I wanted to offer her a ride home but I didn’t want to push it.  She took the train and I asked if she wanted to go out again. She said yes.  That she would love to.  We kissed each other goodbye and called it a day.  It was amazing.  

I got home and she let me know she got home, I felt euphoric but not because she is beautiful.  She talked about her flaws during the date (blemished cheeks, some gray hairs) and I thought she was gorgeous BECAUSE of this.   

This is the important part.  Despite these past few months and despite so many missed opportunities, it’s the fact that I was able to be myself from the beginning that this date was so great. 

I hope our next date goes just as well but even if it doesn’t, I know it’s possible and to not give up.  Damn good time.

Forgive me as this was written on mobile.  

Edit: thank you for the silver! Never got it before.  

And of course I’ll update as the days go on. "
"Lady at the beach who was scared of dogs, you rock as a mother.","I was at the beach with a friend and our dogs. The dogs went up to see a little girl. She seemed a bit scared so I couched down and asked her if she'd like to stroke my dog. She gave him a bit of fuss and although she still seemed a bit wary she was grinning, obviously pleased with her self. When I looked up I saw her mother was a little way off. 

It turned out her mother was scared of dogs, but she didn't want her daughter to be, so she'd removed herself from the situation so she didn't pass on her phobia to her daughter. Really awesome parenting. I grew up scared of dogs because my mum was and it took me ages to get over it so I really appreciate what she did."
If someone wants to be with you,"They will make time for you, they will want to spend time to talk to you and hangout with you. If they want to be apart of your life they will seriously make an effort to do so, and you will never have to question it. I have to reminds myself that even though I still have feelings for you."
"If I met my wife today, I wouldn't like her","It's not as though we're unhappy or arguing all the time. She has just changed so much, and it seems like she's becoming the kind of person she would joke about early in our relationship. She seems to love drama, broadcasts our life for likes and retweets, and will get together with friends to complain about how everything is terrible and the world has it out for her.

This is not the woman that I married and I don't know how long we can last."
Anal reminded me why I love my boyfriend,"My new boyfriend and I decided to try anal for the first time. He slid his finger in there slowly and when he started taking it out, the sensation triggered this horrible flashback of the first time I tried anal with my ex. This ex and I discussed anal and agreed to try it so we started to have sex but mid way through missionary he just slid out his dick and shoved it all the way into my anus. I'll tell you right now that this was the absolute worst pain I've ever been through  and it felt like I was being torn in half. I pushed him off, curled up and started crying in pain. Instead of comforting me, this ex just started laughing and told me to stop crying. About 10 seconds later his friend called him so he picked up and started talking to him. His friend asked him what he was doing and he replied laughing saying that he was  inside me. I stayed with that disgusting pig for way too long but he was the first boyfriend I ever had and left me with some incredibly warped perceptions of what a healthy relationship is and some trauma that just leaves me crying during random times. When I got that flashback I pushed my (now)boyfriend off and started crying again. Part of me expected him to get angry with me or laugh at me but to my absolute surprise, He just started cuddling me and rocking me until I calmed down again. It's only until I experience what should be normal that i finally realise how truly fucked up and abnormal  some things I've been through are. If there is some sort of higher entity out there that made me cross paths with this amazing man, I owe it/them all the bloody gratitude in the world."
He would have spent exactly 7 years with us.,"He suffered from a metastasised lung cancer which gave a him a serious pulmonary oedema. He could barely breath, so we did what we could to make him feel better, we put him down. He was 9, almost 10 years old and would have spent exactly 7 years with us today. 

Even if I rarely saw him anymore, it's hard knowing I wont see him ever again.

My teenage daughter made me a very Proud Parent today!,"My fifteen year old daughter went to court today and faced her molester during his sentencing hearing. I'm so very proud of her and the courage it took for her to do this. It was her step father. After his arrest she was removed and placed in my foster home. I adopted her in January 2013. He took the plea because he was facing a max of 150 years! With the plea he it was knocked down to 6-20 years. She gave a victim statement and endured questions from his lawyer. The questions were light weight. It was a lot harder on her listening to him and his supporters (including her birth mother and brother)defend him and his claims of being a changed man. I don't think the judge believed him because he was sentenced to 18 years with 4 years suspended for time served. We are very happy with the results and she feels this is a turning point because she no longer needs to worry about him. She also feels she spoke for others who didn't get justice or don't have the courage to speak. I'm one proud mama!
Thank you all for the support!"
Today is my brother's 18th birthday,"Happy birthday Steven. I hope you dont mind I wont be able to make it out later today, work has been running me ragged. Just some updates for you, our big sister is pregnant! She must have found a blind guy! Ha! Not sure when the due date is but I'll let you know as soon as I find out. 

Mom got another promotion at work and is doing really well on her own. I had lunch with her a couple days ago. Thanksgiving is coming up. 

Remember when we saw that episode of friends and then you put your head in the turkey,  but it was too big and you fell down, wriggling on the floor with your head up that turkey's ass. Great times. I wish we'd had cell phones back then! 

Well steve I have to go, im on my lunch break and running out of time. You know what, what am I saying, its your birthday of course I'll come out after work. I always get you tulips because I know roses remind you of your least favorite movie. I'll bring the DS too and I'll show you the new games I got with my last paycheck. Happy birthday steve, I love you and miss you 

I love you so much

A friend of mine just killed himself and it's so fucking crazy how it happened,"Dude I was literally just talking to him yesterday. I walked up to him at his desk and I started telling him about a girl I met on tinder. We always would talk and laugh and share stories and shit like that.

So I talked to him for maybe 30 minutes and he was normal. Laughing, commenting, giving me shit just like always. I talked to him throughout our shift but about half way through the shift his attitude just changed. He got quiet and looked Hella sad and upset. 

Everybody noticed because this dude is normally the life of the place. Making everybody laugh, customers love him. He's the one guy working here who you just know isn't gonna be here long because he's going to be like super succesful. He wast in school to be an engineer I think. 

Super smart guy. Funny. Cool as shit. 

So when his attitude changed it was wild. Everyone asked him if he was okay and bed just smile and say yea.

He was supposed to be off at 10 but apparently he just walked out a little after seven. I get here today and everybody crying. He killed himself lastnight. No note or anything.


I was just talking to him yesterday, dude. Dude was writing his own comic book, tutoring little kids at a tutor place in the city, going to school and building a fucking race car for his school. He had shit going good. I can't fucking process that shit.

I just saw him yesterday. Fucking yesterday. "
Another day in the third world.,"So yesterday I was pretty sick and by around 5:30pm I realized that I had run out of meds, so after a few minutes I put all of my efforts in waking up and going downhill to a supermarket near here to get the meds and some food, juice and what not. After getting everything I need I realize it's almost 6:30 and it's already night time which I really was trying to avoid... On my return trip uphill (while sick and carrying a few bags, not so pleasant) I hear one of those chinese motorbike knockoffs which we're all so scared off in here because they're cheap and make a quick getaway for thieves. I went out with the exact amount of money I needed for the groceries and meds, and left my phone at home so i'm just carrying my keys and my id and wasn't too worried.

After a few minutes, I now can see the motorbike coming at me, show was about to begin. He blocks me off and starts yelling ""WHERES THE PHONE, WHERE DO YOU HAVE IT?"" I calmly tell him that I have nothing, obviously he doesn't believe me. ""WHERE DO YOU HAVE IT? I'LL FILL YOU UP WITH BULLETS RIGHT HERE"" I insist that I have nothing and I tell him to search me up if he wants. I empty my pockets and everything letting him see that I'm not upset or anything for trying to rob me, after all I'm just dissapointed at the current situation we're living in. 

The man finally says ""Fuck... Money? You don't have any?"" I take out a 10 Bs.F bill (Basically, 0.10$) the change from my purchases. The guy looks at me with a dissapointed face, not knowing what else to do.

""Well, if you want I can give you a ride"", I thought well if he wanted to hurt me he would have already so why not, and I took on his offer. During the ride he kept saying ""Naa man, you dumb as hell why would you go out at night? All u'll get is robb!"". Inside I'm just laughing at this absurd situation while he drops me off uphill and I walk into my residence again, I say goodbye and thank him.

Don't even know if this is a funny or a sad story myself.

(Sorry if my english or storytelling isn't top notch, it's not my first language.)
"
"Fuck you, Ancestry.com.","Seriously. I pay $100 for a DNA testing kit and you force me to sign up for your site with a ""14 day free trial"" in order to process the kit. Of course, you never fucking mention that the kit takes nine-to-ten weeks to process, all the while you're charging me $19.99 a month for your shit site that I have zero use for whatsoever. 

So your DNA testing doesn't cost $100, it costs $160 which is more than your competitors. Thanks for tricking me into buying yours you assholes."
I should have killed him.,"I know she'd be disappointed in me saying or even thinking that. She didn't agree with the death penalty.  

He was drunk, driving the wrong way on a highway.  He has 4 prior drunk driving convictions/arrests.  He was out on bail for a Drunk Driving arrest less than a month before the accident.

She drove a small car and he had a big truck. She changed lanes to avoid a slow moving 18 wheeler.  He hit her head on.  Her car was gone, all I could make out through the flames and twisted metal was the trunk of her car.
We were driving home (in separate cars) from a birthday gathering.

There's really not a way to describe the simultaneous want and fear of that moment, staring into those flames.  I couldn't find her, so i closed my eyes and listened.  Hoping I would never hear the thing I was trying so hard to listen for.  But all I could hear were the flames.  

After a while I became aware of the truck driver who had stopped to help. He was banging on the Drunk's car door but couldn't get it open.  I went over and with all the adrenaline or whatever happens to you after something like this, I managed to pry open his mangled trucks door and drag his unconscious body out of the cab and away from the fire.  I laid him on the highway a few meters away and went back to the wreck.  

There is a blank spot here, but after some time I remember people yelling at me to back away from the wreck.  I walked back to where I'd laid him down.  Two guys had him sitting up trying to wake him up.  I asked if he was alive and they said they had felt a pulse. 

I grabbed his neck and laid him on his back, I straddled his chest and I choked him.  Nobody stopped me. They watched as I cried and screamed and choked the man that took her.

There is no satisfaction, no release, in choking an unconscious man.  I had a flashing thought of her telling me in a conversation we'd had not a week before how she didn't agree with the death penalty.  I'd like to think that's what stopped me, and maybe it is.  Maybe I'm just a pussy.  Maybe I'm a good man that did the right thing.  If there had been any visible sign of life in him when I started, I can't tell you I would have stopped.  But I did.  They flew him to the hospital. He walked out with cuts and bruises and burns but nothing major.

He has a trial date on Tuesday but the lawyers are just going to ask and receive another extension.  These things can take years apparently. I go to all of his court dates.  Her family doesn't go, or haven't yet.  It's too hard to face him.  I could have spared them this part.  Maybe all I would have done is take away what little justice they, and she, can have.  But there is no justice in tragedies like this. 

When I think of it, I try to focus on her.  She was as good as they come.  A truly amazing, beautiful person.  She had plans. Good plans.  A loss the world will never fully know.  She was a redditor, so she's your loss too.

Most days I'm glad I didn't.  But sometimes I wish I had.  Neither are thoughts I'd wish on anyone. 
Thanks for reading.  Long time lurker first time posting. I just needed to share. 

Edit: I posted as a comment and should have just edited. I'm learning.

Update: Thanks for the kindness. I'm not good at posting or responding but I do appreciate it.

He changed his plea to guilty and is set for sentencing next month. His guilt was never in doubt but it does expedite this process so I'm grateful for that.

There's a scholarship and some other things in the works to carry her memory forward. I may in the future post links for anyone who may want to contribute or learn more about her and what a staggering loss she is.
 
   "
I googled my ex-wife,"I haven't spoken to her in 16 years.  I don't know why I decided to do it.  But when her picture came up on my monitor, she looked absolutely beautiful.  Almost the same as the day I married her, but her hair was a little longer.

And it was the biggest confidence booster I've had in a long time.  She looked happy, and from what little I was able to read about her, she's doing well, and I couldn't be happier for her.

It took me a long time to get my shit together, and now that I have, I think she would be proud to say I am her ex too."
"The best advice ever given to me came from a huge douche I hated in high school, so I hate to admit that he changed my life.","When I was in high school I was not the most attractive or confident girl you’d ever seen, but I was funny and smoked a lot of weed and therefore hung out with a lot of the “cool” people but I wouldn’t say I was necessarily that cool myself. 
One of my “cool” and ridiculously good looking friends (we’ll call her Jane) started to date one of the hottest guys at school (we’ll call him James). I didn’t like him, he treated me like her “special” tag a long friend and would make me the expense of many jokes. He was also rude to his parents in front of us and an entitled jerk in every way.
One night at a party at my good friend Austin’s house I ended up leaving with Jane and James at the end of the night. When I got in the car James opened his backpack to brag about the fact that he had stolen a small flatscreen tv from Austin’s house. Knowing how well off James already was I was flabbergasted and said he should give it back and he said if I ever told Austin he’d freak out on me. A few days later after hearing Austin tell me about how mad his parents were at him for letting the tv get stolen I couldn’t deal with it anymore and didn’t want to cover for someone I already didn’t like and told Austin exactly what had happened. 
Later after being confronted about it both James and Jane (who yes was a shitty friend) pretty much disowned me. I wasn’t too heartbroken about it.
A few weeks later my mom died in sudden circumstances. I was only 15 and a sophomore in high school and had never met my father so I was out a parent already. Thankfully I had amazing grandparents to step in but it’s not easy to go through something like that especially at that age. I felt like a shell. A complete zombie. After a few weeks a friend finally talked me into going to a party to try and feel normal again. At the party as soon as I showed up it was very apparent that my being there caused some discomfort since word had already gone around and everyone already knew what happened. To make matters worse my first interaction was with James. I was walking by and he said hello and I say hey back and then he had the nerve to say “so how’s the thing with your mom going?” with a shitty smile on his face,
Normally I’m honestly an emotional rock when in public, I didn’t cry at the funeral, I didn’t cry around anyone else, but when he said that and a few people turned to look at me I just absolutely shut down. I ran to the back of the house and shut myself in the guy who was throwing the party’s room and began to bawl. I sat there and cried for like 15 minutes until I heard the door open and James and another guy were standing there, apparently on their way to retrieve weed from the room I was in. James told the other guy to leave and he walked up to me and said “what’s wrong?”
Between sobs I told him to eat a dick for even asking me that and that his stupid comment earlier had this effect on me and that he got what he wanted. 
The response I got back was completely unexpected. 
“Got what I wanted? I didn’t want to do this. I didn’t even think I could do this! I have absolutely no right to have the ability to make YOU cry! You who have been through so much more than I have. I can not even imagine what you’ve been feeling. I can’t imagine not having either of my parents let alone having none. I’m so so sorry this is not what I wanted. But you shouldn’t be crying not because of me I’m just a normal guy there’s nothing special about me. But this makes you special. I respect you more than you could ever imagine, you came back to school! You came back to hanging out! I couldn’t do that! Fuck me! Don’t let me or anyone else at this fucking party or this school or anyone ever have the power to do this to you ever again. You are allowed to hold your head higher than mine, you get to hold your head higher than anyone in that room, you get to hold your head higher than anyone in any room that you ever fucking walk into.”

It’s been about six years since that conversation. And still every time I doubt myself or feel bad I repeat that last sentence he said to me in my head as a reminder and it had helped me through a lot since then.
The only bummer is I never wanted to tell anyone because I hate having to remember his stupid face and admit he did something good. Really good,"
It's my birthday,"It's my birthday today. I'm a simple girl... I really don't need much and definitely don't want much. I just like to spend quiet days with the people I love doing things I enjoy. And honestly, I mostly just enjoy netflix and puzzles. Staying active is nice too but it's only Wednesday and I've had a hell of a week at work already so really don't want any part of exercise today. Here's what I wanted:

1. Go buy a new puzzle with the coupon my sister gave me from one of my favourite puzzle stores.
2. Have a fancy dinner. Nothing too fancy, just more fancy than usual. I'm talking like $30-40/person.
3. Get dressed up for said fancy dinner. I don't do it often but wearing make-up and doing my hair is fun once a year. 
4. Hang out with my boyfriend. Talk about stuff.

But instead, my mother forgot it was my birthday today so she accidentally made dinner plans with her realtor. She also is adamant that birthday's are a family event so now I must go to her house for dinner which means simple home-made food and no dressing up. My boyfriend has decided that his workout goals are his main priority. So he's doing that until about 6:30pm. This means I get to go shopping for a puzzle by myself after work (wanted to do this with him) and then pick up him from the gym... then drive us over to my mom's house to have dinner with a stranger. Then I come home and will probably be too tired for anything else.

I'm just a little sad right now. Sorry if you read this all the way to the end. Needed to get it off my chest and no one to tell except the internet. "
I do nice things for my girlfriends because I fucking want to.,"EDIT: Apologies for the typo, I can assure you that I do, in fact, only have one girlfriend.

Please stop with this ""whipped"" bullshit. I've lost count of the times I've had this conversation, but I LIKE DOING THINGS FOR MY GIRLFRIEND, why is that so difficult to grasp? Why, when I mention that I do a lot of the cooking (I fucking enjoy cooking, and I'm good at it; I used to work as a chef ffs), that I clean occasionally (my gf works away from home for often weeks at a time, so I make sure she comes back to a clean house so she at least feels comfortable when she returns), and that I care about her sexual pleasure (this came up originally in a game of I Have Never, before me and my gf were dating but I've not subsequently denied it, wherein my group of friends discovered that I enjoyed cunnillingus - it's actually my favourite part of sex - and now seem to think it's hilarious that I wouldn't just skip the foreplay; I honestly think it's quite sad that to them sex literally means ""fucking like a jackhammer till at least one of us cums"", it really actually shows a dysfunctional and unhappy sex life imo, but according to the men in that group that makes me a ""pussy"", and according to the women it means my gf must have ""trained"" me to do so... WTF), so so many people leap out of the woodwork and parrot the same old bullshit ""LOL WHIPPED"", ""I SEE SHE'S GOT YOU WELL TRAINED HAHAHA"", etc.

There are hundreds of examples of this and it fucking pisses me off. It actually upsets me because no-one seems to understand that I like doing nice things for my girlfriend because it makes me happy (and likewise she does nice things for me too). Like it just isn't fathomable that my feelings on this matter one iota; if I do nice things for my gf it must be because I either want sex, or I'm being ""trained"" like some kind of fucking dog. Well fuck you guys.

It's really not that complicated a concept..."
I slept through my alarm.,"I work part-time at my local radio station.  Today, I was supposed to come in at 8 AM to broadcast the local church services.  Well, after a mostly sleepless night, I slept right through my alarm.  At 9 AM, I get a call from my boss.  Shit.  

""Hey, PlaidDragon, are you at the radio station right now?""

Shit.

""Oh crap, no, I guess I slept right through my alarm.  I am so sorry.""

""Oh, its no big deal, I was just talking to someone and they were asking about the station being off the air and I was a bit confused.  I'll head out there and get things going, you just come on out as soon as you can.""

>station off air

>no big deal

>wat

So I got to work and he's there waiting for me.  I knew I was about to get it.  I give an embarrassed/nervous, ""Helloooo...""

He laughs and says ""Hey there, how's it going?""

>he laughs

""Pretty good I guess...""

He then proceeds to tell me it's no big deal, everyone sleeps through an alarm or two and not to feel bad.  He starts telling me stories of other employees here that have slept through their alarms.

He gets up to leave.  I give a slightly confused and still embarrassed, ""thank youuuu...""

He laughs again and reassures me that it's okay.  

I have the coolest boss ever.  

This same boss gave me and the other part-timer $20 Taco Bell gift cards for Christmas.  

I just needed to tell someone that.  I feel much better now.

Edit: I accidentally a word so I added it."
As an American Jew… I have to get this off my chest,"All this news about Israel has brought the feelings back up again. It happens every time the conflict heightens. I guess this time I'm finally at an age where it all makes sense and I can put into perspective the entirety of the situation. 

I know I don't have all the facts, or even most of them. But this is pathetic. enraging. and inexcusable. Israel is a terrorist nation. 

Individual Jews moving back to Israel ""because it is the holy land"", that's all fine and good. 

What's not fine and good is being gifted the land right out from under the people living there, kicking them out of their homes with the big guns you were also gifted, then waging a 60+ year war against those same people to try and take more land that they never had any right to in the first place… and when the Palestinians fight back for their homeland, then Israel claims they're the victims while continuing to use the US purchased weapons to destroy countless villages and end countless lives…

What Israel is doing is by no means less evil than the Holocaust was. Racial persecution and senseless murder on a huge scale. They're just not doing it as effectively as the Nazi's did.

The justification needs to stop. The war crimes need to stop. Honestly, as a Jew, I wish America would stop funding Israel."
I've never been more infuriated about an internet discussion than when redditors talk about farming,"This is just an angry rant I need to get off my chest. There's a thread on the front page about dairy farmers throwing away milk and all the professional armchair farmers have come out to complain about how easy farming is.

 I grew up on a farm, in poverty. We never went hungry because, well, we lived on a farm but I had no idea how poor we actually were until middle school.

I grew up thinking 20-hour work days were normal. Literal 20-hour work days. My father would get up at 5 am and work until 1am, sleep and repeat. I was too young to help beyond feeding the calves and carrying around fencing buckets or other piddly stuff. 

I watched my father run a 200-acre farm by himself in the brutal heat and milk cattle every single fucking day, twice a day, even below zero. We had no fancy tractors with cabs. We didn't get these magical subsidies I hear so much about. We sold milk and tobacco, struggling to stay afloat. It wasn't until I was older and could help more that I realized how much work my father had to do by himself.

I helped him fence, I helped him run cattle in, I helped in tobacco and corn and green beans. I cleaned barns and shoveled manure and put in my own 10-hour work days. I'm ashamed I couldn't do more but sometimes my body just gave out and my dad kept going, determined to provide for us. Even with mine and my brother's help, his work was never ending. There was always a down cow, always a fence that needed patching, always hay to cut or field that needed plowed, always an engine to be worked on or disc to be welded. There was never a single day off. Ever. I didn't know vacations were normal. I didn't know people got to just stop working and still get paid. My father never took one.

I visit him now and his body is broken. He has a hard time walking and standing up. The years of intense manual labor have caught up with him. At 55, he has the body of an 80-year old. And it kills me inside to see my strong, hardworking dad reduced to this. 

And then I read the comments that talk about how farmers have it easy and there's little physical labor involved. And it makes me want to vomit. It makes me want to drag them to a field and make them understand what actually happens. In their little suburban bubble where their parents make a combined 120K. They know nothing about farming or poverty. They don't know work. They don't know what nicotine poisoning is or having a sun stroke in a field does. They don't know anything but they act like they do.

I've never been so angry in my life. My father worked harder than two men in their whole lifetimes will, all so we wouldn't have to. He made sure we did our studies. He made sure we could go to college and get a good job so our life wouldn't be his. Entering the career-field now, I'm determined to get an easy, normal job that normal people have so I can take care of my father, so he can stop working. So he can have the easy life the ignorant, city-slickers thinks he has.

Thanks for listening. Rant over."
"Girlfriend, love of my life, died wednesday at 22","My best friend, my girlfriend, died on wednesday may 28 due to a very secret heroin addiction. We had been dating since march 2013 and living together since august 2013. We were inseparable. She was a beautiful girl, 6 feet tall, red hair, painter, actress, funny as hell, smart. 

She had problems with anxiety and took klonopin and prozac, but never seemed to be fully unhinged. She had confided in me that she had, in high school, hung out with a very bad crowd of drug-addicted artists. She had assured me that her stay in a detox center as a 17 year old took care of her problems and she had no connection to the people she did drugs with. I never suspected she had a problem of any kind.

On tuesday she and I went out to a couple of shows and she seemed very out of it. She threw up a few times and was very woozy. She told me she thought she might be pregnant, or that the dosage of klonopin was making her sick. I told her that I wanted her to get off of it. A long drive home and a argument ensued, I slept on the couch--but I eventually joined her in bed. I held her all night.

Wednesday morning she woke up before me and told me she was getting a pregnancy test and then going to register for classes at her new school. I told her to give me a kiss and that I loved her. I still had some time before i went to work so I waited around for her, her phone was off. I was worried but I didn't get too upset. She was known for forgetting to charge her phone all time. I went to work at 10am, I left a note for her telling her I was sorry for yelling at her last night and I that I loved her so so much.

Around 1:00pm she finally charged her phone and called me, she sounded a little out of it. I told her I loved her and not to scare me. I asked her to take it easy. She read my note and told me that she was sorry she worried me, but that she wished I would stop bothering her. I told her I would see her at home. I went back to work. 

Around 3 I started texting and calling her but she wasn't responding. I didn't think to much of it, she often would leave her phone in another room. I left work at 5 to go see her, sat in traffic for an hour, calling her nonstop. Finally got to our apartment to find her white as a sheet, lips blue, and a needle and a spoon next to her. Paramedics tried to revive her for hours but she was long gone

The worst day of my life.

I never knew of her problem and I feel so much guilt over it. How could I have not known? There is a chance that this could have been her first time in a long time and she overestimated it. She definitely kept it from me because I am very anti-drug. I wish she was still here so I could tell her I love her.


I miss her so much. I just wish I could hold her one more time. 

Thanks for reading. Please tell your loved one you love them."
Stop blaming your child's teacher for their low grades or shitty behavior,"I am so sick of parents who think it is all their kids teachers fault. Your child is not 3 grade levels behind because of me, nor did I cause them to act like an asshole on the playground. Sorry, but you created them, please take responsibility for them instead of making it my problem. Or better yet, make them take responsibility of their own mistakes.

I am currently messaging back and forth with a mother who thinks its MY fault their child hasn't been bringing home their homework, and is mad because there is a test tomorrow. I post online all the time reminding the parents of things going on in the classroom, including homework assignments.  You like them. Yet some how you didn't know about it? 

&#x200B;

These kinds of parents always seem to expect that the teacher writes down the homework in all 21 kids agendas, places each piece of work they need in all 21 kids book bags, and speaks directly to the parents of all 21 kids every day to communicate the expectations. The reality is, I can tell your kid to do something, but it is up to them whether they actually do it. 

Sorry Susan, its not my fault your kid fucking sucks. "
You were fucking wrong and I want you to know it.,"When I was 15 my very mentally and physically abusive mother always kicked me out of our home. For any and everything. I worked a weekday after school job, and a weekend better paying job. Every dime I made went to my gambling addicted mother for house bills and food. I hated her and my life. At 18 I graduated and joined the Army. When I decided to do this. To leave. She told me I was garbage and would be all alone and worthless my whole life. She told me that I was trash. That I would always be trash.



Im 34. I have an education. A wife. 3 children. 1.5 million invested in the market. 300k between my wife and I, put back into a retirement IRA. We own both of our cars. Have no debt. Just bought a half million dollar home with cash. But the most important thing.

I have three intelligent and healthy children. Whom I love and cherish. I take each day to teach them life lessons. To show them how important they are to meand building them up daily. They all are very caring children. With very happy lives. 



You were wrong. You were fucking wrong. I am somebody. Im a father, a husband, an entrepreneur, a loving friend anda mentor. Most important, I am happy."
I will never forgive my 1st grade teacher.,"She did nothing when I told her my parents were using drugs and my vagina hurt. She didn't even acknowledge that I spoke to her. Thanks a lot. You could've changed my childhood.

Edit: Thanks to everyone showing concern! Years later the situation was resolved. I have received help, counseling, etc. I cope. I am a happy and healthy adult, now. Thank you, so much, guys!"
"Please for the love of god stop using your god damn tits as a wallet. Your money stinks, its gross, and frankly I don't want to touch it.","Yes I am a guy, no I don't want to touch your sweat covered money. I don't know you and I don't know how clean you are. I don't care if you are a fucking super model. Don't fucking hand me sweaty ass money out of your bra. I know a lot of women's clothing has fuck all for pockets so I understand its hard to carry around. But I see the fucking purse your carrying, put it in there. Its fucking -4 degrees F' out, you see that coat your wearing with 2 pockets use those. If you still have no good pockets figure something out its gross. If I pulled some money out of my junk and tried to hand it to you I would end up in court for sexual assault. The fuck, people have some common fucking decency."
Guardians of the Galaxy changed my life,"I was in a huge funk for a while. For real I was getting rejected by women a lot and I felt really low and sad about it. I felt like I was really ugly and stuff. But I saw Guardians of the Galaxy and it was such a happy movie, from Peter Quill's happy attitude to Groot's caring personality it was so positive. I even cried a little when Groot says we are Groot. I wanted that kind of positivity in my life. So I started to listen to some of the soundtrack and it just all put me in such a positive headspace. I loved it. I've since seen it a lot of times and people have noticed that my attitude has changed but I can't really say why to them but I can tell reddit. That movie touched me in a really positive way.

Edit: Whoa this thread has the most replies I've ever gotten on Reddit! Thanks everyone! Come and Get Your Love!"
I share a birthday with the kid next door. This happened.,"Today is my birthday. I turn 26. Im alone, have nothing to my name and wont be celebrating. I got a couple birthday wishes, and I was grateful for that. Why? Because people actually remembered. That itself, is worth being thankful for...however...some interesting events took place this morning.

The kid next door is also sharing his birthday today. I hear some interesting words being exchanged next door...more like outside. So I went to go look. This little guy got a 3DS for his birthday and proceeded to, I kid you not, throw it into the pond in front of his mother. Well sorta. It was in the box still at least. He said ""I wanted a PSVita mom, not this. You never listen to me."" She then began to cry. He then said ""You always cry. You're so weak."" and then walked inside. I went out and consoled her. I grabbed the 3DS for her, cleaned off the box and asked her to talk to her son...so I did. 

I exchanged some words with him. I didnt know she was a single mom working a fulltime job and freelance on the side. I didnt yell at the kid either. If anything, I asked why he did it. Shes never home. Its all miscommunication. I explained to him what Ive been going through a bit and brought his mom in on it. I got them two to talk it out and in the end, the son ended up apologizing and crying. She thanked me, gave me a hug, told me more about them and I went on my way.

What a morning its been. Theres more to it but its just tidbits. I just wanted to get my feelings out there really and put them into words. I know if my birthday isnt going to be anything, the least I can do is make someone elses better, especially if its a bit life changing. He seemed really ungrateful at first, but all that needed to be done was some talking. Im not happy with how it was initiated in the first place but it turned out for the better at least. 

Thanks for reading if you do, I just needed to put my thoughts some place. Im sure this may not all make sense but its how I can get the words out right now. 

Edit: Friends kidnapped me. I honestly thought they forgot. I'll respond more when I get home. They took me to Red Robin. Between the kindness of you all and this, I'm so happy. I have some other things to add but to much to type on mobile. I'll respond to all the posts when I get home. Also, girls are nice but.... :)

Edit #2: Im home now and responded to EVERYONE I saw here. Thank you guys, you brought happy tears to this soul. This was one hell of a gift, knowing you made a difference and others happy. This is the kind of stuff I yearn for. I want to feel happy, I want others to share that happiness with me. I know I have nothing but...thats okay. One day im sure that will change and Im going to keep praying that my life does get better, but for now, all I can do is walk forward and strive for the best. Heres a song for you guys, its something that I can relate with the situation. Its got no lyrics, but the song speaks for itself...coming from a big time gamer that is. 

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lDb5D1O7cQ

Anywho, thank you guys. I cant tell you how many tears were shed reading this. This is a feeling you cant get from just receiving some gift. This feeling is going to stay with me forever. Thank you guys. Thank you so $&#(*&(@ much. 

Edit #3: Still so many responses! I wanted to make this edit because I'm going to take someone's advice. Currently, I'm unemployed and live in Murray, UT. I'm having a lot of problems finding a good job or even just a job. If anyone sees this and can give me a hand, shoot me a message. Asking for help is never a bad thing, especially if its within good reason. Thank you for teaching me that guys. I can be really stubborn but...I learned a lot tonight. If anyone can give me direction, Id be so grateful. If anyone is curious, I want to work with anything gaming. That or anything that's all about being diplomatic, social-able(if that's the word) and public speaking. Its what I accel (sp?) at the most. Let me know! :D"
Almost two years ago I posted about how I was abusing my puppy. Figured I'd give an update.,"As of today I've had my dog for two years so I figured today would be a good day to tell about our journey.

When I got him I was fresh out of high school, miserably depressed, and had no clue how to handle a dog. I was told that if you hit him he'd stop whatever he was doing wrong. When it didn't work I'd hit harder, I'd shake him by the scruff, I did all kinds of terrible things. He was still a baby. Barely three months old when I started.

When I realized how horrible I was and how frightened he had become of everything I wanted to change. I posted here with a letter to him apologizing and saying that from that day forward I was going to change and be a better owner.

No one here liked that idea. They told me what a horrible awful person I was, they said I'd never deserve my dog, that they wanted to hurt me the way I hurt him, and that I had no right to try to change while I had him. I needed to get rid of him and then try to change. Some said I should just never have another dog.

Out of the hundred or so insults and threats I got only one person encouraged me and offered to help me learn how to properly train him. So she sat down with me and taught me about clicker training and how to handle each of his issues.

It was tough. Unbearably so. The training itself was easy but trying to stay calm and use positive methods rather than just hurting him was horrible. There were times where I had to drop everything to go to a different room and just scream or hit a pillow or just blow off steam so I could continue the session. I had to learn to control myself at four in the morning when he went nuts barking at something in the back yard and I was so tired I couldn't think straight. It was the hardest thing I've ever done.

It was also the most rewarding thing I've ever done. Once I actually started training I realized I loved it. I loved seeing how excited he got to do tricks and loved the time we spent together. It was the only thing that inspired me to get out of bed and go do things when I felt like I was drowning in a particularly dark depression. The more we trained the less depressed I felt in general really.

I did everything I could to make up for how I treated him. I got him the best food, best toys, best treats, we went every where together, the cashiers at all my favorite stores know him and spazz when he comes in. He's finally reached a point where he trusts me completely. When he's afraid he comes running to me instead of away, he doesn't run away when he's sniffing something and I approach, he lets me pull stickers from his feet, he doesn't flinch when I reach for his face or pet his neck anymore.

I'm his favorite thing in the world and he's mine. I can't imagine how horrible my life would be now if I hadn't kept him and actually tried to work on my anger issues. He's taught me and helped me more than anyone in my entire life has. I'm an entirely new person and it's all because of him.

I've posted about this once in the dog subreddit but I realized they aren't the ones who needed to hear this story. It's the people who told me to not bother trying to be a better owner, the ones who rather than encouraging someone to change put them down and told them they were a monster and to just give up.

I was literally one comment away from still being a miserable, depressed, self loathing ball of anger.

So maybe next time someone wants to change it'd be worth it to encourage them. I kinda figured that's what this subreddit was about when I posted my original post."
I did something awful and should never be allowed to teach again.,"So, I teach IT at a shitty school in the UK. You've got some good kids and some bad kids. I'm a generally well liked teacher at this school (I like to think), probably because I'm young and like to have a laugh with the kids. There's a kid in my class who's incredibly bright, but God is she disruptive. She does nothing but play games in my class and talk to the people around her. So, after I switch off her games for the fourth time, I decide to take extra measures. I tell her that her parents are going to have to come in for a meeting and she will be put on report. She goes and sits back down and just kinda...doesn't move for the last 10 minutes of the lesson.
On her way out of the class, she says to me ""Bye, Miss [name]"". Thinking she's being sarcastic, I do it right back as sarcastically as possible. 
Today, I found out that she killed herself. Jumped out of her bedroom window and snapped her neck. I'm just sitting here shaking. I'm fucking awful. I deserve to die."
Women: stop pee hovering,"You don't like public toilet seats because they're ""icky"". You're the reason they're gross. Wipe the seat, or put toilet paper down. STOP HOVERING. I just sat in piss because of you. 

Sincerely a not uptight female. (Except for right now)"
My girlfriend's daughter.,"Dating someone who has a kid is new territory for me, but I've been with her a year now and I can honestly say I love her daughter (4 years old) and I'm glad to have them both in my life. 

Last night, while were decorating their Christmas tree, her daughter busted out singing, ""I've got the moves like jaguar!"" (yes, jaguar). 

The silly things she says and does make me happy. Getting to teach her about the world and seeing how excited she gets when we do a science experiment or build something makes me feel like a kid again. 

It was scary at first, but this little girl has definitely won me over. "
"I was raped over the summer, and I just want to get this off my chest...","Over the summer, I was out clubbing with a group of my friends. I wasn't drinking or anything. While I was taking a breather at the bar, a guy came up and started flirting with me. He was relentless. I politely declined and headed to the restroom to call a cab (it was the only quiet place). While I'm on the phone, the guy comes in and yanks the phone out of my hand. I was fighting and screaming, but there wasn't anyone in the bathroom. He bent me over the sink and then he just... put it in my butt. 

It was horrifying. I was being sodomized, but somewhere in my mind, I just thought, ""Fuck *you*, you dick."" And I... shit. All over him. While he was fucking me. 

He promptly pulled out and I heard him utter ""Oh my fucking god."" I ran out of the bathroom and got a security guard. The guy was arrested. I told the police what happened, and their faces were priceless. 

Anyway, yeah. Just wanted to get that out there. I shit on a guy to stop rape. 

**edit** i'm a little embarrassed this got so many upvotes! thank you all for your kind words and everything nice you have said!

**edit 2:** fuck those of you messaging me and telling me this is fake and to the few of you saying that you wish ""he would have finished the job."" fuck you, but i hope your self-hatred is cured soon. it must suck to come on the internet and put others down. i wish you well. "
To the two women who made fun of me directly in earshot while I was working...,"Yes, this may have happened a month ago but it's something that still bothers me.

It was a beautiful sunny day at an art fiar in a public park, in a city that is ranked one of the most dangerous in America. I guess I should be grateful neither of you robbed me. But that still doesn't mean it's ok to be as rude as you both were.

Yes, I'm a spray paint artist. I know it's not the most highly acclaimed art medium. But may I remind you both that I am an art school graduate. I went to art school on a full ride scholarship. And spray paint is just one medium I use. I can paint with acrylics, and oils as well. I am also pretty good with ink, pencils, markers, clay, stone, etc.

You stood there at my table with your kids watching me for ten minutes. I painted what your children wanted me to paint. I was friendly and courteous to all of you. I made your kids smile. Then one of you rolled your eyes at me and asked ""Why are your paintings all so *expensive?*""

Really? Are you kidding me? $10??? That's expensive? And no answer I gave was good enough. I said because they are original paintings. And was told that's still too much.

Then the two of you stand 3 feet away, perfectly within earshot and make fun of me for 5 minutes. You talked about how I'm not a real artist. If I were a *real* artist I wouldn't be here in the park. If I were a *real* artist I wouldn't be using spray paint. If I were a *real* artist my work would be in galleries, etc.

 Well, fyi, I have had my work in several galleries. I have even had whole shows of just my work. If either of your white trash asses ever set foot in a gallery you would be really surprised to see how much original paintings sell for, since in your opinions $10 is really expensive.

I grew up in a very abusive family.  All my parents ever did was beat me down.  And I was also bullied all through school.  You don't know anything about my life.  And you also don't know anything about what makes someone a ""real artist.""  

I'm not a real artist, (according to you) but I'm going to go home to the house I bought myself, and work in my art studio, that is fortunately right on my land. And hang out with my amazing boyfriend and awesome friends.

Have fun being miserable. :)

*EDIT*  Wow!  I was away for a few days (road trip to another state to deliver a few paintings to a customer.) And I have been working since I got back.  I can't even believe the outpouring of replies I got from so many people!  Everyone who wants a link will get it.  It may take me a bit, but you all will get it.  Thanks to everyone.  "
I just realized I gave my family a tour of a The Simpsons XXX-site when I was a kid,"I ran and got my mom and dad and brought them to the computer. I loved the simpsons when I was a kid, and I told them I had made a funny discovery! I vividly remember showing them pictures of Bart assfucking Lisa and Marge sucking off Flanders and all types of hardcore shit. I remember sittting infront of the computer and looking over my shoulder at them smiling like hell, my dad looking slightly uncomfortable. ""Thats nice, son"" my mom said. I'm sorry mom & dad."
I got away,"I am writing this from my new home. For the first time in ages I feel completely safe, and it is the best feeling ever. 
I recently escaped a terribly abusive relationship with  a jealous, manipulative and controlling man with a tendency to violent behavior. 
I stayed for too long. Fear, isolation and promises make it hard to leave. But when he killed my pet because he thought I looked at a guy in a flirty way, I knew I had to get out or he would eventually kill me. 
I am fortunate to have an education that open doors in many countries, even if I haven’t been working for a while (controlling men dislike women with careers).  
So one day when he was taking the car to the garage to get some repairs done, I saw my opportunity and took it.  I threw some belongings into a backpack, and headed for the air port. I acted as if someone suddenly hit autopilot and everything happened very quickly. I had planned this in my mind many times, but suddenly I had the courage and determination to carry it out. 
I had no family in the country I was about to leave behind, my older sister being my only living relative. She had moved across the globe to start a family. How I had missed her. 
 I left my wedding ring, my mother’s  emerald  earrings  and  my watch at the pawnshop to pay for an emergency passport and a plane ticket.  He of course didn’t let me have any money of my own.
I phoned my sister from the airport in what I like to think of as my new country.  I only had to say her name and that I needed her. She dropped everything and came to get me. She had no idea what had been going on, why we had lost touch so suddenly. 
I got my life back. My sister back. I have a family now,  a life, a home where I don’t fear for my life.
My only remaining wish is that I could warn all other women. 

Edit: I'm overjoyed by the kind comments! I would never have guessed so many would care - thank you all! 

Edit 2: Oh dear what a huge response to this post! I know it's a bit silly off me, since none of you know me, but I feel wonderful that people out there care and take a moment to make it known. You restore my faith in humanity. "
My entire professional life has been faked,"Every job I've ever gotten was through faked resumes. 

I've worked in Physical Therapy with a fake resume saying I had previous experience in the field, a degree in anatomy, volunteer experience, etc. 

I've worked in IT, setting up Wifi/internet/printer connections for small businesses, hardware repair, etc. Again, faked my resume, work experience, credentials/certs, and got hired. Literally everything was learned on the spot through google or other online resources. I even got two raises in less than a year with that company. 

Most recently, I was hired as a manager at Sears after claiming I had a decade of managerial experience at Target and Circuit City.

I'm not sure what the point of this is, but I haven't really told anyone about this and I want to get it off my chest. I have no passion in any specific field, I get bored and disinterested very quickly, and this is my way of changing it up every few years"
"To the people that read this, I love you.","Edit:  Thank you all for the positive response this post has gotten.  I am really happy that I could make people smile and let them know that they are cared about.  No I don't know you, but I feel like if I don't try to use my heart to help somehow, then what good is it?  I mean, love grows and heals people when you share it.  I think this is the best way I can do that.  I tell all my friends and my family I love them every day.  I have Cerebral Palsy and I spend a lot of time on my PC, and Reddit in turn, so why not tell one of my favorite communities on the 'net that I care for them, because without knowing it, they care for me every day.  :)  You all help lift me up and I'm so grateful.

I love you. I love you because you are reading this. You're taking time to read what I wrote and I love you for it. I love you because you have a heart, and in this moment it is connected to mine. 

I love you because you know pain, in some way at least, and in that way, you resonate with me. You have suffered, are suffering, or will suffer, but your heart will not suffer alone, because even though I don't know you, I love you. I love you because I can, and it feels good. 

I love you because I can. Even anonymously.   I love your joy because it brings me joy. I love your passion because it inspires me. I love your fury because it frightens me. I love your courage because it tempers my weak heart. 

I love you, even though I do not know you, because I know the gift of love, and to be without that, is to be truly lost. "
I finally have a warm place to pee (FLUFF),"I have worked at my job for 15 years. 15 winters I have had to use the restroom that was the coldest place in the building.  Last week while freezing/peeing, it hit me. I don't think our ceiling vent is opened. I didn't have the time to investigate it that day, but the following day I grabbed a ladder and sure enough the F""ning shutter? was closed. I couldn't get it opened so I enlisted the help of another employee and BAM we have **HEAT.** Now I'm going back and forth between I'm a freaking genius for finally figuring it out and what a moron I am for not checking that 1st around 14-1/2 years ago.

I'm sitting with my friend's kids while he's in jail,"She hit him. He called the cops. She said he pushed her.

This has been going on for months now.

He's a classic domestic violence victim and she's a crazy violent drunk.

He keeps letting her back in.

She's in jail, too. Felony assault.

I do what I can but I can't save him. I don't know what's going to happen tomorrow.

Praying he doesn't catch charges when she has a record of being the aggressor.

I've never been exposed to domestic violence like this.

It's a mess and I wish I could fix it for him. He's my best friend. Hate to see his life in ruins.

Seriously if someone hurts you, don't let it get out of hand. He stands to lose everything.

He's a good person and not stupid. This can truly happen to anyone.
"
Cried like a baby in the fitting room at Kohl's because all the pants I picked were too big,"Been on a long journey and lost about 60 lbs with about another 70 to go. Went to buy jeans for the first time in probably eight months. It's normally an emotionally exhausting time that leaves my self esteem in ruins and ashamed of my body. 

Grabbed some jeans in what I thought was my size and went into the room expecting the usual disappointment, but the smallest size I picked were too big. I don't know why, but it struck me like a super emotional bolt of lightning and I started crying happy tears. All the hard work and time I've put in is starting to pay off and my pant size is back in the teens for the first time in almost 4 years.

It was very exciting and liberating and I don't really have anyone I want to share this with in my personal life."
NSFW I bought plan B today and my bf made me feel good,"**Background:** we are in our early 20s, and he just recently got a full time job and I'm still a student. We're decently well off, but would consider ""wasting"" money to buy plan B quite expensive ($40+). This whole incident was totally our fault, not blaming anybody, but I just wanted to share the experience with you guys. Here it goes....

We haven't seen each other for over a week + haven't gotten some in over a month, so I guess the tension was high. He asked if he could just ""slip it in"" and being the big dumbasses we were, it happened. It was just going to be a ""few strokes"", but who were we kidding. I never thought that without the condom, it would not only feel good for him, but for me as well. I asked him to go get the condom halfway, and he was about to - but we both realized that the box was empty. We stood there in awkward silence, and my dumbass said, ""Let's continue, just pull out."" He pulled out in time and it was great.

Then common sense came crashing down to me as I was sitting on the toilet trying to pee out any UTI-causers. I had a period tracker and realized that I was fertile this week (along with some other signs). Then I was wondering if we really \_did\_ pull out in time. Then I thought about whether I should buy plan B just in case. But we did everything fine... minus the condom part. Cool, glad to confirm that I have an IQ of 10 when I'm horny. What if I get pregnant? But it's so expensive... So what if I get pregnant? We both said we didn't care and we'd get an abortion if that were the case. But that would suck, because that would be our ""first child together"". It's almost exam week too, I won't be able to study if I keep thinking about this. It's going to be another 2 weeks before I get my period! 

&#x200B;

So here I am, rambling in my head. I guess it made me look a little worried and quiet. My boyfriend turned to me and said, 

Him: ""Hey babe. Are you okay? Are you worried?""

Me: ""Yeah. I actually am. I know we pulled out in time and everything, but I'm still worried. What if?"" 

Him: ""Let's go get Plan B then. I don't want you to worry and I know your exams are up soon. I'll drive us to the nearest pharmacist and we can get some burgers after. I'll split with you."" 

Me: ""Really? You'd split (obviously he should bc it's both our mistake but let's just say my prev. bf has been a huge dickwad and I'm still unfamiliar w/ the concept of being treated properly) with me? 

Him: ""Of course, it'll give you a peace of mind and me a peace of mind. \*Pats head\* "" 

So the ride there, I was just all smiles, and glad that he spoke up when I was afraid to and made the decision easy for me to make by offering to split. $20 is still a lot for just sex, and I know he's a frugal guy because he's saving up. He also made a comment, ""Holy shit, we could've bought 2 boxes with this money. Let's never do this again."" I laughed and said, ""That was super expensive sex. Never again."" 

&#x200B;

And that's why I bought plan B today :-)

Ravioli,"When i was 12 years old and my parents left to see a movie and have dinner, i was home alone. I opened a can of ravioli and stuck my penis inside. Right in the middle of the kitchen, window blinds open, i look out the kitchen window and i see the terrified look of my neighbor looking directly at me. I’m not sure if he ever told anyone and it haunts me to this day wondering who knows."
I just wanted to tell someone,"Today I made it back to my boyfriend's arms after a horrendous, shitty week visiting my hometown. I found out I passed the GED test. My doctor emailed me with news that I don't have cervical cancer. I don't have many friends, but later tonight I will be surrounded by the few people who want to be around me.

Today is a good day and I hope everyone else is having a good day, too."
My SO just died in a freak accident on the 2nd day of our vacation and I am sitting alone in the waiting room at a hospital in Cancun.,"Still in shock and not fully processing. Just hours earlier we joked about dying and spending the rest of our lives together. 


 We both have challenges with relationships and finally felt we had found the one we could be with forever. We are not young (48 & 54) but we were ready to start life over again. Only together 10 months but it moved quickly and was the best relationship either of us has ever had. 


I feel numb right now but am dreading when the shock wears off. 


I know that you knew it and I said it many times but again, I love you Futurenobody. XXOXOOOX

UPDATE

Thanks for all of the kind messages from everyone. Now that it is day time it is sinking in and the tears are flowing. I have been speaking with his family and friends as well as the US consulate and hotel guests and staff. All have been very gracious and supportive. 

I am flying home tomorrow. 

For the curious, he was electrocuted which caused him to fall off a balcony. It was quick. 

LATER TODAY

I have been speaking with his sister and several long time friends. They are all trying to comfort me while holding back their tears. He was such a charismatic person that he was impossible to ignore. Not for everyone, but for those that got him he will leave a big gaping hole in their lives. 

I recently left my job (which I was totally burned out from) and was looking forward to adopting his unplanned, come what may lifestyle. My future was already fluid but now I don't have him to flow with. "
To the farmer who gave me his coat and prayed for me...,"Early this morning I was involved in a car accident. A fuel truck came into my lane and I swerved to miss it, by doing so my car slid off the road and down into a cow pasture. My car basically fell off a cliff and I tore down the gate and almost hit a cow. As I was getting out of the car (it was pouring rain) I lost my footing and slid into the fence which happened to be electric. It completely knocked the wind out of me and thankfully the farmer was outside and saw it all. He came running and pulled me off the fence, I had been laying on it on my back. He didn't show one bit of anger. He took his coat off and laid it on top of me and said a prayer while holding me and waiting for help. I am so thankful to him. It was not the morning I expected and I'm sure the farmer felt the same way. Thank you sir for staying out in the freezing rain and holding my head and comforting me. I owe you everything. What a blessing. "
"Fuck America. There, I said it.","My fiancé and her mother have huge medical bills right now because of her stepfather's stroke as well as my fiancé's medical condition known as HS (skin disorder that also messes with your immune system) that has caused her to have to be seen in the ER a few times this year. They have no insurance because her mother lost her job almost two years ago and hasn't been able to find another since. They are almost $100,000 in debt right now because of America's bullshit health system and might have no choice but to file for bankruptcy.

Only in America are we told ""healthcare is a privilege and not a right"". That's basically saying that those that can't afford healthcare deserve to die. Do people not even realize how fucking sociopathic this is? Thousands, if not millions of people have died because they couldn't afford health insurance and those greedy fucks at Congress don't even give two shits.

Fuck America. "
Her kiss gave me life.,"I was going through the motions, always on autopilot. I spent more time sleeping than I did awake, with no desire to see the next morning. I had accepted that my life would always be dark. It didn't rain all the time, but a cloud would always be close behind me. I drove without a seatbelt, wondering what it'd be like if someone crossed the median and hit me head on. A body of water looked like the perfect place to fall asleep. The thoughts were intrusive and breaking me. I never allowed myself to feel joy, because I knew in my heart it wouldn't last. The pendulum would always swing, and I would always be kicked while I was down. Any day could have been the day I just ended it all. But then she kissed me.

It was so simple. Small, but profound. When she first leaned it, I jumped back in disbelief. My best friend, whom I loved more than anyone, wanted to kiss me. Her lips meeting mine was pivotal. I was truly alive in that moment. I felt joy. I felt love. I was so safe with her. Happiness existed, even for a broken soul like mine. She breathed life into me. 

That was six months ago. Now we are stupid happy, and I look forward to each day. There will never be enough time, because life is too short, but her and I are really going to live with the time we have. I had so much to live for without ever knowing it. She saved my life, and I may never be able to repay her for giving me that second chance. 

Edit: Some people are sounding concerned that she is the only source of my happiness, this is not the case. She helped pull me out of the depression I was in, and this has kick started my ability to work on myself and see the world in a different light. "
Update to proposal...,"She said yes!!!

I was full of nerves and couldn't get myself under control so I stood in our room at like 2am while she was watching TV (we stay up late...) and I just screamed at the top of my lungs ""M'LIESE!!!! WILL YOU MARRY ME?!""

Then it was funny because all I hear from then on is her and the dogs pitter pattering across the floor to our bedroom.

She pushed the door open and just stood there the dog ran between her legs. It was pretty hilarious.

So in the most deadpan, ""don't fuck with me"", voice imaginable she says, ""Is this serious?""

I told her I was and showed her the ring. 

After that, the night/morning was an episode of crying, cuddling, and selfies. "
My SO sent me a nude and it made me cry,"He sent it while I was asleep, so I had no warning. I woke up, still blinking away my drowsiness, and checked my phone. My boyfriend and I are long distance. Its not uncommon to wake up and have many messages from him. About his day, or whatever else. But when I checked it today, there was a photo of him completely exposed. 

He's never sent me any risqué photos before so I was pretty shocked. But the thing about this photo, you guys... Its so, so breathtakingly gorgeous. It doesn't look like lewd pornography, it looks like art. The whole point of it is to turn me on but instead I sat there like a sap, taking it in and thinking about how beautiful he is. God, my heart feels so warm and I'm just... I'm so happy. I'm so lucky. Not because of his looks, but because he trusted me with that. Because it reminded me that someday I'll be waking up beside him, unabashedly casual with our nudity, not naked out of lust but naked for comfort, and that'll be the most normal thing in the world. 

I don't know if I'm making any sense. But this photo warmed my heart so much I cried a bit. I just love him so much. I can't believe how happy he makes me. "
4 Years and now finally success!,"Me and my wife have been trying to get a baby for around four years, and now she is finally pregnant. (8 weeks so far)

I'm just so fucking happy!!!
Who cares about bad KPI's and boring meetings at work right now - 'Cause I'm having a BABY!!! 

Enjoy you day Reddit!!!"
To the 20 year old that's sleeping with my ex husband,"I would be lying if I said I have achieved a complete state of peace and acceptance when it comes to this whole situation.

However, given that there's no going back from this, I have come down from my initial rage, fury, and embarrassing fits of sobbing, and leveled out at a more ""mellow"" simmering pot of emotion.

I wish I could have been this collected the day you showed up with him when he came to collect his crap. You had a great time standing there laughing at me while I went off on the both of you. Admittedly, I probably would have been hard pressed to not be amused if I had been you at the frumpy woman with mascara down her face and blood shot eyes from lack of sleep. You saw me at my worst, my absolute rock-bottom worst, and you flipped your pretty hair and got into his car and I could see you both grinning as you back out of the driveway. I have never contemplated going to jail so seriously in my life.

The weeks that followed were some of the worst I have ever experienced. I went through a lot of emotions there, some really dark things I didn't think were possible to feel. I tortured myself at night replaying everything over and over again, I found myself obsessively checking social media. The fact he just left, that he was somewhere out there laughing and happy, while I could be hanging from a shower curtain, it just completely broke me. I spent 15 years with this man and for what? Those are fifteen years I never get back, and now I get thrown back into the singles pot with the disadvantage of a lined face, the beginnings of gray hair, and the lack of all that youthful radiance that makes those second glances happen.

It took so much time to get here. A lot of  group therapy sessions, a lot of one on ones. A lot of forcing myself to get out of bed, to clean, to shower, to rebuild my life  in a smaller more compact way so that this gaping hole was no longer there.

It was so hard to get over hating you. You were me, 20 years ago, but better. You didn't care about me, or what your fun with him had caused. 

And then slowly I began to accept things in a different light. 

He was a broken man. He always was, really. He always needed more, an upgrade, another promotion, this years car model. Nothing was ever enough for him. I suppose I should have seen the pattern more clearly to realize that eventually I was going to need upgrading too.

And the thing is, one day you're going to be me. Time stops for no one. You're beautiful and radiant now. But in 5 years? 10? If he even sticks around that long. His need for something better won't stop. You'll lose the allure when you begin to bicker. He'll stop calling you so often. He'll come home later and later. 

And then one day, you'll be sitting at home in your bathrobe, and a woman will call his phone. You'll pick up, and she'll say his name or petname in a sexy little voice and you'll know the time has come for his upgrade. You'll stand in the kitchen, mascara down your face, hair a mess, eyes bloodshot, and you'll watch him pull away in his new car model of that year with his new and improved younger, more perfect version of you. 

Good luck."
I keep forgetting I'll be dead soon and I make these plans with my husband and...,"I just forget. There's no pain or any problems until the very end. So I just keep forgetting. We both do. We say, ""Next year we should take a trip to..."" and then we just look at each other in horror when we realize, when we remember. There won't be a next year for us as a married couple. He'll be taking trips, just not with me. With his new wife. He's young enough to have children, still. Will the person I've been with for 20 years start a family after I die? We were each other's firsts; he is my only and will be my last. Will it be like I wasn't even here? Will his kids know about me? Anything at all? Will she make him stop talking to my family? A family he's been a part of since he was 20 years old? My family put him through school. We are very much a part of each other's lives. 

The worst part is not knowing him anymore. Knowing that this is all there is. I know I won't realize I miss him when I'm dead, but I miss him now while I'm alive for when i'm going to miss him when i'm dead. Will she help make his death not so awful the way I would? Is she going to cater to him or is she going to be impatient? I hate that he may have to suffer, and even moreso, have to do it without me. He always tells me we should make a suicide pact, but then we laugh because ""Wait, what about the cats, though? They hate everyone but us. One of us has to stick around to make sure they're okay."" And then we talk about travelling and we forget again and then we remember."
My dog IS that important,"I took my dog to the vet today and he has cataracts in both eyes. The initial surgery is going to cost over $3,000 and there was never a question that I was going to pay to have this done. A few people have expressed shock that we are actually going to pay this money ""for a dog"". 

I know that I'm getting soft in my old age, but fuck you. My dog has been my faithful companion for the last 9 years. He has been by my side when I was just trying to get my career off of the ground, during those long nights when my kid wouldn't sleep, when an unethical employer shafted me out of $25,000, through the all-nighters in grad school, and simply when I wanted nothing more than to sit on my deck and have a beer. 

Nine years is middle aged for a Jack Russell. They easily live 17 years or longer. I don't know how I could in good conscience let him go blind when I could do something to prevent it. $3,000  isn't cheap, but he isn't just ""a dog"". He's my friend. He's my son. People say that pets become less important when you have your own 'real' children. Well, fuck that noise. He is more important today than the first day he came home.

I've got your back, [buddy](http://i.imgur.com/44Qdwi7.jpg), and I am going to make you okay again.

**Edit:** Firstly, I want to thank everyone for their kind words. So, thank you.

Secondly, I am humbled at the generosity that many people have shown, like /u/Mr_Horse_ and several people who PMed me. Fortunately, we have enough money in our rainy day fund to cover the surgery. If you are feeling generous, please donate to your favorite charity instead and if you don't have one, there are plenty of no-kill shelters that are woefully underfunded and understaffed. They could use your help far more than we can.

Lastly, to those who have angrily questioned my intelligence and the breed of my boy, I can assure you that I know his lineage and he is indeed a Jack Russell. JRTs aren't bred for aesthetics, but instead for health and how well they can work. That is why there is such a variance within the breed. There are [smooth coat JRTs](http://www.petguide.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/jack-russell-terrier.jpg), [broken coat JRTs](http://www.imagepuppy.com/shared/806b7268cad82bbff73036ebee159955.jpg), and [rough coat JRTs](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/af/Rough_Coated_Jack_Russell_Terrier.JPG) like my boy. If anyone has questions about the breed, I am happy to answer them, because they can be wonderful companions...

**Edit 2**: People have also been asking about the well-being of my dog. He's doing well. The surgery isn't for a few weeks and in the meantime he is chomping happily on his toys, eating treats, and curled up by me feet as I work. He's a little jumpy, which is unusual for him, but we found out that he can only see light and shadows out of one eye (the other eye is doing the vast majority of the work for the moment). The cataracts progressed extremely rapidly in that one eye. I can only imagine that the loss of vision in that eye has been disconcerting for him. He actually flinched when I went to pet him from that side because he couldn't see that it was my hand coming for him. Hopefully, the surgery goes off without any complications and he's back to his old self..."
I know what it feels like now. To die.,"I died. In the hospital, exactly 2 weeks and 6 days ago. I died in my sleep and had to be revived. They gave me a pacemaker. It's so strange how life is.

I was always telling myself in the back of my head that I was going to kill myself in the pine barrens one day. Way way out there, where nobody would ever find me and have to be disturbed by the discovery of my necrotic flesh. Isn't it funny? How I got hospitalized in the pine barrens? How my heart issue was discovered just by chance during annual training? I was destined to live.

This year truly sucked in a lot of ways. But things have gone up. Gone up so much. I was so ready to kill myself. I was. Hell I might not have even made it another few months after I got back home. But one little ""Hey you look kinda pale"" led to all this. 

Sure now that I have a pacemaker I'm being medically seperated from the Marines, but now that I don't have to go to drill I have so much more free time. It's an honorable discharge, and my surgery was completely paid for. My platoon bought me a ball ticket. And I'll always be a Marine.

So I died. The funniest part was that I didn't even know. I woke up in the morning and thought I'd be discharged from the hospital. Nope. The doctor was there and said I was getting a Pacemaker ASAP. I didn't even know. I had a stupid dream about some old western town in a canyon. There were people dressed in dark clothes just silently walking around, almost robotic. No crazy lights or seeing dead relatives. Oh well.

It all happened so perfectly. Everything fell into place. And I did die where I wanted to, right at a heart hospital dead center of the Pine barrens in New Jersey. I just came back."
"Being a ""good dad"" and spending hours in the park with my son is heartbreaking.","First of all there are quotes around ""good dad"" because it shouldn't be that unusual or commendable for a father to spend time with his kid. I love my kid and spending time with him is an important part of my life. 

It's heartbreaking because lots of other kids see me in the park with him and they come up and talk to me. Kids who don't have ""good dads"", or good mums for that matter. One minute we're talking about Dora the Explorer or Minecraft and the next minute it's *""My dad comes home drunk and hits my mum""* or *""My dad smashed my iPad with a hammer because I was late""*. Kids who haven't seen their dad in three years and nobody will tell them why. Kids who visit their dads every two weeks in a ""big castle"" which they don't know is the local prison. Kids who get hit, not just slapped or spanked but hit, hard, with a stick. 

I can't be a good dad to them all. 

**Edit**: some people have asked where I live and whether this is really common. It's a working class/lower middle class urban, multiracial  area in a big city. But trust me, it's not really  about class or race. It's about listening. "
I'm so excited and I have to keep it a secret!,I'm so excited about a surprise I'm planning for my husband. Normally if I'm excited about something I tell him but in this case of course I can't! It's his 30th coming up and he kept saying he didn't want anything but I found out the local zoo does a 'penguin experience' where you can go in and feed them and help with the penguin parade they do. He absolutely loves penguins and he is going to lose his mind when I take him! Aaaaah I'm just so excited!! I can't wait to see his reaction!
My girlfriend acts like a little girl.,"She is 20, almost 21, and we have been together for over four years. She is likes to talk about fairies and princesses and has this intense love for all things ""cute and chubby"" as she puts it, meaning adorably pudgy dogs and bunnies and the like. She loves to tell bedtime stories before we go to sleep, which usually either center around fairies, princesses, or horses. She is obsessed with horses, but without a real desire to own one.

It's the cutest thing in the world. I can't wait for us to get married in a little over a week. I hope she never grows up."

"I'm so sorry, little boy in the hotel swimming pool","EDIT: for those of you who are concerned - Don't worry, the little boy did not drown!

EDIT2: well that certainly took an interesting turn. For the record I often do play with strange kids in the pool but only when their parents are there. And by 'play' I mean swim race up and down, up and down, sometimes letting them win, sometimes beating them and making them try harder, until everyone's tired and goes quietly to bed.  This particular little guy really got to me though with his look of hurt betrayal as older brother dragged him off.

ORIGINAL POST:

You were there all alone when I went down for my nightly swim, which is what I do instead of drinking at the bar when I'm on the road. 

You were fat and kind of tall but I knew you were just a kid because I have a nephew just like you who ended up being 6'7"". Turns out you were only 11 years old.

You sat at one end of the pool kicking your feet in the water because I don't think you know how to swim and watching enviously as I did my laps ( used to swim competitively ). I could tell you wanted to talk, but even though I'm a woman all the pedo hysteria makes me cautious about talking to kids.

I thought your patents would show up but they never did and when the security guy came by I mentioned that you were by yourself in the pool and I didnt think you could swim.

The security guy marched over and quizzed you in an intimidating way, then your handsome older brother stormed in from the exercise area where he had been chatting up the gals all along and dragged you off while yelling at you.

I feel so bad little guy, I failed as an adult. I should have showed you how to swim."
Officially Terminal,"There's really not a lot to say but maybe it will help to say it here. My mystery cancer hasn't responded to any treatments. My Oncologist put my remaining time at weeks to months. I will never know life past 21. 
     
My Girlfriend just lost her brother and two of her cats. My parents have already lost another child but in infancy. There are so many things I'll never get to see. I won't ever meet the men my younger brothers become. I won't be able to give the support my youngest brother needs as an LGBT youth.

I finally overcame depression and figured out how to love life on Earth, but now my visit is ending and my body has become a prison."
Pretty sure my “aunt” is my birthmother,"I believe my true mother, who I will refer to as Ashley, got pregnant in high school, had me at 17, then gave me to her older sister, who I will refer to as Mary, to raise.

I was raised by Mary with two older siblings. While they look extremely similar to each other, neither looks like me- when I tell people they’re my siblings, people are surprised. They both have dark hair, dark eyes and olive skin, while I have blonde hair, blue eyes and paler skin.

Ashley is married to John, who she has been dating since high school. Ashley and John have two daughters, one five years younger than me, the other eight years younger than me. These two girls look very similar to me- both have blonde hair, blue eyes, and quite similar facial structures. I am also a girl and growing up, I spent a LOT of time with this family, much more than anyone else spent with any other cousins, but I was always told that I was babysitting them, and it made some sense. However, I would frequently be with them when adults were around and there was definitely no need for a babysitter. They even took me on family vacations with them! Every Christmas, Ashley and John would buy me, and only me- not either of my “siblings”- expensive gifts. When I was in high school, Ashley, John, and their daughters moved to another state, and Ashley urged me to move out of state to go to college there and stay with them.

Ashley and Mary were raised in a conservative Christian family where sex before marriage was extremely taboo. Ashley also was the only one in her family to pursue college, so it’s very logical that if she got knocked up in high school she would have given me to her older, married sister to avoid controversy and allow her to attend college.

What made me realize this which in hindsight seems quite suspicious as that family clearly looks like me and favored me is that I took a DNA test. I got a good deal on an Ancestry DNA kit and thought, what the hell? I’ll take it.

Both of my supposed parents are of Irish/English descent, but John- who has been with Ashley since high school and would be my father- is proud of his Norwegian descent.

My test came back 46% Scandinavian.

Now, there is a substantial amount of Scandinavian ancestry in the U.K. population, and these DNA tests are very imperfect, but it’s fucking suspicious to say the least.

This entire conspiracy honestly hadn’t occurred to me until I saw those numbers, but t should have. My “cousins” have Instagrams and every day I see them getting older and their faces becoming more and more similar to mine and every time I am shocked.

Throughout my entire life, my “parents” tried not to, but quite clearly disfavored me. My mother used to make sure that I would never outshine my siblings, and always try to make me appear inferior to them. This was done subtly and I believe subconsciously, but I could never understand why my mother got so much delight when I got a bad grade or failed at something, and my siblings did better than me.

I’m not sure if I’m going to confront anyone in my family about this- I think I’m going to try to convince my brother to spit in a tube so that we can test it. He always did “joke” that I was adopted."
I watched my cousin rock her baby to death yesterday,"I REALLY need to get this off my chest. Ultra long. I feel like eighteen didn't signal my change to adulthood, yesterday did. 

My baby cousin, three years old, died yesterday in his mothers's arms. Everyone was there. We are all so close. Death is nothing like I thought it would be. Passed away peacefully is a lie.

They stopped treatment the day before and called everyone to the hospital. He was sitting up, calling out for his daddy, and all he cared about was the water bottles. Not his toys. He just wanted water. I had the thought, maybe we could bring him a Marvel water bottle for tomorrow? He loved Spiderman so much. He stopped drinking that night. 

The next day we all came back. His grandfather, built like a brick wall, crying in the hallway. He was so, so much worse. Ma pauvre tante, his grandmother, the family rock, so strong all the time was lying on his hospital bed sobbing. Her own daughter (baby's mother) has the same illness, you could tell she knows that she will be in the same position one day. 

He was having trouble breathing, very phlegmy, his eyelids were swollen and purple. Feverish and hot to the touch, though I never got to touch him myself. In a way I'm glad that the last time I held him he was fine, he was laughing. 

Everytime he would be moved, to be placed into someone else's arms to say goodbye, he would cry out and scream, ""No mummy, no mummy, no!"" His mother crying, taking him into his arms, and pointing to the camera to get one last picture with her baby is one of the worst things I will ever see. 

After the photos she broke down and wanted some alone time with him. For the last time. After a half hour she called in his dad. And then my poor, poor, poor brave little cousin. Only eight. Losing his little brother to the same disease he has himself. The same disease his mother has. He wasn't in there very long. That was the last time he'd ever see his little brother. The baby worshipped his older brother, he was his idol. I was told he ruffled his hair one last time.

All of us being there, we started to fit into different roles as the hours went on. I feel like we became a net. I kept the children busy, laughing in the playroom. Other people got food. Took the people who couldn't handle it to get coffee. Stayed in the room to be with his mother. His daddy left to self medicate with weed constantly, you could smell it. It's part of the reason they aren't together.

My baby cousin did not want to die. He fought it. He was angry and did not go easy. Some people started trickling away after 10:00 p.m. One child left. Then another. It was just me and my little cousin then, playing Pokemon, but he was taken to sleep at the Ronald McDonald rooms about an hour later.

At that point I went back into the hospital room. I hadn't been in since she requested the alone time as I was babysitting the kids. He was in MY mother's arms. Had been for three hours. She held his hand. It was hard not to cry. Apparently a nurse had been in recently and had asked his mother whether she wanted to know what stage he was in, whether she wanted to know the signs she was looking for, how soon she thought he would die. And she refused it all, didn't want to hear any of it. She wasn't ready.

Not five minutes was I in there before his daddy came in and said that his sister was leaving the Ronald McDonald rooms. He was stressed out, saying that someone needed to stay with my little cousin. Saying HE or the mother would have to go. No way was I going to let him stress out my cousin by leaving her son's side or not be there for himself, so I volunteered of course. 

So I left the room and saw my baby cousin alive for the last time. The people in the room, including my sister and mother, told me the story of his death that night and it was out of a nightmare:

- His breathing like someone just finished a race subsided to whimpers, described like a little bird's shallow chirps for air.

- Sometimes he screamed at the ceiling. Another family member thought he looked so angry, still fighting.

- His abdomen becoming rock hard, ma tante (a nurse) draining it from his G.I. tube only for black, inky blood to come rushing out all over her hands. Her saying, ""Oh no, oh no, I shouldn't have done that. Now he's bleeding out."" And just crying.

- Changing his stoma and fungus floating out, like mold on leftovers. It had been growing in his liver.

- Every pause. Every agonising pause, only to wheeze back into it again and again and again. 

- In the last hour, no more crying out for his mummy when moved. He just chirped, the little bird. Sometimes he would open his eyes to look at his dad or his mum, them saying, ""Shh, it's okay.""

- He died five minutes after his grandmother kissed his forehead one last time and told him it was okay to let go. 2:45 a.m.

I was alone in the rooms downstairs, watching his older brother sleep, knowing that when he fell asleep he had a brother and he would wake to world-shattering loss.

The funeral is next weekend. The pallbearers will dress as Marvel characters. 

And in the tiny coffin will lie my baby cousin in his Spiderman costume."
#WeWillAlwaysSupportYouJustin,"#WeWillAlwaysSupportYouJustin is trending on Twitter. 

I'm just going to let that sink in for a little bit. 

This isn't about how much I like/dislike Bieber (I honestly do not care for him or his music, but I know there are people that are in *love* with him, so there's that). 

This is about the fact that thousands -- millions -- of teenagers around the world are trending this. Like, do they not fucking understand that he was arrested for drunk driving?! 

People are quick to counter it with, ""But he only blew a [insert random number here] into the breathalyzer... it's not that bad!""

**I DON'T FUCKING CARE!** HE WAS STILL DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE, ENDANGERING OTHER PEOPLE'S LIVES YOU FUCKTARDS!

I don't hold what people like/dislike against them, but if you stick up for Justin Bieber, I'm going to judge you. Hard. 

Six years ago, my best friend in the world was killed by a drunk driver on his way home from college. He had a full scholarship and he wanted to go to medical school. There's no telling where he would be now. But a woman who had ""just a few beers"" rounded a curb and went out of her lane and hit my friend head on. He died instantly. 

My friend will never get to be a doctor. And I lost my friend. 

But people like to write off acts like what Bieber did as ""not too bad"" just because he's famous, and teenagers/people across the world are spouting off ""I will always support you, Justin!""

I don't fucking care that Justin is just ""going through a rough time."" 

I don't fucking care how much you love/support him. 

He endangered innocent people. Not only his life, but others. I think of my friend that was killed by a drunk driver that was saying the same things that Bieber said. Now we're trending to ""forgive"" him. 

I have so many angry thoughts in my head right now. I just want to smash things. For fuck's sake, people. 

I never thought I would be that person that said ""damn kids today,"" as I'm only 25, but...

Damn. Kids today. Fuck. 

**EDIT:** Wow! Did not expect this Bieber-fueled rant to take off. Thanks to /u/jennyfer847, there may be a way to fight back. To all of those that Twitter, tweet ""#biebercouldhavekilledsomeone""! I feel this would be a great way to bring awareness to the situation. Even if we dont' make a difference, it's the thought that counts. Thank you to everyone who contributed in the comments! "
STOP USING YOUR FUCKING PHONE WHILE DRIVING,"Im so fucking tired of these kinda people. My colleague is one of them. Always talking to her boyfriend about some random shit and even TEXTING. Always driving towards the opposite lane/off the road. Seriously, what the fuck? Respect other people's lives and keep that shit in your fucking pocket. I don't want to get in a car accident because of stupid shit like this. Can't even sit still for 30 seconds without checking that motherfucker. Jesus fucking christ, shit's triggering me so hard. FUCK."
I'm looking for a girl I met on Omegle who talked me out of suicide. Where are you Natalie? I want to thank you,"EDIT 12/13/17: Over a year since I posted things and I’m still getting PMs which is great. I’m so glad people are still reading my thoughts. No I haven’t heard from Natalie, but truthfully I don’t need to find her. This was more of me expressing myself than a genuine attempt to find her. I want to thank everyone for their kind words. I still check this account every now and then so I can still see your PMs. Thanks again reddit! 


Throwaway account.


About 5-6 years ago, I was a depressed lonely person who had no friends. My family gave zero fucks about me or my happiness. My social life was nonexistent and my grades were falling. I spent a lot of time on Omegle talking with strangers and asking people if I should commit suicide. I felt as if it was my only option.


Natalie, you were different. You were the first to actually give a shit about me. You responded with a Lil Wayne quote before realizing the seriousness of my question. You told me your story. You told me about your abusive boyfriend.You told me about how close you were with that knife. You told me about your guardian angel. You told me how you turned it all around. You told me about how you were in culinary school and with a new man.


Natalie, you talked to me. You actually listened to me. I was so close to quitting and you talked me out of it.


Natalie, you are the person responsible for the young man I am today. You are the person behind my turnaround from a depressed, suicidal teenager to a college student who has his shit together. I got accepted into a great medical program out of high school and I am about to start Medical School soon. And this wouldn't have happened with you.


Natalie, if you are out there, I just want to say thanks. Before, I was close to ending it all, and after talking to you, for however brief a time, I became someone else.


I regret not asking you for an email. If anyone here knows a Natalie who has ever attending culinary school within the past few years, please ask if she ever went on Omegle and changed a depressed kid's life. Please help me reach her. I just want to say thanks."
I finally broke the silence and formally reported my uncle for sexual abuse today. On his birthday.,"You never got tired of using little me to your own twisted and perverted pleasure. 


Bigger me won't get tired until she sees you on jail, where you belong and where you can't damage others.


I remember that you used to laugh at the fact that you were born on the 'Massacre of the innocents' day.

Well, you know what they say 'he who laughs last, laughs best'.

Update: Holly molly! I spent the whole day at the Domestic Violence Office and came back a little while ago. 
I set up a counseling session for tomorrow morning, lawyer and psychologist involved. We'll discuss what my chances are and they'll help me bring the case to court.


After that I'll be granted a restraining order. He can't LEGALLY be near me or my house, how amazing is that?


This one is for the little girl who had no one to help her. And for the other million kids and people who suffered or is currently suffering this horrible nightmare.

&nbsp;

To all of you out there: do it. Tell your story. Seek help, go to the police. This kind of incidents can't, and I repeat
CAN'T go unreported. First, because you deserve it. You are worth the try. Second, because even if you don't win the case, or can't even make it to a case,
you will be heard. You'll form part of the statistics and there will be a record somewhere that you stood up for yourself.

My nephew likes my meatballs better than his mom's.,"He swore me to secrecy because he's just the sweetest 7 year old and doesn't want to hurt my sister-in-law's feelings. My SIL is the best mom and one way she shows love is through her cooking. I think he's right and this would hurt her feelings. I can't tell anyone IRL, so I'm telling you all. I feel like a million bucks because he likes my cooking! "
To my wife,"This is a throwaway account, no one must ever know. 

Dear Scarlett, 
I haven't been entirely truthful with you. Our relationship is not as it seems. Let's go back to the beginning. 

First year university. I was scared and alone. Fresh out  ofa high school sweetheart breakup, I was in pain. I needed comfort. I found solace in another new student. She was beautiful, flawless. I was in love. We became fast friends, and within weeks, over a bottle of vodka, we expressed mutual attraction. Of course, I was over the moon at first but, all was not well. She was distant, cold. Sure, the sex was there but it was clear she did not reciprocate my feelings. I moved to confess my love, and she was disgusted to say the least. She cut ties, and despite being in the same group of friends, she did a good job of ignoring and avoiding me. 

Two weeks later. 

House party. Despite not wanting to go, my friend managed to drag me along. She was there. New boyfriend. 26 year old Honours Medicine student, real hotshot. So were you. You turned up in a plain green dress, pretty face. Twin sisters, she said. The predator inside me awoke, and sought you out, charmed you, seduced you, and had you all over me. At that point, you were her. When we had sex, I imagined you were her. To me, you were just a tool I could use to release my heartbreak, or at least I thought you were. You were not as beautiful as her. Her eyes were blue and green, yours a dull common brown. Her hips smooth and strong, yours lumpy. Her face was nice, with smooth skin, yours was long and rough. She was friendly and lively, you were mousy and silent. You were a conduit to my anger. Nothing more.

Thailand had its flood. I saw the TV at work and came home expecting you to be there to discuss it. You called from work, huge project, gonna be late. Ok, I went and got takeaway, watched the news. Something wasn't right. As I laid down, I realised, I missed you. It all changed from there. You weren't your sister, you were you. Your chocolate eyes were deep and shined of excitement, your hips were full, and great love-handles by the way. Your slender face accentuated your high cheekbones, and your adorable freckly face. And while she became loud, nosy and irritating, you were a deep sea of thoughts.  

She went through six boyfriends in a year, and dropped her business degree, leaving her with her 'passion' for liberal arts. We made it together, I got my aeronautical degree, you got your medical science certificate. She's living with her 54 year old 'sugar daddy' of sorts. We're kicking it in our penthouse apartment over the harbour side. 

She tried to come onto me, last year at New Years Eve. Told me I could have what I always wanted. What I wanted? The only thing I wanted was to take you home and get you out of that dress. The look on her face, the look of embarrassment and shock still makes me laugh and pity her at the same time. I left the room, found you and got the nicest handful of ass ever. 

So that's it. My story, of our love, true love. You are the greatest thing that ever happened to me, I love you with all my heart, and I pray God kills me first, cause hell, life would be pretty boring without you."
To the little girl on Omegle.,"I was going through a hard time in my life and an outlet I found was Omegle. I like to genuinely make people laugh so it was a perfect place to me. I would go on there, with a webcam effect that added a cat sleeping on my head, and lipsynch pop songs. Quite often, people sing along or dance and laugh. But there were also a lot of negative comments like asian jokes (im asian), people calling me loser ect. 

After a particularly bad day at home, I went on Omegle for my happy place. But I was receiving a lot of negative comments, and was planning on stop doing what I was doing for good. And then I came across you. You started singing immediately and enjoyed the song. I saw that you were bald and in a bed. You only moved your head but you were happy as can be. That's when I realized you were ill. You told me you were undergoing chemo.

I asked if you wanted me to put a graphic of a wig, but you wanted the cat. So I put the effect on you and you were estatic. You smiled, laughed and then cried suddenly. You told me thank you for being there when you needed someone.

After I got off, I cried also. Thank you for making me do what I like to do, whether others like it or not. I sometimes hope I will see you again so we can sing, but I know that's tough. I want to thank you for being there when I needed someone. 

*edit*: wow thanks guys for the kind words guys. I should have phrased that one part better. but i was definitely not in the unmoderated section, but under the singing tag. 

When I said I gave her the graphic, what I did was stream her camera and added it on. I took a picture and was going to post for proof but thought better of putting a picture of her online.

 Omegle is a great place. Random laughter and great people to meet. I have a lot of fun doing this ""gig"" and people often ask if I have a youtube channel, but I don't. I do it for the smiles for them and I guess for me also. I wish I could talk to her again but that's the thing with omegle, random encounters. I agree she was too young to be on omegle. 

love you guys."
I accidentally ended a strangers life and it still consumes mine.,"1 year ago a homeless man named Wolverine spent all day behind a shitty old building doing meth and drinking a full bottle of vodka. As the sun was starting to set he put on his head phones and decided to run across the street to a  gas station beg for a few dollars. 

1 year ago I was wrapping up a photoshoot and heading home to my husband and 2 beautiful baby boys. My whole life falling perfectly into place. I was super thirsty and decided to pull into a gas station to grab a drink on the way home. 

I never even saw him. My van hit him head on and the crushing thud is what made me slam my breaks. I’m told the impact was horrendously violent. But I couldn’t even remember those few seconds if I tried. When I realized what had happened I jumped out of my car to check on him. I remember feeling relieved because his eyes were open.. so he must be okay. But he was so very far from okay. Because it’s not okay when your eyes are open but there is no life in your body. 

All I could say for an hour or more was “ I just wanted a bottle of water”. I was in complete shock. The kind that just shuts your body down. I was cleared of any fault almost instantly. He was so high he ran strait in front of my van, like he never even saw it. wearing headphones and dark clothes. It was 100% his fault. But being free of fault doesn’t make anything any better. 

All I can remember is seeing his curly hair stuck in the shattered glass of my windshield. My youngest boy has curly hair too. I bet wolverines Mom loved his curly baby hair. The stares from strangers literally hurt. The large crowd that gathered made me feel like I was suffocating. Strangers holding me as I sobbed. My husband, uncle, sister, showing up to the scene. They still have nightmares. I screamed at the emergency room doctor to just make me go to sleep once I finally got to a hospital for my own injuries. I couldn’t bare being awake living this reality another second. 

He was dead instantly. And I knew it. But no one would confirm it for me. Not till days later. But I knew. 

I spent weeks drugged up so I was numb and couldn’t feel the pain of the emotional and physical trauma I’d just been through. But honestly I was thankful for the bruises and bandages. They showed the outside world a glimpse of what I was feeling inside. 

My truth?

I hate him. I hate Wolverine. for choosing drugs. For choosing to risk his life. For running in front of my van. For changing my life forever. For changing me. For forcing me to end his life. For taking me away from my kids for months. For forcing my husband to shower me and hold me as I sob because I just couldn’t do it another day. For still invading every thought a year later. 

Yet, I want to go put flowers on his grave and scream how sorry I am. How so very fucking sorry. 

I wish I had just one other person to talk to. Just one other person who knows what this feels like. They don’t make support groups for accidentally killing someone, in case you’re wondering. And it’s really not something you go around asking for. 

So every day I pretend I’m okay. Because it’s been a year. Because it was just an accident. Because it makes everyone else feel better when I say I’m okay. Because I really fucking wish I was. 

But it’s not okay. 

Not at all. 

I guess time doesn’t heal all wounds. But I’m still holding out hope. "
"Hey kid, I saw you with your grandfather a few days ago","Hey kid, I saw you with your grandfather a few days ago.

It was in one of those overpriced, breakfast-only restaurants that are so popular nowadays around here. You must've been twelve or thirteen (but then I've never been been too good at guesstimating people's age) and alone with your old man. And, to put it kindly, you clearly didn't want to be there. You had that ""shit, I'd rather be at the dentist receiving a root canal treatment"" face. You looked bored beyond what's humanly possible. And, right in front of you, your grandpa tried chatting with you during the whole lunchtime. Oh, he seemed to try really, really hard and he never lost his smile but I could feel he felt this was just not working out the way he intended. He asked about school, friends, a possible girlfriend, even your favorite video game... and failed. But hey, he tried and he tried _hard_.

Now, I'm going to start with the obvious disclaimers. I don't know you. I don't know what you've been through in your life. Maybe he molested you as a child. Maybe your parents beat you up constantly and he turned a blind eye on the situation. Maybe you're abusing drugs. Maybe... a lot of stuff.

But odds are that it's not the case. Odds are that you're a normal kid, coming from a middle-class family who's had a pretty normal life without too many hardship. Odds are thus that, to be blunt, you just don't give much a fuck about the old fart in front of you who's doing his damn best to somehow connect with you. Perhaps you've been kind of guilt-forced to go spend the lunch with gramps while you could be spending time with your friends, playing Minecraft or whatnot. You don't have much in common, except a family bond and a lunch table full of yummy stuffy you barely even looked at.

Now, you're too young to fully realize it but children are something really, really precious - and our children's children, well, they're extra special. I'm way too young to have grandchildren, yet, but I can see how my parents and in-laws treat my kids and I can still remember how much love I received from my own grandparents. I know for a fact that I'd throw my own life away for my kids without a second thought and that their grandparents would do the same. Really, you probably don't realize it but to him, you're special, sweeter than sweet and the greatest thing ever created. So because of that, he's trying to connect with you. Because you're special. Because you're important to him. Because he truly, deeply cares for you.

But, see, there's the age gap. There's a forty- to fifty-year difference in age between to the two of you. When your grandpa was born, WWII was still fresh in the collective memory; the word ""computer"" was not even _known_ by most people; cell phones weren't just not invented yet, they were the stuff of science-fiction; his first TV set probably didn't even have color. He probably doesn't know the difference between the internet and Internet Explorer - IF he even owns a computer. I'd bet he doesn't even own a smartphone or tablet. Gasp.

You're not from the same era: you kind of live in different worlds that happen to share a common physical space.

So my advice, after this wall of text of a rant? _Carpe diem_, carpe the fuck out of the diem, dude. Make an effort to try and reach out to that old man. It _will_ be awkward, I can guarantee it, but you have much to learn from him if you give him a chance.

Otherwise, you'll end up as a thirty-something year old man having lunch in a restaurant with his kids and wife, watching a nearby pre-teen and his grandpa, thinking about how lucky that kid really is and being bitterly and painfully reminded of how much you miss your ol' pappy and how fucking much you'd give anything to have him back and hear his terrible jokes, even to share a simple meal.

EDIT: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! But many more thanks for those of you who shared their stories. As I mentioned in some comments, focus on what you have instead of what you've lost."
To the driver who waited in the Wendy’s parking lot while I panicked about my car over heating in -20 degree weather.,"Thank you kind stranger for staying in the empty Wendy’s parking lot tonight until I got my car started back up. Your car was just sitting there with the lights on and I didn’t pay much attention because I was panicking on what I was supposed to do. I got out of my car and I called my brother. He told me to turn off my car after sighing a million times at the situation I was in. I finally got a hold of my sister who stayed up to make sure I was ok and who was available by phone if anything got worse and I needed to be picked up. I got into my car and looked around wondering how it was just my luck tonight to be stranded on my way home from work and I noticed your car was still sitting there. I waited for what seemed like 30 minutes (about 5 minutes) and then I started up my car. My temperature gauge was back to normal again and I put on my seatbelt and turned on my headlights. That’s when you saw I was in the clear and you started to pull out of the parking lot. You still waited for me to loop around the parking lot before exiting onto the street. And you even waited at the stop light for me after the light turned green for you to turn. 

Thank you kind stranger for just being there while I called and scrambled for help tonight in -20 below weather. Your presence meant a lot to me and I didn’t feel like I was left stranded alone tonight. "
To My Husband of 10 Years,"You’ve been lying to me for the longest time. You’ve been lying to me almost every day. You think I cannot tell? It’s been 18 years since we started dating and you’re a terrible liar. When you lie, I can see in your face, I can hear it in your voice. I know for the longest time that you’ve been cheating on me but I let it slip. Come to think of it, it has been a very long time since you last noticed me. When you wake up, breakfast is ready, you eat and then you leave. When you get home, dinner is well prepared, you eat and do some paperwork and then you sleep. I’ve wanted to ask you what’s wrong and communicate but you barely notice my existence. I wanted to know where I went wrong or where I came short so I can make arrangements to meet them for you. But you were barely home. Not even on the weekends. Until such time I found out you’ve been sleeping around with someone for the longest time. I fell apart upon finding out. I can’t understand; I want to understand. I did what I could to be the best other half anyone could have, right? But I held myself back from confronting you and we went about our regular routine and this has gone one for another year and more.

Until such time, about a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. When I told you, you finally cared. You finally noticed my existence. I felt important to you once again. I was happy. I once again, is visible in your map. And I thought to myself, ‘I think everything is falling into place’. Until such time I found out that you were still in contact with that someone and occasionally rendezvoused with them. And once again it’s back to square one but still, I refused to confront you. I was already happy at the fact that you were noticing my existence. That you once again, give comments about the food I cook for breakfast before you leave for work, the food I cook for your lunch, and the food I cook when you come home. But I never stopped thinking. Thinking that when you’re away, you are with that person; that whenever your phone gets a SMS notification, it’s them. I cried far too many times, away from your eyes. I didn’t want you to see me when I’m weak. I cried because I know that all I have is your pity. Pity because I was sick.
Honestly, I fee l like a beggar; a beggar who deserves nothing but spare change; a beggar who deserves only the leftovers given by those who are more fortunate; a worthless trash of society who deserves nothing but to be shunned. I want to run away, but a homeless beggar like me has nowhere to go; no place to come home to.

But don’t worry, honey. I don’t have much time left anyway. Soon you’ll be free to be with them. You won’t have to go around my back anymore. Because by then, I will just be a bitter memory to you; a nightmare you might have always so avoided. 
To you my love; I’m sorry. I’m sorry if I was not enough. I’m sorry if I was not able to fulfill your needs. I’m sorry if I was too much of a coward to speak up. I love you, believe me, I love you so much and even if you did so much that made me cry, I will still love you.

I hope one day, you’d be able to read this and realize that it’s me. I hope one day you find out that this is the voice I have always suppressed in the last few years of our life together. Honey, you know I love you so much that’s why you are free. Find that person who will make you happy and make you feel content. But I have one request to ask from you: Please do not make that person cry. Do not let them shed even a single tear of sadness and if you did, only tears of joy. Thank you for all the years, sweetheart I love you. "
"I find it so *ridiculously* strange, that we treat Obamacare like it's the worst thing to ever happen, when the direct reasons for its failure is the Healthcare companies involved","I just don't know where else to voice my concern about this... Why doesn't anyone do anything about this? 

Edit: *are

Edit 2: The truth is that more people pay more than they used to, there is no argument there. It is also true that the reason why this happens is because everyone is required to pay the same amount for a plan as everyone else... For example, 'Joe' has a treatable but expensive cholesterol related illness and is 48 years old and will pay the same amount as 'Bill' who is 27 and a super healthy, cross-fit legend. It is relatively worse for Bill if you look at it like this because Bill pays more to support the costs of Joe's Treatments. However, if Joe didn't have healthcare  before, he wouldn't have been able to have treatment at all and might've died. If you look at it like this, it is collectively better for both. The increased amount Bill has to pay to assist in Joe's treatment is directly attributed to what the healthcare company charges.... This basic concept is in every element of the interactions, including college students and the lower income elderly. 

Edit 3: Another thing that happens is companies have been cutting worker's hours so they don't have to pay for their worker's medical insurance.... You will be capped at 19 hours instead of 20 so they don't have to incur the cost... I completely understand a smaller company doing something like this, but for a big institution like a school (college... Let's say big tuition private college) McDonald's or Walmart to do something like this is kind of vile

Edit 4: The SOLE reason you could not get coverage is because you fell into a certain income bracket and your State's legislation didn't expand Medicare coverage

Edit 5: Healthcare coverage (increased costs, not covering certain ailments, Rejected coverage, etc.) was changing before the bill was passed. Not everything that's happening in healthcare (In fact, very little of what is happening) , good or bad, is a result of this bill.  

Edit 6: thank /u/tikitravels for these, they are really informative

My dad defends Syrian refugees,"My dad was telling me about how the old guys in his coffee group were talking trash about Syrian refugees and how Canada shouldn't allow them into the country. 

He asked the guys how many of them came to Canada from somewhere else (all of them) and why shouldn't we give people a chance. 

I'm honestly so proud of him and respect him so much. He's not afraid to voice his opinion, even if everyone else thinks differently. At 76 years old, he's one of the most open-minded, fairest non-judgemental people I know."
Got in a fight with my wife about a fucking sandwich,"My wife likes to make these smoked salmon sandwiches sometimes. And by sometimes, I mean all the fucking time.

Generally her sandwiches are killer, but these ones are just OK. Not bad, but nothing amazing. She loves them though. So she insists on making them for us. A lot. And she makes a lot of them.

We're a pretty egalitarian couple. I don't expect her to cook for me, and vice versa. We get take out a lot, sometimes she cooks, sometimes I cook. Neither of us is much of a chef, so we usually just make simple meals that are reasonably healthy.

But goddamn does she love those salmon sandwiches.

She always makes two of these hulking salmon sandwiches for me. She can polish off two like it's nothing, but me ... well, I just get tired of eating before I finish. It's hard for me to gulp down two of them in full.

But if I don't finish one, she picks at me about it. ""Why aren't you finishing your sandwich? Why?"" I've tried playing the ""I'm full"" card, but she sees right through it. She's a lot smaller than me, but she can eat two, no problem.

So we were talking on the phone today while I was at work, and I asked what she wanted to do for dinner. ""I want to make salmon sandwiches,"" she says. *Great*, I think to myself.

I say that's fine, but decide to man up and be honest. By which I mean, I told her that ""you only have to make one for me."" Of course, that was just an invitation for her to go into Spanish inquisition mode. I felt like Galileo trying to defend my predilection for one, rather than two, salmon sandwiches. Assuming Galileo was trying not to piss off his accusers *too* badly, since he had to sleep in the same bed with them that evening.

Eventually I ward her off, but I can tell she's upset. Who am I to only want one of her salmon sandwiches? What an asshole, right? Realizing this, I text her that I am sorry if I hurt her feelings. She insists that she is not mad, but I decide to apologize a couple more times, just to be safe.  I wanted a solid record of my contrition in case she brought this up again.

Anyway, our kid was a nightmare tonight so we decided to get take out. As we're gorging ourselves on Chinese noodles I comment on how hungry I get during the day.

""Then why can't you eat two of my sandwiches?""

Fuck.

I tried explaining, again, that while I did like her salmon sandwiches, I'm really just fine with one. Really. I just don't like them quite as much as you, you see?

Well that went over like a fart in a crowded elevator. Suffice it to say, this quickly escalated into a full-fledged fight, which mainly centered on the fact that I'm an ungrateful asshole who doesn't appreciate how much my wife does for me, especially when it comes to making salmon sandwiches. When I mentioned that she was possibly being a tad over-sensitive ... well, let's just say that didn't make things better, for some reason.

So I am currently on a drive to ""cool down."" All over a fucking sandwich.

**TL;DR**: Told my wife I only wanted one sandwich, narrowly averted World War III."
"My parents ""adopted"" my orphaned boyfriend tonight and it was the most beautiful moment of our lives together so far.","My boyfriend, Gabriel, has had on of the most difficult lives you can imagine. He grew up terribly poor, lost both parents at a young age, lost two brothers, was abused as he grew up...I could go on but just that would be enough to break me. Still and all Gabriel has more passion and love for life and people than anyone I've ever met. 

Yesterday was his birthday and even then he insisted on cooking for me, my brother and sister and my parents and grandparents. We sort of welcomed him into our family since he doesn't have one to go home to.

So after a great dinner we were all just sitting in the family room talking laughing and playing games together when Gabriel made a comment towards my parents. I don't remember exactly what he said but he finished in saying, ""...Mr. and Mrs. (Lastname).""

As soon as he said that both of my parents spoke up at the same time and told him to call them mom and dad. I remember my mom saying, ""Oh, 'Briel, honey, just call us mom and dad. We're far past the formal stage."" My dad said something similar but I couldn't make out everything he said.

Gabriel just sat quiet for a quick moment and asked them if they were sure. The uh nonchalantly said of course they were and that he was part of the family. They didn't realize how much that meant to him.

Gabriel quietly got up and went to the kitchen. I followed him and he was crying his eyes out. I went and hugged him and after a few minutes my (our) parents walked in and consoled him. He assured them nothing was wrong and explained how much what they said meant to him. 

It was a very beautiful moment we'll cherish forever."
"I stared in the mirror. Shirtless, my wife's blood stained my skin. Postpartum Psychosis Survivors. (Long)","**(NSFW, NSFL,) - Possible triggers - please read with caution.**

Dear Reddit,

Thanks for being the anonymous strangers I can confide to. I don't want to have this story traceable so please no details. One week ago, my wife tried to commit suicide in front of me and my 6 month old daughter. We're doing okay. I've had to repeat that line countless times to our worried family and friends. She's getting help and getting better. 

The Doctors say that it's something called postpartum psychosis. Google tells me it's hell. I can't ever understand what my wife was thinking when she plunged that knife into her chest. She created a puncture wound into her upper right breast and collapsed her lung. She also nicked a vessel and bled internally. 

Screaming ""Oh shit! Oh Shit! Oh Fuck!! I ran into the room and put the baby down. The next 7 minutes would be the longest of my life. I ran back and saw that the knife was dropped. She was standing there, eyes wide open, mouth agape, a sliver of skin split and I found myself peering into her chest. Her cut was about an inch gash and the skin had separated, blood had started pouring out. She was still screaming at me, things I couldn't comprehend. She fought like a lion. She gashed me across the face and I didn't even feel it. I manhandled her into our room where I could keep an eye on the baby (who can crawl now) and grab the towel that would save her life. Blood trailed our floor where I had wrestled her into a corner. I took my shirt off and pressed as hard as I could against her wound.

""Baby! Baby, please! Stop! Let me help you! I implored, as I desperately tried to calm her down. My panic increased tenfold when I saw bright red blood spurt out. A sucking chest wound I could deal with. An arterial wound I could not. Somewhere in the middle of this I had dialed 911 and was screaming at dispatch to send help to my house. I had nightmares about what would happen to my family if someone got hurt so I memorized my address and repeated it like a mantra. 

She had collapsed and I had been able to get a towel switched out with my shirt. I laid her down and cradled her legs with one hand to get as much blood to the heart while pushing against her chest with the other. The Cops pulled up. I had never thought this might happen - ever. That night we had a great family dinner, smiles - affection. But she just hadn't slept in so long. 

I picked her up as gently as I could and brought her to the door. The Cops came in and immediately took control of the situation. Cradled my baby, took pictures of all the evidence and were out of my house before my 3 year old daughter who mercifully slept through all of it in the other room. She never woke up to see the carnage. These guys and gals, everyone who stepped through my door that night; these were Absolute hardcore true fucking professionals. I thank those men and women who saved her life. I tear up right now just thinking about all the compassion that every Dispatcher, Nurse, every Doctor, every EMT, Paramedic, Receptionist, Volunteer, Janitor, Cafeteria Worker, Random fellow Veteran manning the ER desk who took me aside, gave me a hug and told me exactly what the next 96 hours are going to look like. Thank you. Thank you all. I wish I won the lottery cause I would hunt down each and every person responsible for her care and give you all of it. All of it. You gave me the best gift I could ask for. A chance to be with my wife for the next who knows how long (here's to hoping to nanotechnology, better research, and continued existence of people like I met just this last week.) 

The Sergeant asked me to call someone close. I called the closest one. They were there in 5 minutes. He told me to get changed, this was the first time I had looked down at myself. I ran to the bathroom and opened the shower. I turned around and saw something out of a horror film. Eyes wide, hair matted with blood and face gashed with nail marks. I stared in the mirror. Shirtless, my wife's blood stained my skin. A crimson streaky mess I rinsed off while talking the Sergeant through what happened. Everybody was scribbling furiously. Someone bagged up the knife. I had a shirt and a new shorts on and then my friend drove me to the hospital to see my wife. He held me as sobs racked my body and I smoked my 4th cigarette. Then I picked up the phone and started to dial.

No one ever tells you how much you hate your phone when something like this happens. YOU are the epicenter and the only one that can give updates. Everyone wants to help. Everyone wants to know what happened. Sometimes repeating the event is to relive the event. After telling her friends what was going on, I couldn't stand the sight of my cell phone. And I couldn't blame them so I did the best I could.

 I was finally let into the ER room (getting there in itself was a miserable experience - not because of the staff). Protocol dictated that for everyone's safety. They have NO idea who you are and what happened. Their concern is the patient and everyone else can fuck off. They did what's best for her which meant suturing the gash, and placing a chest tube. After verifying that I wasn't the aggressor from the Police, the Nurse came to see get me.

""She doesn't want to see you."" She said, shattering my heart into a million pieces. ""She's asking for her Dad."" - ""He had died a few years I ago."" I replied bewildered. 

""Oh, she didn't tell me that.""

She went off to confer with her team. After coming back she said that I could come with her. I looked at my wife for the first time in what seemed like eternity. She was so pale. I wanted so bad to be in her place right then. To somehow switch bodies so she wouldn't be the one lying on that table. So if something happened, then it would be me that died and my girls would still have a Mother. She was my morning star. The first smiling face I saw every day. The first that greeted me back at home after work. The one that I kissed goodnight, every night. I love her more than my own life. She was the Mother of my two little girls who are my other reasons for existence. She was the one that cradled me when I was crying trying to forget Iraq. 

By all statistics it should have been me. I was a Marine combat vet (reservist) who did one full tour in country. I am not a hero. I still wear the silver bracelet that bears the name of four of them I knew. I was wounded by glass fragments to my face when a sniper punched a hole through the engineer glass that was placed backwards. I have lost too much to remember anymore from those days now. However, I knew what emotionally would come next when something happened to someone you cared about.

And she had tried to kill herself, in front of me. I haven't been able to stop this overlay imagery from repeating itself in my head. I kept seeing her do it. I still see it. I have never wanted something more than for that knife to stab me instead. 

My friends and family are now just called family. Every member of my little tribe has pitched in, done whatever is necessary - no questions asked. My company has donated money and time off to help me out as long as I needed. No questions asked. I was supposed to move that weekend to a different state. My friends made that happen. I am supposed to close on my house in two days, my realtor made that happen. 

The amount of work that went in to help me in the last 200 hundred hours is gargantuan. Faith in Humanity restored. Somehow we're making it. We couldn't have made it alone. If no one came, she would have bled out in my arms and there was nothing I could've done about it. That's a fact. 

Instead, after four days in the ICU she was finally moved to that psych ward. Since that time, I've been able to hold her, comfort her, talk her through her anxiety attacks and be there when her delusions are more real than me. I've gotten everything lined up for a slow slow transition to the new apartment and her new life about 12 hours from her family. If she does well and if she wants to, we stay. If not we move back closer to home no questions asked.

I've come to understand that compassion and love are the best best medicine in recovery. She loves me. She desperately wants me to know that. I desperately want her to believe that I never doubted her. I want her to know that I never stopped loving her. We had no fights beyond anything I'd find unusual. Never did things get physical. We always had strict rules for arguing and stuck to them - usually that framework helped us move past problems pretty easily. 

The signs finally became clear. She had just said goodbye to every support system in her known world and agreed to go to my new job with me. We were excited because it was going to be near the mountains and we loved the area. Talks of hiking, camping, and a buying a new home was really invigorating. Life was good. But the stress was still there. Like a poison that spurred her mind onwards and in cycles over the lists of endless things that needed to happen for us to move. The stress caused her milk to drop, the baby was then exclusively breastfed. She had to wake up more often to feed. In the morning she always looked exhausted.

I noticed this fairly early on and tried to stay awake for a few hours, or at least cradle the baby when she was awake while my wife got ready. We are a team. We rocked at life. I thought I was doing as much as possible to help. I had my own worries and a high stress job to close down (it is very rewarding, just moving locations - not the company). I came home exhausted as well.

Either way I missed it. I didn't notice the more frequent silent spaces that filled our conversations. I didn't notice the highs and the lows. I did notice the weight-loss, tired eyes and paranoia. It was the moment I decided to call her mom to talk to her that she ran into the kitchen and I watched her plunge that knife.

We will make it though. We always do. We're not alone. No one ever truly is. Humans tend to do funny things when one of us is injured. We do whatever's necessary to help. People are amazing. That's what is getting me through this.

That being said, I think I know what I need to do. I'll make sure she gets all the help she ever deserves. I'll make sure to follow the advice of all the medical professionals who took care of her. I'll make sure to get rest, food, sleep because I have to be strong.  I have to be her rock right now. And I cannot crack. That's why I want to thank you my fellow Redditors as well. Thank you for listening to my story. Helping me process exactly what the fuck happened. I remembered that writing always helped me to put my thoughts in order. Writing this finally feels like I got a handle on where I need to go. It's one in a long series of steps in getting the complete nightmare off my chest. But because of people. I know that we'll make it. 

Thank you,

Semper Fi 




**Edit (update) - on mobile (sorry for the formatting)**

The outpouring of support from completely random strangers just confirmed what I learned last week. People are amazing. Thank you all for the responses, prayers, well wishes and good vibes. My wife suffered a complication yesterday. Her lungs developed an infection so she's in surgery right now to drain the rest of it. She will however be okay.


Words can't describe how I am feeling right now. Blessed doesn't come close to it. She is doing okay otherwise. She's eating and sleeping and most importantly she's lucid and back in reality. She's overwhelmed with guilt for what she did and no matter how often or how sincerely I tell her that's there's no room for anger or resentment in my heart, I know that's a battle she'll have to win against herself. I am going to do the best I can to make sure she wins that fight. It will take a long time until things are back to a new normal but the journey to recovery has started.


To everyone that took the time to read this - thank you for sharing my pain. Thank you for your encouragement and support. If your ever in a situation like this please get help. You can't win this fight on your own. Battles are won by teamwork. 


Ill update again when I have some more news but until then I can only convey the sincere and deep gratitude I have for everyone who helped. I love you all, I thank you all.

**Edit 2 - last update for the night** 

She's out of surgery and resting right now. :) They managed to get all the infection out of her lungs and she has two chest tubes draining all the old blood, etc. out. We are on the road to recovery. I told her I had to write what happened so I could get the thoughts out of my head and get some sleep. She's totally fine with this being on the internet. She's also expressed interest in reading the comments whenever she gets better. I wrote the story for her benefit as well so when she's ready, she can start processing everything. (I'll never pressure her to however - it might be too much to take in. We're on her pace and her schedule.) 

Some have asked via PM if I am religious. At the risk of offending my religious friends, I have to say I am not religious at all and I don't believe faith in a higher power has helped me in this situation. My religiosity died in Iraq. Instead I relied on my faith that other human beings were doing all they could to save my wife. That belief was vindicated. That being said, I would *never* think less of someone for turning to their own world philosophy for comfort whatever that may be. Prayers are just another way to express concern and wish others well so I am never offended if someone tells me they're praying for us. If you are religious and it helps you in your life, I would certainly applaud that and defend that right, it just simply isn't for me.

I've also gotten a lot of wonderful words of encouragement via PMs and a few requests to cross post this to other relevant subs - I am all for it except I have no idea how to do that. This is the longest post I've ever had on Reddit and the community is just as wonderful and supportive as I thought it would be. Once again, you guys have my gratitude for the outpouring of emotional support, personal stories, etc. There were a few times when I was in and out of the hospital that I sat in my car crying reading what was written. It certainly helps to know we're not alone.

Thank you all again.  
"
It's my birthday,But I'm alone and a bit apathetic. I miss being a kid when birthdays feel so special.
I am ashamed at what my country has just done.,"I'm 20. Young. More open minded than older voters.

I've grown up in schools with Polish, Lithuanian, German students, all whom I love to bits. I've played football in the parks with them, completed school projects with them, and will graduate with them in the closing years of my current degree in Politics and IR. 

Staying up all night to what the experts thought would be a complete 'remain' win. Those experts should be fired.

Just now, looking at BBC with a correspondent standing in front of the Elizabeth Tower, I actually had a bit of a lump in my throat that the London skyline, **my** London skyline, will shortly not be a part of the Eiffel Tower, Brandenburg Gate, Øresund Bridge club. We're now independent.

Judging by the results and from what I've gathered, it's another typical case of open-minded youths being outnumbered by greedy baby-boomers (who have already knackered our economy) and elderly wenches who are too scared of outsiders, even though we **need** those *'outsiders'* to compensate for the ageing population.

I'm ashamed that my country has, literally, 'Trumped' over Europe by burning it's biggest bridge into the world stage rather than building them. We've turned our backs on the world's biggest trading bloc, and we will never get another say or influence on how things should be run.

Britain **isn't** a world power anymore. We **have no empire**. The European continent is the only way we have any true representation. Churchill, the man who pleaded for a united Europe, must be turning in his grave.

How can isolation be progressive?

Today my country has just done a U-turn on one of the greatest projects ever thought up by mankind - a project which stopped blood-shed in the world's most developed continent for ~70 years. And now it's looking like it will crumble now that similarly Eurosceptic countries have seen that leaving *is* an option.

Britain may have potentially ended the world's biggest, best, most inspirational act of good will - all because it's too much of a coward to contest, debate and challenge the EU."
"My wife cheated on me. She claims that it was not cheating because she is 'polyamorous'. I pointed out that she never informed me of this, nor asked my consent to seek other partners.","She replied that she didn't ask me because she knows I would have said no.

Also, I don't have the right to 'control her'.

Now suddenly, *I* am the jackass.

In what world, on what planet did I do something wrong here?

I have always tried to communicate with her, good or bad. I've never mistreated or neglected her. I'm not exactly Lothario but I am far from impotent.

Sorry to vent guys. This just really hurts.

I have a zero-tolerance policy for cheating, and now I have to put it in effect. The house is in my name. We don't have any kids. We don't even have any substantial shared assets. I want to just tell her to leave and file for a divorce.

I love her, but I refuse to flagellate myself by letting *my* wife lay on her back for somebody else and pretend like it means nothing.

UPDATE:

About an hour and a half ago, my wife figured out that I haven't come to bed all night or morning and came to talk to me. I told her that I wanted her to leave, and I plan to file for divorce.

We have a Prenuptial Agreement, signed by a Private Judge (witnessed by my attorney at the time), that declares if either of us motions for divorce, a TRO can be put into place to ensure we divide property reasonably. However, since the house and bills are in my name and our bank accounts are separate, we have little in the way of shared debt or shared property to try and divide. Divorce Court could be much less of a headache thanks to that. If we file together and don't argue over things in front of a Judge, we could be on our separate ways in 60 days according to laws in our home state.

I told her that rather than sign a TRO and make her have a police escort every time she wants to come over and pack more stuff, I would be willing to cash in a week of vacation from work so she can gradually move her things out while I am here. I could use a break from work anyway, given the circumstances. I will inevitably have to cash in more of my vacation time when we actually get around to Divorce court. 

She never actually protested the idea of us getting a divorce. She was more concerned about not having a credit card to put down for a U-Haul or Penske truck rental, and having to call some 'hillbillies' from Two Men and a Truck to move her things for her. 

She asked if she could stay here for the week while she moved her things out. I told her no. She asked me how she was supposed to be sure that I wouldn't 'destroy' or 'tamper with' her belongings in the meantime. I told her that I'll be writing down and taking pictures of everything she removes from the house, just so she (and the Judge, if we take that route) can be sure that they leave in one piece.

Then the accusations started. Accusing me of not trusting her (after cheating on me and accusing me of being untrustworthy to be alone with her little hummels and old clothes and fucking toaster oven), accusing me of not loving her anymore, etc.

I tried, repeatedly to make her understand that the best thing to do now was go stay at her Parents' place, call Two Men and a Truck or whoever the hell, get her things moved out of here, file divorce with me as a mutual agreement and get on with our lives in two or three months.

She finally caved in, gave me her key, packed two bags and took off. Our last exchange of words was this;

Wife: ""I'll call you when I'm coming back. Probably tomorrow.""

Me: ""Okay. Be safe.""

There was no real grand climax or resolution to anything. We just got tired of crying and yelling, I think."
I'm black and I got pulled over by a state trooper today,"I was driving home from my friend's house and I passed through a part of a state highway where the speed limit was 45mph before it transitioned into 60mph. At that time I was doing 70mph, so I was going 25 over and I know I was. I openly admitted it to the officer and apologized.

I was extremely respectful to both of the officers and they let me off with a warning, but my registration was expired so I did get a citation for that. But even with that, they gave me a break on it and put it down as under 60 days vs after 60 days. 

I'm just really really thankful. It could have gone a lot worse, I'm glad I had officers who weren't trigger happy or anything. Here's to paying $140 I don't have though... Learned my lesson. "
I broke his nose and he deserved it.,"Fuck throwaways, i am proud of what i did.
It was around a week ago, i own a store in the Downtown area of my city. The building across the street has been vacant for a year and they are currently renovating it to open a Pizza store. The owner and his son are really nice people, however the contractor they hired is a fucking sleaze ball. I'll call him Sleazy.

There is a mentally ill person Jessica that walks up and down the street every day for hours talking to her self. We all know her she is a regular sight and i occasionally buy her food or coffee since she is only 19 and except her non stop walking and talking to herself she is practically very sweet and harmless.
 
Sleazy was smoking a cigarette at the entrance of the building and she asked him for a smoke. He gave her one but i noticed leaning towards her and whispering something and her. I also noticed her flinching and she seems distraught and she quickly walked away, the cigarette he gave her was thrown on the ground.
Next day i see him smoking again on the entrance and i make sure i watch him so if Jessica passes by he won't bother her. Little did you know it seems like the asshole was actually stalling at the entrance and occasionally turning around and talking to someone inside the building while looking up and down the street. I see Jessica up the street and as soon as she saw him she crossed over and came to my side of the street. I start talking to her asking her if she wants some coffee since it's pretty cold outside and she is shivering. She just asked for some chocolate bar since she has a sweet tooth and me and my husband occasionally spoil her with Mars bars which she loves. I go behind the counter to grab one and she says to me *That man is very bad, very bad, very bad*. I ask her why she says that. She says *he asked me for sex, very bad, very bad*. I ask her what did he say exactly. She says *No, no, no, no. He said sex, sex, blowjob and he give me $20*. Needless to say i saw red. Fucking sleaze ball trying to take advantage of a little girl with mental health issues. It is so obvious when she talks and the way she conducts herself. I gave her the bar and made sure she walked away before i closed the store and crossed the road. My intentions were to ask him to stop harassing her and that she is mentally ill in case he didn't realize it. Sleazy starts whistling the closer i get to him. I stood in front of him and told him to cut the crap and stop harassing Jessica or i will call the cops. Sleazy replied *maybe you want to take her place, i will fuck you and you will keep begging for more*. I do not know if i said anything but i raised my right arm made a tight fist and slammed it right at his nose. He started bleeding and yelling. I calmly walked across, entered my store and called the cops. 
They arrive 4 minutes later. I reiterate everything and tell them i punched him. Cops said it looks like i broke his nose. I told him good that was my intention. He told me to wait in the store he is coming back. He walked across and i saw an ambulance arriving. Ten minutes later he comes back and he said he talked to Sleazy and he won't press charges but next time to call them because he could of had hurt me. I told him the same thing i am going to say now. **I would do it again in a heartbeat if i saw him prey on an innocent human being** 

TL;DR : Sleaze ball preys on mentally ill girl, i broke his nose and i am proud."
My coworker gave me a rose...,"Alright, granted he gave everyone a rose.
He brought a dozen or two dozen white roses and gave one to everybody working that shift. I feel like it shouldn't be a big deal, but it is. 

This  is the first time I ever got flowers for Valentine's day. The hell, it's the first time a guy's ever given me a rose; the first time I got anything for Valentine's day that wasn't from a family member. 

I don't know if you're a redditor, but whether or not you read this, thanks, Anthony. 

You made my day.

EDIT: Shit, my first gilding, too? You guys are the best!"
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD AND ALL THINGS HOLY,"CHEW WITH YOUR MOUTH CLOSED, WOMAN."
My mom killed herself,"I'm here to tell my mom's story because she is not here to tell it herself. I know she would have wanted her story to be told.

I was 6 when my mom was raped. I obviously didn't know this at the time, but she was dealing with some very severe sexual harassment at work. She was 45 and had recently reentered the workforce after being a stay at home mom for my sister and I for about 15 years.

Her manager (who was about 10 years younger than her) began sexually harassing her from the beginning. It started with lewd, obvious staring. She told several of her female coworkers about what was happening and they all brushed it off. ""Oh, that's just how he is! He doesn't mean anything by it! You should be happy that a young attractive guy is interested in you!""

My mom was terrified to kick up a fuss in case she lost her job. She needed this job. She was newly divorced and needed to support her two children (me and my sister who is 9 years older). So she kept her mouth shut and carried on.

She was working late one night when her manager told her to come into his office - he needed to discuss something with her. She was worried, but went in anyway. He locked the door and raped her. She was so terrified that she completely froze and just silently wept.

She was never the same again! My smart, bubbly, outgoing, passionate mom became withdrawn and isolated. She quit her job and was mortified that she had to go on welfare to support us while she looked for another one. She lost so much weight that she became unrecognizable from her former self.

She reported him to the police who didn't believe her! They told her that sometimes women sleep with their bosses for promotions and you don't get to cry rape just because he didn't uphold his end of the deal! This hurt my mom more than the actual rape itself, according to her journal.

My mom became so depressed that she couldn't leave her bed. Until one day, she came unexpectedly to my grandma's house. She looked great - her hair was freshly dyed, her nails were done, her outfit was stunning. My grandma was so happy that my mom looked like she was finally getting back on her feet and starting to recover. She asked my grandma if she could take us for a few hours while she went out for lunch with a friend. My grandma happily agreed.

My mom never came back to pick us up. She wasn't going for lunch with a friend. She went home and hung herself.


A lot of people have asked me if I think what my mom did was selfish or if I'm angry at her for what she did. My answer? How could I possibly be angry at *her*? I'm angry at the piece of shit who violated her in the worst way a human being can be violated. She was in so much emotional agony that she saw absolutely no way out. *None of that was her fault. It was ALL HIS*. If he had not attacked her, she would still be here today.

I read my mom's journal several years ago and that is how I know all of this. She had barely gone into any detail about what happened to anyone. The police made her feel that she was never going to be believed. She even doubted herself and her own memory. She thought she was going insane.

My mom's story is, tragically, not unique. If you type ""rape victim + suicide"" into Google, you will find hundreds of similar stories. It makes me so angry, angrier than you can possibly imagine, that so many people in positions of power commit these disgusting crimes against more vulnerable people and continue to get away with it.

Mom, you are my hero. I love and respect you more than anyone in the whole world. You have 5 wonderful grandchildren - Megan has 3 girls and I have a boy and a girl. I am so crushed that they never got to meet you. They love you so much and love hearing stories about you. I wish I could hear you sing again. You stopped singing after what happened, but I remember you used to sing us to sleep every single night.

To all the victims/survivors out there, I believe you. I believe you, I respect the hell out of you. You are strong and it was *NOT* your fault. Whether or not you've been able to speak out about what happened to you, you are incredibly brave. 

I just don't want my mom's death to be in vain. Fuck ""locker room talk"", ""boys will be boys"", ""take it as a compliment!"" As a man, I have made it a point in my life to always call out this disgusting shit when I see it and I encourage everyone else reading this to do the same. 

Sleep tight, Mom.

Edit: Wow, my wife woke me up to tell me that my phone didn't stop lighting up all night long from messages on this post. Thank you all so much. And thank you to the person for giving me my first gold on my first ever post on reddit! 

For those of you asking if I ever managed to find this guy, the short answer is no. From what I've learned from various people, he left the country pretty soon after my mom passed away and has not been heard from since.

Thank you for all your supportive comments, I teared up reading them. I can't reply to all of them, but I read them all and thank you very sincerely for them. 

So far this post has nearly 8k views. If even one quarter of the people who read this post did one small thing to combat rape culture and victim blaming, think of how much positive change could come about. It could be as simple as telling your friends that rape jokes are not funny, posting a facebook status to say you believe the women accusing the likes of roy moore or harvey weinstein or donating a small sum of money to your local rape crisis center or women's shelter.

Most importantly, this is not a women's issue or an lgbt issue or an issue that only impacts one group of society. Sexual assault and rape is everyone's problem whether you want to believe it or not. While not all victims of these crimes are female, it is not a question that the majority of them are. Tragically, I believe that this is the reason that it is not taken as seriously as it should be by society. Why should the onus be on them to remove this problem from society? Aren't women doing enough as it is?

Edit 2: Also, please do not support my mother while simultaneously not supporting all victims of these crimes. Be equally outraged when it happens to a sex worker, an lgbtq+ person, an immigrant, a homeless person, a mentally ill person, a refugee, a person suffering from addiction. They matter equally."
A woman posted her picture...she was fat.,"A woman posted her picture and said she did it because she was beginning to overcome negative self image and starting to like herself. 

Most of the comments were about how she was in denial of her obesity and needed to lose weight. 

I wish people knew that for some people, self acceptance is the first step to fixing a weight problem. Learning to like yourself as you are doesn't mean you've given up on ever improving. 

I grew up being told I was fat and ugly constantly. All I heard was how gross I was. So I didn't take care of myself. I made no effort to look nice or even clean. Why should I? Why pay to paint a car when the engine is wrecked? 

Through a long process i began to start to appreciate myself. My fat ugly legs did work. My overburdened spine did keep me upright. I hated something that was doing its best to keep me alive. 

So I started dressing better. I started keeping my hair brushed. I even got a tan one summer. I finally felt somewhat pretty and less worthless. 

Then I jumped on a scale and saw 302 pounds. I knew this was no way to treat the body I loved. I knew it wasn't about beauty, but health. Maybe I could give my poor body a break. 

It's a struggle. It's hard. Sometimes I still hate myself. I'll never have an attractive body. But because I value myself...I'll never stop trying to have a healthier one.

There are a lot of variables to everything in life. Sometimes the chicken has to come before the egg.

Never let the words of others make you feel worthless. 

Love yourself and realize you deserve better. People on the Internet don't. The guys calling you a whale don't. But you do. 

Tl Dr Shame is not the answer to obesity, and self acceptance isn't the cause."
"My roommate and close friend just walked out of our apartment and into the rain at night with no shoes, no coat, and no keys. I don't think he was planning on coming back.","My roommate and close friend just walked out of our apartment and into the rain at night with no shoes, no coat, and no keys. I don't think he was planning on coming back. 

It rained for the first time in a long time where I live today. It wasn't even impressive, so much as it was unexpected; the one day that me and my roommate had the time to actually hang out with each other this week, a freak weather thing hits that we couldn't have planned for. Thankfully it was only minorly annoying, and not a huge hinderance to our plans to just walk around this mall near our apartment. 

He got me my Christmas gift from this cool independent game store; Final Fantasy V/VI (PS1), and Kingdom Hearts (PS2). It was 30$ and he said that I wasn't allowed to go over that amount if I got him anything. 

We went there, got food, walked around Barnes and Noble (he was looking for D&amp;D manuals), and then we came home because he had work early the next day. I bought the Ubers there and back.

We got home and he went to bed. I stayed up and was browsing Twitter and responding to texts from my parents. He kept tossing and turning but I didn't really pay any mind to it. 

And then, he got up out of bed, wordlessly got his phone and his headphones, and, in pajamas and a t-shirt, went outside barefoot into the rainy night. 

I asked my other roommate where he went when I heard the door shut, and he pointed at the door. My heart dropped. 

I ran and got his coat, for some reason, and ran after him. I was still wearing my sweater and shoes from when we were at the mall, but he wasn't, so I knew he had to be freezing. 

Luckily, I caught up to him before he got too far. He looked at me and laughed, asking where I was going. I asked him the same thing. He had no idea. 

So we just walked. Me with shoes on, him without. Him holding his sweater against him, not putting it on. 

We were friends in our hometown, and would have been even better friends if we'd ever really hung out during high school. It was only once we started talking to each other, two years after his graduation but the summer of mine, that we realized how comparable as friends we were. He needed out of our hometown, where everything reminded him of Her, and I needed a roommate. We decided to room together while I was in college to prevent ourselves from going insane. 

He's been depressive since we moved out, since he only came with me here because he and his soulmate couldn't stand each other. She couldn't believe that he was as perfect as he made himself out to be; he had to be cheating on her, or something. He was fed up and lost it on her. And it was over. This bastion of high school togetherness, gone forever. They'd planned their life together and everything, too. They knew where they would live and everything. They really were the ones you look at and go ""ugh"", but would secretly envy. 

It wasn't mutual, apparently, but technically *he* did break up with *her*. She bounced back damn near immediately, which he took as evidence he was entirely unimportant to her. Basically inconsolable. I sort of think *she* was cheating on *him*, and was projecting. But that's pretty much irrelevant now. 

He would look at me in the face sometimes and say that since the one person who knew him completely and who he could make happy 100% of the time never wanted to see him again, he no longer had purpose in the world. And I'd balk at him and remark that countless many others loved him—and I'd list them, as best I could—and that they should be purpose enough, or that his love of film and his aspirations to act should be purpose enough, but he would shake his head and chant ""distractions"", throwing them aside. 

His passion was to make people happy. But his true passion was to make *her* happy. And now he couldn't. And he knew that and could barely live with it, day in and day out. 

So there we were, walking. I kept asking him where he was going and he kept shrugging off the question. We both knew I knew already. 

I asked how long we were gonna walk and he said he didn't know. I asked why he didn't bring his shoes and he said he didn't know. I asked if he was going to put on his coat, and he said he didn't know. 

I asked if he was planning to return to the apartment, ever. He said he honestly didn't know. 

I'd caught my roommate going to go potentially kill themselves. 

He asked how long I'd known his goal. That's what he called it; his ""goal"", for this walk. I told him I had a feeling when he didn't put his shoes on, left his keys, and didn't say anything. He said ""ah"", and was silent after that. 

We were quiet some of the walk. I started talking after a while to try to get him talking; after all, I knew he had something to say, I just had to have him talk long enough for him to say it. 

I don't know why—maybe it seemed like the right thing to say—but I told him my mom was in Indiana taking care of a sick grandfather of mine (which is true; lung surgery of some kind), and he started talking about his favorite grandfather and how he couldn't eat sodium towards the end of his life but would anyway, leading him to become sicker and sicker. 

Then he talked about how, since he is Bi, he was kicked out of his Mormon household for a while (which I knew), and was urged by that Grandpa to reconcile with his family. He did eventually, and I think that made his grandpa happy, and I told him this. 

And then he went on to talk about Her. How she was ready and willing to convert for him, and he ruined it. How she was the best thing to happen to him, and he ruined it. How she knew everything about him, and him her, and he ruined it. 

I stayed silent. He needed ears and a shoulder, right then.  

He started talking about how Charles Schultz (creator of Peanuts comics) apparently killed himself at the peak of his career, saying that he never wanted to experience the downward slope that was sure to follow the comic's success. I could have said that Peanuts never declined in popularity, but I didn't. I don't know why; just seemed like the wrong thing to say somehow. 

He was sobbing softly through his words at this point. 

And then he told me that if he could, he would go back in time and kill himself right then, that winter, when he would still go to bed smiling about how good everything in his life was. He said he'd have gone back and shot the past him with a gun in the back of the head while he slept. 

I kept silent. He stopped talking for a while after that. We were still walking and it was still wet and cold. 

I didn't know what to say. I wanted to put my arm around him and reassure him but honestly, I didn't know how to. I couldn't tell him with a straight face that the future would get better, or that he'd find another Her somewhere, because I didn't know if he could, and he knew that. He was too smart for ""you can do it!""s.

I stayed silent. He complained after a while that his feet were cold and we both laughed. He hadn't laughed that hard since we came out here. 

He asked me to lead him home, since he didn't have his contacts in. He'd talked himself down, at least for tonight. 

He apologized for ""vomiting on me"". He calls his episodes ""vomiting"", and his depressive periods ""sick-feeling"" and ""fluish"". It's a way we have to talk about what's going on without having to say the words Depression, Suicide, and I Can't Live With Myself. Maybe it's unhealthy, but at least it keeps him alive and let's him communicate to me without fear of being judged. It makes him feel clever which is a weird, maniacal incentive for him to tell me whenever he's feeling down. But that's irrelevant. Point is, he hates it when he vomits on me, despite me telling him he needs to induce vomiting more often so I can help him work through it as best I can. 

It's bizarre, being so utterly helpless in a situation like this. What do you say to someone having an existential, ""why am I here"" moment, to convince them that they are important and worth keeping alive? Especially when they are so convinced otherwise? And how can I possibly trust him with his own wellbeing now? What do I do from here? I didn't say any of these things, but I was thinking them and I think he knew I was thinking them. 

We got back to the apartment and we both knew the score. He knew everything I would lecture him on already, and I knew he knew, so we skipped the lecture. 

We were locked out so I knocked. He said he was going to wash his feet and I said that was probably smart. 

And then I asked him what it would take, honestly, to trust anyone like he trusted Her ever again. And he said that he'd have to know them and they'd have to know him 100%. And platonically, like only a best friend could, I said ""Alright. Let's do it"", and I knocked again. 

He looked at me and said ""Not tonight, I have work tomorrow"". I said ""Yeah, you do. But we're starting tonight.""

He said ""I wouldn't know where to start"". I said ""Start where you think you should, and we'll go from there"".

And then he finally gave his real reason for not wanting to, and said ""It would remind me of Her too much"". I said ""That's the idea.""

He is so obsessed with the idea that no one can love him as much as her. I want to show him that I could, albeit non-romantically, and do.

He agreed as my roommate let us in. And we talked until he finally said he needed to go to bed because he had work in like three hours. And I said that's fine, we'll continue tomorrow and keep going every day til we're done. Just like when you did this with Her. And he called me crazy but agreed to do it. 

I'm straight. But I've known for a while that I loved this kid like a brother and that if anything happened to him I didn't know what I'd do. 

I think he looks forward to it a little bit. And I think he knows that no matter what happened with Her, that I love him and that that's not gonna change, no matter what he does. I just hope he loves me enough to tell me next time he's about to lose it and almost do something stupid, because if I hadn't gone after him, I don't know what would have happened. 

Edit: I really appreciate your kind words, everyone. Thank you for all your offers of support and suggestions, I appreciate them. And thank you to those saying I did the right thing. Honestly, I was unsure of what I was doing and if I was giving him what he needed, so to have so many people with similar—and sometimes identical—stories come out of the woodwork and thank me for what I did... Well, it really makes me happy to think I am at least close to being on the path to helping him. 

I appreciate your comments on my writing style on a personal level, since now I'm at film school and writing scripts or stories like this is what I want to do forever. And to those wondering, yes, this is a true story. It happened yesterday and it really crystallized the matter for both of us, sort of making it real. I actually almost feel sort of lucky, in a way, that now I know better the full extent of the problem so I can help him better. 

I just want to see him better, you know?"
"I am a ""missing"" child.","Um. I don’t even know how to start this off. But I feel like it’s time I say something. Obvious throwaway for obvious reasons. I want to post a trigger warning: **mention of sexual assault**, just in case anyone is sensitive to that. 

Anyway, I am a “missing” child. Or “former missing child.” I don’t know how to phrase my existence. The reason why I’m even posting this is because I saw some news article about how a guy found out he was kidnapped and was found safe. I’m not sure why, but it just made me feel a lot of emotions and I wanted a chance to explain myself. 

I grew up in the 90s during the time of faces on milk cartons and child disappearances were all you saw on the news. In 2001 I was 16-years-old. I came from a rural southern family. I had seven older siblings. (I say “older,” but each of us was about a year apart from the other.) My mother was unemployed and my father—according to my mother—died when I was little. But the seven of us kids all had different fathers, I’m pretty sure. 

We lived in absolute poverty. No running water, no electricity and no outlook of it ever getting better. My mother was a drug addict. She loved us, that much I know. She tried so hard to get clean, but when you come from where I come from, there’s no chance of getting help. We had no extended family to pitch in and help pay bills. 

Growing up, I was one of two girls out of the seven of us. My mother had several boyfriends she would bring over, and most times my sister and I would be sexually assaulted by these men. Multiple times. My sister eventually became pregnant by one of the men but had a miscarriage when she was only 17. Out of the seven of us, only one had managed to finish high school, but he became addicted to meth and helped my mom deal. I was on track to being the second one—until I couldn’t take it anymore. 

My mom said I was “rowdy.” I would always fight her. I begged her to move out of our tiny little trailer with one bedroom. I even said I would drop out of school to work and help pay for an actual house. She said I was ungrateful and spoiled. She probably would have called me “entitled” and “selfish” if her vocabulary was advanced enough. But I knew she loved me. 

So one night after my mother’s newest boyfriend had assaulted me and my sister and threatened our lives if we turned him in (which I threatened I was going to do), I left. 

It started out as me leaving in the middle of the night to just go for a walk. I left everything behind but my purse, which I took with me everywhere. I walked to our local gas station, bought a soda, walked into “town” where we had a dilapidated bus station that still ran at odd hours of the night. And after sitting there for a while, the bus pulled up. People got off to go about their lives. The bus driver asked if I was getting on and without hesitating, I got on. 

I was scared out of my mind. I thought the bus would just go to the next town over, but I found out it was heading to a new state. Internally, I panicked, but I just sat in my seat beside a woman who was snoring. 

About five hours into the trip, the woman and I struck up a conversation and she told me that she was going to visit her son. I told her I wasn’t sure where I was going. She invited me to stay with her and her son in the city we were headed. I said yes. 

And when we got to where we were going, I went with the woman. I used the money I had with me to buy us a taxi to her son’s house. The son and his family welcomed me with open arms. And I stayed there with them for over three months before I found a job and was able to pay rent. I used a fake name and it all worked *too* perfectly. 

I remember seeing my picture on the news. They were actually searching for me. My mom was on the news. My sister was on the news. It was a pretty big deal and I was scared for a little while that I would be found and sent back. However, after about two months and the occurrence of 9/11, the news was preoccupied with other things and I didn’t have to worry about it anymore. 

I felt guilty for leaving my sister, but I was terrified that if I were to call the police, even from states away, that the guy could hurt her in some way. So I stayed away. 

It is 15 years later. I got my GED, my bachelors and my masters. I’m halfway through my PhD program right now. I have a husband and a daughter. I have a life!

Sometimes I think about reaching out to my family or visiting the town that I left, but I don’t know. I feel like I can’t look back. When I type my name into Google, pictures of me from the news 15 years ago pop up. But I’m not that person! That’s just the thing, I’m not her anymore. But I do wonder about my siblings and my mother. "
"Rest easy, baby girl","If you’re in an emotionally abusive relationship, get out of it now.

Now matter how many times I told her, she never left.

She shot herself in the head this morning in front of him. 

He’d been wearing her thin for years; telling her she was dumb, worthless, a sl**

And this morning she gave him the ultimate fuck you.

He destroyed someone so fucking beautiful. The most beautiful woman I’ve ever met. The most contagious laugh, the funniest Chicago accent, the biggest heart, so smart, so bold and brave.

How am I supposed to ever wash the sheets in my guest room again? I just keep standing over the bed sobbing, remembering how much fun we just had a couple of weekends ago. I can’t even smell your hair on the pillow. Not fair.

It’s not fair that I live in a world where your soul has been snuffed out and he still gets to live.

Rest easy."
Going to the cops about rape is my biggest regret,"A few years ago I was raped by my friends Dad while I was drunk and possibly drugged. I couldn’t remember what he looked like, I couldn’t remember his name, but they knew him because he had been in and out of jail for years. 

The night it happened my friends at the time told me to go downstairs into his parents room cuz the dad wanted to talk to me. Looking back I should have asked someone to come with me. Or maybe they knew and set me up. He was just offering me pill after pill and I denied them all. Finally he asked if I wanted some water and I said yes. I drank some of it and he kept urging me to finish it, kept saying I still had some left. It all got really fuzzy after that, and I’m not going into detail to rehash everything, but I remembered enough to know it wasn’t consensual. Fast forward to the day after, i battled myself and went to the police and hospital for a rape kit. The hospital didn’t take my claims of being drugged seriously, they tested me to see if I was pregnant but not if there was anything in my system like I asked them to. 

It was a grueling 16 months. I was trying to heal and I just couldn’t. I was forced to go to interrogation after interrogation with the police, children in youth services, court houses, retelling the story over and over and over and then telling me my story doesn’t add up and that he said this happened when I’m saying this. It was a living nightmare. I was pulled out of school for the rest of the year, and at this point I felt so alone, yet I had little to no support. My parents didn’t even believe me. They told me a few weeks after that if I need a dildo instead of having sex with strange men to let them know. 

When questioned, the Dad said he didn’t know me, nothing happened, he didn’t see me. The rape kit came back positive with his DNA and suddenly he switches up his story and says it was consensual. The detectives took my phone and downloaded everything. They went though years and years worth of messages. They found some dirty pictures I sent, I was 16 at the time and curious, who the fuck hasn’t sent a nude. It was game over from then on. My sexual past is what made this case into a joke. They also blew up 2 pictures of me holding a BB gun and smiling, showed it to my parents as if It was real. They told my parents how many people I’ve had sex with before, personal conversations I’ve had on my phone, anything they could get a hold of to make me look bad. Anyways, they told me they weren’t going to take the case to court. Since they did find his DNA and I was a minor, they gave him a whopping 6 months for statutory. But in the process they dug me into the dirt and convinced everyone around me it didn’t happen. The police talked to my parents, friends, people who were involved, everyone they could get their hands on and led them all to believe I lied about the whole thing. It was the biggest mistake of my life ever going to the police. I wish every day I would have just stayed quiet and got on with my life. It’s still a part of me every day. I’ve been healing but slower than ever with no support. I put it on the back burner and just stopped talking about it, everyone around me forgot. I just can’t forget the hurt I felt and how I was obliterated by the system, my parents, and my friends after already being so low. I should have never opened my mouth. "
"My roommate is a disgusting, irredeemable manchild.","This year, I got roomed with a Kenyan exchanged student. I can only assume he was sent here to get him as far away from home as possible. 

It has been 3 months since I've been alone in my room for a period longer than 5 minutes. He lies under the covers with his hands in pants, watching anime on his laptop from 1pm to 5am every fucking day. He leaves to shit, possibly to attend his one hour of class per day (I don't know, I'm in class from 8:30-5 ever day), and move snacks into his bed. There is an ever-growing mountain of filth (food waste, packaging, far more wadded shirts than he actually wears that I presume he uses as jizz rags) extending from his bed that I have to clean when it encroaches on my space, because WILL NOT clean, ever. 

If I try to talk to him about any of this, he very suddenly speaks no english despite being perfectly fluent when he wants something. He just stares at me like I've grown a dick on my forehead until I give up. If I talk to Residence, I get told that ""adjustment is difficult for exchange students and I need to be accomodating and understanding"". No other exchange student struggles to wipe their own fucking ass! (You can tell, because he constantly smells like actual feces and it's dissapates briefly when he takes his WEEKLY shower)

I can't see how I'm going to get to the end of this year without resorting to physical altercation. I am sick to death of this human garbage.

An under age kid asked me to buy him alcohol,"Today I walked out of my local liquor store and some random under age guy asked me to buy him alcohol, I said no way. I kind of assumed he was an under cover cop, I waited in the car while someone else bought him alcohol and sure enough two cops come out if no where and arrest the guy who bought him alcohol. Just wanted to get that off my chest, don't buy minors alcohol!

Edit: Spoke with the owner of the liquor store, he said everyone who got caught that day each had to pay a fine of $2000"
I would have had my baby today.,"Well, given that things had progressed 100% normally, of course, which is never a guarantee. It might seem, from the title, like I'm feeling sadness or regret. I'm not. I'm filled with a massive wave of relief. 

Despite taking my birth control every day, I missed my period. I was a little scared, at first, but convinced myself I definitely wasn't pregnant. Well, spoiler alert: I was. I immediately called Planned Parenthood and scheduled an abortion, as that's been my plan since I became sexually active. There was no guilt, second-guessing or hesitation about it. None. Still none today. 

I'd told my ex (bf at the time), before we had even slept together for the first time, that this was my plan of action if I got pregnant, and that if he wasn't okay with that, I wasn't interested in sex or in continuing the relationship. He agreed. 

Unfortunately, when I called him in tears, he came over all Catholic all of a sudden. Let me lay out our living situation for you, briefly: Neither of us made enough money to eat regularly.  Our ""house"" was a disgusting, structurally unsound monstrosity filled with bugs and rodents in a dangerous neighborhood,. My skin is covered in old bedbug pockmarks that will never heal. I spent most of my time sunken into a deep depression. I couldn't leave my bed, or eat, or wash myself. I was fading into a sick, sunken sweat stain on an old mattress in the stifling heat, while neighbors screamed at each other, sometimes shot each other, outside all night. 

And that's about when I found out I had something growing in me. So many times, when I read stories like this, as I did when I searched online looking for forums to get help or advice, I read about regret and sadness. I didn't feel that. I felt horrified, like a parasite was growing, suddenly and without permission, in my body. I wanted to hold a razorblade to my stomach and slit it open and pull it out, and if I died in the process, so much the better. 

I took the pills. The women at the clinic were kind. I paid for everything myself, and passed the pregnancy at ""home,"" curled up in a ball on the bathroom floor, alone, ants crawling over my arms and legs, snorting the morphine they'd given me for the excruciating, unbelievable pain, unable to keep from animalistic screams and wails. 

He'd already told his friends that I was having an abortion, even though I'd begged him to keep it quiet. He screamed at me for not wanting him to practice his rights, since this was his situation too, wasn't I taking into account that HE feels pain TOO and we should do what HE wants?

It's 9 months later, as you may have guessed from the title. Since then, I've moved out, cutting contact and leaving a number of things behind out of necessity (sometimes you just gotta pay the asshole tax). I saved up a chunk of money, and I'm moving 2,000 miles away from a toxic city filled with bad history. 

I'm happier than I've ever been in my entire life. I'm confident and healthy and I'm a pretty killer guitarist, too. I've reconnected with dear friends and mended fences with family. I never thought it was possible for me to experience happiness. I didn't know there was even a difference between ""not being crushingly depressed"" and ""being happy."" Well, there is, and I feel it. 

Today, I'm thinking of an alternate universe in which I gave in to my ex. If you look through the dirty kitchen window into a broken-down house on Forlorn Avenue that not even Tom Waits would have deigned to sing about, there I am, bone-thin and pale except for my distended stomach, holding a baby, rocking it listlessly, perhaps thinking about food. There's my ex, still playing video games on the same bedbug-ridden couch. Oh, look, we forgot to pay our bills again and the power's cutting out. 

The summer air is thick with moisture and flies. I can feel my hair plastered to the back of my neck. In this life, I never finished college. I never got help for my mental health. I never got a job with better income potential. I never reconnected with friends or family. I never picked up the guitar again, never got excited about new music, never moved away like I'd always dreamed of. 

Instead, in this alternate-universe life, I do my best to care for a baby, and at night its wails are matched by my own. Perhaps I do not live for much longer, there in that dark place. Perhaps it's for the best. 

In my real life, where I did what I had to do and moved on despite the heart-wrenching pain I endured, I persisted and blossomed. I made the right choice, and I will never, never, never regret what I did. I didn't then, and I don't now. I am so grateful to feel the sun on my face, and to know that soon I will get into my CAR that I BOUGHT (holy shit!) with all my things and my awesome dog and take off for a new beginning.

To anyone who thinks I'm morally wrong, or whatever: I'm ready for an inbox filled with Missouri-billboard-esque (sorry, Missourians) anti-choice spew, so go ahead, then. 

Please just keep in mind that you won't change my mind and I won't change yours, and that by typing out an angry message to me, you are wasting a chunk of the brief flash of sunlight that's your experience of life and sentience on this earth, and while it's certainly your right to do so, as I have made a very personal and polarizing experience public, don't expect me to waste my time immersing myself in your political views. Just hit the downvote button instead.

The best you can hope for is that I'll even open the message, and perhaps roll my eyes. I'm a lady, folks. I'm a lady online and in real life. I've heard it all, graphic threats and insults included. 

If you're still hellbent on sending something out into the ether after genuinely considering all this, maybe you could find a subreddit for scared women who have decided to keep their pregnancy and offer them your support, encouragement and advice instead. Cheers! 


******EDIT****** : First of all, I'm overwhelmed and deeply moved by the support I have received. I am filled, for the first time, with a feeling of hope for the world and faith in humanity. The number of kind, supportive messages FAR outnumbers the scattering of nasty ones, and I choose to focus on the good, especially when it is surrounding me like this. I'm so grateful for the internet love, and for those of you who have chosen to share your stories either in the comments or privately. You are brave, and strong, and beautiful, and I love you. I do. I have removed several minor identifying details from this post in regards to my ex, as I know that mutual acquaintances are on Reddit. (Who wouldn't be? This place rules.) While I do not want to invite contact or speculation from him or his friends, I harbor no hatred for them, and shared my story not to vilify him, but to just get it off my chest (ha), and to talk about my abortion without shame or fear. 

Again, thank you, all of you, even those of you who doubt my honesty or consider me a killer, for taking the time to read about a piece of my life that was very, very dark, and for taking the time to offer me your feedback. I'm in the middle of a move right now, and I'm doing my best to respond to each person who's been kind or invested enough to respond to me, and if I haven't gotten to you, I will. If you are feeling alone, afraid, angry, sad, scared, confused, or anything, PM me. I will listen respectfully and without judgment. I want to give back to the community that has given me so very much over the span of a mere day. "
"I am going to leave my girlfriend of 6 years, who is both mentally and financially dependent on me, and I am concerned about her.","I was with my current girlfriend for the past 8 years (give or take), she had an abusive family and a difficult childhood, and we have not lived together until last year, when we decided to move to a new country together.

she applied for a masters in Netherlands and I applied for jobs there, we both got accepted and I had to put ~9000 euros in her bank account for her to be able to get her study visa. 

being here in Netherlands, and living together for the first time, sides of her that I have never seen before started to surface, she is controlling, does not take no for an answer, extremely lousy at home, and most importantly, she does not know when or how to stop being mad or angry, sometimes being >10 days angry, not talking to me, not sleeping with me in the same bed, for something that she later admits was small and that she does not know how to stop being mad.

one last thing is that she is never thankful for the fact that I am helping her by working my ass off for her to be able to study stress free and even afford travels and all kinds of stuff (she literally said that I owe her that for ""wasting"" 6 years of her life).

point of the story is that I no longer want to be with her, because, even though I care for her, she is making me miserable and guilty feeling like I will never be enough to her, I am planning to leave her, but she is so fragile and I know this will break her heart and affect her studies life.

I have started secretly looking for a job in different cities, to prepare for my leave, she still has one year left of her studies, and has about 6000 euros left in her account, I have 1500 euros extra saved up that i will leave to her, plus leave her a bank account that i will put 300 euros per month until the end of her school year. 

even though i know this will be enough for one year, the thought of her being sad and lonely in this country, and the thought of her not finding a job after completing her studies and not being able to stay here after she's done with school (therefore, going back home where she basically has no family) is killing me, and i'm writing this right now already regretting what i am doing.

at the same time, I know this might feel selfish, but i want this for me, for my own sanity."
To the cute guy I like,"After lunch, we spontaneously decided to go to the park. I sat on the grass while you laid next to me. We talked loud enough just for the two of us to hear while our friends were occupied with other things. I was picking out the grass from your white shirt that fit you perfectly. You were messing up your usually neat hair as you almost fell asleep. After a while, something caught our attention and we both got up. My brother then pointed out how good the messy hair suited you and you being the shy guy that you are, did not know how to handle all the attention that came from our lovely friends. I was standing by a tree watching you awkwardly try to ignore their compliments. You walked to me as if to seek safety. I looked you in the eyes and assured you that you really did look good with your messy hair, and your eyes lit up as you blushed and nudged my shoulder. Those few seconds of your absolute cuteness was enough to get my heart racing."
"I was kidnapped and forced to have homosexual intercourse. Instead of anger or devastation, I developed Stockholm Syndrome","I am a married man, currently 28 years old. I would not consider myself being a homosexual due to the fact that I am only largely attracted to women. Just to make it known.

6 years ago, I was kidnapped by a man aged around 40. He grabbed me after a night of wild partying that I had.

He held me captive for 2 nights. Was taken on a Friday night and released on Sunday. It was my first time having sex with a man.

He did not treat me well, but apart from the rape, he never physically abused me either. I was bound and gagged most of the time and was only briefly untied during meals or shower. 

*Edit: My passion for bondage did not develop due to this experience. If anything, the feeling of being bound and gagged when it happens in real life is very different than doing so consensually*

Throughout the entire period I was kidnapped, he forced himself on me for at least 8 times. He made me do plenty of sexual acts but none of them degrading or inhuman.

On the Sunday night, he told me he's going to let me go, but if I ever tell anyone, he'd come for me again.

Just before he dropped me off, he actually kissed me on the lips, and due to the relief, I actually didn't resist.

Now here's the puzzling and perhaps screwed up part. When I think back about it, I somehow do not harbor any resentment or ill feelings for what he did to me. In fact I do wish I could meet him again in the future.

I believe this is a case of Stockholm Syndrome which I totally do not have any clue as to how and why it developed.

Thank you for reading. It feels good being able to share this in great detail for the first time after it happened. Not many would understand."
"I kinda went off on a coworker who told me to check my privilege, I spent most of my life in an orphanage and homeless working up from literally nothing.","So at lunch today my coworker was talking about the cost of her son's upcoming college tuition to which I made a brief statement saying how any kid going to college should try their damnedest applying to any scholarship they can get their hands on, every cent counts.

For some reason my coworker instantly snapped at me saying ""well that's sure easy for someone like you to say. A young well to do white man like yourself easily has an advantage over everyone else with these kinds of things, you should check your privilege"". 

I let her finish and then replied ""well idk who has a precise advantage or what have you, I know there's all sorts of scholarships and it was just a suggestion. I also find it a bit rude to automatically assume my life has been better than most people just because I was born white and a man. To hold some belief that all white men are living such great lives and fit in some sort of statistic is pretty silly. The world isn't becoming a better place with people going around with all sorts of assumptions and unwarranted anger"".

I then kindly said how I am more than willing to explain to her that my life wasn't some glamorous privileged experience she assumed it to be. 

I was literally dumped off at an orphanage at age 3, went through some of the worst facilities ever to be built for education(rampant violence, drug abuse, and teachers literally quitting within the first month), didn't get adopted, turned 18 and got the boot as is the reality for many people in foster care.

So I decide to take up a job doing dishes at a local cafe and taking the little belongings I had to a local men's shelter. Things were going ok for awhile until I began to realize how hostile of an environment shelters are. I had people threatening me for the little money I had, shoes, and other things.

I think what many people don't realize is that local police tend to take the crazies and other characters off the streets by throwing them into shelters instead of making any formal arrests or sending people to institutions. So you basically have a lot of mentally troubled people confined in tight quarters who are not likely to act the most rational. 

Deciding that I didn't want to be put into an early unmarked grave, I packed up my backpack and decided to head westward to work odd jobs nobody wanted to do in areas where people could offer you a little money and somewhere dry to sleep. Yes I became a hobo. 

Eventually as my resume began to develop with the amount of people I helped across the Southern and Midwest US, I had began to establish quite a number of ties(among other hobos and people with homes). I also kept myself informed and busy by visiting local libraries for hours reading up on current events, history, technology and various other subjects. 

After a couple of years of being a hobo , I was offered a permanent position at a produce company. Through working my tail off I managed to climb the ranks and am currently sitting in a nice position.

Long story short, I didn't have the most nice of lives and ate out of more dumpsters than I have in restaurants. 

I know times are rough and everyone's getting hit hard but it's kinda crazy to start arbitrarily marking people as being on top of the world just because they were born with things that they have no control over. 

Start a conversation with some open dialogue before jumping down someone's throat and declaring all this stuff as being the case. 

Don't judge a book by it's cover."
I can't believe I've seen your balls for the last time.,"You loved having your balls out, man. You thought it was hilarious. We'd be sitting there in exec meeting, someone would be jabbering away about the budget, we'd all be zoned out, I'd look over and you'd have your balls out and a shit eating grin on your face. We'd be group texting about weekend plans and you'd send us a picture of your balls, out for the world to see. You'd fucking come up to me at parties while I was talking to girls, say ""I've got something for you!"", point at your crotch, and your goddamn balls would be out.

I really think you were at your happiest when your balls were out. Maybe if you'd taken your balls out more, you wouldn't have killed yourself. Maybe it wouldn't have mattered; maybe you were sick and no amount of testicle exposure could have cured you. I don't know, man. I never thought I'd want to see your balls again, but if I could choose to lay my eyes on one thing today, it would be you, smiling, with your balls out. I hope they let you take out your balls in heaven, buddy. Rest in peace."
I just heard back from my dream college,"I've wanted to go to caltech for years, it's a huge reach for me but I really want to go into astrophysics and work with NASA and caltech is the perfect place for that. And yesterday my friend messaged me to tell me that they had released decisions and I was so scared to open the portal.

But I did it. And I got accepted!!!! I'm the only person from my school to have been accepted early and I've been walking around in a haze for the last 24 hours because this is so surreal but I really did it!!! I've been suicidal in the past and recently and it was so hard to make it and I never thought I would make it this far but I did!!! I made it and I'm going to college, I'm going to the college I've been dreaming of, and my life feels like it finally makes sense and it fell into place and I haven't been this happy in so long, and I'm going to COLLEGE!"
Why am I in trouble when you fucking lift up my dress?,"I'm really pissed off right now. I just finished showering, threw on a comfy dress I usually wear to sleep without wearing undergarments because I got lazy will head off to bed soon anyways. Mother comes come, I walk past her to put the mop away because I was mopping my room. She fucking lifts up my dress, discovers that I'm not wearing anything under, slaps me across the face and I get called an inconsiderate disgusting whore. What the fuck? She's screaming all these obscenities at me and all I can do is just take it in. She says I'm tainting family space. Well what about me? How do you think I, a 17 year old female, feels when you lift up my dress in front of everyone? Even if I was wearing everything under, that's still not okay with me. I feel fucking violated.

Edit: I really want to thank all of you that commented. The amount of support I got was overwhelming! I started sobbing uncontrollably after I posted this but after reading the responses on here, I'm beginning to calm down. Seriously though, you guys are the best <3

Sorry if formatting is bad, first post :("
To the little boy's father at the airport,"I saw you this morning at Newark airport. Escorting your son to my flight. Your son was only maybe 5 or 6 years old, he reminded me so much of my son. My son just turned 7. 

You were kissing your son's head, and hugging him, trying not to appear upset. But I could tell. He was eating Pringles and watching a movie on a tablet, just like my son would. He was flying to his mom in Austin.

I felt it. I almost cried. I had to leave the area. I felt like it could have been me there, sending my son off. 

I just got separated from my wife, and I'm thinking of finding a job in another state. But not sure how I could handle that. Taking my son to the airplane. Trying to maintain composure, knowing I wouldn't see my son for a while. 

He made it OK to his mom. But I'm sure you know. 

I miss my son."
"""i miss my daddy, can we find him after school today?""","Thats what our 4 year old asked this morning, while i choked back my tears and explained that we can try to find you on Thursday. He thinks you moved houses and ""forgot"" to tell me where you moved to, in reality you moved interstate to be with your Internet girlfriend and her kid after spending a week with her in our home state. That was the first time you guys met in person and suddenly our son didnt mean the world to you anymore, it was easy for you to pack up and move away. Did you never realise that you were his everything? Or was he just a blinding reminder of us?

He thought he saw you at the supermarket the other day, following a stranger around for a while until he realised it wasn't you and then he came back to me with his little face screwed up with pain until i said that he was clever and offering to buy him a new toy. We can go weeks without mentioning you and then he'll say something completely random, like how he misses flying kites with you.

6 months ago you left and you broke our sons heart, you also unintentionally broke mine and i will always hate you for that."
"Dear Christians, please stop leaving religious pamphlets, literature, notes, bible verses, etc instead of cash money or credit card tips.","Stop leaving religious tracts or whatever you want to call them as tips when you bring your group of jackals/kids after your youth meetings or whatever.  Instead, leave money so I can afford to pay my bills.  It's cool that you want to save my soul, but the electric company doesn't take your kind thoughts, or the pamphlets as payments for my electric bill.  

The gas station does not take your ""gotcha"" fake notes that look like various denomination notes of currency only to unfold into an advertisement for a church, nor does the grocery store.  Rather I think ""fuck that place"" when I pass it and I happen to remember the reason why the name seems familiar.

Not to bash all Christians or people who go to church and go out afterwards.  It's just that I'm seeing too many of the same people trying to tell others to ""pay it forward in the name of God"" for them, but never do a thing for anyone except themselves."
I’m getting married today!!,I’m getting married today!!! We have been dating for 10 years. I get to marry my high school sweetheart. I am so happy/nervous/excited. It’s been a long stressful process and I couldn’t be happier. 
Something my dad said to me that really touched me,Background info: I was emotionally abused by my mother. My my mom masterfully manipulated me and my siblings to hide it from My dad so he didn’t really know until a few months ago. I don’t remember exactly when this was but I remember I just got my tattoo and he had seen it. My mom was really pissed off that I got this tattoo. I was talking to my dad about it when he said “look I don’t like the fact that you got the tattoo  but that’s OK. You don’t exist to make me happy and I’m still proud of you. “ And I don’t know why but that really touched me.
Start a new job tomorrow. Very close to paying off 4k of debt. No longer suicidal. Feel happy for the first time in nearly four years.,"I don't want this to seem like ""hey look at me!"" and all braggadocious - but in November 2016 I was suicidal and didn't want to live any more. I felt that nothing was going right in my life. I fucking hated myself. 5 months later, with help from therapy, support from family and friends and a general optimism about life, I'm feeling good, and ready to move on from this episode of absolute hopelessness. Don't get me wrong sometimes I have low self esteem and feel like ""what the hell am I even doing with my life"" but they're much less regular. Just thought I'd put that out in to the universe. "
Today my mother and I participated in an experience,"I'm 25 and I still live at my parents, I don't have a job. Not for lack of trying though, but as a college graduate I thought I'd be able to find something somewhat related to my field of study. I have now been trying for a whole year, to no avail. 6 months ago I settled on applying for anything at all, but it didn't change anything.  
This quite understandably led to some resentment from both of my parents, as they both work during the day and have never really trusted me with my time on my own. They could see me get up at the same time as them in the morning, but I guess they assumed I didn't do anything all day. After approximately 5 months of fruitless research, their frustration really started to show: sarcasm, comments on some friends of mine who found jobs in banks or what have you, insistant questioning became a daily routine that I put up with for over half a year. My own frustration grew overtime as well.  
So last night I decided to grab my balls and ask my mother to follow me around for a day because I just couldn't take her fucking fantasy that this generation is just lazy and that if we can't make it like they did, it's because we don't try hard enough. Today was probably the most painful day in her life: she discovered lots of things, including the fact that I was applying for jobs abroad because I had exhausted all the ""offers"" (are they even really offers anymore ?!!!) in the country, that I visited the employment office every friday and that every friday they had the same fucking answer: *Young people are not a priority at the moment*. In the afternoon we came back home and I opened my e-mail box to show her the 6 letters of rejection I had received during the time we spent in the office.  

She's trying to drink herself to sleep right now.  "
Asked for a raise. Got it.,"I just started this job 4 months ago. I was asked to  laterally transfer to a different position. When I agreed to take the new position I asked for a raise. Not much of a raise, but still a raise. I GOT THE RAISE! This is the first time I've ever asked for a raise based on merit and received it! I am so proud of myself!

Edited: thank you all so much! I appreciate all of your congratulations and well wishes. I cannot tell you just how much all of your replies mean to me! Much love to you all!"
MY DAD DOESN'T HAVE CANCER!,"When my dad called me and told me about the test results and how *he doesn't have cancer* even though the doctors really thought he had it, I couldn't even get any words out of my mouth. I was busy crying with relief.

Best Christmas gift ever!

**EDIT:** Whoa, thanks a lot, everyone! We (my family and I) are very lucky and very thankful, indeed.

**EDIT II:** I just woke up and, seriously, I'm really surprised how big this got. Thank you, again, everyone! And thank you to whoever gave me some gold as well. You guys are great!"
I have always really disliked tattoos. A girl I've been dating just dropped the bomb on me that she has one.,"I was raised in an extremely conservative culture (I am not American, for reference) and I believe that due to my upbringing and other reasons, I have always been put off by tattoos. I met this girl and have known her for a while, and I have recently become very interested in her.

She's definitely the ""rebellious"" type. She's an overachiever and focuses on academics pretty much 24/7. She has a lot of piercings and other alternative features that I don't typically find attractive. I like her a lot though so while I used to be very put off by piercings I am now pretty much neutral, since they can be removed and such. Tattoos are different in my mind and very unattractive to me.

So, we were talking, and we got on the topic of why I don't like them. She got really shy and said she actually has a tattoo and has been reluctant to tell me because of my views. (I have never seen her naked or in a bathing suit so I did not notice before.)

Slightly offput, I asked her what it is of. She replied, ""it's a quote with the nicest thing anyone has ever said about me"". Now, hearing this answer, I become even more offput because I immediately think of something shallow/superficial. I mean, who gets a compliment tattooed on themselves? Really?

She showed it to me. It says in print ""she's the perfect way to make him last."" 

When her dad died suddenly, who she loved so very much, her mom received a condolence letter from a friend and that is a quote from it. She said that that was the nicest, most beautiful thing anyone ever said about her.  

My heart completely melted. I am sorry for being close minded. It made me like her even more. Now excuse me while I go hopefully turn her into more than just a girl I'm casually dating. "
My high school bully's son killed himself,"His mother found his body.  Good lord that poor woman.  It was over cyber-bullying.  There's no schadenfreude to be found, it's just fucking sad.  Sixteen years old.  All of his perceived problems would have soon been resolved and he'd enter the adult world.  Now he'll never have that chance.  Because another kid or other kids were assholes to him.  I don't harbor any ill will toward him.  We were just stupid teenagers, like his kid.  Sometimes kids are assholes but I guess sometimes the consequences can be dire.

I don't know if there's a point here.  Maybe just be kinder to one another.  Life is hard enough, don't make it harder for people."
thank fuck it finally happened,"22, no one knows it was my first kiss, was drunk, was messy, she was hot, was a lot of tongue....



was fucking awesome



"
I just left my students' funeral.,"I'm a middle school teacher, and recently one of my students was murdered in a drive by shooting. Today was his funeral, and I couldn't be more upset by the service the church conducted. It was nothing but a bunch of Catholics jerking each other off and singing their songs. They talked about the child for 30 seconds, and went on for 5 min about who's allowed to take communion and who isn't. Nobody spoke on his behalf, nor were they even given the opportunity. What should have been a time of remembrance and mourning was instead seized as yet another opportunity for the church to celebrate itself. 

I suppose I'll say here what was never said on his behalf: Isaiah was a good kid. He was very bright, and you could see it on his face that he enjoyed learning and embracing his intellect. Unfortunately, that gift was squandering due to a sick obsession with this city's gang culture. Though he was good natured and intelligent, he often spoke to me about how he looked up to certain family members, and aspired to join them in their lifestyle. Instead of fostering those traits that made him such a good student and person, he was instead subverted by those close to him and made to follow in their footsteps. 

He was only 14. Not even old enough to shave. This boy was taken from the world before he was afforded the opportunity to decide what kind of man he wanted to become, and for that I'm heart broken. 

Though I only knew him for a short time, his impact on my is clearly evident. I'll remember him for his sincerity, and for the look on his face the first time I told him how smart he was. Hopefully someone sees this, because he deserves to be remembered for who he was, and not just a reason to sing another round of hymns.

I'll miss you, Isaiah. It was my honor to be your educator, if only for a short time. "
He said yes.,"I have my first official date this week. I'm 26 and gay and I finally found someone who is sweet and funny and incredibly sexy. And most of all he thinks I am cute and awesome as well. I've been single since middle school and it was a girl and I knew I was fooling myself. I'm so excited and nervous but thankful for the chance.

Edit 1: The date is this Thursday and I will definitely update with how it goes. Also thank you all for the overwhelming amount of support. I can't believe so many people are commenting and upvoting and just wow.

Edit 2: The date has been canceled and so has the chance for a future date. Thank you for all believing in me. I am now going to go drown my sorrows in ice cream and Gilmore Girls. "
Ran a half marathon to prove my ex wrong,"2 years ago my [26M] ex [23F] ended our relationship because I wasn’t in the same physical shape as her. We would go running and hiking, but I was always steps behind her. Well, 2 years later, 50+ lbs lost and 1 half marathon complete... fuck you i did it!"
"If you tell someone that 'under no circumstances should you take antidepressants', you can get the fuck out of my life.","I. Am. Furious. I mean I want to punch a wall type furious. I began taking antidepressants back in September after a suicide attempt that I kept quiet about. My 'friend' immediately began to berate me with his talks about mind control and big pharma. I apologised for getting angry with him. He didn't apologise to me for offering me his unsolicited medical advice. I shut up and said no more.

However, it continued. I decided to walk away and not be friends with him anymore. I was mature and didn't get angry with him. He played the victim and acted like he did nothing wrong.

My other best friend is a mutual friend of his, and she has been suffering from depression. She wants to take antidepressants. Yet again with the mind control talk. 'Under no circumstances should you take antidepressants or see a psychologist' - his exact words. Because yes, if wanting to kill yourself isn't a circumstance worthy enough of professional intervention, I don't know what the fuck is. This level of ignorance is so fucking dangerous and it infuritates me. People die because they were too afraid to get help, and it is because of people like him.

Also, I'm pretty sure he has reddit, so I guarantee if he's reading this you know exactly who you are. So a quick message from me: Fuck. You. "
We beat the odds!,"I gave birth to him at 19. I was an unmarried, teen mom. But with the help of supportive family and friends I earned my Bachelor's degree, while working full time and raising my son alone. I bought my own home and worked hard to raise my son right. He stayed out of trouble, graduated high school, and this week he was granted his Bachelor's degree as well (coincidentally from my alma mater and at the same age).  I accomplished what I set out to do - beat the odds by not being a stereotypical single, teen mom and child! We're both college graduates, both self-supporting and have successful careers.  I'm so happy and relieved! Just had to share!

Edit: Thanks all for the kind words and support.  I'm new(er) to Reddit and if I'm not mistaken, this is on the front page. Now my life is definitely complete! "
First day in America and this happens...,"A little bit of backstory, I'm 22 and finished my bachelors in Software Engineering in Cairo(Egypt) where I was born and raised my entire life. I was accepted last spring to a masters program in San Jose, California. Opportunity to study in the  Silicon Valley and I jumped to it which leads me to today. 

I bought the cheapest ticket I could find in coming and had a 40 hour travel time with random connections in Paris and Russia and finally arrived at San Francisco airport around 1pm Monday. Went straight to the place I found online and with the jet lag I fell asleep.

Woke up around 9, freshened up and being a Saturday night I decided to check out the town for a bit as it was my first time in America after watching countless sitcoms. The downtown strip was small in a cute way (everything's small compared to Cairo ) very lively with clubs and bars everywhere. With no US ID and it being my first night I decided to just walk around and get a feel for the place. Around 1am people stared pouring out of clubs. I hung around for a bit as I was wide awake and I noticed these two women (shemales, transgender idk the politically correct term here but they were basically women with all the body parts but you could tell they were guys before) they kept staring me up and down, after a while both came to my each side and stared asking so many random questions and feeling me up. Just that moment my phone dies and I lose all hope of making some excuse. They continued chatting and it got a bit inappropriate to the point where I said I have a friend waiting (no friend obvs) she asked me the place I was gonna meet him and I said a random street and they both took one of my arms and said they'd take me here. All during the same time this creepy guy in his 50's who was with them before was behind me so it was like the three of them escorting me almost physically towards this alley that connects two main streets. Literally being my first day in the country I started Internally freaking out. Just as one of the ladies hands got too far these two really pretty college aged girls came out of nowhere and acted like they knew me and had been looking for me forever, it startled the three escorting me and they backed up a bit. The other girls literally dragged me quickly out of there with me speechless trying to comphrehend what the fuck was going on and why I even left my house that night. They told me they saw what was happening and thought to intervene. They took me to this all night burrito joint and we chilled for hours, I just got back a while ago, they and invited me to a hockey game ( gonna have to learn that quickly haha) next week which was really cool as the semester starts on the 24th and I don't know anyone here!

So basically the whole point of this long kind of pointless story is THANK YOU to those girls and what a first day in America. Not something I'll be telling my parents back home haha but forreal is this normal or did my vulnerable new guy vibe just give it off??"
I Poured My Drink Back Into The Bottle,"I'm only 18, but I've been drinking since I was 14. I've been trying to change since I've started college this fall. My last living situation was with my 22 y/o boyfriend who would encourage me to drink. A lot of the time it was so that I would relax after work or a fight with my mother. Then it became a habit. By the end of the summer I was drinking at least one rum and coke a night. On the weekends I was drinking a six pack and 1/2 of a 5th or rum. 

Tonight, my new boyfriend who has been helping me out, just stepped out to help a friend move some furniture. We plan on having sex when we gets back because he is going out of town for the week. As soon as he left I went to a bottle of Kessler that hadn't been touched in a few months by either of us. I poured some into a glass and was going to start drinking it straight to be more ""fun"" for when he returned. 
Then I realized I was sneaking it. Then I realized he didn't want me to have to be drinking in order to enjoy sex. I don't know why I would think I'd have to either. With my old situation it eventually became necessary but, tonight, after staring at the untouched glass for ten minutes debating whether or not I wanted it, I poured it back into the bottle and got another bowl of soup instead.
I'm happy with myself tonight."
The door closes shut on my stripping career.,"Tonight is July 30th 2017, I’m 23 years old and a month before my four year mark my dancing career has come to a close. After years of telling myself “ I’m going to quit when …” and “As soon as …happens I’ll quit” it has finally happened. I quit.

These last three years have seen me crying in showers, traveling the world.- I watched the sun rise over the 19th arrondissement  for my 22nd birthday. - It has consistently drinking myself to the point of no recollection; of needing to drink in order to get through the night, of building and destroying myself based on moments in a dark sweaty room with men who fed a part of me that felt stagnant and isolated from the rest of my peers. Peers that I watched graduate and become salaried office folks while I put on 6inch heels and danced until I felt my heart through my temple.

I have laid awake, my eyes open in a room drenched in sunlight petrified of my future. Insidious thoughts telling me ‘You’re not smart anymore. You dropped out of school. You didn’t save your money. You don’t know how to work 40 hours. You won’t be anything. Look at you, nothing but memories to show for these last few years. I hate you.” I hate me.

The idea of these thoughts being my reality petrify me, but I am also tired. I’m tired of not feeling progress. I’m tired of hating myself, I’m tired of feeling lonely in a room full of hundreds with someone’s hands on me and I am fucking tired of vodka sodas. 

I am finally to the point where I am more tired than I am scared. It feels like I have been drowsy the last three years and have missed a breath that startled my brain fully awake. 

Quitting. I've pictured it often. That I’d decide I was more than this, rather than just hope it. It was as easy a text. Never have I been more eager to be more than this lifestyle of 4am cab rides and noon hangovers.

I have five months worth of savings and a resume that is three years out of date. But, I’m out! No more taking my clothes off for money. I'm dating a guy who makes me want to be better, and with the support of my friends and family I have interviews lined up.  I’m scared, but I feel so hopeful. Maybe, I can be scared and attempt the life I want anyhow. 

EDIT: It felt as if I had so much to dislodge, more than those two paragraphs that I went ahead and added more. I don’t know if that is proper reddit etiquette. I’ve always just been a voyeur on here. I guess I wanted to have one place with all the summed up guts of this chapter in my life, and reddit offered me that venue. Thank you for even glancing at this.

To the hot girl at the gym who spoke to me,"I was lying on the mat (matt? sp) doing leg lifts when you started to walk by. You are taller than me and naturally more beautiful than me. Oh, and skinnier. You smiled and said something, but I couldn't hear you. When I yanked out my headphones, you told me that you couldn't do leg lifts yourself and said, ""You go, girl!"" 

I have been forcing myself not to be shy at the gym and stop hiding in the women's section; it has less equipment,  but there are less people there. I wanted to feel proud of working out, and I thought that if I worked hard, someone would notice. And you did. 

You made my night because you complimented me when I needed it. Thank you!

Love, 

Slightly less attractive, shorter, overweight girl



[EDIT: Wow, thanks for all of the love! I've been working out for about 7 weeks (down 9 lbs), and this just helps me to keep pushing for my goals. Next time you see someone working their asses off, give them a smile or a nod. It helps immensely]"
Wife thought I was gone. Heard her true feelings,"My wife thought I had already left to pick up my son from Air-soft practice. She was in our room talking with a friend, and what I overheard was informative.  I finally know how she truly feels about me.

I am disabled.  I have a severe degenerative disease that attacks my spine, hips, hands, etc.  It's very hard for me to walk more than 20 feet at a time.  I can't bend over, hold things very well anymore, pick up anything over a few pounds, and quite a few other fun things.

I've been battling this for almost 10 years now.  I fight my absolute hardest to keep as mobile and independent as possible. My wife has always been there for me, and has always gone above and beyond.  I always make sure to tell her how much I appreciate it, and if it's ever too much to please talk to me about it.

Back to yesterday....  I was sitting in the hallway on my walker trying to get my shoes on.  My wife for some reason thought I had already left.  I heard her telling her best friend how she's tired of playing babysitter to a grown man.  She's tired of helping me do things like put a sock on my left foot, because my hip no longer works.  How she is tired of me dropping things, wincing in pain all of the time, tired of me not being able to help with chores, other than very basic things like dusting and wiping counters.  This continued for a few minutes.  One thing after another, on and on.  Finally she said ""I'd give anything to be able to have sex with a real man again""...that it's taken all of her self control to not find someone else to be with...how she can never leave because she'll be the one who abandoned her sick husband.  This gutted me.  It actually made my head swim.  A ""real"" man?  What does that make me?  I always suspected she was bitter, angry, frustrated at the least.  I don't blame her.  I can't imagine how hard it's been on her.  But I never knew she saw me as a lesser person.  

I didn't want to hear anymore.  I don't want to know what else was said.  I went into the kitchen and purposely dropped my water tumbler so she'd hear the tin clank off of the tile.  When she walked in the kitchen I told her I had just walked back in, because I'd forgotten my water bottle.

I've lost everything in these last 10 years.  A career, house, cars, money, pride, mobility, my life.  It's all been replaced with pain, hospitals, surgeries, pills, needles, canes, wheelchairs, sadness, loneliness, hopelessness.  I guess the one thing I never thought I'd lose has now been lost....Love.

I plan on making it easy on her.  I don't want people to look at her and think ""She left her sick husband all alone"", and other things that could be thought and said.  So how do I keep that from happening?.....I'm going to make myself the villain.  I plan on telling her I have been having an affair, and that I think I'm in love with this other woman.  I'm going to give her everything I can give her.  I don't need anything.  I want her to be happy again.  I want her to find what she is longing for.  She'll be angry and hurt.  She will probably hate me for a long time, possibly forever.  But she'll be free from rumors and crass looks.  She'll be free from guilt.....She will be free...from me"
I recently won the worstand longest battle of my life,"There is a lot of backstory here, so bear with me.

In 2006 I was 18 and  dating a man that I knew wasn't ""the one"", but it was simple and easy and I felt safe in the fact that I knew I didn't love him. That was until I got pregnant.

At the time, we lived in our small, rural hometown. My then boyfriend was a well liked ""good old boy"" type, helped out on local farms and such. Everyone that found out about the pregnancy told me I should marry him (he had immediately proposed) because he was a good man and my daughter deserved to be born with a dad, as opposed to being a bastard. So, I did.

I went into the marriage intending to stick it out. I knew I would never be completely happy, but I expected to be content in a simple life with a man who had always been kind to me. Unfortunately, the second I signed those papers, I became his property, at least in his mind. He became brutal, abusive, and cruel, making my life he'll.

We were married less than a year when I left him. I struggled financially, had to quit nursing school to work full time and take care of my infant daughter. But things were finally okay, for almost a year. Then my husband decided to try to take her from me.

 His first attempt came by way of a violent visit to my home at midnight where he nearly broke down my front door. That night I phoned the police and obtained an emergency protective order, which is sort of a temporary restraining order. At a later court date it became a domestic violence order, which lasts for a year, and this granted me custody temporarily.

His next attempt was far more insidious. Having to hide from him and not being able to leave the baby with a sitter during proceedings left me without my full time job and I was forced to move into low income housing. I quickly found another job, but it was a part time minimum wage position. Essentially, I was very poor.

He, however, picked this time to join the military. Now by military, I mean the army reserve. And inactive duty for his entire career. So he literally became just military enough to say he was military. At the same time, he started having people call social services to place false reports. They were usually stupid things like my house was dirty, things I could easily disprove, but still.

That is until he got several people to say that I was either crazy, on drugs , or both. Although this was totally crap, it was crap that took a bit more effort to disprove. Social services requested that I leave my daughter with her father while I underwent psychological and drug screening.

To this day, I don't know if he did it purposely this way or if it was only unfortunate coincidence, but in the month it took them to do the tests, my DVO ended. I was advised not to pursue another while I was under investigation as the custody section could go badly for me.

 What I didn't realize was that letting the DVO end meant that there was now no custody. This essentially means that whoever has the child is not required to return her. I waited three long months after passing both tests easily before I could get a court date. I lost my crappy job. I went two months without even seeing my baby.

When we did go to court, I had no lawyer and no knowledge of what to do, so we ended up going to the wrong court. The judge said he did not have jurisdiction over permanent custody, and awarded temporary custody to the father. The reasons he gave were that she already lived there, and my lack of employment.

There were no jobs in my area, I had lost my car when I lost my job and couldn't commute to another town. I had nowhere to turn. So I went back to court to establish out of state visitation and moved with my mom in Florida. When I sought legal advice from a lawyer here in Florida, I ended up getting scammed by a lawyer who claimed he could get the case done here. Of course, that was false. All that the state of Florida could do was a basic divorce, with no mention of custody.

It took me another two years to gather enough evidence and money to take him back to court. My current husband and I pushed up our wedding date so that we could present a solid family environment. I hired the best attorney in my home county. We found his girlfriend's Facebook, detailing her drug use. We claimed neglect after a doctor discovered over fifteen untreated cavities. We showed evidence that her paternal grandfather, who she was often left with, was a registered sex offender. And just to top it off, my daughter testified that she wanted to live with me.

Still, it took nearly a month before a decision was handed down. But, in December of last year, after battling for almost the entire seven years of my daughter's life, I was granted sole custody of my daughter. She is already flourishing happily here, and I feel like I have finally woken from a nightmare.

Edit 1:  Wow I am super surprised by all the attention this has gotten. I just posted this in the hopes that maybe someone going through what might feel like a hopeless battle can see that it doesn't always end badly. Thank you for all the wonderful things you've said, and to the person who gave me gold, you are awesome. Honestly I don't think I'm all that special, we all have untapped strength in us when everything that matters is on the line.

I had fun for the first time in 2 years last night,"***Update 3/19 - early afternoon***

So with the momentum and good vibes you guys have supplied me with, I decided to send her a text yesterday - because, ya know, I gotta at least see what happens. She responded well and we're on to hang out tonight!!

Obviously there's still a decent chance she'll cancel (weclome to 2017 I guess), or that it will be just meh --- but either way it's all progress to me!


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***Original Post***

My career hustle has taken everything from me - my health, my looks, my girlfriends, my friends, everything.

Finally two weeks ago I broke and made a change. I went out, splurged  on designer jeans, a new pair of converse, and got a gym membership!

 Last night I went out for the first time since college - by myself (cuz you know, no friends :| ), and just started drinking. I don't know if it was just because of St Patty's day, but everyone there were so fucking nice to me and inclusive.

There was even this girl there who was so cute - and some how, some way I ended up meeting her without completely embarrassing myself - honestly a world record by itself.

The night actually ended with the girl making out with me and leaving me her phone number. 

This all sounds real dumb, but all I want to do is cry tears of happiness because the last two years have been so fucking challenging, that I was starting to think things would never get better. It just feels so good to have had a fun time and now a fun memory."
"Dear Secret Santa, I hope you see this.","There are no words big enough, but I will have a go at it anyway.

I am sitting here staring at this screen, as I have many many nights since December 21st, still unable to properly utilize what is usually a very lovely and articulate mind (when it comes to written word).
Even the grammar in that sentence is embarrassing, but cannot be written any other way. Why am I obsessing about grammar? Maybe I feel anything written imperfectly will take away from my sincerity or the power with which I hope this message comes through, but that is not what this is about.

You... Have no idea what you've done for me.

Let me preface this by saying this is not a sob story, I am just telling you these things to show you where my mind was at.

Something happened to me a couple years ago. All the beauty in my body vanished into thin air or locked up so tight it was entirely inaccessible. I treated the most beautiful lover I've ever known so badly it cripples me just to have the memories. I absolutely lost myself. I couldn't listen to music. I couldn't play the piano. I couldn't write. I read, but nothing substantial. I had no drive to exist. I make amends, now, to the poor woman who had to experience it all by staying as far away from her as possible so that she may forget my darkness and live, again, in her light.

But what is a woman without love?

What then, was I to do with what was left of me? I'll tell you... numb it. And I did. With any and everything legal and calorie-less I could get my hands on. No one knows this part of the story. Well... I guess a few do now. I hid it well.

The point of telling you about my relationship is to explain why I signed up for secret Santa. Christmas is my favorite. Buying or crafting gifts for the one I love is one of my most absolute favorite relationship things. Being single this year, I needed a way to fill that hole a bit.

I was in the pits, man. No other way to describe it. It was not the same darkness as I experienced during my relationship. I was no longer mean or hateful. I no longer misplaced my fury... but I was barely breathing. There hadn't been any tears left to cry for months.. All the numbing agents were gone. I was just plain empty. Void of everything but this low lava-like fury that had no will to erupt. Enter you.

I was off to the bank, opened the door, and BAM - huge box.

You know when you smile so big you can't help but laugh? Times that by 35, minimum. I was laughing and grinning like a baby unicorn in a sandbox full of glitter. I lit up like the sun.

I haven't put this guitar down since. I haven't gone one day without playing and singing and cursing at my tiny hands. I haven't gone one day without thinking of you, thanking you.

I sit indian style on my bed and play Nicest Thing by Kate Nash or Waltz for a Night by Julie Delpy hunched over with the body against my chest. It hums and vibrates hard enough to hit my heart and as long as I keep playing - I feel love. I lean back and close my eyes and pretend to be a rockstar playing Don't Stop Believing or Love Interruption by Jack White. I sit up straight and put the bedroom eyes on playing the bass line to Hey by The Pixies, because that song always made me feel sexy.

You have changed my entire life.
""Thank you"" is nowhere near a big enough a sentiment to give you... But thank you.

Thank you.

Thank you thank you thank you.

I hope you have the most unbelievably unimaginably mothereffing AMAZING life possible.

Thank you so much. From the bottom of my heart and any other organ that holds love.

You are the bomb diggity, my friend."
I'm so fed up with sexual harassment.,"I just need to vent. I live in a Middle Eastern country which has a huge problem with sexual harassment. Yesterday, a video of dozens of men sexually assaulting 2 girls went viral. Many men here are complete animals. They can't control themselves and blame it all on us, the women. They say we deserve it because there's always something wrong with us: we wear tight clothes, laugh too loudly or the ridiculous ""why the hell did you go there in the first place?""

This video brought back so many bad memories of my most traumatic sexual assault incident. When I spoke up, many people didn't believe me. My dad didn't let me report it to the police. I see myself in those girls in the video and I feel helpless now just as I did then. Society condones it and it's always our fault. Tasers and pepper sprays are illegal. The police tend to side with the harassers so many women are afraid to report the incidents. It's hopeless all around. 

I'm just so angry and sad. I really don't want to hate men but I'm starting to. I can't help but see them all as sexual predators. I have trouble making eye contact with men or defending myself whenever a random guy harasses me. I freeze every single time and it makes me feel so fucking weak. I'm practically letting them win by being so passive. Because that's what they want: to force women back into their homes and if women want to be on the streets, they should cover themselves with countless layers of clothes.

I hate myself for not standing up to them. For being born in this hellhole in the first place. I despise the society and its rape culture. I despise religion which people use to victim-blame us. Fuck it all. I'm just so tired and I can't take it anymore.

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for their support. I didn't expect this to gain that much attention. Thank you for making me feel heard for once. Your words helped a lot ❤ 

EDIT2: I know that realistically not all men are sexual predators. I didn't mean to hurt some men's feelings. I've always hated generalizations and that's why I said I don't want to hate men. It's important to note that the society and culture people grow up in naturally have an effect on their personalities and actions. Our society encourages men to do whatever they want without consequences for their bad actions. On the other hand, the majority of men I've met from other cultures were very respectful to me. So I definitely don't think that men are inherently evil or anything like that. "
I am fearing for my life right now.,"Long story short: I am an undergraduate student. I work at a public university with one of the most famous, successful football teams in the nation. It's a big part of the culture here. College football is life, essentially. 

My job is part of the academic integrity board as an undergraduate representative. What I do is I am responsible for determining sanctions (and punishment) for students that have been caught cheating in academic work. I am on the board as a neutral party to make the process more fair. 

One student that came through the sanction process was a football player. I did not know this. After hearing the facts of his case, I voted to sanction him. (He literally just copy and pasted an entire Wikipedia page as his paper and turned it in.) Once the coach found out, he came to my place of work and threatened me. He literally said, ""I will get you thrown out of this university for what you've done."" The football player we sanctioned was expelled, because it was his seventh violation (students are normally expelled after their third major violation like this, but he was given more than enough chances). 

This rattled me, but I didn't think anything of it. However, I live in a student apartment complex. There are student athletes that live there. For the past few weeks, I have been harassed by the athletes. I have had my front door vandalized, windows broken. I went to take my trash out a few days ago, and one of the football players drove by me, stopped, rolled down his window and said, ""I'm going to fucking kill you.""

I've called campus security, but I'm legitimately too afraid to tell them what I *think* is seriously going on. 

I told my supervisor (in the academic integrity office) of what's happening, and she told me to ""keep my head down"" and ""she knows."" This whole thing is going a lot deeper than I even know. My supervisor told me that she has been sitting in on cases where our campus is covering up sexual assault claims from students that revolve around athletes. They're being allowed to rape people and get away with it. 

But I'm scared, and the mentality in this city is that athletes are *everything*, so there is no one I can turn to except my supervisor. No one will believe me, or they'll think I'm lying or blowing this out of proportion. 

But what has scared me so much is that tonight, I got home from work around midnight. I was walking from my parking lot to my door. This guy got out of his car and just started running at me. It was the student we expelled. He knocked me over and started kicking me, he pulled out a knife, then ran away. It happened so fast. I called the campus police, then the real police. I told them everything. The campus police laughed it off, but the city police seemed interested--but more like ""this sounds like a good fiction novel"" type interested, not in protecting me. 

I don't know what to do. I can't sleep. It's 6am. I've been up all night. I'm scared. I'm legitimately scared. "
MY WIFE IS PREGNANT WHOOOOOOOOO,"I went to the bathroom last night and saw one of those test things in the trash next to the toilet so naturally I took a wad of toilet paper and picked it up. BOOM PREG. I go lay in bed and when she comes in I hit her with the question, no playing around, I had to know. She confirms. Celebratory sex follows and we talks for the next few hours. GUYS, I'm gonna be a dad but we decided not to tell our families until MAY just in case since most miscarriages happen in the first trimester. I had to tell someone so why not the internet. BE GONE OFF MY CHEST HEAVY JOY."
Found out I have a 35mm Brain tumor on my Pituitary Gland.,"So a little about me, Male, 24 yrs old, living in Australia. 

It started out as a bit of vision loss that I noticed when Photographing some Weddings \(Wedding Photographer checking in\). Got referred to, and made an appointment with an Ophthalmologist for last Thursday at 8:30am and he told me to get an emergency MRI on my Brain. Had the MRI done at 2:30pm, and at 11:30am Friday, my Ophthalmologist called me to confirm that I have a Brain Tumor on my Pituitary gland large enough to be putting pressure on my Optic Nerve \(causing blind spots\). Aside from the vision loss, I'm pretty much asymptomatic of a Pituitary Gland tumor. 

I now have to look forward to talking to the Neurosugreon on Monday that will crack my skull open to get that bad boy out, the Neurologist that will double check my brain \(not sure what else they would do\), and the Endocrinologist that will regulate my hormones after the surgery.

I think my parents are more concerned about the fact that on the surface I don't appear concerned. In reality, I'm slightly worried, but keep telling myself that ""Tough times don't last, tough people do."" I'm glad that it's been caught relatively early, glad that it's a high chance that it's benign, and glad that I have amazing support channels through my friends and family. 

Thank you for reading.

Quick edit: Thank you everyone for your kind words and thoughts. I really appreciate it, and although we've likely never met, it means a lot. It's 1am in the morning and time I think about sleeping - big day tomorrow. Again - thank you."
I [30 F] just sent my husband [31 M] to jail for child sex abuse,"I discovered my husband of 10 years is a pedophile and has been abusing a close family member. I'm trying to cope with this and I am not. At all. I feel like dying, although I wouldn't ever act on it for the sake of my children. He went to jail 3 days ago. 

I'm angry at a lot of his family, as I feel the ones involved in the chain of abuse that led to this failed. 

I'm hurt and disgusted with him. At the same time, I'm mourning the loss of my best friend and my kids' father. It's horribly conflicting and I keep riding the waves of grief, barely afloat. Horrific images keep playing in my mind. I don't sleep, save a couple hours a night. I don't eat much. I'm struggling with the desire to drink myself stupid so I can numb this excruciating pain.

To explain my anger with his family, here is the horrendous history they've kept hushed.

His grandfather [90 M] is a raging alcoholic and a pedophile. He abused my mother-in-law as a child. Then, he abused her daughter, as well.

When my MIL and I had discussed this before she passed, I asked her why she would have ever put her daughter in a position of vulnerability with him. I couldn't imagine how she even continued to have a relationship with him. She said she had blocked that part of her memory and forgotten it had happened to her, then it all came flooding back when the abuse allegations involving her daughter arose. She has since passed away.

Speaking with her daughter, my husband's sister, she said that she had been left with family members for extended periods as a child because her mom worked in remote location for lengthier times. Piecing these parts of the story together, I still cannot fathom how one can forget such things and put their child in that position. I am very angry at my MIL for her lack of preventative measures and blame her to a degree for what has happened since 

So, when my sister in law was a preteen, she sexually assaulted my husband at the age of 5. This didn't come out until later on, when my husband first committed sexual assault himself.

He was a preteen at the time he first perpetrated. My MIL had taken a woman and her 7 year old daughter in off the streets for a period of time over Christmas. She discovered my husband and the girl pantsless in his room. She did nothing. It took years later when the girl went to the doctor, had a vaginal exam, and the abuse came out.

He was charged, with what exactly I don't know. He was placed on house arrest and put into diversion therapy. I talked to him at length about this when I first heard of it, in the beginning of our relationship.

His sister didn't like me because I was ""stealing her brother from her"". He spent less time with her and she was threatened by me, so she would tell me all the dirty family secrets in the hope I would leave him. So, the entire incestuous history was relayed to me.

I brought it up to him as soon as she told me. I was mortified. Of all the horrific things experienced, this was the most morally disgusting thing I'd ever heard and I had no experience with that kind of abuse. I was relatively healthy sexually, if not repressed compared to my peers.

He assured me that the counseling had set him straight. He discussed the shame and the group therapy. He was ashamed that I had found out, angry his sister had divulged that so soon, without giving him the chance to tell me. It was about 9 months into the relationship. I was already in love and believed everything he said. I was wrong and I feel so horrendously guilty for trusting him.

I come from my own line of fucked up hell, but had no experience with sex abuse. Regardless, I have many of my own emotional issues. I battle depression, anxiety and anger constantly, but I'm able to redirect and cope better than most. I'm pretty functional most of the time.



All of this fresh hell has brought up all of the horrible events of my own past. To give a ""brief"" summary of my history -

I grew up around constant abuse. Physical, verbal, and drug abuse. My mother was high on opioid painkillers from when I was 5 until 14, when she went to jail and was forced to quit. She was often comatose or near it during my childhood. She ended up dying 4 years after her sobriety because of the damage the drugs had reaped. I was 18, she was only 49.

Because of my mom's issues, we spent many years living with my aunt and grandmother. My aunt hit my mother, sister, and I a lot during our childhood. Broomsticks, fists, whatever was available. One time, she threw a mug at my mother and shattered her shoulder, resulting in 2 surgeries and a prosthetic bone replacement. She verbally abused everyone, including my grandmother. She was an angry, unhappy person and we all suffered her misdirected wrath....

My uncle [34 M, at death] had drug abuse problems and committed suicide long before I was born, just before his daughter ever met him. He went into the mountains shot himself in his car. My mother [27 F, at the time] had to drive the car down the mountain, still covered in his remains.

Something clearly happened to my mother and her siblings when they grew up, but whatever it was, no one talked about it. No one went to therapy. It just got pushed under the surface and locked away.

At times, I have felt the addictive tendencies coming out and have to reign it in, for fear I'll end up like one of my family members. Sometimes, it feels easier to throw yourself into a bottle and avoid the pain. Many people are unable to reel it in when those urges to say ""fuck it all"" hit.

I've coped with a lot, but I'm totally losing my shit right now. The weight of it all is crushing me. I lost my best friend, the memories of him tainted with the sting of what he's done. I can't believe that I've lived with him so long and been so close, but he was a monster, hiding it all from his ""best friend."" I feel like I missed some sign I should have seen and the guilt is overwhelming.

Then I think of all the people that could have done something to change the course of things that didn't. I wonder what would have happened if only someone got him the help he needed, when he needed it.... If any of the abuse had been reported at any time, how differently would everyone's lives have been?

But nobody said anything. To this day, his grandfather has not answered for what he did. He has lived a long life of freedom doing God knows what to who. How many lives have been hurt? I know of 5, directly related to his actions.

It kept happening because people were shamed into secrecy, too afraid to speak up, kept sweeping things under the rug. No one got proper counseling. The cycle just continued. 

Now, I'm left alone to support my family to pick up the pieces. We are all entering therapy and I'm sure will continue for years to come. I don't know if any of us will ever truly recover from the damage done. I think I might have finally had the last straw that will break me for good.

Tl;Dr: My husband has become the next link in a chain of incestuous sexual abuse and I'm falling apart in every imaginable way.

Fuck people who are against dreamers.,"Okay, rant time.

I love in Los Angeles, which is (I'm gonna guess) one of the larger cities for dreamers. Some of my best friends are dreamers. Both my ex, and my current SO are dreamers (though they're not both from Mexico). They are legitimately some of the best people I've ever had the pleasure to meet and hang out with, and are also some of the most patriotic people I've ever met.

So fuck Trump. Fuck this whole anti DACA thing. I guarantee you these people have never even met an immigrant, much less an illegal one. 

For Christs sake, most of these people are *younger than 17*! To argue that it's somehow their fault that their parents immigrated illegally - when they were *FIVE* - is fucking bullshit.

To the woman who sat in front of me at the Soundgarden/Nine Inch Nails concert this weekend,"To the woman who sat in front of me at the Soundgarden/Nine Inch Nails concert this weekend:

I had been looking forward to this concert for a very long time.  Nine Inch Nails is my favorite band (well, it’s really just Trent Reznor, but he does have a band with him on stage), and while I had seen NIN in concert two times before, I was looking forward to enjoying this concert with my fiancé.  I was looking forward to seeing Soundgarden live for the first time.  It didn’t matter to me that we got the cheap lawn seats since we’re trying to save as much as we can for the wedding in December.  It didn’t matter to me that it was 100+ degrees out as we sat down on our blanket one and a half hours before the show.  It was worth it to get the good seats, center stage, only one row behind another group of people.

As has usually been the case at these shows, the people around us were awesome.  They were true fans that were waiting patiently in the sun like we were.  We laughed, we joked, we got to know each other a bit.  When the bands started playing, we went wild.  Even the dad that was sitting in front of us with his teenaged kids was having a good time.  I even chuckled when he looked rather uncomfortable as NIN started playing Closer. 

Then the dad and his kids left a half hour before the show ended, probably trying to beat the traffic and crowds.  That’s when you showed up with your partner/husband/boyfriend and friend and took their place in front of us.  Your two tall, tough looking guy friends didn’t bother me (at least not at first).  I could tell they were bikers.  My dad’s a biker.  It was obvious that they weren’t that into the music, but they were there for you.  But you, you bothered me.

It was obvious that you were completely smashed.  I think you were just drunk out of your mind, but it’s possible that you were high on something else.  You were smoking.  You were drinking.

You are pregnant.

As you stumbled about, dancing (and I use that word loosely), screaming, gyrating your pregnant belly, I felt so many emotions go through me.  I felt sad for the child that you are carrying inside you.  I felt mad at the fact that your companions just laughed at your antics and seemed to encourage them.  I was infuriated at you for doing what you were doing to your unborn child.  You are already destroying their chance at leading a normal life.

Instead of leaving the concert on a (natural) high, like I always have, I left pained at the future of your unborn child.

Fuck you.  Get your shit together.  If you can’t do it for yourself, do it for your kid.

I hate being a black woman sometimes,"Like usually I’m so used to people being ignorant and racist and I brush it off because I know who I am and they don’t, but sometimes I honestly have to wonder what year it is because some people are so horrible to me and I don’t get it. I feel like the struggle of being a black woman is overlooked- like no one cares what I have to say even if it’s a valid point. I’m an educated, well spoken woman, just a bit shy and awkward. Yet whenever people see me they already have decided how they feel about me- they think I’m dirty, “ghetto”, loud mouth, etc. When they learn I’m different from the stereotype portrayed in the media about fat black women they’re so shocked and disappointed. Another thing I get so fucking upset is that black men, white men, a lot of men try to put dark skinned women like me down like we’re somehow “lesser” than lighter skinned women. I’m so sick of supporting black men and knowing they don’t support girls like me. I saw a post online talking about how successful black men don’t date “ghetto black girls” because they can do “better” and get white girls and I started crying at work because I realized people actually think like this- black men actually think like this. Black women are so disrespected STILL- were seen as garbage and treated as such. Everything we have, everything we create is automatically seen as trendy and better when white women do it. I’m disrespected and treated as just a fetish- I’m not seen as wife material- I’m seen as someone to be used until they find someone better (aka not black/dark skinned). I’ve been in gym class and had a black man say in front of me and a bunch of white girls that he would never date a black woman because they’re dirty and ghetto. I’ve had men lead me on while a white woman was their end game all along and I was just a distraction. I’ve had my words ignored, but when a white man repeated them then everyone suddenly agreed. Whether a woman is uneducated, ghetto, loud, whatever I think they deserve to be treated with respect unless they’ve done something that suggests otherwise. And I don’t mean to say I hate white women, but I am envious that I have to try 20 times harder to earn respect that they’ve been so used to getting they don’t even notice that the world might not be as kind to others not like them. I’m just so depressed this is the world I live in/ I’m so depressed that when I think about having kids I pray for a boy because I don’t want my daughter to experience the shit I have. "
A husband/wife is NOT a glorified boyfriend/girlfriend. I get SO sick of hearing “just get a divorce” when people are trying to find support for marital issues. Does marriage mean nothing anymore?,"Seriously, if it’s that easy to leave one, why does anyone even bother getting married in the first place? A marriage is made up of two imperfect people who are going to fail and hurt each other. If the answer is “get a divorce” every time someone fucks up, then no one should ever get married. Do these people say their vows knowing they’re meaningless? If so why say them?

I commend the people who are feeling guilty for hurting their spouse, and I have respect for the spouses who decide to forgive. If marriage is done right, walking away will tear away pieces of your soul even if you are wronged. If it doesn’t then idk why you bothered with marrying in the first place. When considering marriage, if in the back of your mind, you’re keeping the “we can always divorce if” backdoor open, then you should seriously consider NOT getting married. You can still have a relationship with this person for as long as you want, and leaving will be easier when you do it. 

And while I’m at it, please don’t think that being 21 and cheating on your Gf/bf is the same as doing it while married. If you’re in a relationship with a person you want to cheat on, you probably shouldn’t be exclusively dating anyone. There is nothing wrong with playing the field before marriage. Our culture glorifies serial monogamy, and demonizes people who keep their options open, but I think a lot of people would be a lot happier in their marriages if they would go through plenty of people to find “the one.”

"My best friend got married yesterday, and I wasn't invited","She and I grew up together as best friends... Dance partners, she and I knew each other inside and out... We talked all the time, hung out all the time, and we used to talk about how I'd be one of her bridesmaids even though I'm a guy and that I'd get to DJ their reception and we'd go ham on the dance floor... As much as you can love a friend, I loved her, and at one point I was sure she felt the same about me, but randomly this past summer she ceased contact with me before her and her fiance moved out of state, and the last thing I know of is that they didn't plan to get married for at least another year.  Imagine my surprise as I sign in to Facebook today to see a marriage announcement... My childhood, my heart feels broken. I want to cry. I just want my best friend back."

I started ""running"" two weeks ago, and after two minutes of jogging, I thought I was going to pass out and die. But now I can run a MILE!

I CAN WALK,"IT HAS BEEN 5 MONTHS AND I CAN FINALLY WALK AGAIN!!

I was in a motorcycle accident in September that snapped both my arms in half, broke the C1 vertebrae, multiple fingers and the talus bone in my ankle. Docs weren't sure if I'd be able to walk. It's been 5 months and I CAN WALK AGAIN!!"
"Yesterday, my mom touched me.","I am a 16 year old girl who has a horrible relationship with my mother. I hate her, I hate her so much. I suffer from depression, severe anxiety/panic attacks, eating disorders, and self harm. I have no social life, nobody who I can talk to and it is tearing me apart. I don't get much sleep because I feel so alone, and I typically spend 3-4 hours silently crying to myself each week.

I had a really horrible day yesterday. My mom pushed me on the floor and pulled down my sweatpants. She called my dad to come over, and she said look at what your daughter does! She shaves. (Which I do. I despise pubic hair, always have; I feel it is masculine). And she proceeded to feel my pubic area and slap me there, hard. I cried and yelled at her to stop. She then proceeded to yank me up by the hair and slam my body against a wall. 

I have been crying since about 1 am in the morning now, and it's 11. Mostly it's just a steady stream of tears dripping down my face. I took 3 muscle relaxants about an hour ago.

I have nobody at all in the world. My mom says that if she ever catches me shaving again (she's going to check my pubic hair everyday now) she's going to take away my laptop which I need for school work and my phone. I don't even have my laptop right now and I'm on my familys computer using icognito mode. My social life is already nonexistent because I do a rigorous school program. 

I feel so hopeless and alone. When she was yelling at me yesterday I honestly thought of going downstairs in the later part of the night, grabbing our largest knife and stabbing myself in the chest/heart. ANYTHING. I want to get out of here. I can't take it anymore, and I'm so alone. I'd rather be in an institution right now, or homeless, anywhere. I feel like my body isn't my own anymore, I feel disgusting. Before my mom pulled my sweatpants down I was talking to one of my only 'close' friends whom I trust. I told him a condensed version of what my mom did, and now I'm afraid he hates me. 

I don't want to lose him. He's all I have, and I feel like a whiny bitch face and so ashamed at myself. I really just want a hug right now, but there's nobody around to hug me. 

I'm thinking now. I wonder how many muscle relaxants it might take to kill me. I wonder how deep I should cut to kill me. Do I have the guts to stab myself? 

My mom has a knack for publicly embarrassing me. Humiliating me. Making me feel like shit. I cannot even count the number of times she has thrown away all my feminine products, taken my babysitting money, and left me to bleed. Following me when I go to friends houses. Making up lies to my friends very religious parents that I'm gay, resulting in my friends themselves finding me disgusting. I don't think she deserves a suicide note. "
Just broke through to a student in a way I never thought I would.,"I'm teaching summer school right now and as assumed, a majority of the kids don't wanna be there.  Anyways, I've been able to get through to most of my students except for this one kid.  He's super-quiet (scores well in assessments relative to his class, though) and participates sporadically.  He's not disruptive and he's attentive for the most part, but sometimes he's prone to ""disappearing"", if that makes any sense.

Anyways, he wore this shirt yesterday:

I'm not a Brony and I don't really have a strong opinion about their fandom (to each their own) but I knew this was my way in.  Some quick research at /r/mylittlepony and I thought of a way to quickly bond with this student.  

I assigned group work and while I was walking around checking on the groups, I walked up to this kid and put my fist up and said, ""Bro-hoof"".  He gave me a fist bump and I swear his face lit up brighter than even I thought could be possible.  He smiled and ever since then, he's been a model student.  It's so crazy to see how a fist bump (Bro-hoof, if you must) can have just as much importance as all the educational and pedagogical theory I've had to learn to be a teacher.  

Life is funny.

"I'm 23, bald, have a smaller than average penis and have had an assortment of problems my whole life. I want to let everything out.","I don't care anymore and I just want to vent and let it all out. 

I'm 23 and have never been with someone, apart from a ""long distance relationship"". I've been balding since the grand age of 19. I have a smaller-than-average penis, at around 4 inches, with little girth. Two of the least desirable traits in a man. I currently have a shitty underpaid job that's going nowhere and I hate waking up in the morning for it.

Actually, let's back up a bit. I have a whole lot more.

I was born with cancer and operated on at 1 year-old, leaving a long scar across my abdomen. I almost died by swallowing a battery the year after that. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure as a child and had frequent severe nosebleeds for most of my childhood.

Starting at elementary school, I've had 'friends' think it would be funny to spread rumors behind my back, making people believe I was gay. Since everyone at that age is very kind and understands rumors might be lies, everyone I knew and talked to started avoiding me. I became the school ""reject"" and was everyone's laughing stock. It went as far as being bullied by girls.

Now, high school. It only gets better. I hated it and had severe depressiong throughout most of it. I had one friend during my whole stay in high school. He moved away after one year and proceeded to ignore me despite reaching out to him. Apart from that, the high school I went to was right next to the elementary school, meaning I had many of the same people carry over. 

The bullying got worse. If there was a substitute teacher, I'd be guaranteed to have things thrown at me. Not just paper balls. Whole pencil boxes. That shit hurt. A lot. Physically. I never did anything because I was lead to believe they'd ""get tired and would stop"". They didn't. Ever. I came back home a complete mess and would cry out loud if nobody was around.

This kept going for the rest of high school. I was still the reject. I became overweight (obese) and got severe acne which scarred my face permanently, just so people could have even more reason to bully me. I tried a bunch of products to cure my acne, including accutane. Nothing ever worked. In fact, accutane more than likely triggered my hair loss in the first place. 

My depression reached a new low. I started wishing I'd get hit by a car on my way to school. I skipped school all the time. And I mean ALL the time. I was the person who missed school the most. My mom yelled at me, other people at school (sometimes even including teachers and the school psychologist) were treating me like a subhuman because of it. Despite skipping all the time I managed with okay grades. Child services threatened to take me away from my home, but never did.

Then, right as my last year of high school was starting, I started experiencing brain tumor symptoms. More issues. What could it be this time? Pseudotumor cerebri. An extremely rare disorder that happens mostly to obese women between the age of 20 and 40. Comes packaged with the same symptoms as a brain tumor. I was operated on and given more antibiotics to take. I eventually just dropped out of high school since I had fallen so far behind on everything. I stayed home alone all day, everyday, playing videogames in complete and absolute solitude for a long time.

Everything was a wreck. I sometimes wish I had died with my cancer. But...

I haven't. I'm still alive, motherfuckers. And I'll keep living on for a long time yet. I haven't figured it out how yet, but I'll find ways to get enjoyment out of this life.

Thanks for listening."
My husband has smaller than average hardware...,"... and our sex life is amazing.

One of the most disheartening things to see on the internet is all the shade cast on men who are below average, as if a 3-5"" penis makes them sexually sub-human. My husband is an incredible lover (I mean, vaginal orgasm incredible), and I just wilt every time I see comments like ""LOL, WHERE'S THAT DUDE'S DICK"" attached to photos or videos of statistically normal guys. Hell, one of my girlfriends in college used to make comments like that as we watched Game of Thrones. (Really?!) Attitudes like that hurt me, so I can only *imagine* how much they hurt my husband.

The worst thing is that I feel like I'm the only woman in the world who feels this way sometimes. Whenever I search ""my husband has a small penis"" on Google, the forum posts that pop up always end with: ""... help!"" I don't need help! I just want to vent with someone as tired of this unnecessary prejudice as I am!

Obviously, women and men are entitled to their sexual preferences. My sister likes tall guys and my best friend likes big boobs. That's fine. I'm just tired of the shade when, honestly, there is no reason to feel like a < 5.5 inch schlong is a sexual death sentence.

Thanks for letting me get that off my chest.

My broken little dog brought me his bone.,"I have a little rescue dog called Fox. I've had him for five months. He is a pomeranian, chihuahua cross and although I know some of his history, I don't know all of it. I know we're at least his fourth home and he's only just over a year old. I know that in his previous home he was bullied for a month solid by their big standard poodle. The poodle didn't allow him to have attention, took all his treats and toys away from him and pinned him down and bit him. This is why the owners knew they had to give him up and made that hard decision (I have every respect for them). Fox hates tall men, he hates people wearing black, people in hats and especially people in motorcycle gear. He's scared of people, he can't stand being with dogs in enclosed spaces and he is nervous all the time. He worries about where the cat is and is constantly alert for every sound. He barks at the rain on the windows and the clicking of the radiators heating up. And he is selfishly possessive of his treats.

If a treat is too high in value (pigs ears are one example) he gets stressed that they're going to be taken away from him. He carries them round for hours trying to find somewhere to hide them. Then he checks on them constantly and moves them to new hiding places. It's heartbreaking to watch, but if I try to take them away he snarls and bites.

This is why yesterday was so important. Fox is a survivor, he thinks of himself, but yesterday he thought of me for the very first time. I ate something bad and had the worst stomach ache ever, you know the kind that makes you feel nauseous and feverish. I was curled up on the couch waiting for the inevitable run to the toilet I was going to have to make. Fox came over and at first I thought he was doing what he always does when I'm on the couch, finding somewhere warm and comfortable to sit. But he was standing on me. I opened my eyes to push him off as I was in pain and I saw his bone I'm front of me. He then leant over and pushed it towards me with his nose.

I melted.

This poor, broken dog who suffers from anxiety and is currently on medication for a skin condition, for the very first time thought of me. When I had flu in December he just wanted me to play with him and didn't understand why I couldn't, but yesterday he understood that I was in pain and wanted to make me feel better. This is so huge for him and for our bond. I love my little dog and I hope this is the first step towards him healing from all the hurt he's endured. I want him to be happy and relaxed and have a normal doggy life. He deserves it.

I dumped my boyfriend because he wasn't going anywhere in life.,"WoW addict, worked in fast food, flunking out of school, chronic porn abuser, smoker, heavy drinker, lives with his mom. Tried and tried to make it work but as I got my life together, his continued to fall apart. I avoided breaking up with him for the longest time because it felt like nobody else would ever want to be with me. 

The night I broke up with him, a guy asked me for my number. He's an attorney, homeowner, and recreational athlete. I said yes because it's time for some new experiences. I don't know if anything will come of it (probably not because I'm still processing the breakup) but we're going to grab drinks tonight and I'm happy.

I kind of wish we could go back to how things were before the falseness of social media ruined our ideas of how life and relationships should be,"We have created a culture for ourselves of being able to say whatever want to whoever we want, whether or not we know these people, whether or not we actually add to a conversation, whether or not we are being supportive or demeaning or insulting or vulgar.  We post these images that attempt to show this weirdly perfect life where we want people we don't know to look at us in admiration and want what we have, even though those images themselves aren't a true reflection of reality.  We post selfies that were taken on the 8th try in specific lighting conditions after a ton of hair, makeup and clothing adjustments in specific environments for.. what?  Whatever happened to us just being human in our appearance and actions?  Why must we spend so long with face primers and concealers, contouring and wearing fake eyelashes and hair extensions and posing with our asses out or with people in these weird lines with our stomachs sucked in and our arms flexed to give them maximum thinness, dresses so tight that we are constantly conscious about how they look and fit and we can't just relax and enjoy ourselves anymore.  We spend so long posing for pictures and creating images that don't exist in any natural context for.. also what?  I don't get it.

I love that social media I can stay connected to people if I choose to, and that I can follow people I admire doing things that interest me.  NASA, Guitar World, Formula 1 news, Earth Porn and cake decorators at work, all that weird stuff.  I miss being seen as an individual on these platforms though.  The herd mentality is crazy, every feels like they need to be a part of a mass that has no definition and contains people whose opinions you won't even read or respect.  I miss that the conversation is not directed to me an an individual anymore, but to a mass of unknown quantity, like shouting into a room full of people and seeing what sticks.

I'm not sure what the point of this is, but there is a simplicity to life that simply doesn't exist anymore for people of our generation who have grown up knowing mass communication as the norm.  Intimate relationships are hard to build, we don't know how to communicate in real life.  We're on our phones, constantly checking for content and comparing and looking at posts from 'friends' that it would be unlikely they would show us if we met up for coffee and a chat, but that they will plaster day in, day out on content sharing apps.  I have a Facebook friend right now, the wife of an ex-coworker, posting images every day of how many steps she has walked on her pedometer.  There are so many things I hate about that statement.

I know the complete irony that I am posting this on a social media site and I HATE it, because this is where I find the memes and stories that I then tell to my friends when I see them.  It's not even about what is happening in our lives anymore.  I am SO tired of phones.  I just want to hang out with people and enjoy being present in life and I wish more people did too.

Rant over, I think."

I want to talk about Jonathan,"He’s a mutual friend of a guy I know. The guy was great, and when he introduced me to Jonathan at a Halloween party last year, I knew Jonathan would be great too. Even though I was in a really short black dress, had a guy on each arm, and was holding a giant inflatable penis, I took a shine to Jonathan. Immediately, I liked the tall, skinny, nervous-looking blond guy with glasses. 

At the time, I’d recently gotten out of a very abusive relationship. She’d been the queen of gaslighting and manipulation; her emotional abuse wore me down over the course of the two years we’d been on and off. She was “asexual” and often shamed me for having a high drive, saying that women shouldn’t want sex as much as I did. She refused to experiment with me. She made fun of my anxiety, my depression, and my PTSD. Then, late one night, she dumped me out of the blue. I found out she was cheating on me with a man. I didn’t trust people for a while after that. 

But, for some reason, I felt like I could trust Jonathan. We started hanging out alone, going to Denny’s in the middle of the night after I got off work. Even though he was awkward and shy at first, we discovered that we had a lot in common. Eventually, the ice broke, and we were reveling in our inside jokes and sitting very close to one another in the dining hall. Touching each other’s hands. Catching each other staring. 

I was his first; I took his virginity one night after work. His hands shook, but he was determined to please me. I told him my pleasure didn’t matter, but he made me come anyway. He didn’t last long, but I didn’t care. I cared a lot more about the way he regarded me when I laid in his arms afterwards, his blue eyes warm and caring. I felt loved. 

I don’t know how, or why, but Jonathan does everything right. He’ll hold my hand when we’re walking outside and it’s cold. He’ll get me dinner when I’m struggling to make ends meet between paychecks. He takes care of my pleasure and makes sure everything is equal. Without prompting, he’ll tell me wonderful things—how beautiful I am, how smart I am, how ambitious and wise and amazing I am. I don’t think I tell him those things nearly enough.

So let me say this: Jonathan, I love you. I love you from the tips of your light blond hair to the toes on your giant feet. I love how deep your voice is and I love the goofy, random little songs you sing me when we’re alone. I love the fact that we can sit next to each other for hours and just show each other stupid memes. I love how you’re full of endless love to give—how you praise all the parts of my body that I hate, like my chubby stomach and the stretch marks on my thighs. But most of all, I love that you love without discrimination, without fear, and in face of all my problems. 

2016 may have been a rough year, but you are worth all of it. 

Love,
Your girlfriend"
Fuck you secret santas who didn't ship,"Fuck you all. A lot of people like me put a lot of time and thought into our gifts and you just fucking RUIN the fun for everyone. I sent a really nice gift only for my SS to bail on me. Right now there are 191k matches pulled and only 165k shipped. That's a HUGE disparitiy. If you didn't do it because you were unable, at least have the foresight to not sign up. If you did it only to receive gifts and fuck your match over by sending nothing: **FUCK YOU**.

I've read soooo many posts about people saying that they're holding back from joining SS because they don't want to encounter this problem. The people that do this both damage their matches faith in the system **AND** people who want to join but fear getting a doucherino.

People who don't ship should be permanently IP banned from reddit and redditgifts for 10000 years. And their associated account should be deleted.

What grinches!"

The time my brother protected me from being sexually assaulted,"So, he's actually my younger cousin. Third cousin. To make a long story short, his mom was poor and lived in a bad neighborhood with a bad school and my parents are pretty wealthy. 

So my parents offered to let him live with us (in a different state) and go to the stellar school in our district.

So this is basically the first day he and I have met. I mean, we'd seen each other at Christmas and Thanksgiving before maybe 2 or 3 times but never really talked. Mainly because the age difference (I'm 2 years older).

So it's the end of summer just before school starts back up and he shows up to move in one day. I saw him and just invited him out with me and my friend to go to a hotel party. 

Idk why I invited him, I just did. So we lucked out because we really got along amazingly well like we'd known each other for our entire lives and my friend really liked him, too.

So we go to the party and it's important you know two things: 1. My brother is straight edge af. He never drinks or smokes and never has. 2. I'm a bit of a light weight.

So we're there and hanging out, whatever blah blah blah. We all laugh at my brother because we catch him pretending to drink the alcohol I gave him (and this was like 5oz Pepsi and a half ounce of...maybe gin? I don't remember. At any rate, it was basically Pepsi with some liquor splashed in it.

Night goes on and I drink. Not enough to get drunk or anything. But when I drink, I get sleepy. So there we are. I'm laying on the bed half asleep from the drinks and he's just sitting there next to me. 

I actually really feel bad for him, looking back. He'd been up, at that point, for like a full day because of the drive to my parents' house and there he was in a new city with a new cousin and he doesn't know anyone and he doesn't drink...so he's just sitting there waiting for us to take him back to my house.

So anyway...I'm laying there half asleep and he's sitting next to me. I feel someone else get in the bed to my right. I figure it's my friend or another girl, but no. It's some guy. And then I hear my brother say this: ""Touch her, and I will harm you."" I'll never forget that quote because, to me, it's equally hilarious and kind of bad ass.

At this point I'm waking up fully and I hear the guy at first ask if I was his gf and then if we were related.

My brother just blankly stared at him. And my brother looks really intimidating. He just has one of those faces, you know? 

So then the guy gets up and leaves the room. My brother later told me he was moving his hand to reach up my skirt.

Ever since then (and not only because of this incident) I've called him my baby brother and he calls me his sister and I love him to death. Probably my closest family member.
 
The end. Thanks for reading. "
My cat just died about 5 mins ago,"He ran in to our house all of a sudden and then hid under the chair. I lifted the chair and he's breathing very hard and in shock (eyes wide open). No open wound or anything. Few seconds later he coughed blood. Changed position for a bit, and then coughed blood again. And then he didn't move. No more breaths. He died. I'm not sure what happened but I think he might've been hit by a vehilce, poisoned, or hit by a blunt object by someone very painfully but in a way it won't make any apparent injury.

He was such a loving cat and very clingy. Always used to wake me up in the morning and sometimes even gets on my lap, and the on the monitor while I am playing on my PC. 

I can't believe I am saying this now but rest in peace.


"
To the nurse that shamed me as a teenager,"I remember the incident like it was yesterday. I was 16 and had my first appointment with a new doctor. The nurse weighs me, takes me into the room and proceeds with the usual line of questioning. I'm a healthy, young person with nothing out of the usual to report, until I remember the results letter from the first time I gave blood. ""Oh, I also have Hepatitis C."" 

The nurse looks shocked and disgusted. She says, in an unmistakable judgey tone, ""that's a terrible thing to have. Really, really, bad."" Then she walks out of the room. 

What that nurse didn't know is that I didn't ""earn"" this disease, as she most likely assumed. My mother passed it along to me. I've never done IV drugs or put myself in any situation to have contracted it otherwise. 

So nurse, who shamed me and made assumptions about how I got a blood borne illness: Fuck You. How dare you judge your patients like that? I wish I could go back and tell you to your face how shitty you made me feel for getting dealt a bad hand. 

This happened 15 years ago. And while hep C took my mom, it won't take me. I finished treatment 2 years ago and I'm never looking back. "
To the dog at Trout Lake,"I noticed you, dog.  
  
I watched you find the biggest stick in the whole wide park.  
  
I watched you figure out the logistics of carrying the stick for close to a minute, after (brilliantly) deciding on carrying the stick from the middle.  
  
I watched you run with all your heart to catch up with your inattentive owner.  
  
I watched you place the stick in front of him, at his feet, and look up at him, waiting for praise. Much deserved praise - I mean, you found the biggest stick in the park, which logically means you're the best dog, and your owner should be proud.  
  
I watched him not even pay the slightest bit of attention as he walked past your crowning achievement like a zombie.  
  
I watched you pick the stick back up, run back in front of him, drop it at his feet and, again, look at your owner, once again hoping to impress your beloved master.  
  
I watched him ignore it again.  
  
I watched you do this seven more times as the two of you stumbled past the lake.  
  
I watched him ignore it seven more times.  
  
I heard you whimper and give up.  
  
You broke my heart, dog.  
  
If you were my dog, I would give you all the attention and treats.  
  
That was an amazing stick, you're an amazing dog, and you deserve a better owner.  
  
Just thought you should know. "
The guy who killed my dad seven and a half years ago finally replied to my message.,"*I posted this on facebook. But I feel that if I could help a single soul, I'm preachin' it. I'm going to post exactly what I said:*

So a few months ago, I sent the guy who killed my dad a message on facebook. I told him how I felt, how I've been robbed of the greatest man I've ever known... Hell, the kindest and greatest PERSON I've ever known. He loved everyone, and everyone loved him. I miss him to fucking death. If it ever happens, he'll never see me get married or have children. I told him how angry I was that in these seven and a half years, he never once apologized to the family. I never heard back.

He sent me a message last night, unaware that there was an ""other"" inbox. (Heck, I just discovered that myself.) He deeply apologized and said that if there was one thing he could take back, it'd be that night. He legally could not apologize and regrets listening to his attorney and not apologizing, but thought it was received to us by other people. Apparently there's a mass at his church for my dad every year. He extended an offer to go and wants to personally express his guilt and sorrow.

And you know what? I believe him. It was a genuine apology, and it's a guilt he has to live with for the rest of his life. A guilt that NO human being should endure. It was truly a freak accident, and it could happen to anyone. I'm not a religious person, but I am going to the next mass. I will meet him. I will talk to him. I know it won't be until August, but I am still shaking. I'm nervous. I'm relieved. I'm... I'm every emotion that exists.

It takes A LOT of courage to contact me. He didn't have to respond. He didn't have to reach out. He could have just ignored it and move on with his life, especially since I sent the message months ago without a response, thinking he didn't care. I am truly shocked and still in disbelief. We have actually been messaging each other back and fourth. This is beyond something I thought would happen. I never knew I had it in me to converse with him.

If I were in his shoes, I have no idea what I'd do. The fact that he did shows that he is truly sorry and feels a guilt that cannot be undone. It's a very kind, courageous gesture that not many people would have the guts to do.

I forgive him. And I will finally have closure.

**EDIT:** I didn't think this would be anything other than a couple of upvotes. Of course I didn't post it for upvotes or anything. I just wanted to potentially help someone. if possible. Thank you for the gold, kind stranger. I just woke up to this surprise.
Since this became so popular, I hope I helped someone overcome a tragedy. More importantly, I hope everyone can learn to empathize and forgive, even in these circumstances.
For the curious as to the accident:

I was sixteen at the time of the accident (I am 23 now). My dad was riding his motorcycle on the highway (waaay out in the middle of nowhere) at nighttime coming home to grab the truck to pick me up from the mall. He made a detour to go to a man's house, a man who was an alcoholic and in a wheelchair who also got picked on a lot, to talk and pray with him. (Side note: My dad kicked his alcoholic habit about four years before.) After that, on his way back, the man went to make a u-turn, misjudging how fast my dad was going and my dad struck the side of his vehicle. It was an instant death.
Unfortunately, my mom (who got mad at him for taking too long so she went to pick me up herself) drove up on the accident. She was the fourth car. She saw a motorcycle, had a bad feeling, and got out of her car to see what it looked like. You can hear her screaming and crying on the police dashcam. It's very haunting."
The drunk driver who put my friend in the hospital started a gofundme page. I left a comment.,"She described a list of her injuries from a head on collision and how she will be out of work for 8 months. On Valentines Day, she was drinking after work (bar job) and then tried to drive home around 2 in the morning. She passed out at the wheel, doing at least 55-60 mph and swerved into the lane my friend was in. The impact was so great, the rescuers had to cut the brake pedal out of the car because it had lodged in my friend's leg. 

My response: ""You should also say how you caused the accident by driving drunk and putting the driver of the vehicle you hit into the hospital. The cops said you were passed out drunk. The woman you almost killed broke her back and both legs. She needed to have her heel replaced and the brake pedal was embedded inside her leg. They needed the jaws of life to get her out of her vehicle. You should be in jail. At the very least, you should be raising funds for the crash you caused to help pay her bills."" 

EDIT: I didn't make this post to ask for money, or to publicize either party. However, due to interest, I will share the link to my friend's gofundme page. I also did not share that a few weeks ago, the house they had bought just prior prior to the accident caught fire and took out the roof/attic of their home. She slept there maybe a week or two before the accident. They are extremely nice people and do not deserve such suffering. Her gofundme page is at: http://www.gofundme.com/sd6jbg"
"You are NOT ""in the closet""!","Dude. You are not a married, closeted, polyamorous person.

I just lost it at the pharmacy section of my grocery store,"This evening I went to the grocery store and picked up a prescription. It was for Truvada, which is an HIV prevention drug (and the same drug that those with HIV take in combination with others). It's commonly called PREP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) and reduces the chance of contracting HIV by up to 99%. When the pharmacist rang it up, it came to $0 and I burst into tears.


I'm a gay guy. About a year ago, I made a less-than-great decision and went home with someone I had just met at a bar. We proceeded to have sex and the condom broke. The guy didn't say anything until the next morning (to be fair we were both FAR gone that evening), when he told me he was HIV positive.


Fortunately I had done a bit of research and knew about PEP (Post-Exposure Prophylaxis, ""Plan B"" HIV prevention treatment). When taken within 72 hours of exposure, this can dramatically reduce the chances of contracting HIV. I made a same day emergency appointment for my doctor's office and went in. I was shaken and it's a blur, but I remember them drawing blood and watching the bag fill up. Watching how careful they were to wipe the blood off at the needle point before putting the band-aid on. Asking if I was the ""active"" or ""receptive"" partner; a raised eyebrow of surprise when I told him both. The doctor didn't know what PEP was and had to look it up (which I still don't understand to this day). Thankfully the doctor wrote the prescription and off I ran (quite literally) to the pharmacy.


Despite trying to hold my composure, after reading the prescription the pharmacist pretty quickly picked up on the fact that this was a ""time sensitive emergency"". They filled it, ran my insurance, and rang me up.  My heart dropped through my stomach.


The total was $1,250 for 30 pills. Insurance had covered about $350. I knew that I didn't have that much money in my bank account. I paused. I had just finished paying off credit card debt and knew that I would be paying the interest on this for several months (if not years) before I could pay it off.


If you've never had to make a decision like this, please consider yourself lucky. In retrospect it sounds silly - reduce your chances of contracting a life-long disease? Of course it's worth the money. But in the moment, it becomes so much more difficult. It's almost as if you're paralyzed. You know you need it but you can't reason with yourself that YEARS of consequences will result. It's already a blur, a nightmare, and now you have to decide whether it's worth it to lay down all the money you have left.


I swiped my card and took one of the pills while it processed.


For those unfamiliar with HIV testing, it takes about a month from potential exposure for a test to be ~90% accurate, and 3 months for the test to be 98% accurate. These were the longest months of my life. Living in stress. Fear. Rethinking how superbly idiotic one decision had been and how I deserved to suffer for it, yet also feeling like ""why me?"" Thinking about how it had to be the other guy's fault, and then the shame of realizing how cruel and disgusting that thought process is. At one month I threw up between my blood draw and finding out the results. I was negative.


Fast forward, I was able to switch jobs which came with a pay bump but more importantly, MUCH better insurance. I changed doctors. I went in and explained what had happened - that I don't have sex very frequency and always use a condom, but wanted PREP if I could afford it. They put me in touch with a local nonprofit that set up a copayment card with the manufacturer for me that would cover the first ~$5,000 of copayments each year, and they called the insurance company with me to confirm that PREP was covered. So this evening I went in, and it all worked; my share was only $50, but the copayment card covered it. It was free.


I'm still thinking about my reaction. Did I cry because I was happy? A little.  But the more I reflect the more I realized I was frustrated. Frustrated that today there is probably someone going through the same experience that I did, and having to choose their health or their financial stability. Angry that I was the one that had to tell my doctor about PEP and not the other way around, and thinking that there is probably someone who didn't happen to look it up on their day off and relied on a medical professional that didn't know what to do. And feeling hopeless. Powerless. I think that is why I cried.


I will be donating the $50 copay to the nonprofit that helped me.  Please, please support your local health nonprofits. They are so important and they really do change lives.


You don't know what someone is going through. Please be nice to each other. Thanks for reading this all the way through.

Edit: I'm overwhelmed and humbled by the amount of support I've received. Thank you so much everyone. I've received multiple requests for the name of the nonprofit that helped me. They are [Cascade Aids Project](http://www.cascadeaids.org/)"
"Mom, my skin is naturally darker than yours. Please get over it.","Please please please stop telling me how ugly and dark my skin is. No, it's not this color because I've neglected it, or because I don't use enough lotion. My skin has been the same color since I was a kid; look at the pictures and see for yourself. It's just naturally darker than yours, and my sister's. So stop comparing me to her and yourself. 

There's nothing wrong with my skin tone. Lighter skin is not automatically better looking. Why do you get so offended when white people think that way, yet allow yourself to hold the same prejudice? Educate yourself and correct  your views, please. And if you're too old to change your ways, then at the very least just leave me alone about it."
My wife is displaying all of the symptoms of pregnancy...,"and I fucking love it. She's getting all of these weird food cravings, so this week she's drinking Coke (and she is not a soda person at all) and we got ice cream at Cold Stone. She loves pizza and sushi (edit: cooked fish and veggie rolls only) all the time, so we're eating that and those are two of my favorite foods in the universe. Her boobs are getting huge and it's hilarious because she already had amazing boobs and now they're just gigantic and way too sensitive, and we get to make jokes about it. Now that she's pregnant, sex is so much more free and when we have sex she's always incredibly wet and it feels amazing - pregnancy sex is the best. She gets mood swings (mood amplification is a more accurate term), but I know they're coming so they're hilarious - when I call her on the way home from work it's, ""Dude, I'm so happy you're coming home! I'M HUNGRY.""

I just love it so much. I feel like I'm just getting these surges of oxytocin and all I want to do is love and comfort her; all I want to do is make her happy and comfortable and I love it so much. I love her so much. She's going to be such an amazing mother, and that's awesome because she's going to be the mother of our child.

It's the end of our first trimester, so we get to tell people now. I get so excited when I tell people that I tear up, and I can't wait to tell everyone.

I don't know what kind of person we're bringing into this world, but we'll both do our best to make sure that they feel loved and comfortable, and we hope that this person is a good one that will be happy working toward the betterment of humanity like the two of us.

My heart feels so swollen with love that I feel like I'm going to explode.

EDIT: Somebody told me I may feel feelings of guilt for not going through the changes that my wife is going through and I love that he said that because it makes total sense. I had a ton to write about, so I'll just paste it. Thank you all for your kind words, it made my morning so bright.

>/u/gazanga: It's an amazing feeling and there are a ton of emotions coming. Just remember that it's not uncommon for you to feel guilty for not feeling ""changed"" or connected, at times. Mom has that little baby inside of her, at all times. You go out, maybe work, have alone time, etc. For me, I remember seeing my baby for the first time and I was emotional, but disappointed I didn't feel more. I had heard of people feeling total love and having this heart changing moment when they lay eyes on their kid. I just felt guilty because I just felt responsibility. I felt the need to help mom, help the baby, do whatever needed to be done. It didn't feel like it was as much love as duty. I loved my child, I just didn't feel all the feels. Fast forward a few months, my wife is giving my son a bath and I walk in to see him light-up when he recognized me. I start sobbing and it hits me. I love this little monster and he's my boy. The same experience happened for my second. In fact, many of my friends who have kids have felt the same way.

>>I think I know the feeling you're talking about, but I am always quick to remind myself that it's my duty to protect and nurture my wife because she feels shitty and needs certain things. I always call her on my way home from work, and normally it's a quick dinner planning discussion, but now I feel a little off the hook for the ""What are you in the mood for?"" back-and-forth that always happens because I just ask her what she's craving right now and we try to make that happen.

>>Anyway, I've had a pretty clear head about this since the beginning, and that's probably because it took us over a year and a half to even get pregnant. I had plenty of practice in comforting her because I needed to be there for her every month when we found out that we weren't pregnant, and because she's a fucking angel, she always made sure that I was taken care of too.

>>I remember like it was yesterday; about a week after a miscarriage we were watching The Switch (Jason Bateman, Jennifer Aniston) and there was this one part where you just see Bateman being a really good dad to his kid and I started bawling. My wife, who had just re-found her footing, let me cry and talked me through it. Up until that point, all of my focus was on her and making sure she was ok because I knew she just felt absolutely awful and there was no way I could empathize with her on her level since it was her body going through hell on top of her emotions, so I wasn't giving as much attention to how I felt about it until she was ok. She knows how badly I want to be a dad, and I know how badly she wants to be a mom, so there was nothing but love, comfort, and understanding.

>>Anyway, the point of me saying all of that is to say that I haven't had feelings of guilt per se, but I can see where somebody might feel guilty along the way. I hate guilt, so when I feel it coming on I do something to atone for it - in this case, just giving my wife anything and everything she needs that I can provide for her. I pet and kiss her belly all the time, so we're going through changes together, and she loves having her baby factory hard at work. Going through pregnancy with a partner that loves you is the ultimate demonstration of what love is: wanting to, but knowing you cannot, take the burdens from the one you love, so instead helping them carry theirs. And that's what I'm going to do.
"
I'm sick of my family telling me that i was stupid for making a decision,"Long story short one of my best friends got arrested for dealing. He was in jail for 2 months before i found out. The other day I became the last cosinger on his bond so he can get out and spend Xmas with his family.

My mom overheard me telling his wife i was approved and he will be out. All Ive heard is its a stupid decision. Well what you dont know, mom, is he was the beginning reason your son is coke free to begin with. When everyone,including you,turned their bqck on me when my addiction go bad, he didnt. He is the person person who called all my dealers and threatened to put a bullet in their head if they sold to me. Hes the one who kicked someones face in when they offered me coke. He offered me a place to stay when i was on the streets, not anyone else. He got me a job, he found a new apt for me to start my life again, clean and sober. He invited me into hks home on holidays when noone else would. So before you tell me again im stupid, go fuck yourself. Id cosign for him a thousand times over befire i ever thought of doing it for anyone else. To you hes a scumbag drug dealer who deserves to be in jail. To me he is the reason ive had the devil off my back for two years"
I HAVE A VAG.,"Throwaway because I'm not public about the subject.

I'm MtF transgendered, and spent most of my life battling against that part of my identity. I always wished I was a girl, and I finally was able to do something about it at 18, (I'm 21 now.) As soon as I came to uni, I began seeing a therapist and started taking hormones. Fortunately, I was rather naturally feminine anyway, so once I flipped to living socially as female, it was no big deal. Nowadays, no one has any clue about that part of my past. Everyone I meet just knows me as female, nothing more.

I never thought I'd be able to afford sexual reassignment surgery. I had enough trouble paying for hormones and blood tests as a college student. Then I remembered I had some stock money from years ago, so I went to check how much they were worth: BAM. $36,000. My parents aren't exactly supportive of my ""lifestyle choices,"" (they also assure me that bisexuality doesn't exist,) so this was a HUGE lifesaver. I scheduled the appointment initially for January, but they had a cancellation, so it got pushed up to yesterday.

I'm currently lying in a hospital bed in a good bit of pain and hooked up to a catheter, (which really blows, I should add,) but I HAVE A VAGINA. That's a sentence I never thought I would be able to say in my life, and I cannot express in words the amount of joy I feel for finally getting to put the whole 'transition' thing behind me. I can finally feel normal, and happy with my own body. Given, I can't even see it yet - the dressing can't come off until tomorrow - but still! It's there, and I was able to pay for it myself. I can finally legally change my sex, and not get initially called ""Mr."" in classes and appointments before playing it off as a typo. I can finally wear bikinis, and hopefully, I can finally have some fucking awesome sex where I don't feel depressed and upset over my genitals. 

Like I said, I'm not really public about the subject, so I haven't gotten to tell anyone outside of a couple people about how FUCKING ECSTATIC I am. So now you all know. C:"
Irma destroyed my house and I can't stop crying,"Fuck, I didn't think it would be this bad in north Florida. But I just got back to my house and it's destroyed. At least three trees fell onto the house, and a foot of water came inside regardless of how many sandbags we put up to prevent it. I still can't walk in the backyard without water almost going into my rain boots. I'm so fucking sad all I can do is sit on my bed and sob. Insurance can take care of a lot but it can't replace all of my artwork and all the other papers I held onto for sentimental value. I have the best friends in the world that came over to help me tear up the carpets as soon as they heard what happened, but I can't help but cry as I do it all. 

Edit: thank you all for your kind words and reading what I had to say. It really means so much to me. I've got a terrible headache from dehydration, so I'm done with the crying for now lol. What's done is done, and the only thing to do from here is try to put my life back into place. "
To Women's Clothing Designers: FUCK. YOU. ALL.,"WHY is it so hard to make women's clothing functional? According to you, we don't deserve pockets that are more than a half inch deep. Our pants don't deserve belt loops and if they do, they don't deserve more than three; I shouldn't have to make two passes to pull up my pants-one for the belt, and one for the pants. We don't have the right to shirts that aren't see through or full of revealing holes and we certainly don't deserve the right to be warm in our clothing. I shouldn't have to wear three fucking layers of shirts to not be naked or cold (and trust me, no, I don't buy them, even if they're cute). Ladies who wear higher than a DD cup don't deserve to buy comfortable bras in a regular store...off to Torrid or Lane Bryant to pay double! At least they have styles beyond plain white, black and nude, because while men seem to covet the giant boobs, you obviously think they don't want to see them because you don't make cute bras for us. And heaven forbid if we're shorter or taller than 5'5, it's all over for us, especially if we have boobs and hips. WE ARE NOT FUCKING MANNEQUINS YOU FUCKING FUCKS!!!!!!!!!! I shouldn't have to shop in the men's section for functional clothing! I don't just stand around all day; I sit, I bend, I reach, I walk and run on a daily basis and I am constantly fighting with my fucking clothes. Bending over should not require a full wardrobe adjustment when I stand back up! Holy shit, if I could go to work in jeans and a t-shirt, I would but I can't. Just... GGAAAAHHHHH!! FUCK YOU!!!!

All right, I actually feel a little bit better now. Thanks offmychest."
You are the coolest dad,"I’m 24 and my dad is 82. He is my favourite person in the world and is unlike any other ‘old’ person I know. 

Last night we smoked a joint and stayed up until 4:30 am just watching funny fail compilations and laughing our asses off. 

I know he’ll be gone soon, we talk about it regularly. He won’t walk me down the aisle or meet my kids. But It’s ok, because the memories I have with him will stay with me forever.

Fuck you for calling me osama you mother fucker,"You had to yell it out as you left the restaurant right you motherfucker. Im a sikh, I have a turban and beard but im fucking done with people not knowing the difference between sikh and muslims. How fucking daft can you be to not know who fuckign sikhs are in 2016. We fought in both fucking world wars, the defense minister of canada is sikh and if you do a little bit of research we were the ones who were kicking islamic extremist ass before anyone. I know im supposed to be politically correct and say that it shouldn't happen to anyone but fuck it. Im sick of dumb fucks confusing us. Most of all im sick of these terrorist fucks who had to fuck up our image and reputation just because we wear our articles of faith on our head. Do you realize you daft kunt, that if someone were to threaten your life right there and try to kill you, Id be obligated to save you. Id give up my life to save you, any true sikh would. But I have to get called osama. Not only that, it was a night out with my family, we were all enjoying a meal together after a long fucking time. Fuck you man. Fuck you. "
My kitten died while I slept last night.,"Her name was Mary Jane, or MJ. She was tiny and loved cuddles and playing and taking naps on my lap. I had her for three weeks but this pain is unbearable. I woke up at 6am to find her sleeping between my legs per usual and not moving. God it’s the worst pain. And i hate telling people. Because they don’t get it, they didn’t love this pet as much as you did. It’s awkward sorry’s and avoiding eye contact. I wish i could bring her back. "
Today my rapist was finally convicted for his crime.,"I'm not really sure where to put this on reddit. I'm so elated from the news, and I really just want to share it with anyone and everyone. I was raped November of 2013. It has been a long year of anxiety, stress, and marital hardship. The trial was from Monday-Thursday of this week, and it was the single most frightening and cathartic thing I've gone through. 

This morning we received the verdict: guilty of all charges. For the first time in a long time I cried out of joy. I am so happy that all of the pain and suffering I went through has been worth it. Justice was served today, and it feels wonderful to have this burden lifted.

I haven't told my family yet. My husband and a handful of friends are the only ones who know about this, because I have been living abroad since before it happened. I want to tell my grandmother and mother so badly, but I don't want them to worry about me. So, here I am telling all of you who were kind enough to read this. Thank you."

"To the fellow mother in Walgreens, thank you.","I told my husband several times to order diapers on amazon. He didn’t, and we only had a couple. So I was in Walgreens getting supplements for anxiety and really just haven’t been feeling great. I got to chatting with a woman, also with a two year old. And joked that maybe I should get serious about potty training in the next 24 hours until the diapers come! So I wouldn’t have to spend 15 extra dollars. She went out to her car and came back with 6 diapers, and said just pay it forward. 

Made. My. Day. 

I wish I would have asked for her name. "
"I'm so sick of people saying she's a ""Christmas present""","My daughter was due in February, but because of some complications with my wife's health, they had to do a c-section this week and deliver her into the world two months early.  And I swear to sweet baby Jesus, the next person who tells me that she's a Christmas present I am going to shove their head up their butt just so they can more easily see me kicking their ass.  ""Hey ZodiacMan423, so your daughter has to be taken out of the womb before she's fully developed, placed in an incubator and receive constant 24/7 medical care at the hospital for at least two months just to survive and assuming that goes well she'll be at a higher risk of developmental problems growing up.  Ho, Ho, Ho, MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS!""  Fucking assholes....."
In one year I will have lived as long without my mom as I did with her.,"She died two weeks before my 16th birthday. It's almost like your life is divided into two parts, before and after. I've never really recovered but it gets easier.

She was an amazing person and I am sad that I can't introduce her to my friends or my partner. There were many a time when old friends came over and talked more with my mom than with me or my sister. She always went out of her way to make people feel welcome. I think that's a trait many sad people have, they know how hard it is do they go out of their way to make people feel heard.

When I was still a kid she took care of my severely depressed father, and of me when I had a (benign) brain tumor. After that she got sick and within a year we lost her. Those last 6 years before her death were a turbulent mess and she got us through it. 

I feel so bad for the times I was being an annoying teen to her, instead of treasuring those last moments. I wish I could have made her feel how grateful I am for the sacrifices she made for our family and the life lessons she gave me which I still carry with me today.

Grieving is never over, but what I appreciate the most about the process is when people give me the space to do so. When my partner let's me bawl my eyes out when a moment occurs where I really needed her, when my friends ask things about my mom or let me share my stories about her. 

I hate it when people think it's a no-go topic. Absolutely not, loved ones who passed away can only be remembered if we keep on talking and sharing, even if it hurts. When it hurts, you are reminded of the love for those people. "
She changed my life,"I've been fighting demons my whole life.

I'm a 44 year old widower. A single dad. 

I suffer from ADHD and have spent my life worrying.

My family are assholes and offer no support.

Then she came into my life.

She asked me out for coffee. 

I'm an introvert. A loner. I live behind walls.

She's an extrovert. A carer. She's beautiful. She's sexy. She's perfect. And she fucking loves me. I don't know what I've done to deserve this.

We talk. Constantly. She's brought me out of my shell. She makes me feel worthy. She's brought out the real me. All of a sudden I'm open, sharing, romantic, and enjoying life for the first time ever.

I'm going to marry her. I'm going to give her children. I'm going to give her everything; because she's given me a new life.

There's hope. There's hope for all of you. 

I'm one lucky fucker. "
"My ex died several months ago, and I am just now laying in bed beside my husband sobbing quietly and dealing with this.","His name was Richard. He was my old leadership camp counselor (yeah, I know...) between my junior year of high school and freshman year of college, and he was ten years my senior. Most of the girls flirted with him to some degree but for whatever reason, he took interest in me. We hung out several times right around the time I turned 18, and when I was 19/almost 20 he helped me through a messy breakup but never once put the moves on me. 

He could have, to be fair, and i would have gone for it. But no, he was a true friend while I left my abusive ex. He was silly and flirtatious and mature about our weird friendship, he kept his distance and never pressed for anything, he made me feel good about myself without being creepy. He always sent smiley faces. 

I flirted with him relentlessly for a few weeks, months, idk, which finally culminated in us messing around at his house. We didn’t have sex, but we were very intimate/affectionate and it was so nice to feel like someone was crazy about me. He had this stupid Snuggie, and that was the whole premise - I was missing out! I had to know how good a Snuggie could be. I told him I’d have to come see. And it was so funny, the whole thing, irreverent and weird as it could be, each of us with one arm in a Snuggie, giggling like mad, and then who knows. It was nice. I had a Snuggie, actually. I just didn’t tell him that until much later. 

His friend, who directed the leadership program, definitely knew something was going on. Eventually Richard and I met him and his girlfriend for beer pong, we had a great night. I remember it so clearly. So much of those years is a blur but I have a crystal clear memory of that night. 

Eventually we started to drift apart, but he was always there to fall back on. For a flirty coffee date or a makeout sesh or just being dumb and playing mini golf. God I remember playing mini golf. Eventually I met the man that is now my husband. I separated myself from Richard so as not to be tempted. Unfriended him on Facebook. And I am glad I did. I’m very happily married. But my confidence came back in the form of Richard’s easy smile, his compliments, his comfort, so in a way I have him to thank for this, a little bit. 

My sister, who went through leadership with me, mentioned him offhand a few months ago, sadness evident. I asked her what she meant and she almost started crying at dinner. She told me he’d had some kind of problems with his liver, his liver failed. He died. He died. Richard is dead. 

I can still hear his voice in my head. I can still picture that face, his voice, his stupid groaning laughter when I teased him for being older than me, my old counselor. His brow lifted, side eyeing me at that stupid mini golf place the night my flirtations became obvious. Man, he was cute. 

I never got to say goodbye. I separated myself so I wouldn’t be tempted to fall back to him, because I knew I was serious about my husband long before we ever talked about marriage. I told myself that Richard was a fond memory, someone I could catch up with in a few years when we’d both moved on in our lives, genuinely happy for each other. I pictured it in my head. I was excited for it. He was such a good person. A bit of a weirdo, but an excellent friend. I waited until the day we could say “best friend! long time no talk. How are things?!” And we could go on and reminisce in a distant sort of way and smile. 

Instead, he spent months withering away, with the support of friends, while I remained blissfully unaware and missed my chance to say... thank you. And goodbye. 

Thank you, “best friend”. I hope you’re in whatever afterlife watching wrestling and football and I hope there are awesome boobs for you to check out, like all the time, and great movies to watch and the softest snuggies you could ever imagine. Thank you for everything. I miss you. And goodbye. "
My cat has the world’s most expensive dick,"My cat keeps coming down with urinary tract infections and blockages. It’s been every couple of weeks for three months. It’s cost me $3500 so far, with a $2500 operation coming up. $6000. Six thousand fucking dollars on my cat’s junk.

My family and friends keep urging me to put him down. “It’s not fair on you or him.” Bullshit. It’s a urinary tract problem, not a fucking brain tumour. His quality of life isn’t permanently negatively affected. If I euthanise him, it’s purely for financial reasons, and I can’t do that. He’s my little man. It’s been him and me vs. the world for eight years. I can’t give him the green dream just because his dick’s nasty.

Cherry on top? I actually near-miraculously decided to get pet insurance 27 days before I needed to rush him to the vet for his first UTI. Why do I know it was 27 days exactly?

*Because my pet insurance has a thirty day waiting period.*

All of his UTIs and blockages are now considered pre-existing conditions.

The next pet I own is going to have a fucking cloaca."
"""Gangbang anyone?""","Last night when I was walking my dog, a group of 5-6 guys were walking towards me. I had my earbuds in but I turned my music off. 


As I walked by I heard one of them say ""hey gangbang anyone?"" And he just laughed it off. Like nothing. I gripped my dogs leash and just took off running. No one really knows how scared I am, because I always try to be strong, but hearing that makes me never want to step outside again.


I just needed to get that off my chest. I was scared and I needed someone to know. 


**EDIT: Some people messaged me asking me why my dog didn't protect me, he's a 5 month old german shepard puppy who loves people, he wouldn't even harm a ladybug.**

**Edit 2: apparently me being scared is being sexist. Thanks reddit**"
There are some really awful people here...,"I was bored so I hit ""random"" up at the top. Figured I'd find some subs I'd never seen before. I didn't realize just how toxic some of these subs can be. There's a group for people who actively hate dogs. I mean, what the fuck is that all about? There are groups for every level of misogyny and hatred. And I just don't get it. I mean, sure, I stick to the subs I'm already a part of, but I figured it couldn't hurt to find some more interests. Was I ever wrong. I like being on reddit, but man, some people here are just the absolute worst people I've ever encountered. And it makes me sad. Just wanted to say that. "

Three years ago me and my then girlfriend of 5 years made a deal to meet up today if anything were to separate us,"A year ago she OD and died. In my mind it was not accidental and i fully blame the guy she was living with at the time. Police has done nothing about it and the guy is still roaming free, dealing drugs to kids. 

&#x200B;

Anyway, i had completely forgotten about our deal to meet until i got a calendar notification just now. That completely broke me. I thought i had started to move on, but now that process starts all over again.

My wife has been sick all weekend and I'm exhausted doing all that she does,"My wife has been in bed sick since Friday. Sunday is our house cleaning day. We usually split it although I admit she does most of it. 

She hasn't been feeling well all week and had let some stuff go. So I set to work doing it. 

I cleaned out the fridge, there was a ton of expired food. 

Did 3 loads of dishes that had piled in the sink. 

8 bags of trash went out. 

Vacuuming

Started laundry still at it today

Grocery shopping (I usually do this but she makes the list.)

Cooking meals (I usually do this anyway) 

Got up and took her to the doctor today. 

Went to work 

Picked up my 12yo step son from school just now and he is sick too. I'd been hoping he could help me or at least keep me company. 

Dinner is in the oven another load of dishes going 

Still have laundry to finish and I feel like crying. 

I don't know how she does so much and with a smile on her face too.

He asked me to marry him...,"On Tuesday night, my boyfriend of three years asked me to marry him. This happened so suddenly. We met on OkCupid, became friends, dated for a few months, decided we weren't good for each other, then became even better friends, stayed as ""friends with benefits,"" and then I moved in with him. Three years later and he asked me to marry him while we're at a skeezy bar in New Orleans.  

I have never been so happy. Maybe we didn't take a traditional route, but I'm gettin' gay married, y'all! "
A cop just gave me a ride home,"I woke up with food poisoning, slept through my alarms and was late for work- making me miss an important meeting which made my boss extremely pissed at me, had to deal with rude, SHITTY people at work, and just to put the cherry on the gigantic shit-cake of a day I've had- my car broke down on my way home. 

I pulled over on the side of the highway, completely freaking out. My car was overheating, and as a person who knows jack shit about cars, I was worried about my car exploding. As I'm trying to not have a total melt down, I see red and blue lights in my rear view mirror and just tried to hold it together. I have pretty bad anxiety, and for some reason cops just make me freak out even if I'm not doing anything wrong. The cop came up to my window, said hi and asked if I was having car troubles and offered to look at my engine. I popped my hood and he said my radiator was fucked. Wonderful. He offered to give me a ride home, and I got all my shit and got him his cruiser. 

To the officer that gave me a ride: thank you. Thank you for being so nice and open with me and talking to me like I was a person on the way to my home. Thank you for giving me a ride and making me feel comfortable. You could tell I was upset and on the verge of tears the whole time and you made an effort to make me smile. 

When I got out of the car, he said goodbye to me like he would've to a close friend, and it made me feel a little better about my terrible day. And even though I'm still getting over the bad Mexican food I had last night, it makes me feel a little better that a person genuinely cared about my wellbeing. 

Tl;dr: not all cops are bad, and don't eat at sketchy taquerias. "
Is it bad that I can't wait for baby-boomers to die off so that we might finally start making some progress in the world?,I know it's not going to fix everything and that there'll always be backwards-thinking people who hold us back.

Being raped on a weekly basis. I'm tired.,"I don't know how to start this or what to even say. 
I'm a 17 year old guy and I've been getting sexually abused by my coach. He's been blackmailing and he's high status where I live. I'm also in the national football team. I don't know what to do anymore I just can't go on like this. I feel filthy and disgusting and pathetic. 
It all started when he asked me to clean up with him after practice, so I did. He told me to go shower and then he grabbed me from behind and that's when it happened the first time. If I tell anyone he'd make sure I never play soccer again, and he'd tell my parents I'm gay. He also has pictures of me being touched by him. He is also very high status where I live and whatever I say wouldn't even matter because I'll be the one ""lying"". I don't live in America but the way. I don't know why I'm posting this. I guess I just really need a friend. I'm tired of keeping it in. It's just so hard to handle lately, I haven't been playing well because I can barely walking and I'm always limping. I feel like a piece of shit. Every time I remember the slightest thing about it start gagging and there's no way out of it. I just need someone to tell me it'll be alright. Because I don't think it ever will. 
UPDATE: guys thank you for all the support. It's jus that I've had a rough few days. I'll read everything soon I promise. "
"Just another pet I killed, just another day.","I am a vet. This means that I get to diagnose problems in animals. This means when a dog walks in the door with owners that think she's 'just not up to her usual self' and I put my hands on the dog and know its lymphoma (cancer) that I have to hide my instant heart dropping reaction. The last time I saw these clients I euthanized their horse. Their son died this year. I have to go through the motions of trying to prove it isn't cancer. I have to try to explain to them it may be more serious than they think. Then two hours later I have to tell them that unless they have tens of thousands of dollars to spend there is nothing I can do for them. I have to deal with their tears and comfort them and tell them that it is totally reasonable to euthanize. 

Then I have to take a 6 year old dog, who is panting and grinning at me and excited to be held by me and kill it. I have to do it in a rush because I have two other clients and their pets waiting for me. I don't get to grieve, I don't get to apologize to the animal I just killed. I get to dump her in a plastic bag, wash my hands, blink away the tears, smile, and walk into the next exam room like nothing ever happened.

My terrific 'half day' ends 3 hours later than it should've with me missing a diagnosis of a highly infectious virus. The patient didn't present classically and by the time I diagnosed it I had contaminated literally half of the clinic (the dog was still doing ok). Maybe the dog will live, or
Maybe I will spend 500-1000 dollars of a young man's money without even giving him back an alive animal. 

More than anything I want to call the man I love and tell him, but we stopped talking 2.5 days ago. He is trying to decide whether or not he loves someone else. So instead I came home, stripped out of my infected clothes, got in the shower, and cried. Today: I hate my job."
My sister keeps popping out kids and giving them stupid names,"My sister has a husband who shares my opinions about her insanity, but he lets her walk all over him to avoid conflict. She's pregnant with her 5th kid. She's an American white woman btw.

Let me introduce my nephews and niece:
1. Cage, a boy.
2. Gunner, a boy.
3. Yuri, a girl.
4. Deki, a boy.

She gets high on estrogen and looks through the dictionary for adorable words to call her babies, not considering that they'll have to put that on a job application someday. I wonder how many times 'Gunner' will be a false security threat when he goes to school and flies. She knows what 'Yuri' means in Japanese and did that anyway.

She knows my opinions, and she says I'm overreacting. She says it's okay because she gives them ""normal"" middle names that she chooses from the list of 100 most abnormal baby names."
"Becoming an adult on your own, without any guidance from a parent/guardian/aunt/uncle/mentor of some sort is an extremely difficult, lonely, and unforgiving thing.","I listened to a girl in the break room at work today complain about a problem she was having with something I'd gone through and dealt with before.

I was going to speak up and offer her advice. And then she said, ""I guess I'll just call my mom and dad; they'll definitely know.""

And I just sat there and wondered what it would be like to have a resource like that.

The thing about the experience of becoming an adult in your own is that people don't like to help or advise adults. They expect grown ups to take care of themselves. I get it. That's why parents are so important. You have people that care about you and can see that you still need help. 

No one cares when I need help. No one calls me to see how I'm doing. Literally if I died right now the only person who'd care is the poor guy who gets stuck cleaning up my body.

It must feel so reassuring to know you have someone in your corner. It must be nice to only work one part time job in college. It must be nice to have a car. 

I'm just very tired and frustrated.

**Edit: wow, I really never expected anyone to read this or care very much. It's nice to know there are other people out there who are going through, and have gone through, a similar situation to my own. I want you to know I read every single comment and I'm about to read the messages you've sent. You're all very kind and sweet people and I really appreciate the commiseration that I've received in this thread.**"
To the cop that pulled my husband over yesterday,"We really respect police officers, because we know what a dangerous job you have. Not knowing who you are going to meet on a daily basis, and how intense things can be suddenly, must be really stressful. We appreciate how cops protect us and help us out when needed.

But cops like you are the reason that some people are losing respect. 

My husband was heading home from a visit to an office in Michigan when you pulled him over. He wasn't speeding, driving erratically, or doing anything suspicious. In fact, the reason that you pulled him over was because the license plate frame was slightly covering his license plate. Or so you say. (I checked it out today. It looks fine. Clearly visible, but whatever). When you came to the passenger window, you greeted my husband and I'm sure you heard his Puerto Rican accent immediately. You asked him where he was from and he told you Chicago and provided his license and registration. You then began to ask him why he was in Michigan, as if it were a crime, and then even quizzed him on the location of the office he was visiting. Playing a gsme of 20 questions for no reason. He had to show you his office ID badge for you to believe him. Then you walked away, checked his license and information, and then drove off without another word. 

What the fuck was that all about? Why did you have to treat him differently because he has an accent? You wouldn't have asked the same of me, a white girl from the suburbs. I don't mean to get political, but the racism in this country is being inflated and it is sickening. 

Now my husband is starting to feel unsafe and worries about our children. We speak Spanish with them so that they can learn his culture, but we are all fluent in English. We are Americans. We both served in the military and are honest, tax paying citizens. 

Way to fuck things up, asshole. Cops like you give the good guys a bad name."
My friend bought me soup,"I'm stuck home after getting 3 of my wisdom teeth removed yesterday and woke up today feeling incredibly crappy. Had chills even though it was 70+ in my apartment, and everything hurt. While waiting for the advil to kick in, a friend in Beijing messaged me to make sure I was okay and I told him I was feeling a little under the weather. I knocked out on the couch after the short exchange and woke up to a delivery guy knocking on my door with two cups of broth in hand. 

Apparently, my friend ordered soup for me all the way from the across the country! Really warmed my heart and I just wanted to share. "
You're a terrible parent and an even worse friend.,"I hate you. I hate you. I hate you.

hen I was 16 I accidently got pregnant, but even then I decided I wasn't going to let the baby stop me in my plans.

You were my best friend who also got pregnant at 16, and you just wanted a baby more than anything.

You were alway jealous that I was having twins, I was always scared.

Once my kids were old enough to be left in a play group, I got a job.
You got pregnant again. 

You laugh constantly at my job, yes McDonalds isn't great, nor is it my carrer. It does however help pay for things I need.

So you can call me ''the McFuckUp'' all you want.

I go to nightschool and you got jealous, said I was ditching for the ''bitches'' at the evening classes.

I am going there so I can get a better job and give my kids a future.

Now here you are, calling me out on facebook because I won't pay for your daughter to go to ballet lessons with mine.

You call my son spoiled because for christmas I bought him a 3ds and alls you got yours was a few cheap toys.

I work hard to provide for my family and put money away for when they are older.

You said I'm evil for not paying for your kid to go to ballet?

Well I think you're evil for getting a tattoo isn't of paying for her to go.


You ''called me out'' for not giving you a discount on McNugget. 
CHILDREN SHOULDN'T LIVE OFF MCNUGGETS.

You might think I'm a ''hippie'' for trying to give my kids fruit and veg, but it's a hell of a lot better than Chicken nuggets and burgers all the time.

You call me a shit parent because I work and go to night-class?
I work while my kids are in school, I go to school when my kids are sleeping. You're not a ''better mother'' because you sit at home all day watching tv.

I've had enough of your shit.

Your kids don't even own shoes, you let them run wild, you feed them crap and you still think you're better because you stay at home watching tv all day.

Stop fucking crying about how much of a bitch I am for not spending my hard earned money on you.

I shouldn't HAVE to pay for your kids to do ballet and football and you shouldn't ''have'' to feed them nuggets none stop because you're so ''busy''"
I loved turning you down,"I was fat, had a crater face and a crappy hair cut. You bullied me all through high school, made fun of me with your cheerleader friends, got your jock boyfriend and his buddies to make fun of me loudly in the cafeteria.



We were friends at one point, good friends even, then you got popular and suddenly we just weren't. You went out of your way to put me down as if to murder the memory of the friendship we had when we were younger.




So I came home 8 years after leaving. Had a decent hair cut, in really great shape and my face didn't look like a meteor had smashed into it. I wasn't some breathtaking sculpture of a human being but I did look pretty good compared to how I used to look. 




8 years later you were still at home, your glory days in high school and college ended and you living on through those. It was sad seeing you at a checkout register at the local Walmart, my girlfriend was with me, it's funny she was like me, awkward looking, odd, then managed to pull of looking decent one day. We'd both never be celebrities but to each other we're the most beautiful people. I didn't so much as pay you a second glance when you tried striking up a conversation. 


''Dan how's it been, it's been forever, omg you look so great, we should catch up''

''How much do the eggs and wine cost?''



I remember the shocked broken look on your face. I couldn't help the savage pleasure I felt back then. Funny, because there was a time in my life I would have waited on you hand and foot.




I'm getting married soon. The days of high school are gone, I have a good life that I've built for myself with a wonderful amazing woman to share it with."
Saying I'm smart/pretty/hot 'for a black girl' is in NO way a compliment.,"It's insulting. Do people *actually* believe this is a compliment? If it is, it's a backhanded one. Just had to get that off my chest."
I was molested repeatedly as a child. I have cptsd and depression. I've tried to kill myself twice. None of that is on the same scale of awful as what just happened.,"I feel like the universe just fucking hates me right now. My little brother, the light in my life, the person who means more to me than any other person drowned two weeks ago. He's in a vegetative state right now that we're so desperately hoping he can recover from. I love him more than any other human being. He's like a child to me. He's only five.

I'm experiencing pain on a level I didn't know was possible. I'd rather live through everything else I've had to go through a thousand times over than have to experience another second of this.

Please get better Rocket. Please."
I came out to my mom the other night.,"It started by her telling me a story about her friend making comments about how my best friend and I would be perfect for each other, and that it was 'too bad he was gay.'

Ignoring that this is something that gets said way to often, I offhandedly joked about how ""what if I was gay? Then it would be twice as bad.""

She just laughed and we continued talking about other things while she did her laundry. After some time she just brazenly asked, 'well, are you?'

So I told her yes. She made an understanding face and said, ""I thought so. Thanks for telling me.""

That was about it. We talked a little bit more about how she did not care and wasn't surprised. She had thought so for a while but did not want to make me uncomfortable by asking at the wrong time. I expressed some concerns about some of our extended family members and she comforted me about them. Then we watched Master Chef.

It was the most uneventful thing. And it was great.

I love my mommy.

Edit: Thank you for the support everyone! Just thought I would mention that I'm female, so no, there really isn't anything going on between me and my best friend haha"
I'm worth more than 5%,"I had my yearly review at work this week. My boss is notorious for being loud, lying, racist, etc. Pick your poison. I always try and be optimistic, pleasant, and treat everyone nicely. I don't pull myself into office drama, raise my voice, or curse at others. 5 people have quit my department in the past year. I'm one of 2 people left in the position. I never negotiated for a higher salary or asked for any special treatment. I keep my head down and work. I didn't think a 5-6% raise was out of the question. Apparently it was. His exact words were ""You're not worth 5%"", as he snapped at me as he stared me directly in the eyes, challenging me to fruitlessly prove him otherwise. He said I'll be lucky to get 3% as allegedly raises ""this year"" are only 1-3%. That's barely a cost of living increase, especially in my region. I can't fathom how a supervisor who's lost 5 employees in one year can be so callous to one who's been diligently working. I guess it's the whole ""it can't happen to me"" scenario. I've never had a boss that was so cold and selfish. But I thought I could avoid his nastiness if I worked hard. Needless to say, I'm applying to other jobs and will be ramping up my search. All I keep dreaming of is when I hand in my 2 weeks, to be able to say ""Thanks for the opportunity, but I found someone who thinks I'm worth more than 5%"""
My autistic brother couldn't have been happier to be invited to his first birthday party and sleepover and you destroyed him,"this was a long time ago but I saw another post that reminded me and I had to get it off my chest. My brother has autism he was probably about 10 and had been invited to a birthday party for the first time he was beyond excited not only was it his first party but it was a sleepover. He had never been invited to a sleepover before. He was so excited he had no friends at school and was only bullied he had a hard time but on this night he was going to a party. He proudly picked out a birthday present for the first time and couldn't wait for him to open it. He went to the party. My mom gets a call a few hours later from the mom of the boy who was having the party. My brother wasn't playing with the other kids he was just playing video games could we please come pick him up. My heart tore in two he just wanted to go to his first party and sleepover he was probably more excited than any kid that went and he has autism of course he wouldn't be socializing. We went to pick him up and my mom said he was on the couch quietly playing video games and that she'd never seen him happier. When she told him he had to leave he didn't understand why, he cried all night, he had been so excited. How do you invite an autistic kid over then basically want him to pretend like he doesn't have autism when he gets there. Fuck you for taking that from my brother. He never got invited to another sleepover. Fuck you for hurting my brother all he wanted to do was be someone's friend and have fun."
I could cry right now. I might cry.,"In highschool I met a kid named Randy.  Randy was absolutely hilarious.  Randy was smart.  Randy knew what he could get away with and would take advantage of it because Randy had muscle dystrophy.  He would show us how people treated him differently just because he was in a wheelchair.  He thought it was absolutely ridiculous and offensive because he was treat as if he had a mental disability, just because his muscles were fading.  He would say, ""watch,"" and turn his wheel chair sideways in the main hallway and look at us as people walked by, bumping into him and apologizing to him, and he would just shake his head at them, to us.  He would be funny when we had to be quiet, because he knew the teachers wouldn't get mad at him.  He didn't do it entirely for laughs, about half of it was just to show how absolutely ridiculous it is that he gets treated so differently just because of a physical disability.

Randy was one of my best friends throughout highschool.  We'd sneak him outside and go out to the football field to hang out (he wasn't allowed leaving the school), we'd save him a seat at our table for every class we had with him, we've gotten accused of using him just for elevator privalges (which was retarded, it's one floor and the elevator took forever), I even almost got suspended for surfing a cafeteria tray behind his wheelchair down the halls...

Randy's grandparents thanked us for being his friends.  That's fucked.  We weren't being nice.  We'd make fun of him the same as he'd make fun of us.  We wanted to spend that time with him.  He was a fucking great friend. 

But they thanked us.  They didn't expect Randy to live through grade 9.

They didn't expect Randy to live to see grade 12.

They didn't expect Randy to graduate.

They said to us, that he did those things, because he had us as friends.  We gave him something to live for.  

Then we lost touch with him.....

We had no way of finding him.

We didn't know if he was alive or dead.

We accepted that we would never see our friend again.   

He was gone.

It's been 7 years.  7.  

My sister seen Randy today.  

Apparently his cousin lives in her building and he's there visiting with his grandparents.   He's fucking alive!!  I could cry.  Holy jesus fuck.  

He's alive.

I have his email address now.  Of course its ""thecripple"".  That's exactly the man I remember.  

My sister sent me a picture of him.

Randy is still hilarious.  Randy is still smiling.  Randy is still happy.   

Randy is still alive.


...And I finally get to talk to my friend again.  I have his email.  Through skype or whatever.  We'll talk.  I can't describe this feeling.  I don't think I've ever felt it before.  I believed completely that he was gone.  You hope not, but hope is a fools game.   My lost friend is now found.  

He's still alive.  

He looks good.  


*UPDATE*
He's emailed me back.  He says he's doing alright, just a hell of a lot weaker than before, which is a hard thing to think about because he wasn't all that strong when I last seen him.   If he leaned too far in his chair, he wouldn't be able to sit back up without help.  The conversation we're having is really bittersweet.  I'm really stoked to be able to hear from him again, but when you care about someone, you want to fix their problems, and nobody can fix this one.  

I asked him what he's been up to and he said, ""just living off disability and family and wasting time on the computer doing nothing productive, so basically nothings changed.""   I can't blame him for not sounding cheerful, it would definitely be hard to keep a smile on when your life is restricted so much.  I wish him nothing but peace.

He's living in a town about a 10 hour drive from us living with his grandparents, which means we can plan a weekend trip to go see him.  We just have to make sure we have the money put aside and stuff.

I appreciate everyone's kind words.  I really didn't expect so many comments.  I spent almost every day for 4 years with this guy and it is such a wild feeling to find out he's still alive and that we can make plans to see him again.  Maybe we can can convince his grandparents to let us take him to the strippers :p   Honestly I don't even know if they'd let us take him from the house without them at all.  If he's saying he's a hell of a lot weaker than before, I imagine he is much more limited than before.

Thanks again everyone.  Much love.  

If you have any questions or whatever, feel free to ask.  I'm a pretty frequent redditor, so I will get back to you when I can.  

Hope everyone is having a great day.  

Keep your friends and family fucking close man.

Me and my pizza delivery guy got in a street fight,"So I have a crazy adrenaline rush so I need to vent somewhere. Anywho, I ordered dominos pizza at 2:30AM this morning and got the pizza at 3:00. As I go outside I see a load of kids (my age) trying to get in my pizza dudes car. Feeling bad for the guy I say ""that's not a taxi you fucks"" and it evidently triggers a member of the group. He comes up to me and stares at me while I tell him to fuck off and then slaps the pizza out of my hand. Well I'm not usually the angry type but the fact a kid my age was gonna pull that on me pissed me off a lot so I ran after him and threw some punches at him. He landed one on me but I ended up grabbing him and hitting him in the face a few times before he backed into an intersection and almost got hit by a car. 

So now that this dude was scared enough I turn around and see my pizza driver out of the car grabbing one of the kids by the collar. He was saying, and I quote ""Give me the money for this kids pizza or I'm gonna break this kids fucking jaw"". So I stand there watching this poor kid being almost choked to death while his cousins talk to me telling me to convince the driver to let go. Well to be honest I wasn't having it so I let the kid take it for a little until they mentioned he was 17. So after being handed $10 I notice the kid who was trying to fight me being talked to by a local man (I got to school in a pretty ghetto part of Philadelphia) who said, and I quote once more ""you think it's funny to pull this shit, you know I oughta blow your head off right now"".

 Now this kids freaking the hell out, back against a car on the street being threatened by a man who probably has a gun on him. So I reach in for a fist bump from that guy and he walks away while me and my pizza guy tell those kids to fuck off. So eventually they left and my pizza man apologizes for the inconvienience and goes to get me a second pizza. He comes back and I just give him the $10 as a tip and we part ways. Well now I'm sitting in bed feeling alive like never before and typing this out. I hope you enjoyed I guess."
To the nervous guy who asked me out at the grocery store.,"I just wanted to tell you that even though I told you no because I have a boyfriend, you made my day. And I hope you didn't let it get you down. 

I was having a bad day (well, month) and I've been feeling pretty useless lately- and certainly not pretty. But you worked up the effort to come up to me, a complete stranger, and tell me that you saw me walking around and you thought I was pretty, and you asked me out. I could tell you were nervous, and you disappeared before I could say much other than ""I have a boyfriend"". But your approach was so sweet, and I really hope you don't lose courage doing that kind of thing.  And  I really hope you find someone. "
My wife has to live out her nightmare,"I remember I found out a couple days into our relationship that she had an extreme phobia of eyes. 
Jokingly bringing your finger close to your eye, her eye, something resembling an eye, all of it resulted in tears and I quickly realized it wasn't something to joke about. 

Three years forward
We took a trip to the eye clinic and have found out she has cataracts.. cataracts at 24, and she has to get the surgery or else she'll slowly but surely go blind..

For those who don't know the surgery, I'm pretty sure it involves having your head **strapped down**, your eyes **clamped open** and remaining awake. 

Granted this procedure takes 10 to 15 minutes but she has described this situation in the past as being her ultimate nightmare. 

And now she has to go through with it.. 

I've never felt so helpless as a husband and I cannot imagine what she's going through right now.


Edit: Wow so much support thank you all so much. She just found the post while browsing and is gonna look at all the nice things you guys said. Much love to you all.
"
Cheating wife and I have to pretend,"My wife and I are divorcing. I found out she was cheating on me and sending topless pics to this hipster guy in the local music scene. She's stayed over his house twice now claiming to be at a friend's. I found this all out cuz she doesn't know that her iMessages also show up on our shared iPad. She's even invited him over when I'm not here.

We have kids. I've filed for divorce, but my lawyer has insisted that I don't say what I know. Just take screenshots and keep a log. That I should file for the neutral sounding irreconcilable differences, instead of adultery or her alcoholism and late night excursions. Because her drunken behavior hasn't brought our kids into direct harm, most likely we will get joint custody. (I'm an active father in my kids' lives, and most of the judges now prefer joint in this state.) And that we will hammer home the adultery and drunken nights out if she doesn't settle and we have to go to trial.

But because neither of us can afford to move out, I have to live with her and pretend I know nothing. Every second, I want to rage and scream, but I just avoid her. I want to contact the new boyfriend's girlfriend (they just had a child together). I want to scream. I want to o punch something.

But I can't. Because I have to find a peaceful solution for the sake of my kids. So I bottle it inside and it's killing me."
I got rejected by my date,"I went on a date 4 days ago, my first date since the breakup with my ex-girlfriend. My date was a super sweet girl. Cute, funny, interesting and fun to talk to. We had a good time, at least thats how I experienced it. I texted her a few hours ago and asked her if she was free this weekend, if she wanted to come over and cook some dinner perhaps. 

I got a text an hour ago saying basically: ""I think you're great, but I just dont see us being together"". I texted her back and told her I wished her good luck and all the best etc.

I may have been rejected by a really cute girl. But you guys, you know what? I'm so fucking ecstatic right now. I'm proud of myself that I reached out of my shell, held out through all the anxiety I felt before going on that date. Even though it didnt go as I hoped for, I learned a lot about myself, and that I'm capable of much more than I thought. I'm more confident and aware of myself now, and I'm grateful that I got to have this experience. Just wanted to tell some people that dont know me in real life. Cheers!"
