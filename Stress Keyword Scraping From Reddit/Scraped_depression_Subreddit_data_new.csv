just genuinely feeling bad,"physically and emotionally, i feel super bad. it b u r n s- and i really wish i could do something about it but i can’t do anything in here
i have nothing to break or take apart
nothing to use

what is there to do"
I'm making a cheesy scrapbook,"I like crafts so I'm gonna make a sort of 'things to stay around for' scrapbook. I'm gonna make a page for each of my parrots and my dog. My dream house (isolated place with a conservatory for my birds to enjoy). Clothes I wanna fit into when I lose weight. What I want my art to look like. Places I wanna visit.

Even though I know that on my bad days I don't care about those things at all because the pain is too much."
loneliness,"I feel so alone and so empty. Nobody in my life understands, I don’t think anyone would ever understand. Every time I want to cry, nothing comes out. I hate feeling like this, I don’t get why this has to happen to me"
I might commit suicide sooner or later...,"This moment in my life is no good, and even tho I’m holding myself on not doing it, I know I might someday. "
I'm super insecure about my intelligence,I can barely hold a conversation anymore. I feel like I just sound stupid no matter what I say. I don't want to talk to anyone ever again. goodnight
I feel really guilty,"About a month ago I was at a bowling game with my school team and I was having one of those days where my mind can't stop telling me how much I should kill myself for hours on end. And I was not very good at hiding my depression. So my friends expressed mild concern before dropping it.

Later on I had just got a strike, which made me feel 100 times worse some how, and my friend, the nicest happiest person on the planet, told me to say that I did a good job.


I physically couldn't,

So she asked again. 

And tears just started streaming down my face, I don't know why, and she apologized and I apologized too because she didn't need to apologize. No one else noticed and she never treated me any different but gosh.

I'm having one of those days again today, and it hurts. 
"
Anyone to talk to?,I really don’t want to go to a therapist and the hotline chat is booked for the third time (99 people ahead of me). Is it weird that I just don’t want to go to one?
I convinced myself I felt better for months but here I am,"I’ve definitely had lapses and depressive episodes in between, but I genuinely convinced myself I was past being this depressed. Around exactly a year later from the time I started feeling better I feel all my worst feelings back again. I feel worthless, miserable, and I can see everyone around me being put off by my attitude but there’s nothing I can do to stop it because I feel so terrible and have no energy. I feel so hopeless and like nothing in my life is ever gonna go well, it’s like I can only see in the present and not the future no matter how hard I try. Just to be clear, I’m not suicidal, I just expected ignorantly that my depression magically dissipated and it didn’t and it sucks."
Trigger warning: I need to talk to someone now. I reached out to an ex I never got over and waiting for a response is killing me.,"I'll try to keep this as short as I can. Back in 2017 I dated someone who I really thought Could Be the One. We only dated for 2 months but around the end of those two months he told me he was falling in love with me and I felt the same way. We shared everything in common. From music, two graphic novels to the same kind of food to the same TV shows, you name it, We had it in common. He had to get a third job because he ran into some Financial issues and he said he didn't want me to put my life on hold for him.

I moved on from the relationship because I obviously had no choice and I just always carried this burden with me of never having gotten over him. I know that it will be the one great regret of my life that we couldn't make the relationship everything I know it could have been. Unfortunately the next person I ended up getting with abused me terribly and I talked to this ex during that time. He was very nice and offered me a lot of emotional support even though he didn't have to. He never judged me or ask me why I didn't leave.

I will be honest and say that when I left my abuser for the first time in August of last year I ended up messaging him and letting him know that I was okay and that I had left this guy. He asked me if I was okay and I told him yes and then he said that he was sorry about the way things ended between us because he felt bad about everything I've had to go through since then. I asked him if we could at least be on speaking terms because we both said some things when we split up that we regret. He said he could forgive me for that and we could bury the hatchet.

Well he kept telling me he wanted to hang out but he was working a lot. I just started feeling like maybe he was stringing me along because I saw he had time to go to bars and go to concerts and yet he couldn't hang out with me. He was using the excuse of having to work three jobs which I know he is because he was on my Facebook friends list. So I saw him working his ass off. To be honest I kind of went off on him and just gave him a piece of my mind and let him know that I did not appreciate being lied to and that if he did not want to hang out with me all he had to do is tell me the truth.

I guess I kind of freaked out because of everything that I had gone through because of my abuser and I just felt like I was being mistreated again. I ended up blocking him and going back to my abuser in November because I felt alone and rejected and I guess I was just trying to cover that up. I'm not blaming him in any sort of way and saying that he forced me to go back to him but that's what happened.

 Well anyway, today makes a month since I left my abuser again. I messaged the ex that I'm talking about yesterday and apologized to him but he has not answered. I don't know if he ever will. It might be a few days. But I just can't help feeling like if it takes him a few days then I don't know what to think because I feel like he's playing hot and cold with me. I just don't know what to do or how to think right now. 

I'm extremely confused because I know that I still love him and never stopped but at the same time in a way I still love my abuser. I can't even hardly function right now because my brain is just a scrambled up mess and I'm not even sure how I feel. I just need someone to talk to me and give me some encouragement."
I feel like im falling back in.,I had a time a year back where I was just awful i started to self harm and everything was just not good. When I told my mom she got me professional help and i saw myself getting better. However this past month was just so bad I almost relapsed 2 times and i dont know why. Ive been just lathargic and not good. Why is this happening can someone tell me why.
Never fit in,"I have major depression and social anxiety that I've been battling since childhood. I always felt like I never fit in during school or college. So I don't have any friends from that time, and I feel like I'm lacking something because of it. I have some acquaintances, and they all seem to talk about the ""good old days"" or the ""best years of their lives."" I can't relate to them, and it's embarrassing.

I just wonder what my life would be like if I didn't have depression and anxiety. I wish I could get a redo and have some intervention with medicine and therapy back then."
"Everyone I’ve ever been close to is no longer in my life. Now, as a defense mechanism, I can’t get close to or be vulnerable with others anymore.","It’s all the avoid the pain of loss. I feel like all my happiness just lives on through good memories with people who aren’t around or who don’t care for me anymore. I’m tired of living in the past and I just want to enjoy the present and be excited about the future. Any tips? 
I just moved to a new city because I found myself only spending time with myself and my brothers dog back in my hometown. Now that I moved, I can’t feel a connection with anyone and I developed extreme social anxiety. I always subconsciously feel like what’s the point of spending time with people if their just going to be gone. No matter how many “friends” I’m
surrounded by I still feel crippling loneliness because they’ll never be as close to me as the people in my past were.  I know it’s a bad way of thinking but I can’t convince myself it’s not true."
How am I supposed to feel confident?,I'm always scared and frightened for no reason. I just want to feel like I'm in control for once. How am I supposed to do that?
I poached some eggs,"I've been lying to everyone for so long about how I'm doing. Not that there's anybody to lie to, except my parents. No friends. Seen several therapists but it didn't help. On medication but it barely helps. Living on takeout and cereal. Dirty apartment. So tired all the time. Somehow keeping it together at work.

Today I poached some eggs. The first time in months I actually cooked something. Never poached eggs before. I know it's not much to most people, but to me it was a huge fucking accomplishment and I'm halfway to being proud of myself but also afraid it was just a fluke and I'll go back to normal tomorrow. I'm nearing 30 and I can barely poach eggs. But maybe I'm not gonna give up."
Addicted to tragedy,"I've recently realised that thinking about unfortunate things happening arouses me. Things like forest fires, pain, being bruised up, being berated, being used by people and emotionally abused. Sometimes I think of being strangled, overdosing, or getting a terminal disease. I dont actually want these things to happen.

My friend recently called me a masochist because I keep getting into bad situations. He was joking, but it made me think. Sexuality aside. I do find myself getting into horrible situations frequently, as if I'm possessed by a crippling urge to seek out personal misfortune, no matter how serious. I only ever want to hurt myself through these actions. I try my best to keep others out of my problems. 

I find that I'm just so overwhelmingly curious to see the outcome of my bad choices. To see how deep I can go, deluded by the thought that I'll make it in the end. I might also take pleasure in the pity and attention.

I'm so addicted to destruction and misfortune. I want to stress that my thoughts never include any other sentient living thing, only myself, however,  I think that if I could live to see the world end I'd be the happiest person alive. It'd be so beautiful.

I suffer from depression and anxiety and spent a few days in a facility for suicidal tendencies, and I want to see a professional for further evaluation in the future.

"Venting, I guess......","TLDR- I’m depressed. Recently got my PhD. My family is depending on me to make a career move and I just want to stay in bed all day. 

So I was diagnosed with dysthymia, insomnia and social anxiety about 3 years ago. I’ve been “feeling” depressed for over a decade though (lack of interest in everything, crying everyday, not feeling genuinely happy anymore, just feeling like a failure), just confirmed it when I went to see a psychiatrist and got started on medication immediately. 

I considered myself having lived a decent life. I was the valedictorian at my high school graduation (highway GPA), had 2 friends I liked hanging out with, always had scholarships to pay for all my college and university studies. Graduated last week with my PhD in a biological science field. In the meantime, I got married 7 years ago, we have two children (5 and 2.5 months old). We dropped everything and have been living in Japan for almost 6 years (during which I got my Master’s and now my PhD degree). And I’ve been feeling increasingly worse about living and myself. I can’t explain why, it’s just something that’s been growing in me.

I genuinely want to find someone to kill me just so I don’t have to do it myself. All my life, I’ve had pressure from my parents to be the perfect student and I’ve been that for them. 

Now, I have a whole family relying on me to make the next move. If we decide to stay in Japan, I would be responsible for getting a work visa and everyone, including my husband, will continue to be a dependent of me. My husband will never qualify for a work visa here because he has no education beyond high school and you need a college degree to even be considered to receive a working visa in Japan. So being on a dependent visa, he can only work 28 hrs max (not enough money). I’ve been trying for the 9 years that I’ve known him to motivate him to get a degree and he’s started things and stopped every time. At one point, I’ve even offered to take some online courses for him so that he could get the degree but the one I started, I didn’t have time to finish because at the time I had to write some papers for my PhD. 

So, anyway, I applied, got the visa and got a job where I’ll have to be separated from my soon to be 3 months old for nearly 12 hours a day (8 hours work, 2 hours lunch break and 1 hr commute each way) for 5 days a week while he gets to work 3 days a week.  

If we leave Japan, everyone is still relying on me to start a career elsewhere because I’m the one with the specialized PhD degree so obviously I should be the one working. And he says he will follow me wherever but we agreed that the safety in Japan is suitable for our children at this age, that’s why we are still here. We can’t go back home right now because our neighborhood has become a war zone and it’s not a place we want to raise our daughters.

Problem is I spent most of my days unable to go to my lab (during my PhD program) because I was too depressed to do anything. I literally spend weeks at a time, stuck on my bed, no joke. 

And I genuinely need an hour to motivate myself to step outside the house. I cry for seemingly no reason. I feel like I’ve done all I could do, I got my PhD, I have two daughters, and I feel like there’s nothing else I can handle at this point, in terms of pressure from others. I’m so incredibly tired of being that strong girl/ woman that everyone is relying on. I just want to stay in my bed as I normally do. 

The thought of going to work and having to be there everyday with a smile on my face (English teaching job) is scaring me because I just don’t think I have the strength anymore to please people and pretend to be happy outside of home. 

I feel like I’ve been working hard my whole life to be great and now I’m completely satisfied being a bum at home, I’m just over life. "
Help,"this is my first time ever on a social media talking about my problem.

depression,"So I've been battling depression/anxiety most of my life (since as long as I can remember, at least 13 years old tbh).

Was first medicated on SSRI's at 22, had a suicide attempt at 24. On and off ADs since then. I exercise a lot too. I got married exactly 1 year ago today, to a girl I thought I loved and she loved me. Last month she cheated on me with an 18yo (I am 29...)

So it looks like we're getting a divorce now, she's made it clear that she doesn't care about me anymore at all. I consider myself a good person but all I get is shit from other people. I almost had another suicide attempt last month but my dad and my best friend talked me out of it.

I won't give up, I will survive. But I am always hitting the bottom. My new meds (Effexor) have been helping a lot, but lately I've lost the drive to workout again. It comes in cycles but I always feel alone, empty, wearing that mask, trying to find simple joy. And now I actually am alone again, completely. I live alone now, no friends here, and soon no wife here. I don't deserve it. Not at all. Someone just help me see the light at the end of the tunnel, thanks..."
I don't know how to help my friend.,"First of all, I'd like to say hello. This is my first Reddit post. I'm relatively new despite knowing about this piece of media for some time now. 

I recently joined a discord group and I met a bunch of amazing people there, amongst which is the friend in question. We bonded over our own problems (mostly hers I think) and although we aren't necessarily that close, we do talk quite a lot through DMs.

Now, recently I became busier and I'll likely stay as busy, but she exclaimed that she wanted to die and that she generally feels worthless & pathetic and lacks a lot of the focus she needs for her studies. She has plenty times in fact. I'm pretty sure that all of our mutual friends know how she feels and everyone that can and has time, puts in time to talk to her about it (if she talks to everyone about it that is).

My question is how can we help this person? I personally don't know the exact details of the scenarios that happen in her life, but I do know enough (if we include my own assumptions) to get an idea of what her life is like. 

Especially, what could I tell this person to potentially make her feel better? As she is my friend and I was once in her shoes to a lesser degree, I still feel at a loss for words of what exactly to say to her to try and make her feel better.

Any comment or critique is welcome, thank you for reading. 

Have a wonderful day. 💜"
I tried to talk to like 6 or 7 different girls tonight and they all laughed at me or did not reply,"Its not a big deal to me I'm used to that happening, I've only ever had 2 relationships and they didn't go well. I just wonder why no one will even talk to me? Nobody even knows me so it's not like I've got a bad reputation, I'm not the greatest looking guy but I like to think I'm pretty friendly even if I'm a bit crazy. For me it's impossible to find someone to talk too. And plus everyone around here is SO boring, well boring to me at least. Nobody has got the same interests as me. Idk . Also where I live there's not a lot of places to meet people if any and I have terrible social anxiety so it makes it harder 
"
I don’t know what to do anymore,"I (15F) have been on tons of different ADHD medications since 2nd grade. My parents blamed the medications for my suicidal ideation and extreme depression. We hopped from Concerta to Ridilin to Adderol. I tried to make it clear to my parents that I am not ok, but they never listen and take it as “she’s going through a phase and she’ll get over it”. I started hearing voices about 2 years ago and started self harming about a year and a half ago. My parents noticed my scratches and took it as me trying to get attention. The problem is, that wasn’t the case. I had become so numb to the world around me that the only thing that I could feel was physical pain. It felt good to finally feel something. The voices keep getting worse and I told my therapist this, but she also thinks I’m lying. I have no freaking clue what to do. I know
I’m depressed and have been diagnosed with it and hospitalized, but still nobody will take me seriously. How do I stop the voices? How do I pretend to be happy? How do I hide the scars? I’m so done with hiding things and think tHe would would be better off without having one more annoying voice to listen to."
What’s the best subreddit to help with anxiety?,I have horrific anxiety and was wondering if you could suggest some soothing subreddit to calm me. I cannot take Xanax anymore because I was abusing the hell out of it so I am needing to find other coping mechanisms and at the moment nothing is really helping. 
Just me,"Hello my name is Brittany, I am a broken person. I have CIP and depression. I have battled depression as long as I can remember. I am married, I have a son a 10 acre farm with dogs, a cat, chickens,and goats. My ""happy place"" is my garden. I cry every night after my husband falls asleep. I have always been the strongest the person who bears all of the weight of the world around me so my family doesn't feel my pain. I try so hard to make everyone happy. My anxiety kicks in overtime if I even think that something will make someone upset with me. My younger years were ok. I graduated high school at 16. I dated an abusive man that broke all of my ribs, both arms, and is the reason I lost sight in my left eye. I became pregnant at 19. My sons biological father tried to kill my son by attacking me. I was stabbed 14 times and stomped on. My son survived and was born prematurely at 30 wks gestation. My depression only got worse. He was so tiny. 2 months of nicu, I worked 3 jobs and was in school for nursing. I finished school and worked in a trauma bay in the Er. One night I found myself holding an infant that would not survive. He went out the windshield of a car during a crash. I held his tiny skull together while awaiting medical evac to a childrens trauma hospital. That night was the night that broke me. I made it home covered in blood. I sat in my shower floor and called my husband. I couldn't talk or breathe, I just needed to hear his voice. He has never made it home faster. I left that job. Depression isn't what most people think. On the outside I am normal. I smile, I walk the dogs and run a farm. I play with my son and love to hear him laugh. I fear that everyone and everything I love will be taken away some how. I do not let people see the real me. If I cried infront of them I would be weak. I have CIP most people I speak to wish they could have CIP. It seems like a blessing but it is a curse in disguise. I cannot feel external pain, but my depression is a pain I wouldn't wish on anyone. I have had 3 miscarriages my heart is broken, my mind is broken, my soul is broken. I dont know why I am the way I am. I don't know why I am so broken. I just want to be happy. I dont know how to be happy. I don't feel happiness anymore. How do I even explain that to my family. My son and my husband, they are perfect in every way. They are the reason I continue to live. The reason I force myself to get up every day. I have slipped so deep into this darkness and I don't know how to get out. "
Is this just being a teenager,"I was bullied at a young age and looking back I think everything that caused it was childish and I regret the person I was then

Im am currently just 15 and have had depressive thoughts for 3 years and sometimes suicidal ones I have thought about ending my life when just doing menial things when my mind is blank I brought up my concerns to my parents and I was told a lot of this is just being a teenager but I'm worried

I don't feel empathy much for others and had a hard time grieving over a death in the family I didn't cry and I haven't since I was 11

I feel alright when with mates or with family but I've noticed recently I am not enjoying a lot of the things I used to playing games with my mates, reading and I used to enjoy writing

I don't remember a huge amount of my childhood other than going to therapy and leaving my primary school age (4-11)

I have friends that actually like my company I have a long family but I still feel depressed

I just want to know is what I'm feeling depression or just me being an angsty teenager like I assume my parents think "
Thinking about suicide I’m ugly and I have a genetic disorders,No girl will ever want me. Because I’m ugly and I have a genetic disorder. What’s the point of living if I’ll never get to experience love
I'm never going to see a therapist ever again,"About a year back i was jobless and was living with my mom. My mom constantly nagged me to go out and do something. But i didn't wanna try as someone is constantly making u feel worthless. Went to see a therapist with my mom. He told my mom to wait outside and asked me what s the problem. Told him i dont feel like it when someone who s ur only family constantly make u feel worthless. And told him im not a lazy ass bitch but will do it and told him i love cars and i love engineering. Told me to wait outside and told my mom that im just acting and giving lame excuses to be a lazy guy and to eat free food. Its been a year since i spoke with my mom. Got a job as a mechanical designer.Looking  to move out. And whatever shit happens, i am never going to a therapist ever again."
getting worse,"Not making much progress on anything anymore. Still the same psychotic thinking, thoughts of suicide, wanting to self harm. Feel like theres nothing to live for. Anytime i think things will be okay it blows up, or i screw something up i dont really want to be alive, i dont have much desire anymore. I'll never get out from under this. I'll always be in the same spot i am now. I don't have hope, and it DOESN'T get better. it never does, i never will. I want to be dead, its what i want. i want people to understand that, but everyone in my life will feel like it was their fault. happiness just doesn't last around me. I think it would be best if i took my own life. maybe i will, who knows. wish something would change to give me some kind of glimmer of hope"
"No one asks how I'm doing, even though I try and make it apparent","Why dont my friends ask how I'm doing? I punch walls so my fists are bruised and bleeding, I punch my face in Hope's that they notice and comment and ask. But still no ones says anything "
Feeling better after stopping bupropion,"I was on generic bupropion XL 300mg once daily for about a year. I started it after one event got me into a depressive state. I never needed meds prior to this.


I tapered by taking XL 150mg for 5 days, skipping every third day. It’s been one week since my last dose.


I feel calmer, less rushed, and my thoughts are clearer. It’s like all this chatter in my brain has quieted and I can finally hear myself, and patiently deal with my thoughts. My mood is great, maybe even a bit less plagued by negative thoughts than it was before I stopped. The only negative has been tiredness and wicked caffeine headaches if I delay my morning coffee. I plan to start exercise to deal with this.


Has this been anyone else’s experience? It’s unlike most of what I’ve read online, so I’d just like to hear some other people’s thoughts or descriptions of life after bupropion."
feeling extremely suicidal,"i no longer want to live,  i've felt this way for a very long time, i've been admitted to the hospital for it and am currently switching over to new medication. but i just feel so fucking horrible all the time, i'm disengaged in everything. i literally have no one, my roommates are pretty much sick of my shit and basically said they can't be there for me. my mom's an alcoholic and my brother is pretty much non existent, and i can't get a therapy appt until the end of april. so fuck me right? i'm wondering how much it will take to overdose on my new medication, because none of the knives we have in the house aren't sharp enough because i've tried. i just can't do this shit anymore. "
I'm losing my mind,"My father died last month and the woman who I wanted to spend my life with left me. I'm a wreck. I start doing better and then crash again. It keeps happening. 

She has blocked me on everything. I know everyone is going to say let it go move on and this and that but I'm messed up from everything. Losing my father forever and the woman I wanted to raise a family with is tearing me into pieces.

I was going to therapy for my anger and depression but it's gotten so much worse since all this has happened. I'm fucked up.

I didn't think I'd lose my dad and her, I wasn't prepared for this. I started getting my life together and it all came crashing back down. 

I didn't get to say bye to my dad either. I hadn't spoke to him for a week and a half before he passed, we were just busy with life. I was out of town for work when it happened.

Then a few days later it all started getting overwhelming and I got into an argument with my ex and we were already on Rocky terms. And that was it. Within five days, two of the people I love more than anything were gone forever.

I fucking hate this world. I finally, after years of trying, got a job I could grow into, and all of this came crashing down. I thought this year was going to be different, I didn't know it was going to be a different type of pain.

Everything sucks."
"With so many people on the planet, why would people care if we are depressed",They could just move on to better people instead dealing with people like us. Fuck this shit 
Anyone else sometimes hope for an accident?,It's been long since things have been bad enough that I thought about killing myself but I've found recently the thought of a car running a red a light as a cross appealing almost hopeful in a way. Than it's accident you know? Family would be upset but not in the same if I killed myself. As someone who delt with depression for about 8 years there's times that aren't so bad and there's times that are unbearable. Right now it's just kinda in the middle but it's just a vicious circle and I can't remember the last time I really happy. I sometimes wonder who would even care if I died? What impact would my life really have?
Sick of it,Sick of my mom blaming everything on herself. Sick of her being in pain. Sick of being miserable all the time. Sick of us being in pain. Sick of everything 
I want to die,I was a savage for so many years of my life. There was some seed of determination in me that I was not conscious of. I was mostly consciously getting into trouble and drunk 
"Was alone, still alone, gonna be alone (wall of text warning)","33, living abroad as an expat just because l home country is in shit state. 

Deeply depressed though. 

So, I had an slightly okay life back then. But i wasnt fit for the people around me. Including my closest friends. All of them got married one by one. And those “mates” started to disappear from my life. Had kids, jobs etc. Basically the culture expects you to so. Or else you’d be lonely. I left alone. 

Ppl didnt prefer to call me because I was still the single guy who didn’t fit family gatherings. Oh btw, my hobbies are drawing, watching sunday cartoons, playing guitar and playing games. Sounds like a manboy isn’t it? Nah I also read a lot especially Friday nights. I’ve completed whole asimov. 

Sounds like i’m bragging I am trying to say, I don’t do drugs, party hard or or any of those. Sometimes grass but on fridays just for playing games. I never understood why I was such threat to their new families.

Oh, i’m definitely not a “i love my home country” person. In fact i couldn’t care less about the nationalism bs. But if it gets a point that it’s also lowering your life standards, fuck that. 

Thanks to that i became a irritated towards my own nation. Also economy went shit and gov corrupted terribly and forced me to change from a-politic to political person.

All those were going, i was already in depression. I’ve seen a fucking coup attempt ffs. We live in a age where people send fucking personal shuttles, discover unfound species, split stoms and while all those going the standard I get was a goddam coup attempt. 

In short, i said fuk it and left my family back there and moved to a better shit hole lol.

I’ve moved to a new place with a dirty start. My mind is already mudded. It become a bit dirtier with two extremely evil housemates -oh never shared a house before. It’s a disaster if you’re over 30 and sharing a house.

Oh, i also got scammed 1 time (fake real estate)
Oh, i also got fired from 2 jobs (even though i was working good just because terrible accent)
Oh, had the worst flu ever and had no one to call ambulance, fainted because of the fever. Woke up all alone.

All. Fucking. Alone. 

Still no one to talk. No buddy to share anything. No one is still gonna even call an ambulance if i have an heart stroke 5 minutes later. 

And the shit part is I hate when people are pushing me to find a girl and throwing tips when it’s not asked. 

And you know what, i’m not asexual. Just boring straight dude. I need a partner in my life. 

And tbh, i even think that ED is on me too -16 years of smoking, what did i exect?

So, lived alone, gonna die alone. Sometimes i think whats the point of living but nah. Too messy. I’d rather play some overwatch. 

Sorry for the shit english and grammar mistakes

**tldr** left my home country, left my parents there. Came to a new place with depression. Had shitty life developments, one i fainted because of fever and had no one to call an ambulance. Dick problems. Still in depression cuz no one to talk to"
When people ask me how I’d lost weight I find it kind of funny.,"Usually I don’t eat breakfast and substitute it with a caffeine tablet or milk tea (without sugar/unsweetened) and I don’t eat dinner my only proper meal is lunch. I feel a bit hungry from time to time but my overall depressed mood keep me away from food. I’d lost another 0.7 kilogram without using laxatives or diet pills like I did in the past and I’m aware it’s an eating disorder but I don’t want to deal with it right now. I still have it under control, I’m still okay with myself...I think. A masseuse asked me last night “You’d been losing weight again, how do you do it?”. She’s tried and failed so, should I just pretend it’s willpower like last time? People tend to like that kind of motivation, just tell them I’m OMAD (eating only one meal per day), that’s not it though cause I don’t always eat healthy food. "
I don’t know what’s going on.,To start off no formal diagnosis has been made I don’t even know what is going on. I haven’t done anything in what feels like forever. I have this feeling in my head and I can’t get anything done. I just want someone to listen but I don’t know what to say. 
Anyone else desperately wish for death but would feel ripped off not being able to experience the peace?,"Like the last thing you feel is the pain of however you die, not the freedom from all your problems afterwards. 

So really you never feel relief (cause i sure as hell don’t have the power to fix anything while alive and feel it)

i almost died when i was born. 100 years earlier and i won’t have had to worry about all this shit "
Nothing looks right to me anymore,"The broader my perspective on the world gets, the smaller it feels. The world is tiny. And dirty. And dingey. Everywhere looks the same and I will never be satisfied anywhere I live doing anything. I just want to cry and turn to dust or something because the world is nothing like how I used to view it, how I looked at it as a child. I don't think I like the world very much. None of it looks beautiful. I guess that's what fiction and escapism is for though"
No one cares until something big happens,"Honestly, if more people genuinely cared about how I was doing when they asked “How are you?” or would try to see that maybe there’s more to us than what we put out there, the world would be a better place. Instead, I feel like I have to try scream and cry to get any kind of help than simply by asking. That just sucks."
I can't talk to anyone about anything,I can't tell my parents how I feel because it would crush them. They think I'm past the depressed period of my life. I cant talk to my friends because most of them are equipped emotionally for any kind of real conversation about depression. I cant talk to a therapist because I'd have to go through my parents for payment. And even if I could I'd feel like I'm boring them with my inane feelings and woe is me outlook. I feel like I'm doomed to bottling up all of my emotions until they explode.
How do you guys enjoy vacation while being depressed?,"My best friend in the military killed himself last Friday. It’s the 4th person I knew in the military that has killed themselves but this guy was my closest friend and we regularly talked on the phone if we were having any issues. I’m not looking for any pity on that just wanted to give some background. 

I’m on vacation right now and I’m supposed to be enjoying my time but I have just so much fucking anger and I know that’s how my depression manifests itself. I can still do fun things but as I’m sure a lot of you know it’s just always there. I can’t fully enjoy something because I feel guilty, or just sad and angry for no reason. It hurts even more cause I know it bothers everyone else too. 
How do some of you kind of trick yourself out of the funk when you need to? "
"I do my best to make people feel better when they're down, but it hurts knowing nobody can do the same to me","I take pride in the fact that I can always cheer someone up, that I can always say the right thing to help. But I'm at a really low point myself recently and it hurts knowing that nobody can ever do it to me. They'll try being polite and kind, trying their best to cheer me up, but they never have an answer when I bring an actual problem up. I feel like a lazy piece of shit, I could have done more, yes I did know, this is my fault. If I were in their shoes I'd easily have the right thing to say, but when I'm stuck in my own head nobody can really break me out. "
:(,The only thing stopping me from killing myself is my brother in the next room 
I feel like I’m in Autopilot... and I don’t know if it’s better for me or worse,"Ok so in the last year my life has significantly worsened, and I was in a bad way mentally. I constantly felt under the weather, and I would say at my lowest point I was depressed. However, recently I’ve seem to have slowly stopped feeling any sort of emotion at all,  and I feel like my life is just whizzing by and I’m just here watching. 

I don’t feel under the weather, and there hasn’t been any significant events to drag me out of this dark place I was in. I gradually just felt a bit better and I would say my mental state is normal. But I never feel anything but normal, if that makes sense.

This state of mind is better than constantly feeling down all the time, but I find it strange that I rarely vary my emotions any more.

I was wondering if anyone else has felt like this and if it’s normal? "
Long rant about life in general,"apologies for the ***SUPER*** ***BIG*** rant incoming

&#x200B;

I'm currently a sophomore in high school, and everything has gone down the drain in terms of motivations, energy, and grades for me. While I am not the worst performing student in my school by any means, I am still unsatisfied and unhappy with myself. My grades have slipped far lower than they ever have, and I don't feel like trying anymore. I try my hardest, but my grades keep dropping to B's and C's, and I know this sounds pretty stupid to most people but I have been crushed by this and I'm starting to lose hope. My sleep schedule has been ruined, with me getting roughly 6 hours of sleep or less a night. I keep losing weight, get constant headaches, have blurry vision, and generally feel sickly and weak. I study (or at least I try to) for hours on end, with no results. I sit rotting in my room every single day either doing school work or mindlessly playing video games in my free time without enjoying it because I can't seem to make any new friends or gain the motivation to get together with anyone anymore. My whole life just revolves around school, but even then I still seem to be failing that too. 

&#x200B;

I've become so pessimistic and cynical about everything. If I get a decent grade on something, I think ""ok whatever"" and toss it aside, because in the long run, it doesn't amount to much when I already know I did poorly on everything else. When I play video games or pursue a hobby, the things that are supposed to let me escape from the harsher aspects of life, I feel nothing. I just go through it as if it were another homework assignment or something, I gain nothing and I feel like I wasted time when I could have been doing schoolwork instead. I've lost all motivation for creating art, reading, writing, martial arts, whatever. It feels like a chore and I just keep glancing at the clock, only concerned with how many hours I've burned doing something useless. The feeling of not having any homework due the next day feels unnerving. Being stress-free feels unnatural and weird to me. Whenever I see stuff like Mr. Rogers on youtube or a wholesome post on reddit about a happy family or something, I can't help but start crying. I look back on how much happier and carefree I was back in elementary school before I had to worry about grades or my future, which once again sounds pretty stupid coming from a teenager such as myself.

&#x200B;

I clutch onto stress, and this has become very bad in terms of my health. I've gotten sick more frequently, and this puts more stress on me as missing days of school create an even bigger workload on my already crowded schedule. I've been diagnosed with ADHD and anxiety, although I only take medication for ADHD since they deemed that my anxiety wasn't ""extreme enough"" or something. My cuticles are a mess due to my constant biting and tearing. My time management skills went down the drain and at the same time, my anxiety towards how much time has passed has gone up significantly. I haven't been formally diagnosed for proper depression because I've been too paranoid of what would happen if I were to tell anyone. I've read horror stories on reddit about mental psych wards, and I know reddit isn't a good resource, but that hasn't kept me from being afraid.

&#x200B;

I feel so stupid. My friends seem to be in more advanced classes than I am, and they complain about getting 95's and shit while I'm over here getting low 80's and 70's. I know that the thought of committing suicide over low grades sounds pathetic and weak, and I would agree. I feel pathetic and weak. I feel like I failed the only goal that I have set for myself. The goal that I spent SO much time and effort on that I forgot to keep myself healthy, make friends, or have a happy life in general. I don't know how I can get myself out of this hole I've dug, so I might as well just lay here until something happens. I'm definitely not looking forward to two more years of high school and college or whatever lies ahead.

&#x200B;

**TLDR**: My life revolves around school and I keep disappointing myself with poor grades. My health, social life, and general well-being has gone down the drain.

&#x200B;

Also, I'd appreciate not posting any ""you're just a teenager with hormones, get over it"" comments. While it may be true that I am young with hormones or whatever, it doesn't help me and it certainly doesn't make me feel any better. It would be like saying ""you're depressed because of your autism"" to an autistic person. That could be the case, but you're just shutting down any real concerns that that person may have. I appreciate you for reading this far and thank you for your time."
See these some times,"Pros and cons of the big bad death


PRO: I will be fucking relieved, No more pain for people that hate me, won’t have to hurt myself for relief any more

CONS: parents would be sad, expensive funeral

🤔 🤔 🤔 what to choose"
"I finally made the decision to get help, but it feels like its getting worse every day."," 

I'd say that throughout my life I've been pretty good at hiding how i'm feeling and appearing positive or happy. But it's been really difficult lately and I feel worse everyday.

I made a new group of friends when I started college, since our major is so small we've become really good friends, doing practically everything together, always together, and they really are some of the greatest people, but I don't want to burden them with any of this and it feels like there's no one I can talk to without feeling like i'm bringing them down or making them dislike me.

It got worse before spring break, one of them found out and we ended up going to our universities student counseling and mental health center. And then another one figured it out cause I just got tired of putting in the effort to be happy after that. I have an appointment after spring break, but ever since then I just feel more and more like a waste of space and like shit. I didn't think it would be this hard but I broke down and cried today for the first time in years, and the only thing keeping me going is knowing how mad she'd feel if I did something or killed myself.

I think a lot about how I want to be with these people for so long, we have all these plans for years down the line, and we even took one of those trips just a few days ago. But I just feel sad every fucking day, I'm falling behind in some of my classes and having trouble getting up, going to sleep, and it just seems like such an easy way out. It's funny cause I told them I'd be fine over spring break, but less then 24 hours after that I broke down and just want to give up.

I thought that since I've felt depressed before in high school and gotten by that I'd just be happy and normal for the rest of my life but it just comes back worse again and again. It feels like I have all this support around me, but there's no reason to keep going. I just keep thinking about not being around and how it'd be better than whatever this is. I'm sorry this is rambly and guess doesn't even matter since I'm getting help but I just don't know anymore."
To lonely to live,"So i decided i dont want to spend another year FA!  I figure i kill myself before i do this lonely life.  I fell for a guy hard and love for tbe first time in my life(34 Virgin, never been kissed , hug a guy romantically or ever had a boyfriend) but after two months he broke up with me , and I love , love him sooooo much . he made me love him . we never met IRL we met on this site. FYI he is AMAZING... But. He just doesn't want me , although he says he loves me . I have so much love to give ...
So now i have decided that I can't do this life alone anymore.  Im unattractive and fat.  So by the end if the year if im still Forever alone and single . I give up..."
Frozen like fear,"Frozen like fear and not having a grain of courage to at least try. But viewing suicide as if it’s some grand escape. Being a wishful thinker and believing that a imaginary thing will one day be. Cowardice being as easy as breathing. The whole victim mentality but not fessing up and owning to what one does. A trillion apologies but not one sincere effort to get better and make less mistakes. Distracting oneself while doing unhealthy behaviors. As if porn and a five second orgasm will really help. Watching self help videos from various people like master Shang yen, mooji, Christian pastors, mystics like osho and krishnamurti, and sadhguru. But watching these videos and nothing seeping in to take courage and to change. Even the number one escape option of dreams is now a horrible place to be. Wishing that you can be that lady that walks on the street just smiling while reading her book. Or wishing you were a good person. Yeah n a unreal world one can be whomever and be great but it’s just not real same as my wishes. But life being utterly terrifying and death being even more. Best way to describe it is an immature, and mentally ill deer being trapped in life’s headlights."
I forgot my Wellbutrin traveling for work,I forgot my Wellbutrin prescription and I'll be working 8 days out of town.  I'm pretty terrified.  I'm already likely getting laid off and I think my work will heavily suffer while I'm going through withdrawal symptoms.  I don't know if I'll be able to call my doctor because I work from 3AM-6PM and I don't think they're open that long.  
I want to die but I don’t know what to do with my animals.,"This is serious, I plan on suicide soon but I care too much about my animals to put them in a shelter and my family won’t take care of them. "
This is exactly how I feel,"I was looking for a sub that I could read to help pull me out of this hole that I am in. Every title I skimmed at here I relate to.  I have irrational anxiety of socializing that I even give up things that I love like IG. I don’t want to get out of bed and am tired ALL THE TIME. On days I do not work, I sleep in and then take an afternoon nap that sometimes leads into the next day.  Even though there are things that I need to do, everything seems to be so hard to get started.  I take meds but they haven’t been helping to the degree I need them to in a long time. I have anxiety just thinking about making another Dr appt because I am afraid my Dr won’t understand how bad it is for me. I don’t know what to do anymore. I am not suicidal but I think life is just too hard right now for me and I know that is not a rational thought because things aren’t bad."
I would like to vent.,"I’ll probably get like 2 comments on this but I’ll still vent. I don’t care. It feels like I’ll never be better. I am very alone. The better me might as well be a martian. People showing how they are living life. I am here rotting. I am worthless. I feel worthless. Are you kidding or are you just saying that; no I actually feel worthless like garbage. I am nothing. I am nothing.

People living lives, having kids, getting married, having friends, doing things. I will be in my room with the door closed. I will sit in silence and solitude.

The world is just pressing a heavy weight on me and I don’t see how there’ll ever be redemption. I am alone, I am sad, I am tired. Why am I tortured like this? People ask how are you? Fine. But I’m not fine. I am not ok. Please help me. Why won’t you reach out? What am I to do?

You have a job, you went to college, you should be happy they say. No, I am not happy. I have an iphone but that doesn’t make me happy.

Have fun going out to that bar tonight. I hope you enjoy the company. I will be here, in my room, alone, with the door shut. I am tired. /vent"
How do you deal with depression?...,"I can't enjoy anything for years now and alcohol/weed are as common in my life as dinner time. I'm trying to stop replacing my emptiness with something detrimental but I always fail.
I'm poor, alone at college for a few more months until I graduate (and then I'll probably be even more alone after I graduate), and push everyone away because it's easier than letting them know that I need them.
I've had so many just feel better or just exercise and eat right and they do help but I always slip back into my inner despair... I do have a great family but I don't think I can really talk to them about stuff like this.
I've never tried antidepressants and don't even know how I would start that since I'm from the U.S. and on my own shitty health insurance from my college.
I'm writing this because I was scrolling through Netflix and Ricky Gervais was on a show saying he can do whatever he wants because if everything gets too bad he can always just die. I've had that thought so many times but seeing someone else say it out loud hit me so hard and I NEED to get better"
Unexpected and now unfamiliar,"I used to be a pro at this depression thing. For a long time, I knew when it was coming, had the defense at the ready, and plowed through the pit until everything got lighter again for a while.         

I'd had a terrible year of loss, illness that wiped out my wealth, and other random wrenches to the face. I found myself on the edge of a cliff making the decision I never thought I would. But then the most amazing man, practically a stranger to me, reached through a phone and pulled me back to myself. Every word he spoke resonated like it was coming from somewhere deep inside me. It was a turning point and I worked hard to repair the space my mind had been lingering in for too long.         

Since then I've made significant progress toward recovering from my illness, met someone magnificent, and started planning/working toward being retired again in five years. I have been happy. A stable, comfortable, steady contentment for nearly two years continuously. I just returned home last week from a marvelous vacation with my s/o. To find three job opportunities waiting for me. I had a preliminary interview today for a position as an interpreter with a prestigious organization. I have plans to move to a much better location than I'm at by the end of next month. Everything is lining up beautifully.     

But yesterday, my s/o and I broke up. Aside from the odd timing, it seemed the logical thing to do. I was okay with it and even a little relieved. But then I couldn't sleep and I've lost my appetite entirely. Today, I unloaded a year's worth of rage and hurt on him in the most vile fashion. When I was done, I didn't feel better. I felt like a monster. Then I felt nothing. Indifferent. Hollow.        

I know what this is. I recognize it, but it is no longer a space I am acquainted with. I can't make myself feel the grief and shame and loss. I can't even find them. This is how my mind handles death, not break-ups and regret. In the midst of all this success and looking toward a tangible future within my reach, I have fallen into the pit again. Only I don't remember the way out anymore. "
How can I get over the anxiety of contacting friends after isolation?,"So I’ve noticed in the last 4-5 months I have become more and more withdrawn. It didn’t really concern me at the time because I was too busy being encompassed by my depression but now that I’m in treatment, I’ve had to focus on things I was avoiding before. I know progress isn’t linear but it’s hard to believe it for myself.

 I feel like I take 30 steps backwards for every step forward and today was one of those days. I spoke to my therapist and she challenged me to call a friend tonight and I did, but no one picked up or was available. As the phone was ringing I found myself hoping no one would pick up and could feel anxiety making me hot and my heart racing. I want to get better so I can live a life I actually enjoy and friends are a huge part of that. Does anyone else feel like after isolation it’s extra hard to reach out? "
Panic/anxiety attack?,"Recently keep getting this thing where I’ll completely escalate something that’s happening in my head. My heart starts palpitation and my face gets hot, sometimes start to sweat and occasionally get shaky hands. It doesn’t last longer than 2 minutes. I don’t know if this is a panic or anxiety attack but it is triggered by something. I haven’t been formally diagnosed but my doctor and counsellor have said it’s likely I have anxiety (before these started). It’s caused by stupid shit. An example: I was in the car yesterday and my mum left to go into a shop. The car was parked on a slight slope and the handbrake wasn’t fully on so the car was making noises (I think the wheels putting pressure on break or something) if I moved at all. I was terrified and was staying completely still panicking but my dog moved the car started moving down the slope. It was SO slow and if I was thinking rationally I would have just pulled the handbrake up fully. The car stopped after a few inches but I was near tears when my mum came back. Is paranoia or anxiety attack or something else? I’m probably just being stupid lol"
"There is a part of me that doesn't want to get better, is this normal?","I was really depressed for a while, considering suicide. Now I'm starting to get better, but there is a part of me that doesn't want to. I don't really know how to phrase this, but I feel like being depressed made me special, like somebody actually important, and when I lose that part of me, I will just go back to being a nothing again. Is this normal, or do you guys thing that I am just overreacting?"
Why can’t I just die,I hate my life I’m a dumb lonely piece of shit but I’m too scared to kill myself.  I’m invisible no one will care or even notice if I die 
Does anybody here have an imaginary friend?,"(20M) I was heavily depressed around the age of 13-16 coz I was ostracized everyday by the people in my school for having a deep voice and I didn't have any friends.  

Back then I was so prideful that I convinced myself that I was not depressed by creating an imaginary friend who was the physical embodiment of my hatred for the people who made me suffer. 

Whenever I felt like I was worthless, my imaginary friend will immediately appear and tell me how much better I was than the 'worthless trash' that ostracized me and in a weird way it made me feel better.

Oddly enough, having an imaginary friend helped me get through school (and life) even with my depression. I still talk with him whenever I'm feeling down, do any of you have an imaginary friend?"
i want to see someone but i cant,"ok so i (think) i have depression but i’m probably just a stupid attention seeking boo-hooer that is not very good at socializing-
but a while ago i asked my mother if i could see a therapist and she acted so strange, and she never did anything about it since.

and now that it’s gotten so bad to the point where i just can’t contain it anymore, i’m too scared to go and tell my family because my sisters going to say i’m doing it for attention and i won’t even open up to a therapist or something of that sort,,,

pls help or comment something"
My mental state is falling apart,"Everything was okay, but my antidepressant dosage just got increased and suddenly everything is falling apart. I know I have to call my psych but in the mean time I don’t know what to do. I have no motivation, I barely have a will to keep living. My urges to self harm are back and so are my suicidal ideations. It’s a constant battle that I feel like I’m losing. I feel lonely, and lost. College is tough, keeping up with all the work when just looking at all of my assignment give me panic attacks. I’m not even entirely sure why I’m posting this, I guess I just needed to vent. I want to get better and I want to have a good life, but I feel like my mental health is so limiting there is so reason to keep on going. I’m trying, I really am. But it’s hard. "
Ahhhh,"When you are dying inside and your mom wants to interrogate your life
Me:sits under a blanket
Mom:what’s wrong
Me:(ignores her)
Mom: what’s wrong
Me: nothing
Mom: something 
Me: NOTHING WHFRGHJHG
Mom: SOMETHING WHHGHGDDGYf
And this continues for a bit"
Nothing feels right anymore,"All I can think about is how happy I was. I miss her. Not the current her, but the past her. And there’s nothing I can do about it. I’ll be happy again at some point, but right now makes me want to kill myself most of the time."
Is this feeling of adult sadness normal from time to time or am I depressed (or something else)?,"I’m in my early 30s and have been working post college for almost 10 years in a few different roles for a couple companies. I also worked retail through college. Ever since getting a “real job” I have this general sadness that seems to come and go but seems to come more often and more severe recently. It’s that feeling of “is this really it?” Life is pretty good. Decent job that (barely but still does) pay the bills, hobbies, friends, good family, girlfriend, all the check boxes at least early on for the American dream. But at the end of the day I’m sad and angry and feel like I don’t want to do anything. My job has been especially bad lately but it’s bareable. After a long day of work, I’ve been needing an oil change, so I called every place open past 5pm (the time I’m ideally off) in a 50 mile radius and everyone was booked out at least a week. Total no biggie, but that was my final straw, I just broke down crying after work. I just don’t want to do anything. It’s hard to make any effort on the things I need to do. And the things I want to do, as soon as I start I lose interest. I don’t know what to do.   "
I don’t want to die but I don’t want to live like this anymore,"I don’t want to live anymore. I hate who I am, I hate how I am. But I’m a wimp, and can’t bring myself to kill myself. I feel like a fucking loser and no one actually cares. "
"As a guy with a disability, why does it seem like people hate me or feel justified in treating me badly?","walk fine, talk great. Only the knees and back are iffy.

I am not in a wheelchair. I have never been in an inspirational ""disease of the week movie.""

If I am fully honest, some will say I am angry or entitled.

Nah, it would be nice to not have Tinder provide a baseline I cannot meet.

People and professionals have had two reactions.

""Why are you thinking about a relationship?"" and ""What are you doing here?""

I would like positive attention and dignity.

I have half a dozen women contact me through here. Their behavior has been the baseline for how most folks have treated me throughout my life.

Women have made it clear that I would do anything they wanted-I mean anything. When when I objected. I had things I did no want to do and those women would not listen.

I dodged a bullet but felt angry because I was mistreated. Total disrespect.

I am not ""a favor."" I am not a realization of a fetish or a devotee.

I am a man with a functioning mind who would like to meet a person who can hold a conversation.

But I am called slurs as introduction. People look disgusted when they see me. Those same people will act like it's my fault for their derogatory behavior towards me.

I am tired of being singled out because I am different. I deserve nothing and am only entitled to mutual respect."
"I hate being autistic, this is not a life","Whats the point of living when you cannot make connections with people? I'll feel ill never have a normal life and will always be a disappointment to the family. Lets face it women just don't like me, (I've already thrown in the towel on that so I dont need any generic platitudes I've heard it all) and the only way they will is if I change who I am which really sucks. I hate when peoe say to be yourself because a lot of the time yourself sucks and doesn't work. I'm a fucking genetic dead end. A failure. Not just women, everything."
That overlying feeling,"This past month I have been feeling especially terrible. Keep getting reminded of how much I fucking hate myself. I even hurt myself for the first time, which I really really feel sick and disgusting and stupid for doing.
I've just had this constant overlying feeling. Maybe I'll feel happy because of a score I got on a test, or laugh hysterically at some shit meme, but I'll somehow always revert back to this awfully feeling no matter what. I just feel like nothing is ever going to change, and that I'll be stuck in this horrible cycle forever, and it really really hurts.
What's even worse is that I don't really have anyone to talk to. I can't face the shame of telling my parents, and I don't want my friends to worry about me(I've always slightly distanced myself from them) even though they say they care. I lied to my doctor at my last check-up. I honestly feel more comfortable venting to a bunch of strangers on the internet. I just can't bring myself to trust others.
I feel so fucking stupid. I don't know what's gonna happen to me. I don't know what I'm gonna do to myself. Things are so hard right now. My heart and my head hurt so much."
"I don’t want to be alive, but i don’t want to die","I hate feeling so alone and i don’t know what to do, so I’m going to crawl into bed, shut my phone off, and i don’t really know why I’m making this post. :/ my thoughts are all jumbled. "

Dead by 18,"I’m sorry if this isn’t the right place to ask but im just not sure where to go, my best friend recently admitted to me he wants to be dead by the time he is 18, we’re both the same age and that’s still a few years away but very frightening nonetheless, apparently he’s had this idea for years now and I’m not sure what do, I know he’s had depression pretty much forever yet he refuses to tell me anything about it and I’m extremely worried about him. I know he’s serious about it when he says he’ll kill himself by the time he’s 18. He’s my best friend and I care about him more than anything. Sorry if this was more of a rant than anything else I just don’t know what to do. how do I convince him not to go through with this?

I feel like I'm just floating in murky water,"Lately I feel like I ruin everything in my life. I'm struggling so much to keep it together, and today I just feel... disconnected. It's a general sense of sadness, sort of like a nagging itch, and I can't motivate myself. However, I need to do some work on a group project that's due tomorrow, and I'm afraid of letting everyone down. On the depression scale, based on my own personal levels of severity, this is only a three or four maybe, but I can't shake it.

&#x200B;

I'm in my 30s, and depression has stolen a large chunk of my life. That's why I'm still trying to get my B.A. while most of my university friends are in their early 20s. I'm going into a very demanding, highly competitive field, and though a part of me has always known that I was meant to do this, lately I'm afraid I won't ever be able to rise above the bullshit. I'm worried I'm gonna fail this class I'm currently in and get kicked out of my school. I had an ""unauthorized withdrawal"" last semester because I was suicidal and had to go to the hospital. Now I'm on academic probation because of it, and I need to talk to an advisor, but I can't get myself to do it.

&#x200B;

I'm just so overwhelmed all the time. I can't enjoy finally living in the place I've wanted to be for decades. I can't have fun with the new friends I'm making, or take advantage of the many things to do around here. And yeah, bad things keep happening to me, which makes functioning a lot more difficult, but I need a way out. I just want to feel better. So much of my life and energy goes into trying to work around this stupid illness, and I'm tired of having to say ""at least it isn't worse."" When can it just be good? I've tried so many things, and sometimes they work for a while, but it's always an uphill battle.

&#x200B;

Anyway, I'm not creating right now, so I guess that's part of it. I need to write. I just can't focus. If only there were a magic pill to make this all go away, but I guess I just have to keep pushing and hoping something changes."
I cam home today on the verge of breaking,"Recently I came to the realisation I was depressed. I've been venting on reddit. I forgot to get off my main to post once and my friend saw one of my posts. I'm so scared, I don't want people to know. I don't want people to know because I cope by running from it. I'm so fucking scared to face it, what do I do here?"
I know what she is feeling and I wanna help,"So, I met a girl this year at uni and I feel like she is drifting away more and more every time I see her. The thing is, I don’t know how to start a conversation about it meanly because she is new at my class. I’ve felt like this before and I know she is suffering more and more every second that passes. I don’t want anyone to suffer what I did and how I did. Can you guys help me?"
I used to think depression wasn't real.,"I beat depression. 3 years ago. Since then I had convinced myself  it wasn't real and I just had to harden up and be thankful for what I had. The 'buck up, get over it' mentality actually worked for me and these past years I've been pretty happy and normal. So far, 2019 right from the get go has been one load of shit after the other, mainly with medical issues. Little by little I've been crumbling at the back of my consciousness. Until a few days ago when I just gave in. I literally fell to the floor, felt a wave of sorrow and let it consume me. I felt like I was giving up and letting go after pushing back for so long. I realised this medical issue makes me think/feel as if my body is against me. 

I also had just returned from a few nights at a holiday house where my sister was getting married and there were a lot of family+friends around. I was pretty excited for the trip, enjoyed it then I think it was coming home, back to everyday routine that get me down harder. Not the first time I've had post vacation blues. I was standing in front of the mirror, brushing my hair, then felt the familiar pain again (from the medical issue). My mind just shut down and I've been wallowing in sadness ever since. I had actually believed depression wasn't real. It's fucking real."
I wanna ask for help but im afraid,I dont know how to describe the feeling i have. Have you ever been so close with someone that you consider them your other half? Only to lose them to suicide. I cant fill the void he left. I can feel the emptyness in my chest. Its been over 2 years and the pain never stops. Ive dealt with depression for a long time but this kind of pain numbs. Its so wierd. lve gotten to the point were im just tired. Tired of getting up every morning. Tired of keeping myself bathed and fed. Tired of doing lifes monotonous tasks. I dont want to hurt myself but im just ready for life to be over. Its not a normal feeling i realized last night. I met someone at a party my friends dragged me to. She made me feel alive for once in a long time. All we did was talk. I want to feel more of that happyness but i dont want to get in the habit of having to rely on someone else to make me feel like a real person. I dont know what to do. Ive had such bad experiences with the psychiatric field and i dont have any body in my life i feel like i can connect with to unload my mind. I feel like ive done everything in my power to better my life and i still feel empty. What do.
A sort of (for a lack of a better term) rant.,"Hey reddit,

I'm here just to get some stuff off of my chest that's been piling in my mind, and it's about time that I got it off (again). I've had ups and downs through 2018 and 2019, I'm in one of the lowest spots I have ever been in my entire life. My anxiety is horrible, and I cant get help since I am to nervous to bother anybody. I'm failing one of my most vital classes due to it, and whatever I do to try and improve it it never seems to go up. Endless bickering and struggle for little to no improvement.

I'm also trapped in terrible friendships. I have a friend who gets mad over the slightest inconvenience and the most I can do is just ride it out. My other friend group is a bunch of reckless people who always try to get a kick out of people and it's starting to rub off onto me. I dont want to cut ties with them since they're pretty much all I've got except for a couple others.

I have had suicidal thoughts, but I have no means to carry out which just makes me miserable. Other than that there are things I want out of life, 1st I wont mention but I want to live in Seattle as soon as I get the chance and find someone who cares for me there.

I cant get into a relationship since My parents disapprove of my choices, and I plan to leave soon so I cant settle down where I'm at, which blows honestly.

I want to get help but I dont want to talk to my parents, since I've tried and they just ignored it.. if theres any way I can get help while avoiding them, itd be appreciated.

Thanks for listening to my long(ish) complaint list. <3"
I only feel safe because my daughter is keeping me alive,"i am really struggling today. i have been battling a bipolar depressive episode for about a month now - triggered by a breakup that keeps breaking me - and I'm running out of the desire to even be here anymore.

background: my ex [32M] and i [27F] dated for almost 3 years, and broke up right at the beginning of October. we share a daughter [1F]. recently, he started dating again... which initially shocked me, and saddened me, but i tried to get through it. but now it has progressed - he started dating another woman right after that, and for some reason, this one just really crushed me. she is smart, and beautiful, kind, and successful - and from what he says, she is very nice. there's nothing to hate about her, and i don't. not even a little bit. i don't hate anything...except my life.

it has felt like one thing after another keeps going wrong, and my emotions are spiraling out of control. over the weekend, i shared some really personal feelings about where i was at with someone. how i still loved my ex, but that i was scared of him sometimes, and i feel like that alone kept me hanging on. i was so afraid of making him angry because of what he might do, that i overcompensated with too much love. but that i saw some really bad sides of him, and i was ashamed to still be in love with him. i shared these feelings with someone who knew i was vulnerable, and got me to open up. i felt like it was safe. i had lost my best friend (him) and didn't know who else i could share these feelings with.

this morning, i learned that screenshots my conversation were sent to his NEW girlfriend. i am devastated and embarrassed. it's like someone published my diary and sent it around to who knows who. he is obviously furious, and read all the things i felt - things i guess i never had the courage to tell him myself. and he cut me off completely. we aren't to have any contact unless it's regarding out daughter.

i understand, i do. i just...i was working so hard on trying to repair our very hurt relationship, and now i feel like we hit rock bottom and there is no salvaging it at all. it breaks my heart, for myself of course, but mostly for my daughter. i never wanted this for her. i don't know what to do.

i almost left work today and killed myself. i was really close. no one would've noticed until i didn't pick my daughter up. no one would've cared. i lost my best friend, and the closest relationship i've ever had. i lost his trust, and his new girlfriend knows personal, intimate feelings about me that i would never want her to know.

i don't know what to do. i have a sleeping, beautiful baby girl in my arms right now. and i am not going to do anything. but oh my god - i want to be done with this life. i am so done.

i did call my therapist today, and we made an appointment. but it doesn't seem soon enough. i don't know what to do. i'm on the edge and jumping sounds so comforting right now. i want this pain to be gone."
"I can't take ""Just hang in there"" any fucking more.","That's all anyone fucking says to me, they don't fucking listen. They don't know what it's like not wanting to wake up in the morning. 

They don't know what it's like always being in mental pain. 

They just don't fucking know, but sure, I'll ""hang in there."""
Suicidal on crane,There's a man in Korea Town Los Angeles sitting on a really high crane right now. Not sure if it has hit news yet
the panic attacks are new,"I've had periods of depression before, but I recently began experiencing panic attacks. My chest and stomach hurt and I feel like I'm dying. It's hard to describe. After, when I'm in a safe place, I'll cry and cry.

Today I got positive feedback from different people, but I still feel depressed and panicky. I don't even understand what's happening to me."
A bunch of high school nonsense,"So a lot in my life is changing and I’m trying out all these new things (don’t get me wrong, is good) but I’m seeing how some people really are like... and it’s hitting me hard. I already have a lot of other stuff that’s making my depression worse in my life, but I had hit a point where something small could really hurt me.

So, let’s get one thing straight, I don’t exactly fit into the popular group. I don’t try too hard when picking outfits or even do my makeup but I decided I was going to look really cute today and try a little bit of a different style. So I got a nice skirt, sweater, and boots, walked out that door, and all the judging ensued. Some people were really supportive (one of my friends could not get over it), but others were just plain rude. 

I know one girl who I don’t thing really likes me but she’s in my friend group so I’m always respectable, and when my friend who absolutely loved my outfit asked her what she thought, and she straight up said “No.” Went off saying that it wasn’t hot enough to wear a skirt, even though it was even too hot for the outfit I had on. But that’s not even the worst of it.

Later in the day, I went to English class, and there was this big group of girls looking at me and laughing (it was really obvious since the rest of the class was being quiet). At first I tried to keep calm, thinking that maybe I was just being paranoid, but honey, I WAS NOT. After class I went to the bathroom and those same girls came in when I was in the stall and started talking to me. Basically the gist of it was “Who does she think she is?” and just making fun of my scratched up boots. It was a little heartbreaking, since I was already having a hard time with stress, and when I came out and they saw me, it was so obvious. 

I mean, people treat you differently by the way you dress, I know, buy why do I even try? I mean, I like looking nice, and I want to experiment with some fashionable outfits that, yes grab more attention, but are super modest (trust me, those girls have worn way worse in colder weather) but all this makes me want to do is stay home. I’ve been bullied before, just for being me, and it hurt, so seeing this happen again is terrifying. And it’s even worse because when girls bully, they don’t go directly for you, they spread rumors and gossip, so it’s more damaging and harder to fix. Listen, I know about half of this sounds super shallow but there’s important stuff behind it, so please be understanding."
How old are you people? I'm almost 30 and I devastated,"In a couple of days i'll reach 30, i'm feeling so bad right now. Every year it's just the same. It's kinda of hard to believe that  I can accomplish anything significant nowadays. I'm feeling too old to make changes, my heart it's just broken. I don't know what else can I do. "
I know my depression is going to push everyone away from me,"I've been struggling with anxiety and depression in the past, with the depression getting much worse in the recent month. To the point where I keep just putting of sleeping because I don't want to face the next day. 

At the moment I'm in my final year of university and living with 7 other girls. We all get along really well but one of them has also been dealing with depression this year. However, her depression is much worse than mine, and she's attempted to overdose a couple of times in the past month. We've all been trying our best to offer whatever support we can but I think it's been very difficult on everyone else's mental health, including my own.

I've also got to see the affect her depression has had on the people around her, no one wants to invite her out because they worry she'll have a depressive episode, they ideally want to avoid her in the house because they worry about what will happen if she's suffering. 

I've not been able to tell anyone in my life that I've been struggling with depression and now I don't know how I can. Everyone wants her to be better but they also don't know how to be around her, and I just can't face having the same fate where all my friends just see me as something to be fixed but avoided.

I've been trying for as long as I can to act like everything's fine and ignore it, but having to keep everything insides feels like its getting too much"
I’m in love with my best friends girlfriend,I am a junior in high school now. I have never been with a girl or even kissed a girl. Not a day goes by where I don’t think and cry about how lonely I am. I have fallen for so many girls and have been nothing but rejected and it just makes me want to die. Me and this girl have been good friends since 7th grade and I never realized I liked her until now. I can really talk and joke around with her. We talk a lot and she is really funny and pretty but the only problem she is dating my good friend. I know I will never have a chance with her and it kills me but it has come to the point where I don’t know if I like her or if I am so fucking lonely that I will fall for any girl that talks to me. I hate myself and constantly think about killing myself and just ending everything. I may not know the reason why I like her but all I know is I want her but I won’t ever have her 
Take the black pill,"I know it's better to convince yourself that you're in control and things can get better, but I can't agree with that, the person I am is exactly the same as how I was when I was 5 years old, literally since we were children you could tell my brother was going to be a chad and I'd be a weird friendless outcast, so how am I supposed to change myself when everything is predetermined, I can't get a solid friend group because I'm unlikeable, I can't get a desirable girlfriend because the only women I can attract are ones with serious mental health/self esteem issues. Those kind of girls treat me like a god but I don't feel anything from it because I've experienced it dozens of times. It's all rigged. Anyway... I watched this movie Paddleton the other day and the ending has made me terrified of death, so I can't kill myself, or maybe that means I don't want it enough?"
Hi I'm depresed,"It comes from my mental illness (Ocd) which changes my lifestyle in a negative way and that in turn leads me to feeling depressed.
Comment whatever you want "
Several people talked to me today and it made my day,"Several different people came up to me to talk to me today just for the sake of talking to me, and it made me the happiest that I’ve been in a long while."
MDD making my life pretty lonely,"I (38F) am currently struggling with MDD. It’s been going on a year now and I still feel like I am in the same place.  It sucks. I have had situational depression a couple times and have always Spring back but it’s harder this time around. 

I started seeing a new psych APRN and we are trying to adjust my meds.  We added in Lamictal, propranolol (for anxiety), magnesium and tapered Cymbalta. While I was on a relatively low dose (40mg) since tapering I feel very “floaty” and want to cry multiple times a day for no reason and I just feel disinterested in EVERYTHING since tapering.
I am supposed to start Rexulti today.  I’m indifferent about this because of the possible weight gain side effect. My son was on a similar med and gained 30lbs in a super short time-period. 

I hate feeling like this, it’s put a strain on my relationships to the point where I have zero patience, zero desire to do anything and just want to be alone. 

I don’t know if I am unhappy with myself, my situation (I work, go to grad school, have 2 kids- one of whom I have 100% custody of and has emotional problems), my relationship with my SO or am just mentally/emotionally spent. I feel like no one understands what I am going through internally and it is very lonely. 

My therapist feels like when my situation is less “complicated” and I can focus on myself things will look up — but I feel like I am dug in a hole & not sure how to even start getting out.

Has anyone else felt this way? Am I wrong in wanting to be alone to just deal with my stuff?"
I went to the gym,Lately ive been so numb and so depressed. im always too self conscious to go to the gym. I was so low yesterday i didn’t even care if people laughed at me. So i went. Nobody laughed at me and i felt way better on my way out. Little things make a difference.
I’m too scared to go to the doctors or see a psychiatrist to know if I have depression,"I’m a teen. I think I have depression but I’ve convinced  myself that I’m just being sad. I get very anxious and I’m very stressed, and that’s why I’m too scared to tell my parents that I think I have depression and I wanted to go to therapy or some shit to see if I do. I really don’t know what to do anymore "
Anyone one just feel voided of all feelings and emotions ? Like I have a girlfriend who loves me but I don't feel anything for her I wouldn't care if she wasn't around or my family or anyone really.,Just only started noticing it recently like I am just neutral if that makes sense I guess this is what a psychopath would be classed as. I just feel only sadness sometimes and misery. I could be told Im the nicest kindest person and it does not mean anything to me I have told people to there faces that I really don't care what there speaking about to me or whats wrong in there lives. How can I shake this and regain some normalised feelings ? Kind of worried I just cant feel happiness or I wont be happy ever again if that makes sense I have been this way on and off now for 20 years so far. I cant hold relationships down as I feel nothing for the person I kind of have to fake emotions if that makes sense. Like if someone says they love me it just does not register with me.

Scared of college,"Currently really depressed about college. My math 100 class doesn’t make much if any sense whatsoever and it feels like no one else around me seems to understand the class. A quarter of the class has taken it before. And even they don’t fully understand it either. I’m going to tutoring 3 hours a week for help but it seems to get me nowhere.
It just seems like this monumental thing that I can’t do anything about and I feel really depressed and deprived of motivation to try because it still doesn’t make sense and I can’t grasp onto anything. 

I guess how do I try and make this problem not be so taxing on me?"
My mom snapped at me.,"The sink in the bathroom I regularly used is broken, so I was going to wash my hands in the kitchen instead where my mom was making dinner.  


She told me not to get in her way a bit disgustedly and I responded with a bit of a grunt and she just blew up at me and I yelled back at her a bit, it ended and we sat at the table when dinner was ready, but I was going to take my food and eat back in my room. She held onto my hand and made me apologize and I said I wouldn't unless she apologized for what she did which she kinda did, I still went back into my room and ate dinner which I knew she wasn't happy about. For whatever reason she hates being wrong about stuff so she just got angry at me going to my room.  


Apparently my dad yelled at her and now they're both upset and I feel like this is my fault now, I think I'm gonna go sleep or binge watch something I don't feel great after all this."
Getting off the interne. -wondering if anyone else feels this way,"As much as the internet is a nice place to find whatever you need, kill time, etc., I've realized that the internet is really a horrible place to be when you're feeling vulnerable and terrified.

I've dropped off of most social media and websites now, only using a few sites sparingly and isolating myself technologically has been wonderful. It feels weird not keeping up with the news all the time, but i do not miss other forms of social media at all. R/depression and r/anxiety are the only places i generally go on here anymore.

Work is dragging on and I just want to leave and cry myself to sleep. "
queer/disabled/mentally ill with no friends,"This became really long, sorry, it just came pouring out of me. Also please be warned for mentions of suicide/physical/sexual abuse.


I just turned 28 and I have no friends, no job, no family save my mom who I live with. I have chronic pain, fatigue, and mental issues like social anxiety, depression, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, and CPTSD that have prevented me from getting a job or finishing university. 


I'm trans male/nonbinary and gay. I spent most of my 20s transitioning. I slowly cut off all high school friends because they made me feel awful about myself. I am an empath/hsp and i can't handle casual friendships or people who don't understand me and project their bullshit onto me/treat me badly. So I have a lot of trust issues.


I'm highly introverted, but I am not socially awkward and don't have trouble understanding social cues so I have ruled out autism for myself. 


I was going to go to two two-year intensive art programs when I was 20 - one for fine art and one for musical theatre, but that all went out the window when I developed PMDD (pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder) and could no longer attend school. That same year I realized I was a gay man so I had to deal with gender dysphoria too until I finally 'finished' transition at 24-25ish. I'm in a weird position for a trans person in that I take both birth control pills and testosterone injections. This has made doctors freak out on me about developing serious medical problems but I have not thus far. They have also given me grief about wanting to have natural children if I am able to someday. This makes me feel isolated from the trans community as well.


I've never been in a relationship (unless you count really fucked up ones that were either statutory rape or with someone who couldn't admit their feelings for me and gaslit me into making me feel like i was delusional for thinking we had mutual love for each other when he clearly displayed this interest.). On top of that, I fear that i will never be in one due to being trans/nonbinary and assume most cisgender gay/bi men won't be interested in me.


I have abuse on both sides of my family. Both parents were physically/sexually abused as children by their parents/siblings. My father hasn't been in my life since I was 18. My mom and I no longer speak to any family, we couldn't go on ignoring the abuse or those who enabled the abuse. My paternal uncle is in prison for murder and may be a pedophile too. Both sides also have alcoholism and depression/anxiety. Luckily neither of my parents drink, or have ever physically or sexually abused me. But the abusive legacy, especially as an empath, still affects me immensely.


I am on many medications. I developed severe depression when i was 11 years old, triggered by intense, systematic bullying by former friends. Most of my medications have helped me, but a recent one has made me develop many awful side-effects that magnify my preexisting issues and made me gain 30lbs in less than a year. I am currently trying to quit this particular drug but the withdrawal symptoms have been very difficult as I have to stagger lowering the doses very slowly.


I came closest to killing myself when I was 22. I remember crawling on the floor, trying to physically stop myself from going upstairs and swallowing all of my pills or stabbing myself to death. I never made a full attempt beyond that.


I have since mostly had passive suicidal thoughts. I don't think I'll ever attempt again, but my life seems so empty, isolated, and hopeless that I sometimes wish I could. That's a weird thought.


But I don't want to die because I don't want to do that to my mother. She is the only person in my life who cares about me. She is my best friend and I would be nowhere without her. But I need more than that. I feel like I am leeching off of her because I have no financial independence and often need her help due to my health issues.


The friends that I have had since high school ended have been almost exclusively online. But even they are unreliable and one is my 'ex' (gaslighting person mentioned above) so it's a gamble whether I will even have someone to talk to online at all on any given day. And if I do it's rarely a mutual conversation. I always take on people's problems and they rarely ever ask about mine or seem to care. I have two friends who do (most of the time) but they are very busy and only occasionally have time to talk to me, they also live alternately in the UK and east Asia and I am in Canada so time differences also come into play.) I have tried to make new online friends but even that has become very scary for me/triggers my SA awfully. I don't even know how I'm writing this post at all. "
Lamcital- Rash,I thought maybe some of you all might have experience with this medication. I started taking lamictal a week ago. My doctor warned me about if a rash occurs to stop taking immediately. A few days ago my skin started peeling a lot on my nose and chin. It’s not really now because I pulled the pieces off. [my chest](https://imgur.com/a/SlUprp1) is also kinda dry as well but not like my face was. Should I be concerned? 
Looking for advice in breaking out of a cycle of not making changes that I need to make,"Hi everyone. I've been stuck in a bit of a rut that has lasted awhile this time, and has really gotten worse lately.

I feel like I'm fairly self aware of what is making my life so shitty, and I've got a decent idea of things I could do to change. The problem is that I continue to not do these things. I either rationalize, procrastinate, or just conciously or unconsciously distract myself from actually doing what I need to do. I've also got a real problem with just taking the easy way out of something, even when I know it's the wrong way to deal with things.

Just as an example: I'm self-employed so I get to set my own schedule. The freedom of that is great sometimes, but it also means that I'm solely responsible for making myself do the work I need to do.

As a result, I've really fucked up my sleep schedule. I just wind up bingeing TV shows and sometimes drinking too much at night and before I know it, its 3, 4 , 5am or later and I've fucked another day.

I always tell myself at the start, eh, I'll just watch an episode or two, or have a beer or two and then I'll finally get to bed at a decent time. Then I'll tell myself, ehh, one more episode is only half an hour, that really won't interfere with tomorrow (or just one more beer). Then maybe I'll not be paying attention and by the time I notice, I just rationalize as ""well I'm already fucked so it doesn't matter if I keep going at this point""

The thing is, I can often watch myself doing this. I'm aware in the moment that I'm making a bad decision. But I usually either just ignore that, or find some other way to rationalize my bad decision making. And I know alcohol makes this worse, but it still happens when I'm dead sober.

This doesn't just apply to this one example, I do similar things when it comes to me trying to socialize more, or exercise, see a therapist etc. etc. I pretty much keep doing this in all areas of my life that I need improvement, and constantly failing to change things just brings on more shame/guilt/self-loathing that makes it even harder to find the motivation and willpower to do what I need to do.

I know the solution is just to stop doing these things. But after having told myself time and time again ""ok I'm not going to do this today"" and then just repeating the same routine, that I've gotta figure out a different strategy. 

I get that breaking habits is hard, and that this a common side effect and perpetuator of depression. But I also know that people are capable of and HAVE broken out of similar cycles. So if you've made it through this long winded post and have any advice, I'd love to hear it."
Drugs,"So this might get taken down but I'm hoping someone out there has a tip before it does.

What drugs have helped you with depression when used responsibly.

I've tried Phenibut, and it works but only on the days I take it. Tolerance creeps up and I have to take days off of course or I'll get addicted. The first day off is usually fine but the second or third is just anger, frustration, depression, self hatred. All the usual suspects.

Heard of tianpetine and trying to get some to try that out.

I will 100% kill myself in the next 5 years if I don't get a good enough job to afford treatment, or find something to actually live for (which likely doesn't exist for me).

I've tried everything that people mention. For real, you name it I've tried it.

Drugs are the last good option."
Today I realized I am depressed due to being heartbroken,"I had to see the person who flipped a switch and pulled the rug underneath me and decided they no longer wanted to be with me. It was the biggest heartbreak of my entire life mainly because it was such a deep connection and I really thought I had found my person. He totally changed and went cold, all the sweet things he said and the way he acted changed.

Seeing him today as strangers not saying a word to each other, killed me inside. I honestly have never been this sad from anything in my life. I've cried so much and I just want this feeling of sadness gone. Any tips? I dont want to take medication. "
Took a positive action but then realised that no one cares,"Hi guys, thought I'd share...so I've been struggling since the start of the uni year with mental health issues. It's difficult for me to understand my feelings because this is the first time I've felt like this...basically have no desire to get out of bed and do anything with my life etc. ...anyway I decided to go and see a GP (doctor) to talk things through and see what help I might need. This was a big thing for me and I was pretty anxious about it.

After a literally 5 minute discussion he basically said 'so I don't think you're depressed, here's the number for counselling if you want it'. Surely there's no way he could have accurately assessed my mental health that quickly? Sure I may/may not be clinically depressed but he didn't even listen to what I was saying.

This just drove it home for me that *literally no one* cares. Perhaps I'm expecting too much, idk. Should I just stop expecting people care whatsoever? And I know docs have to deal with a lot, but I ended up feeling worse afterwards than when I went in."
Nothing makes me happy any more,"So, I used to have some serious case of depression, to point of suicidal, after 2 or so years, I somehow managed to pull myself out of it, i got myself on track and was doing ok for a long time - sure everything wasn't the best, it was far from it, but I enjoyed my time.

But, last night I broke down and realised its back, i sat in my chair in my room at university and cried, i sat there for a while bawling, contemplating everything and just wanted to disappear, but I am refusing to let myself go back down into this pit of sh*t. And trying desperately to find ways to get me to smile.

But i cant, and that is how it fully dawned on me that I'm lost. I am totally and completely lost and right now i am laying in bed, not moved at all, missed an entire day of classes, and barely ate anything - I don't know what to do.

I want to find something that can make me smile, make me stop feeling like a piece of shit and make me want to actually be motivated, to make me want to do fking something with my life... but i can't even find something that i want to do - what i used to love to do isn't even doing it for me, and i can't bring myself to speak to my friends let alone my family.

And as i said, i can't, and i don't even know where to look next, I'm not sure if i should even stay in university - i don't even know what i want to do when i wake up in the morning.

Is there anything you guys know, anything that can help me find something or someone, just, a tip will do... please anything, i don't want to go down this road again and I'm terrified of this sh*t and what will happen."
losing interest in people as soon as it begins,"What is it that when someone I've been interested in takes interest in me I instantly lose it? It annoys me that a guy I've been on a date with last night (and had a really nice time) texts me the next day (edit: and again 3 days later and I'm still not responding to him) Well I'm old now (sorry. for me. I'm almost 23) and never been with anyone (the full sex way, or a relationship. Some experience has been had.). Maybe I'm too used to being single? It's just so relaxing. Not having to give a damn about more people than my friends? Maybe I'm scared of the 'full sex thing""? Maybe I'm asexual if I'm not interested in anyone once they like me? It's just a wonder.

I don't know. Do You?

I don't know which group this post belongs to I'm going to try here. "
How can I help?,"TLDR: How can I help and support my depressed fiancé?

My fiancé has recently become very depressed and anxious. There are a combination of things which have caused this to come to a head: being a mature student at university, getting married in July, money, life. I get it. I really do.

Tbh, he has been truly awful recently and a complete emotional rollercoaster to be with (one day he loves me, next day he doesn't). But I know all that is down to his mental health and is not the real him. I love him so much and I know that the happy, loving guy I fell in love with is in there somewhere. So, although it would be much easier for me (and would save my MH from deteriorating too) if I left him, but I can't do that. I want to support him through this.

So what can I do to help? Should I listen? Put up with the crap? Challenge the crap? Give advice? Force him to be motivated? Leave him alone in his down times? What is the best way to be supportive?

Thanks for reading."
I want to cry but can't,"It physically hurts, i just want it to stop. I dreamed about my death and in my dream everyone thought that i was being over dramatic. My mom thinks that I use my depression to get out of doing chores. I cant live feeling like this. "
Anyone else just not want to be alive,Not killing myself or anything like that because I know people care about me but I just want to remove all existence of me and no one would think anything is amiss
"I let it all hit me, but I didn’t give in.","So I’ve been having some doubts and anxieties eat at me for while now, and last week it all just hit me hard. Every nasty thought, every vile comment from the voices in the back of my mind came to the forefront and I basically broke down. I had a day to myself, and just let it all out.

I sat and cried for hours; telling myself that I deserved to be made fun of, to be abandoned by my friends, to be alone for the rest of my life, to never figure things out. Things aren’t necessary great in my life, but they’re not bad either. It could be worse all things considered. I get scared when I let these things hit me because I don’t know what to think after I’ve experienced them. I’m on my fourth day of “recovery” now since then, and I haven’t given in. "
Have you ever gotten used to being alone then when you briefly meet someone really nice who then disappears again it feels like life just pulled the rug out from under you?,"I used to think I was content with being depressed, I've felt it for so long that I just decided to embrace it and give up socialising or reaching out.

Then when you meet someone really nice briefly you are reminded on what you're missing out on in life and just feel like shit for ages afterwards, I'm sick of feeling that. I feel like I'll always be nomadic with relationships and friendships and just endlessly drift through life alone.

It's weird, some days I can give advise, tonight though I don't really feel too good. I know I just have to push on with life but it doesn't half get lonely being me. "
The more I get out of depressiob,"Thr more I understand why i was depressing my emotions...the world is a sad place.I starded a course 2 motn ago after years of isolation... Pretty surr half my school has mental illnesss.. I made friends with people in my class 1 of them had memorie problems becauze of an accident 4 years ago... He abruptly left the course because he couldnt learn... Ill probably never see him again:( another guy is 40 years old and had alcohol problems... hes alway studying alone and hes a bit weird and talk alot... some people start to talk behind his back because hes weird... I pity everyone and myself... I was better with no feelings i think.
"
Idek,A massive wave of depression just hit me today and I don’t even know where to begin. I don’t know who to talk to because no one cares and I’m such a nuisance to everyone. I can’t even pin point why I’m feeling this way. Just everything is crashing down on me at once. But I think the biggest thing making me sad right now is that I don’t think I will ever find love. I’m 18 and I’ve never had a bf before and I don’t think I ever will find my true love. And I’m going to college soon and I know no one will like me and I’ll be a failure. I am so ugly and suck at everything I do and I don’t even know why I’m writing this. I’m just so sad and have no one to talk to 
I feel lost.,"After going to therapy for a while, being on Prozac for months, and being out of my classes for a long time, I don't know what to do anymore.
I feel completely numb now, if anything good happens it doesn't affect me. I saw a man almost overdosed on heroin today and I didn't feel affected. Nothing affects me anymore. I just feel so depressed all the time, I feel gross. I am so disconnected from myself and my life.
Have I turned into a heartless person? My therapist asked me a question I've been asking myself for years, ""Why do I think I deserve this?"". I am meeting with her again on Thursday and I don't even know what to say. I don't know where to go from here.
I smile and laugh but it's all fake. I don't want my family to worry.
I'll take any advice, please help me."
Lost and alone.,"I have no idea what am I doing in life. Where do go. I am coming from small place in Bosnia, born as younger child at the very beggining of civil war. Brother moved out and lives in his place, while I stayed with parents. I droped college after coming back from Work and Travel program in USA. Coming from poor country and living ""normal""  life in USA for a while, then coming back to this shit hole fucked me up. I worked and helped to support my family since I was 15. I was even working on cruise ships, but had to quit after I injured my leg. Now I am unemployed, my father can not work because is suffered a lot during the war and have PTSD, depression, my mother is supporting us. My grandfather had a stroke few days ago, and will need terapy, which we can not afford. I feel lost, hopeless. No skills or talents, no will to go on. I need advice, help, something, idk what..."

I have nothing to live for. I really should just end it.,"I suffer from various mental illnesses. My father passed away a few years ago. He cared for me more than anyone else.

I just go to do my airport work, and come home... for what? There's nothing in the future I'm looking forward to.

The only thing that's stopping me at the moment is that I don't have any reliable tools to do so. Every method I currently have access to has a significant chance of just leaving me alive as a cripple."
physical and emotional pain?????,"when you’re feeling really down, does your chest physically hurt, or your throat? because it happens to me a lot and it hurts,,, so,,, bad an dit makes me feel worse :("
Wish teachers would do something instead of yelling at me,"Every fucking day is the same. I wake up. Takes me 15 minutes to get out of my bed. I don't get to eat and I barely have time to wash my hair and brush my teeth. Lesson starts and I loose focus after 10 minutes. The teachers ask me if I could repeat that sentence. Of course I can't. He gets mad and asks me what I'm thinking about. I just tell him that I don't feel good, but in reality I try to find the best way to kill myself. Then there's lunch break. I have at most 2 people I talk to and I still have trouble entertaining them and keeping a conversation. Then I see other people talking to each other and I ask myself how the fuck they can keep a conversation for that long. Another lessons starts. Still the same shit. I can't remember anything for god sake and I have to do my best understanding a single sentence. "
"Just a long attention seeking, self pitying rant that couldn't find anywhere else to post. So delete away if inappropriate. Not like I care anyway.","What's the point?

Seriously what's the fucking point. 
I had everything at 21 completely wrote off my bucket list I accomplished everything I wanted to and more.

Now. Well self destruction, laziness, stupid decisions now in my 30's with nothing.

I had money a career, I was freakishly fit I could of turned into a professional boxer or athlete my fitness was ridiculous.

But nope, instead I make stupid decisions, I become lazy and unambitious or motivated, I become fat and lazy.

I fuck everything up. 
My therapist says, its in the past, I didn't know any better, I'm willing to change.
So I say this which is probably the only comparison I can think of;
Would you be OK to be around or want to be around or date a pedophile but that pedophile hasn't harmed or had a desire to harm a child? 
Maybe in the past when they were younger they looked at things they shouldn't have but are not a danger in real life?

Why would you? They are still carrying that darkness.


I get sectioned, go on anti psychotics, end up on a DBT group which will probably be a waste of time.

Either I don't want to get better, I like being this self pitying useless person, or I just don't want to do anything or have an interest in getting better.

That's fine but I have a dad that works hard , has his own problems, getting on I'm age and all the shit that goes off in his life he has to worry about me, stressing over me if I don't answer a phone call because he is worried in case I harm myself or worse.

With all that I just feel like a fraud.
My cousin killed himself. He was my best friend, who taught me to box, who would take me camping, who was incredibly intelligent and seen the world in this amazing way, it was to me  jaw dropping. even at a young age he had incredible philosophy, he could work out complex arithmetic in seconds, he could read a book on any subject and he would take it in like a sponge he had dozens of friends he could build almost anything from scratch, robotics, cars, radios, computer programs.

He's fucking gone and I'm here.

I couldn't even kill myself after failed atempts then got sectioned.
 I even pretended I tried to kill  myself.
I even took an overdose and phoned emergency services straight after it.

I hate myself, Im a fraud and I don't belong or deserve any happyness.
Then again I could be just saying all this because I'm a pathetic attention seeker.

I probably don't even want to get better, I just want to die without killing myself.

I'm a sad pathetic person.

What even happens when I'm gone, is that it just nothingness, out like I'm a light switch, a computer.
What happens to everyone left behind.
Does it even matter? 
Why would it. Why should it.

I can't even do basic shit like clean up, my fucking place could easily contend with anything on r/neckbeardnests

Maybe I'll just live like a self pitying bitch until a point of no return.
My dad and step mother get so stressed out their relationship fails and my dad dies of a heart attack from the complete worry he has over his sad pathetic manipulative 30+ year old man-child.

I don't feel that ""looking forward to the future"" feeling, no hope, no desire, no ambition, no hobbies, no interests, no motivation.

I'm never going to get better, there is probably nothing wrong with me other than to grab attention and play victim.

Doesn't matter if I want to change or capable of changing.
I'm poison just a sad petty poisonous person.

I need someone I can talk to,"It feels like I'm falling into a depression again or I'm just not healed from last years depression.
I'm not sucidal but I just don't wanna live. I have nothing to look forward to, don't like my job and constantly dealing with overthinking things.

Last year, I met a guy(who I later fell in love with but never admit my feelings to him), things has changed and now we don't talk to each other anymore. I miss him and I don't know what to do. I don't wanna put myself in a position where I write to him and he leaves me at ""Read"". That would totally break my already broken heart.

Music can be so so helpful,"Throwaway account because I have a friend who knows about my profile and I’m not comfortable with them knowing...

I don’t know if posts like this have been made before or get made very often but I just really want to share this since it’s helped me so much. 

I’ve been struggling for some time, it’s been years now and progressively things got worse, I started to notice it more and I fell into a pretty bad stage. I’m lucky enough to have a good family, good friends etc... and I know everyone may not have that and may be in a worse place than I was/am, however, Music has really helped me.

I recently started listening to music again after having dropped the habit for many months (when things were at their worst and we’re getting worse), and it has lifted my morale, made me more productive and able to actually do things. Things have become way less cloudy and I’m feeling more optimistic.

When I first started listening to music again things were as bad as ever, I’d lie in bed, doing absolutely nothing, feeling useless, wishing I was out doing something, while listening to music on my speaker. At one point I even thought: “man, I’m ready to end it, there’s nothing to stop me”. But I didn’t, I kept listening to music and soon I turned it into listening to music while doing revision for my exams, or listening to music while doing exercise. It started slowly but simply listening to music has kind of turned my life around.

Whatever music is good for you, just give it a go, for me it was Australian rock, indie rock, alternative rock etc... I was recommended a band and I kept finding more and I love them! 

I’m sorry if this is something cliche or not meant to be posted here but I really wanted to share this as picking up the simple habit of listening to music again has really played a big part in turning things around for me and I think it could help people here.

TL;DR - After not listening to music for months (caused by my condition), I started again and it slowly lifted my mood and allowed me to be more productive. Please give it a go.



"
The only reason I’m alive is so that I don’t upset others. Not sure if this is sustainable anymore.,"I have no reason to live for myself. My once fulfilling career now barely allows me to pay my bills. I have no hobbies anymore because I don’t enjoy anything. My only happiness in life is my relationship. I used to be a musician, paint, be good at video games, kayak, ride my bike, and go hiking often. I hate it all now. Whenever I attempt anything, I would just rather be in bed. I don’t even like watching movies or eating food. I used to love makeup, but I haven’t worn it in months.

My life is doing things for others. The only reason I go to work is because my boss needs me there and I don’t want to let him down. My only purpose is to work and drive everyone around. My boyfriend does martial arts and has hobbies, but I don’t, and I end up just being his support system and chauffeur to his martial arts classes. I love him and want him to feel happy and fulfilled, but I wish I had that. 

My birthday just passed and my boyfriend took me out, which was nice. He’s a great partner. It really made me feel depressed that my coworkers bailed on my bday plans for the second year in a row. I understand they had more exciting things to do, but they don’t realize how badly I need the friendship of other people outside of my relationship.

I don’t even have friends anymore. I’ve been trying to make new friendships for months, but I don’t fit in anywhere. People think I’m strange and I just don’t “click” with anyone. I spent years avoiding making friends so that it would be easier to disappear, but I changed my mind.. now it’s just too late I guess.

The only reason I’m here is so that nobody grieves over me. I really wish nobody loved me at all so I could just disappear.

I can’t afford a psychiatrist. Every time I save money, something happens to my car or I need it for a health reason, or some other kind of emergency. Even on a sliding scale, I can’t afford it. Zoloft is the only treatment that has ever helped me. I wish so badly that I could afford to see a psychiatrist regularly.

Although that does seem pointless.. things get better for a while and then I just wind up back here. Every time."
"I need some advice , i feel like my brain is ruined","Won't bother making a throwaway

I am 18 and on Zoloft 50mg for a year and a half , it was not that bad in the past and it helped my OCD , but the last 1 month, especially the past few weeks (same dosage)  I am getting sooo fucked 

I feel dizzy , disoriented and dreamlike all the time , I start to get depressed again and to have weird thoughts , I want to cease existing , I will never live a normal life , it begins to affect my relationships with people , I am getting really dissapointed with everything

I also experience Existential crisis which doesn't help , am I even real?Those thoughts are a burden

I’m going to try and kill myself again,It’ll ruin my relationship and people’s trust and my parents thinking I’m finally stable but fuck it what have I got to lose. If I die Id be finally free from this disgusting ugly mortal sack that’s lonely. I’ve got nobody hur my boyfriend who I don’t even think loves me anymore just because my incesurities and mental health gets in the way of everything in my life. I won’t ever be able to be independent in my life. I don’t know if I’m fully cis and that’s terrifying I want to be normal if I can’t be normal and attractive then I’d rather be dead. I’m lazy and worthless and talentless I’m a burden on this earth and I know it because nobody cares enough. I make eveyeone I know and love feel worse and I have like fucking 3 reasons to live and I can barely hold on any longer.

How much damage am I doing by punching myself in the head?,"I keep punching myself in the head whenever I can't take it anymore.

Today I tried to kill myself,I tried to slit my wrist but I just couldn't get deep enough. I'm too dumb for everything even to kill myself. 
I don’t know how to deal with this,"I was 8 when I first told someone I hated life. I’m 19 now and have had a very bad major depressive break every year for most of the year but this is the worst it’s ever been. Every possible way you can feel bad, I feel it, it doesn’t even make sense. To be honest I need someone in my life, a girlfriend. I’ve never had a close relationship with anyone. A lot of girls like me, I’m good looking and charismatic, I just haven’t for whatever reason gotten past the initial friend phase and get close to someone. I’m not exaggerating. I have broke down and cried three times today and I don’t know how to keep going. 

Everything was going perfect until about a month ago where it was one thing after another till I was left with nothing. I swear the same shit happens every year and just gets worse. I have no motivation to do anything and am limited because I am technically disabled. I wake up in the middle of the night because my brain won’t let me fall asleep. I just sit there in agony waiting for it to stop. I don’t even know what to do. I feel like I will go insane if I have to deal with this any more. I don’t like most people but damn do I need someone now, and I sure as hell respect people who put themselves forward for someone else. "
Living while being dead,"To whoever takes the time to read that,

I need to write the things in my head tonight. Because I am just another obnoxious human being, so it seemed right to publish them online. And here we are. 

I don’t feel alive anymore, I just feel like a broken soul in a living body. And I feel so alone.. all the time, wherever I am, with whoever I am. 

I have no wish to live, no hopes and no goal whatsoever. I am just waiting for death, basically. 

I don’t want to be happy. I don’t want to try because it requires spending energy that I don’t have.  I’ve tried, and it’s just not worth the effort. Why would I bother anyway?

My only “goals” are to try to keep my life bearable until I die and to avoid dying in a painful way.

I am not suicidal, even if i think about it sometimes. I am too afraid to die to kill myself. I am afraid of how it could/will be painful... 
 and I am afraid of how it will end everything. I am just an useless coward. Also, like many others on this sub, I don’t want my mom to live that. She’s great. She’s done her best for everything. She has been and is giving everything her family... it would hurt her too much... it would make her think that she’s done something wrong... I love her too much to choose to let her live without me.

It’s been 2 years that I feel dead now. I’ve always been suffering from depression and anxiety. But it’s at another level now. 

2 years ago a guy broke me and I think it’s not fixable. To be fair, it’s not entirely his fault. He probably just accelerated the self destruction process that was already on in my head and that would have happened at some point anyway. He just crashed my hopes and goals a bit faster than the “normal” rate. I am not grieving our relationship anymore. Although I still wish everything didn’t happen the way it did from time to time.

One of my friend told me I should get help. But for what? I know I CAN be happy. I just don’t want to. Life is ugly and I don’t want to try to see it in another way.

Sometimes I feel happy... but it never lasts. My brain doesn’t let me be happy for long. It’s ok because I only take it as it comes. I never try anyway.

I’ve tried therapy before and I don’t want to do it anymore. I think that  they can’t fix someone who doesn’t want to be happy. And I don’t. 

I hate myself so much, I hate being alive, or just existing. 

I am just stuck here. Dead in a living body.

"
Well big oof,Seeing 2 of your best friends hang out without you on the day a year after your dad died and not even try to invite you is fun but that’s just how life is ig :))))))))
‘Why would you rather be dead?’ I get asked a lot,"In a round about way here is my answer, 

In 2008 a low budget film, called ‘Submarine’ came out here in the UK. Filmed in my hometown, the soul reason I wanted to watch it. 

It’s about a borderline autistic teenage boy. He makes this observation;

If you asked someone about me while I was alive. The response would be ‘he’s okay’ ‘he’s a dick’ ‘never really spoken to him’. The kid being a loner, a bit like me. 

“But I sometimes fantasise my death, local news reports, candle lit tributes, everyone says nice things about me”

Nothing bad happened to this kid for this bleak view of the world. He just saw death and it’s place in society for what it is, and this observation is what I believe we call depression.

"Never felt like a human, cause noone ever treated me as one.","Even if you're the most selfless person in this world, you need something to live for. I don't know, maybe that's just how I feel. I've never felt like a human, for all my life people used me, treated me like shit and when things got good they just abandoned me. I might be available for someone almost throughout the whole day - but they won't even spare a minute for me. I don't know, maybe I'm needy, maybe I'm just a selfish person. I'll listen to them, I'll do whatever it's possible for me to do so to be there for them, I'll even forget myself when someone needs me or I'd feel like they could use some help or maybe some support. But I don't know where I've gone wrong, I thought maybe they would do the same for me. But nobody ever did the same or just fraction of what I've done for them. I know, I shouldn't be hoping for them to return the favor. I just wanted someone to listen, just someone to care, just not to laugh at me, just treat me as a human being.

Love, care, affection - I don't know how these feels. Fucking hell, I don't even know how a hug feels, nobody ever gave me one, nobody ever even held my hand.

I feel unwanted. I'm disgusted by myself. I hate this life and I wish I could die just right now. "
I feel very lonely,"Hey guys, so basically i broke up from my girlfriend of 2 years about 3 months ago due to some stupid reasons that seemed valid enough for her to end it all, and anyways we didnt speak at all until 1 week ago she messaged me and we started to talk for a couple days and she brought up the subject of ""getting back together"" and I want to get back with her but she said again that she didnt want to even tho she brought it up herself. Anyways, I really loved this girl, she was there for me everytime i felt depressed and had suicidal thoughts, she was the most beautiful, the smartest, and she was the first person I would go to when I needed anything. She made me happy, just her being by my side was enough for me and I didnt want anything else in the world. But now we are broken up and I am very lonely, I miss her so much, I miss having her by my side, I miss having someone I could go to talk with after a rough day. I have nobody now, she was the only person I had. I really dont have anyone to talk with, to share feelings, to count on. I have my male friends but I could never talk to them, its different when you open up to boys, I could never do it. Ive always opened up to girls. And I just feel so lonely, I want someone to be for me, and of course someone I could be for them. But I cant seem to find one. I dont really attract anyone, I feel that I disgust females. It seems that I'm mistaking this sub for a dating site but no, I just have been feeling so depressed these days and I dont know what to do, I dont have anyone to talk about this. I just cant seem to be happy. I just cant. "

Lost job due to depression a few months ago. Been trying to get another career and just got turned down for a job I really wanted. Trying to move past it. Venting I guess.,"I guess the following will be just me trying to cope with getting rejected from yet another job. I’ve been rejected from a lot of jobs in the past few months but this one really hit hard and seems like the straw that is breaking the camels back. 

I quit my job months ago after a year of the organization investigating me because I told a coworker I suffered from depression and thoughts of suicide. The coworker told my bosses and I was deemed unfit for duty. 

So, I quit my career after 11 years and decided it was best to resign rather than to spend money and fight to keep my job through litigation. I probably would’ve lost that battle anyway. So to save face and avoid termination I stepped aside. 

Fast forward to just an hour ago I had received an email from a company for a job that I’ve been obsessing over even telling people I was certain I’d get. It was a teaching job and I was excited at the notion of a career change and working with children. I drove 2 hours for a day long interview and though it went really well and for whatever reason they decided I was not the right candidate. 

So needless to say all I want to do is sleep and feel sorry for myself all day. Naturally the rejection also puts my 11 years of experience in my field, bachelors degree, military service into serious question. 

I have a home, daughter, wife and of course crippling debt that’s just there and I can’t seem to catch a break. So yeah. Thanks for reading this. I don’t know what more to do. "
Is there even a point to life when no one likes you?,"To make things short, no one has ever liked me [19/M] in any way ever. I've never ""belonged"" to any friend group. By that I mean, I'll go out with the group, but I'll never get any invites to go hang out with only a few members of the group, and I'm always the last to know about anything if I ever get to know at all. I'm sure it's not intentional, but I feel left out as fuck all the time. My family (extended too) has always made it clear to me that my younger siblings (younger brother in particular) were always more important to them than me. In fact, some days I'm pretty sure they forget I exist. They hate me, and have since I was born. 

I've tried changing so much about me, my interests. I've gotten into things simply for the purpose to feel more included but nothing works. I have my own hobbies I'm in decent physics shape. I have a job and I go to school for a pretty respectable major too (Comp Sci). I volunteer my time and my money pretty often, I always play therapist for people. Everyone always talks to me about their problems, but God forbid I reach out to them. 

But no one fucking likes me, no matter what, ever since I was a kid. I can't point to anybody in my life past or present and say they were my best friend. 

I don't wanna be 40+ and have no one at all. That thought kills me inside, but it's looking like the probable outcome here. Of course things could happen but I don't have a lot of faith that things will.    I don't see any point in continuing this cold lonely life of mine, if no matter what I do people don't like me even a little bit. I don't even want a a girlfriend or anything, I just want a friend, an irl friend, who actually wants to be my friend and cares about my well being.  

Fuck man, why did I end up with this life"
I would love to kill myself today,It pisses me off that so many people will laugh and gloat about it but at least I’ll be gone 
Need a reason to live,All my life I've been causing pain and suffering to the people who loved me..and I'm unintentionally ruining people's happiness and their life's... honestly I Don't even wanna live anymore.. I've been hoping if there's any reason for me to live my life and not to end it ... if anyone going though such situations or they overcame this stage of feeling please help me get past it..if anyone thinks I'm unworthy to live please share your thoughts also... I'm not looking for any sympathy or anything I don't have anyone else to talk to that is the reason I'm turning strangers for suggestion 
Alcohol currently the only thing i look forward to.,"I go through my weeks only thinking about the next friday and saturday when i can drink my ass off. I usually start drinking around 6 in the evening until about maybe 10 in the morning but it depends on when i pass out. Then i repeat it on saturday. 

Im only truly happy when im drunk. Even if i get a mental breakdown later it's still worth it for that moment of happiness. Pretty sure my future is fucked"
Do you hate yourself?,I sure as fuck do. I know this is terrible but it makes me feel so alone to see other people doing well and im just here feeling like a human sack of shit. I hate myself more than i hate anything in the world. Does anyone else feel like this? 
Happy it is only 5 more weeks,Only 5 more weeks until I don’t have to be in school surrounded by judgemental assholes. I really think yhis group of girls are kind of like picking on me and making fun of me. All I try to be is nice. Only 5 more weeks of it. Girls suck. I am a 26 year old man around 21 year old girls. Some of them that I find attractive just kind of make fun of me. It real hurts me. I just don’t like it. They are total jerks.
Switching from Mirtazapine/Remeron to Valdoxan/Agomelatine - anyone else?,"Just wondered if anyone else did this switch. Mirt works great for me except... weight gain/carb craving. I dont want to have to diet so giving Valdoxan a go. At the moment 7.5mg mirt and 25mg valdoxan as i taper off of 15mg mirt.  So far its ok, dont sleep as well as i did on mirt but ok. Dreams are a bit weird but manageable.

Just wondered if anyone else had this experiene and how it worked out for them

Thanks"
Anyone else feel guilty that they have things going for them but at the same time jealous of people who are doing better?,I feel like I don’t deserve the things that I have right now because they don’t make me happy at all but for some fucking reason I’m irrationally angry that other people have more than me. It’s so fucked
Looking for life advice.,"I spend a lot of time on reddit and I've read many wise people's opinions on other posts. I'm looking for some advice of my own. I'm in my mid 20s at this point and I feel like I haven't accomplished much with my life. I hate my current job but I don't have any real skills, so I don't know what I could transition into. I live with my parents, and they don't even hide the fact that they are disappointed in me anymore. I also feel pretty disappointed in myself. I know it's not productive to spend all my time regretting doing nothing with my life, but I don't really know how to move forward. The only hobby I have is video games, and I just don't get as much out of them as I used to. I've never liked any of the sports I used to play so I don't want to get back into that. I have no idea how to spend my time productively and I'm just not passionate about anything. I know I'm depressed, and I have no energy either. I sleep 12 hours most days because I can't think of a reason to get out of bed, and I feel tired all the time. I could spend all day listing more problems but I think if I could get the ball rolling on this one I'd be able to tackle my other issues. I guarantee other people were in similar situations, and I'd like to know how they saved themselves from themselves. I'd like to know what career paths, activities, habits, and/or hobbies that I could pick up to give my life meaning."
I was driving home from school and almost decided to just pass my exit.,"I was driving home and this has happened a few times where I think about just driving past my exit and keep driving.

What if your bad day is everyday?,"I see all these mental health posts which say things like “self care ideas for bad days,” or “coping on a tough day.” But what do you do if your bad day is everyday? One after the other after the other...for years. What then? I just wish I had the courage to quit:("
My mom thinks I'm not making any progress,"My mom thinks I'm not making any progress, but I think that I'm doing really well based on where I started, and my psychologist thinks that too. My mom says I'm still grumpy, but I felt the most happy in months. And while last weekend I had a pretty big dip that's actually still going, I made progress over the last few weeks. My mom's already sceptical of my visiting a psychologist, she wants that we can do it on our own. So yeah in conclusion: my mom thinks I'm grumpy which makes me even more grumpy. What can I say to her? "
I just need to let all get out… well im sorry if this is too long,"All this started when i born bc i know that my parents never want me they just let me born bc my older sister died… and how i know this bc they are just two fucking alcoholic and they tell me all this when i was just a kid( im 19 right now) 


Beside that they never care about if i live or not i remember that when i have 4 we went to the beach and when i was playing in the sea i almost drown the only thing that saves me was a friend of my dad that take me out of the water i went i came back where we are in the beach my mom was drinking wine while i was throwing up the seawater that i swallow… anyways i just tell this to let you know that i really don't care they


Well we go 2 years later i was 6 and i hear my mom screaming i was scare and i go look and i found my mother cheating my dad… well my mother cut my shirt in a half with a knife and almost stab me i remember how i cry back then and i was fearing for my life bc this was not the first time that she hit me or other thing but they always says that was normal that a mother hit they son if he do something bad and that if i left home i will go to a place that will be worse and i believed that, and no one seems to care an all go normal 


This continued to the point that i get very nervous and anxious bc nobody stop her, nobody really care and i start defending myself bc she go pass the line far far away when she hits me, she will really beat me up and i was afraid (sorry for this and maybe you will be ok what happens to me later) in that point try to fight back (yes i hit my mother… sorry)


All that they see was a fucking man hit a woman… really all my family see me like a giant piece of shit… even one of my teacher that one time push me of my desk and i have to tell in front of the class that no i was too fuckin dumb that was bc i fall, anyways they all insult me( at this point my depression begin to exist) i was alone… now i think how dumb i was how i believed them if i tell somebody or if i go out of the home i will die in the streets or if i get into an social service they will rape me there or beat me up harder so how i was a kid i always believed the so i keep my mouth close 


Well this keep happening from when i was 6 years old to 12 i usually try to defend myself, run into my room or stay out of the house (but that summer i remember that i was so depressed for so many reason that i don’t get out of the house for at least 2 or 3 months the funny thing was that they get mad bc of that and one time i was in the garden watching the plants i my mom get mad and that make other guy who lives with us almost stab me, so i can be sad or mad or happy without bothering them)


Anyways when i was 12 one day my mom go a little more far that they usually go so i was more scared and i remember that i find a little gap and i start fight back but i pass the limit and i left her face with so many bruises that i feel so guilty that i tell to myself that i never will defend myself i was just run away or hide into my room, but she always catch me anyways so i let she hit me (one day take me out a piece of flesh of my finger but that happened 7 years now so the scar is barely visible)


this is the harder part bc one day she was drinking like usually do but she was mad so she wanna hit something, i was going to the bathroom but she stop me and push me to the floor i just get prepared and i remember how she was kicking me in the floor after a while i tried to play death but the only thing that she do was try to step up my neck but i have so… so many luck bc the floor was wet she don’t went to the bathroom and i was pee on all the floor so she step neck and his foot slip out and she fall to the ground and she grab me leg with so many force that was hard to get away and when i did my leg has so many wounds but that it was not the worst of the night, the worst part was how i feel that day i know that nobody care, that nobody want to help, that i was so alone, i remember rip off a sheet and uses like a bandage bc now the wounds was bleeding and i remember how i was scared that my own mom go to my room overnight and maybe kill me and i remember how i cry until i fell asleep, in the morning i take out the sheet opening all the wounds without feel anything how i keep living without feeling that much


I keep like that not knowing what to do i was supposed to keep living but i feel so  empty but a really tiny part of me want to stay alive so i was trying to get out with people to get out of the house try to eat something( i remember how i steal some money to my mom bc she always wasted in wine or beers and sent other people with the money and they keep that money and she blame me for that, so i begun stealing some of her money to eat something in the week or maybe go to play pc in a cyber cafe) and how i sleep in the streets sometimes just to don’t come back to the house (and if you are asking why i don’t go out and never come back it was that i was afraid i was 12 years old i know that i don’t care that enough to let me live in their house and i don’t have where to go)


I want to tell more but i just have a breakdown a few hours ago and now i have a little of courage enough to tell this bc i don’t wanna tell this to anybody bc that maybe fuck off my mom’s lifes (it’s confusing but she is a really good person when she is sober)


So to keep this short jump to this lasts months where i feel so anxious and depressed and i hate me so much and i blame for anything so much bc i feel that i was a mistake i don’t deserves to live i’m the cause of all the problems that the people have


I feel all of that to the point that i beat me up if i make upset someone now i just want to kill myself but that tiny part of me that says keep living fading away more and more and that was the reason i write this bc i don’t want to die but i feel so weak the last 1 year and a half i notice that i just give up i stop doing anything u left the school i get out of the house over 2 weeks i usually eat after 2 or 3 days i cry so much 


I need some help but only want a few advice of what i should to do i don't know how keep going i feel so weak the voice that tell me keep living is fading away to the point that only kicks out when i have a knife in my hand(lately i starting just stab me the tip of a knife after i beat me up i don't wanna know why)


So please if you read all of this thanks, sorry for make you read all of that but if you have any advice i will receive them


By the way i think that i will come back in a day or 2 if theres some coments o maybe in a week "
Constant battle with depression has subsided for now with a revelation on self care,"I registered for a self care workshop. I usually don't register for anything like that. However, a friend of mine convinced me that self care is the best thing I can do to ensure success in every other area of my life. If I don't feel my best, I won't do my best. I got really depressed every time I didn't live up to my own standards for myself. I would beat myself up and become my biggest bully. My friend said that I should try being my own biggest ally and best friend. So they recommended this workshop to me. I registered at Advancing Arts Forward dot com. I figured I'd share it here because I hope that it can help others as well. We need to be our biggest allies.

I also have medication too. I don't think this is a replacement for meds that your doctor prescribes you, but I just think that there should be more than just meds helping us live our best life."
First thing to do ...,"When depressed , the 1st thing to do is get your labs done. Everything. Even something like lack of b12 can wreak havoc on your mental health.  It's ok to get antidepressants but dont let your doctor skip labwork. 
Not saying that lack of things cause depression or not, but it sure doesn't help. 
You need all your strength. 
Best to all of you. "
I don't want to leave the house in the morning.,"Some days I just don't want to leave the house. It's like my body tells me I don't want to get dressed, go out and be around people. I think some days I want to hide from the world. It's particularly bad in the morning when I have to go to college. I will even slowly get myself up, have breakfast, get ready to head out but I'm having this argument in my head. There's a voice telling me just to put my bag down and stay home. I try so hard to be positive and overcome the negative voice but its too strong. I miss college because of this and my attendance gets bad. It makes me feel so down.

"I feel so sick mentally, it is getting worse","Hello everyone. 

It is probably going to be something like a confession, I am not sure. I feel so much pain in my brain. Not a headache but it does hurt my heart and makes my body weak, lots of diseases find me since. 

Before I actually signed up, I had a lot to say, then I feel shy. Sorry.

However, still I want to share...

Since I was probably 13 years old (it was about 2009-2010), I am really mentally sick. I wanted some real attention and I did things that I cannot be proud of - to catch attention... It went worse in 2014. Now, I have an anxiety disorder, panic disorder, mental fatigue, so much ADD, loss of focus, Alzheimer? and lots of sadness+worry+stupid self hatred+no confidence or self-confidence and a thought of being a total trash.

I never felt like a normal human being since then. I used lots of medicine, they seemed to be working well, but it's not true.

&#x200B;

BTW, I'm even now paranoiac about if my dad has installed something on my computer to see what I am doing!

&#x200B;

I don't ever want to die, or hurt myself. I just want to be happy again.

&#x200B;

Okay, let me tell my story.

I have been a happy child since I discovered the Internet. I had lots of dolls and imagination to play, I was so happy to be alive. Then, a strange thing happened. I was able to see and connect to other people: nobody taught me how to use or what to do on the Internet. So, I discovered and hurt myself real bad on it. 

It was fun, though. First, I discovered a game called ""Popomundo"" in 2009 or 2010 - I honestly don't know the date, maybe even earlier. It was a fun thing. I played it for a few years, *at the same time I was growing up*, ladies and gentlemen. I was growing up in a trash community because it had lots of bad people! I needed some cash in the game, it was probably the same time as I had face palsy because a man (he was about 28-29) asked me to do things on cam. I did, I was threatened and I had a face palsy for the first time. I never wished something like this to happen. I was scared and hell no, my family is too religious and they are always busy!

Then my childhood friend passed away. It was 2009.

\---

It was just the beginning of my story though.

I was very alone and I am always alone. My friends never loved me truly. Nobody was with me when I was a wreck. Thanks.

\---

Anyway, then lots of stupid things happened that I don't want to tell.

I feel so alone. Damn alone. I feel very stupid. There is no cure, I tried my best. People are too ignorant to be true. All I was doing is searching for something, love, attention, having some fun in a useless game? 

\---

It is more of a depression or anxiety disorder because I never told a psychiatrist my real issues. I covered. I continue to cover them up.

&#x200B;

I cannot even love myself, I hurt my mind so much and my ""self-love"" cells are destroyed, lol. Is there any suggestion other than going to a therapist or treatment. I really need a real solution.

&#x200B;

ADD catches me so bad that I forget things to say. My apologies."
Tired,"So so tired of being depressed all the time. Tired of loving people and them not loving me back or as much. Idk. All the people I love feel some need to hurt me. I guess I've got to be the problem. I wish I could kill myself, but I have literally no balls. Lovely. "
Am losing it,Please anyone...!!! I am struggling. 
Maybe distraction is a good thing,"I've always been at least mildly depressed. But after a surgery with a horrible turnout, I became very depressed. 
Distraction has often meant not facing the truth to me. But I'm starting to think otherwise. Sometimes you can only handle so much truth and ruminating just hurts you. And anything you can do to distract yourself from the pain is good.

Forever a disappointment: no more,"Is being one final, posthumous disappointment better than continuing to disappoint? So much time and effort has been spent on me that I cannot repay.  The results of these investments are lackluster at best. No matter the level of my effort, the results remain the same. All of this causes me great anxiety and stress, which in turn makes accomplishing anything nigh impossible. I look to my peers and am filed with jealousy, seeing the strength and resilience I lack. I don't see what could possibly make living in such hell worthwhile. All of my flaws make me the worst candidate for everything. I can't stop either. If I do, I'll kill my chances for everything that I've worked for. If I tell anyone this, all of my options will be taken from me.  That's why I must, and will, be successful."
Finding a therapist is so difficult when you work a day job,"It's almost impossible to find someone who has openings after 5pm. Right now my only lead might have an opening in 2-3 months, which is better than nothing I guess. And I don't even feel like I'll click with this guy. I'm just desperate enough to try anyone."
Does anyone think that you’re whole life is a tv show and people are trying to make you depressed on purpose.,"I’ve always had this stupid thought in my head for as long as I can remember. Please help me, I’m just really sad and I don’t want to be here anymore. "
Drowning,"I am a 21 year old male that has been struggling with severe depression for about 3 years. But I know that it’s my own fault.i was bullied a lot in high school and it always made me feel worthless and i don’t think i ever grew out of that. When I was graduating high school, that summer I got into drugs bad. I was taking Xanax almost daily, LSD, Molly, etc. all to fit in with the group of people I was with and hoping on of the girls I was with would fall in love with me but she never did, acted like it, but never did. But the heartbreak from that isn’t even what still haunts me, it’s the state it left my brain in. My head is filled with voices that are against me and always put me down or convinced me that everyone I know fucking hates me and it hasn’t always been like that. Almost every day I walk past the gun that I have in my house and debate if today is the day that I finally have had enough. I just know I can’t keep living like this. I feel so crazy, I don’t even wanna tell me friends how I feel cause I just get brushed off. I starting trying therapy but I fear so much about how people view that I can’t even talk to them. Every day I wake up and it feels like there’s a wave creeping up my body making me feel worse and worse "
"I know what to do, I even know how, but I'm so tired.","I've been diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and been depressed for most of the last 12 years. I'm 26, and after a two year period of very deep depression I put in the work and the time to get myself to a better place. 

At the start of this year all that work paid off, and I came into 2019 feeling good and doing good. I met someone amazing and started a really fantastic relationship with them.

Two weeks ago she left, she said she wasn't ready for a relationship, at least not a serious one without an obvious expiration date. I soldiered on through the post-breakup period, tried to stay positive, but it didn't work. 

Not only did I not stay positive, but I let myself get VERY far behind at work. Unfortunately I've just been promoted (effective 4/1) so I HAVE to get all this stuff caught up and ready to hand off to my successor ASAP, but there is so much of it and I'm so overwhelmed.

Now I'm back in the pit, I've been having serious and significant suicidal ideation for almost a week now. I know what I need to do to get back to a good place, I know how to do it, but it's so much WORK and I'm so tired. I'm so sick of having to try so hard just to get to ground-level.

What's the point anyways? Someone else will just come along and throw me back in down here if I manage to climb out again. I'm so tired of constantly struggling to be happy only to have all that work undone in a weekend.

I don't really know what I'm looking for coming here, but I just thought I'd share."
Suicide - pros and cons,"PROS: I won't have to be in pain anymore. I'll be free from everything. I'll never have to worry again. My family will be better if financially.

CONS: my family will be miserable for a while, my corpse will have to be cleaned up, a logic legal shit would have to before and my death would cost a lot of money. Also, it's a permanent descision.

Which sounds better? I don't know what to do."
Life has become a routine,"It’s a redundant prison that has been more difficult to escape. I truly despise working to indoctrinate the masses. Ever since I’ve lost my outlet to creativity, it’s been a downward spiral. I think my time in society is over."
fuck me,"I go through this 2 years of depression so i try to open up and talk to peaople more ,meet this girl who i don't believe is real how perfect she is for me. I get into a relationship with this girl and i love her so bad i actually start thinking i have something to live for. she loses her feelings because of how many times i say i don't deserve her and all the times i left her alone. Now i'm fucked up even more don't know what's worse losing her or knowing i found someone perfect and i fucked it. I really don't know what i want to do anymore and my numb depression is back so yaaay.

I appreciate the time you are taking out of your usual scrolling to listen to me.

I want to feel alive, I want to live.

I want motivation and that spark to put 200% in everything again.

Tried signing up to therapy again, but I messed that up by ignoring the calls.

Reckon, I should go to the doctor again and see if anti-depressants will work again; or any meds that will bring me back to life.

Almost everyone treats me like I know nothing. They all boast with what they are doing and that when they were my age (18) they were doing everything I do now, but better.
I love musical theatre. The singing, dancing and acting. I love it. But because of my last job, I've developed vocal nodules and I can't do what I love and what makes me happy.
But my dad always tells me that its for the best now when i cant sing anymore, cuz it never sounded good.
He also tells me that I need to stand on my own feet and not be a snowflake.
It hurts because I have faced hard times and I've done things I don't like to do. I'm sick of people trying to ""raise"" me! He is my dad but he wasnt present during my whole childhood.
My mom's also not helping me, telling me to relax and that I'm the only one that can help myself.
Suicide sounds more tempting than ever now and   I constantly picture me jumping of rooftops, slitting my wrists, or standing in front of a train.
I don't know what to do so ending it would probably be the best solution for me now.
Thank you so much for reading to the end."
Social Anxiety,"Hi, I suffer from something since a long time. I learned a little ago that it was called social anxiety. Everyday it's hard to go outside, i only have 10 min to go to the subway and i walk while watching the floor because i'm scared. Then I have to take the subway which is also terrible for me because i'm also scared. And finally i have to walk 2min to go to my high school which is probably the worst part of my day because I am surrounded by people. I don't know what to do, this is killing me and ""it's"" always with me.
This feeling of being scared is hard to explain and I hope that i'm not wrong in writing in r/depression. 
"
Help.,"I hate everything. I feel hatred towards everyone and I get mad at everything. I can't stand my family. I can't stand my dogs. I'm in a horrible mood all the time and idk why. I've got no one to talk to. I've got no friends. I lay in my bed playing videogames all day. My parents are spending a lot of money paying my university but I can't get out of my bed. I've missed all my classes. I hate the career I'm studying. I'm mediocre, I know I will never succeed and I suck at it. Yeah, I should go to a therapist, but I have no money nor transportation so it's off the table. Please don't suggest it. I can't even drive a car. Is there any medication or something I can take without a prescription? I don't know what to do.  There has to be something else I can do to get out of this horrible loophole. I just want to die. It would be so easy to just die..."
Trying not to self harm...,"So I’ve recently picked up smoking as an alternative to cutting which I’ve done in the past figuring that it would be better for me...but nicotine is a bitch and I’m just trying to feel something other than empty all the time. I’m thinking of getting a dab pen, which would be better for my health but less so for my wallet...thoughts? :( "
Down For No Reason,"I hate it. You know? I should be happy right now. I'm dating an amazing guy, I have a house of my own, and I cut negative people out. I've got two good jobs. I have supportive friends. And bills are paid. I dont see why, then, I'm waking up feeling numb. I dont see why I'm waking up with no motivation to finish laundry or do anything else. It just doesnt make sense."
"Need help for my housemate to get him out of that ""given up"" rut","Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I don't know where else to go.

First off, my housemate is amazing, love that guy. Always the life of the party. However, over the last 2 months he's had some really bad luck (bike got stolen, lost his job, phone got stolen last week). There's 4 of in the house, and recently money has become a huge burden for us.

We're happy to help pay his rent, but now we're struggling too. What's hard is that he's kind of lost his way. I keep offering to help him out with his CV or help sell these expensive shoes he's got (big NBA shoes he can't fit into), but he's forever in a smoke weed/drink/play games until 4am, sleep until the afternoon cycle. It's been heartbreaking, and because he didn't say anything even when asked, we thought he was ok.

Tonight we had a mini intervention, saying we've noticed a slow decline and worried for his future. He said he's been too shy to ask, and wants all the help we can give him. It was great I think.

Thing now is, we're a bit unsure on how to proceed. I'm quite active, so I mentioned I'd go running with him (healthy lifestyle helped me get out of my slump). Also tomorrow I'll clean up his CV etc. We also mentioned that he has got to be honest with us too. 

Just wanted to ask here - what are other things we can all do to help him out? He struggles just to get out of bed, so now we're gonna have a buddy system where my mate will wake him up with coffee, and the next day he has to do that for my mate.

We mentioned that he cut out smoking weed and drinking on weekdays as a start. I wanted cold turkey but worried it'll lose effect.

Anything else that could help? We want to help him, but do it in a way that's supportive. Also, we can't afford therapy, and his parents aren't much help. 

Some ideas I have:
- Setting daily/weekly/monthly goals
- Setting up a budget
- Getting more active
- Better sleep schedule
- Cutting out weed as much as possible
- Getting better at cooking cheap and healthy
- Getting a bartender/waiter job asap
- Read/Journal
- Start off slow and slowly progress, adding more from the above as the weeks go by"
Current status,"I think i have to write something so here we go thank you if you read this and sorry for my bad english. So my life is so fucked up im currently on 9th grade and my life is just one big mess: i have suffered from depression since 6th grade i have done so much stupid and dangerous shit, im addicted to nicotine and drugs. I have done lsd and that shit helps me. I dont want to tell my whole life story but im just so fucked up. Im fucking stoned atm in my bed some fucked up shit happened today and that just got me thinking about everything, listening to kid cudi in my bed i jusy fucking love that guy, his music keeps me from the edge tbh. I have a fucking twisted humor, im a fucking mess, i have fucked all my relationships with everyone bc of drugs and everything else and i just had this feeling i have to get this off my chest. (Sorry for my username i was drunk when i made this profile) im not a sick fuck, my mind is. Peace✌️"
no matter how strong a girl is..,"she has a weak point, and all she needs is a hug."
a cry for help,"the thing about a cry for help is someone else needs to be around to hear it and care enough, but sometimes no one is there."
"If I wasn’t around, would you miss me?","Would it be painful for you to have me gone? To have that empty space on the couch as a constant reminder of what you’ve lost?

Would you put off going to bed so you don’t have to face another tomorrow without me?

Would it be almost impossible for you to get up in the mornings and brave the day because you know I won’t be there to say hello? Would your bed become a prison of escape from the reality in which I no longer exist?

Would it be hard to focus on your work with thoughts of “why did she leave me” and “how could she do this to me” going through your mind? Would you curse me for being so cruel?

Would it be heartbreaking to look in the mirror and barely recognize yourself buried under the tears and grief masking your face?

&#x200B;

If I wasn’t around, you would finally know how it felt to be me.

&#x200B;

Your grief echoes mine. I grieve for the ""me"" that died I don't know when, and I wake up everyday in an empty costume playing the part of the person you lost.

&#x200B;

If I wasn't around, you wouldn't miss me.

You would miss an illusion, because I haven't been here in a long time."
I’m DONE,"You know what? I’m fucking tired. I’m tired of letting all this goddamn pain hold me back. I’m tired of letting it control me. I’m gonna go put my bathing suit on and swim. I don’t care what my mind tells me, I don’t care how much pain I’m in. I’m going.
Take that universe! You can’t fucking stop me from finding joy in my life. I’m gonna do what I fucking want!
It’s spring break and I will NOT be held back by pain or darkness. 
Not today."
im not who i used to be,"why?

because ive been hurt. ive gone through a lot of shit which has made me who i am. these past years so many things have happened. things that have changed who i used to be.. little things. big things. everything. as time passes no one stays the same person. people tell me that i have changed.. dont you think i know that? of course ive changed, im not going to stay the same person forever. the worst part is i hate who i have turned into. i hate everything about myself."
Does anyone else have trouble finding something to want?,"I graduated high school in June last year and ever since I have expressed to my therapist and parent that I don't know what to do now. They always say, ""well what do you want to do?"" And I have no answer other than ""I want to die,"" which I refuse to say. I know I should be looking for a job or going to college or something, which I have been attempting but gathering motivation feels impossible. And It's not like I feel completely fulfilled by the way my life is now. I do want things to change, I just don't know what or how. I understand I'm incredibly privileged to be able to have gone this long without being forced into something, but I can see my very small support system get more and more frustrated with me as time passes and I still haven't come up with anything."
Just found out I can’t afford my first choice college.,"I know what you’re thinking, who gives a shit. I can still afford school just not the one I want. And it’s true, I don’t know why I’m even posting this because it’s just such a non-problem and other people can’t even afford any schools. 

I just feel like such a failure, I’ll be honest I didn’t work as hard as I could but I thought it would be good enough and it apparently wasn’t. I feel pretty lost honestly."
Starting to slip back into depressions due to a break up,"I (F26) have experienced depressions since I was 10 years old. I had good and bad times. I am not as bad as I was in the past and I haven't felt any depressions for 3 years. But now I am going through a rough break up and I can feel that I am slipping back into them. I have a lot of 'mental cinema' happening. Imagining him having a fantastic time, f\*\*\*\*\*g the coworker he tried to f\*\*\*, which is one of the reasons the whole break up thing happened (a lot more to it) while I am alone, not having anyone.

 I am new to the city and have no friends here yet. And he is probably out and about with his co-worker and his new flatmates (I kicked him out) having the time of his life. And it just hurts and I feel the depression coming back. It's so difficult and fighting it is really hard. I know the steps to take, but my head is really working against me right now "
Feeling unwanted and rejected,"Very long, I felt like this is the only place that I can share it.


I have this feeling for about 3 years now. It started since Junior High School when my only friend in school started to hang out with ""cool"" people, my second friend (I'll call him John) went to other school so I wasn't seeing him very often.

I was trying to hang out with classmates (including that friend) but for them I was ""if he's here then good, if he isn't, even better"" type of person. When I've noticed it I started to become more sad and apathetic and my anxiety increased. Last months of school I spent time mostly alone.

When summer break came I forgot about all this because everything I did was playing games and walking out my dog.

In new class in high school (that started last year) I've met a John's friend. John was going to same school but different class so I felt safer that I won't spend time alone again. Soon I found that it wasn't, a good situation, because again they rather spend time together than with me. They talked a lot what happend in previous school (they were in the same class), it crushed me, because I found out what I have missed while being alone. I don't even have good memories from my school to share.

My parents don't help either. They want good grades from me but even when I'm above average they say that ""I could do better"". They're reacting neutral when I get a good grade but are upset and disappointed when occasionally I get a bad one.

Last time I felt really needed and happy was last week when my new neighbour ask me to help him with his key to staircase door. This little thing made me happier than getting the only good grade on test in the entire class. 

Most of my days I spend doing little more than nothing, mostly playing vidya or using my phone. I don't have motivation to do anything else. I feel like I'm not living, just existing. Everyday I hope that something terrible happens to me so I'll get ar least a little attention and care.

I want to change but I don't really know how and don't have motivation to do anything about it."
I cant think of a reason to not kill myself.,"I'm isolated. I hate my job. my relationship is going down the drain. Even though I've started making small steps to improvement (seeking professional help, getting some certifications, opening up), my anxiety attacks have been getting worse. I can't imagine doing anything I love, I can't convince myself my friends care or my family loves me. I thought I could rely on my best friend but my depression and suicidal thoughts caused her to abandon me, my girlfriend is going through a lot in her life too and I feel as though there's no room for me there even though I try to be supportive. I am expected to be a slave in my current environment, even if I leave and go back home, I'm expected to live a life that is meant to make other people happy. I have no where to go, nothing to look forward to, I thought I could trust my friends, my girlfriend, my parents. And then today, while just sitting, I realized I can't think of a reason not to kill myself."
Just because I’m expressing my negative emotions does not inherently mean I’m self loathing,"I think this is a massive problem when it comes to people trying to express the deep dark things that they feel. Everybody lives in fear that they’re just gonna be minimized and dismissed because we’re going to be perceived as just self loathing. How can I ever get to the deeper I go article issues if you won’t let me express how I feel with purity. I think it’s a lazy therapist work and I think that it’s just an attempt to label everything that goes into what I’m trying to say instead of really trying to understand it. 

I’m not self-loathing if I say that I hate my job and don’t want to be there six hours a day. Maybe that job isn’t what serves my passion, serves me as an individual or helped me discover who I am. The job is not what’s causing the negative emotions. I’m not using the job as a scapegoat however the point is that it’s bigger than just this one conversation it’s just more complex than that label of self loathing

Yes I self loathe  because I hate myself and want to die what is because I don’t know how to think you’re just telling me that I’m doing it doesn’t help me with anything"
Today I went to work,"I finally stayed for a full shift at work for the first time in awhile. Last time I went to work I randomly started crying and had to go home, I cried all the way home because I didn't want to be here anymore. I've been on a new medication for my depression lately and it's made me very suicidal and depressed. I went to the doctor and I'm trying something new now. I'm proud that I've gone a whole day without crying and I stayed for my whole shift."
Why do people keep wasting their time on me,Why do they waste their time caring about me. Im just a useless piece of garbage that wants to die. Can they just stop. I don't deserve anything. I don't deserve them.
I miss the stars,The light pollution has got so bad where i am that i rarely ever see the stars anymore. I miss them. 
Anyone here tried Cognitive Behaviourial Therapy,"Going on 8 months of antidepressants and beta blockers. GP recommends getting started with CBT. Anyone here tried it? How did you get on with it?
"
I'm dying.,"I just want to punch a wall so hard that my hand breaks!!!! I seriously hate was my life has succumbed to. I wanted to get better and I wanted to believe that I could get better but I'm helpless. My psychiatry appointment this morning just confirmed how helpless I am.  I don't know whats wrong with me which is why i went to seek help in the first place, but instead of help all I get are answers like ""I don't know how to help you."" Well that makes the two of us! I know I'm doing it out of anger but I'm just going to stop taking all my medication, I really don't care what happens anymore. If I report that a medication hasn't been working for the past 6 months then wouldn't it be a good idea to stop the freaking medication instead of keeping me on the same dosage?? I'm just so confused and can't keep doing this anymore. In my entire 20 years of living have I ever met a doctor that just hears me out, I really don't know what the purpose of life is or what the point of living is for. "
My big chance just got destroyed,"I'm currently a junior in college and I'm under a lot of pressure to get an internship.  I did an interview for basically my dream internship a bit ago.  I thought I did really well and the hiring manager even told me I did really well.  I thought I would get it for sure, but today I got a call telling me I didn't.  I don't really have any other opportunities going for me as my GPA isn't that great and I don't have a lot to show for myself.  Now my parents will proebe really disappointed, my dad was really excited for me.  Today I'm staying home from school to be depressed about it.  Story of my life. "
Why am I such a failure?,"Hi I'm a 20 yo male in college. Its my second year and it hasnt exactly been the best. Starting last year I have experienced pretty strong depression from time to time. It get bad then better then worse then better, etc. I am kind of getting fucked by it. It is nearly impossible for me to show up to my morning classes because I cant get up. Even when I go I cant pay attention no matter how hard I try its like my brain hates me and purposely doesnt want me to succeed. I am already on academic probation and Im probably getting kicked out this semester. I dont want to be a failure but i cant get out of this slump. I have friends and stuff but nothing seems to work I dont know what to do and I feel like im being a huge dissappointment to my family. I dont enjoy basically anything I used to. I dont laugh at comedies or enjoy touching stories. I hate the person I am becoming and I dont know how to fix it. I feel like I just want to cry all the time. when I study no matter how hard I try or how long Im at it I cant remember anything. Im so scared that I will never make anything of myself."
I am proof that it gets better. Trust me. Maybe not right now. But in time.,"First of all let me start off by saying that I've been on this sub reddit for a while and I've reached out for help and there are so many of you willing to help and I just want to say thank you to each and every one of you. I had been depressed for over 3 years (might not seem very long relatively but it's still a really long time). I had lost interest in everything that i once loved doing. I lost a lot of weight in a very unhealthy way and in the past year I found out that I have anxiety. I had to be held back a year from college because I'd failed a subject twice. 
I honestly thought things were never going to get better. Everyday I would go to bed thinking that i did not want to wake up and live the next day. I was very suicidal. My best friend/ girlfriend that I was with for 9 years, cheated on me in this time as well. I was lost. I had no one to go to. I felt very very alone. If not for this sub reddit I would've killed myself for sure.
But many months later it's gotten much much better. I cleared my exam. I started feeling better. I started doing the things i used to enjoy again and I'm starting to love it again. I'm not going to sugarcoat this by saying ""everything will work out"". It wont. I still lost a lot of people that i loved very much. I'll have trust issues for the rest of my life. Everything will not work out. But most of it will. Don't lose hope. I know now that if I had killed myself when I wanted to I would've regretted it big time. I will never leave this sub reddit because I want to help as many people as i can. I want all of you going through a horrible horrible time to know that some things will get better. Maybe in a few months. Maybe in a few years. But it will. There are people here that want to help. Do not give up folks. Do not. You will regret it if you do. Once you feel happiness again you will do everything to keep it going and as far as i know you will not go back to being depressed at least for sometime. It will get better. I promise. "
Depression is weird,"1-3 days ago I was feeling extremely hopeless, sad, and somewhat suicidal, but today I feel great. I know that at the end of the week my depression will probably come back as per usual even if nothing else in my life actually changes. Does depression work like this for anyone else? "
Been let down by a guy and feeling pretty low,"Been seeing this guy for a short time, and today he's said that he went on a date with an old flame and wants to end things with me. My confidence has taken another massive blow and I feel really teary. So sick of feeling like this and not having people to talk to."
I just wanted to get this out,"I'm a 15 yo student athlete and am currently on 30mg of fluoxetine.

I always have this terrible mind set of wanting to die, but deep down I know I dont want to do that, instead i just want to get out of this shithole of a life I'm in rn.

Is it just me or does anyone else also feel this way?"
i’m just about done,"anyone else depressed because all they do is sleep? I sleep because i’m depressed and then I get even more depressed because I sleep so much. I know everyone’s been through this vicious cycle but I literally cannot break it and I have a job i’m going to lose due to this. I’m already failing my semester in uni because I cannot get off this goddamn bed and do my assignments. I just barely gather enough energy to get up and get to work. I’m barely making it. It’s like I literally cannot stop sleeping, i’m suffocated by the weight of sleepiness that is constantly over me. 

I think at this point i’m just done. I’ve already been on a handful of psych meds that didn’t help in the slightest. I’d rather be dead quite honestly. I’m going to snap soon."
"Do you guys listen to songs that remind you of someone, who you’ve been together with, and just whenever you repeat that song, no matter how many times, it just pours the memories of that beautiful time?","It reached a point where every time I listen to that one damn song the tears won’t stop pouring out.

I made a decision once that I knew would probably lead me to not see a close person to me for a long time, but I hoped we’d still communicate, over time that connection just kept getting weaker and weaker, until we stopped talking to each other, the last time I talked to them was probably 3-4 years now, and I’m starting to regret that I made that damn decision. We knew each other for 9 years, now I don’t think I’d recognize them if I saw them. 

I wanted to write the first three lines of this post, I just couldn’t stop, I’m so frustrated now, I hope we’d meet soon."
I can feel myself slipping,"I usually know how to pull myself out when I start sliding downhill, but it's been getting harder and harder as I've gotten older.  Now, I can feel myself slipping again, and I just don't know if I have it in me to claw my way back up.  Hell, it took a lot out of me to even post this.  "
Anyone else struggled to believe their antidepressants are working? How long until you accepted it?,"One month on new meds and I had been in a good mood for 2 weeks. I was only on 1/8 the starting dose the first week and slowly made my way up to 1/2 the starting dose by the end of this month. 

I just feel like it’s a freak coincidence that I’ve been happy for 2 weeks. (Nvm that the longest I lasted before these meds was 2 days with a huge crash after) My mind just keeps whispering “correlation =/= causation” and that I’m gonna crash soon and just go completely psycho. (Which is why I’m dead afraid of taking my pills even a couple hours late)

but I know this time correlation DOES equal causation. How long until I stop doubting myself?"
Started 10mg Lexapro increased to 20mg still feeling hopeless and unmotivated.,"Depression/anxiety got to the point i decided I needed to do something so about 2 months ago I got prescribed 10mg a day of Lexapro and Xanax when needed. Maybe a week or so ago I talked with my doctor and decided to try 20mg a day of Lexapro because I felt it could be doing more.

Anyway so over the past 2 months or whatever I’ve noticed the intrusive thoughts seem to go away on their own but I still have pretty bad days and every day (not working and not in school, basically a bum right now) i’ve been sleeping until 12, not eating much (but definitely eating more than before thanks to the Lexapro... still a little underweight) and just doing nothing really unless my boyfriend can convince me to go out and do something. I have zero motivation to do anything but it’s not that i don’t want to. I want to get up and workout and get some meat on my body and get some sun and get a job for god‘sake and get back into school. It’s just I feel so useless and worthless and hopeless and can’t get myself to just do it! 

Don’t know if this is a vent or a question or seeking advice but just what’s on my mind....

Anyone who’s had experience with Lexapro what are your thoughts? "
Haven't brushed in two days,Just feeling so lazy and hopeless and it's been hard for me to really give a fuck. Anybody else struggling to get up and do things? I just wish I had a time machine. 
Empty,"I don’t usually post anything but here goes.

I feel empty.
I have a very good job, a career plan, a car, somewhere to live and up until 3 months ago I was with someone I adored and wanted to spend the rest of my life with and then something changed, I don’t know what. It was like a snap in my brain and everything turned grey and dull, I lost almost all drive to do anything and it makes me so angry because I’m not this type of person. 

I pushed my love away because I became obsessed with playing video games and stopped giving her any form of affection and now the guilt of what I’ve done is bearing down on me, which hurts so much.

I’m not suicidal and wouldn’t self harm because I know deep down every issue can be fixed with time whereas doing something like that would destroy the lives of my family and I’d be gone forever.

In hindsight I don’t think me and my Ex were right for eachother, even though we used to have so much fun, I became a reclusive nerd and she liked to live life to the fullest. 

I’m trying to make myself better by going back to the gym, my computer has gone into storage and I’m trying to be generally more active. 

I don’t even know if this was the best sub to put this on but I just wanted someone to read it because I feel so lonely 


 
"
Is anyone else having a 'nothing' day today?,"My depression has been worse the past couple days and today I woke up feeling completely on empty, so I am staying home doing absolutely nothing. I had some things I wanted to get done today, like go to the gym and get groceries, but it took me 3 hours just to get out of bed so I know productivity isn't in the cards for me right now. To ride this out I'm sitting in a comfy chair under a blanket watching spooky videos (episodes of Lore and Mr. Nightmare's youtube channel) and I don't plan on leaving this chair, never mind the house, until tomorrow. I might take a shower later if I can muster myself, but that's it. For those of you who are in the same boat, how are you spending your nothing day?"
what should i do,"alright, so for a couple months now i have been feeling empty and just not as i was before, i don't know if im depressed or just sad but i really don't know what to do. i tried talking to my friend about it but after stating that i thought i was depressed i took it back immediately because i wasnt 100% sure about it and didnt want to go out of my way to say that im depressed because that is a very big statement and id feel very bad if it was false."
Effective tools against depression.,"Has anybody here checked out the book “Feeling Good, the new mood therapy” by Dr. David Burns? It has some great advice and offers practical skills for a depressed mindset. Check it out."
First day at the job!!,"only had one panic attack and suicidal thoughts.

How do you guys handle being depressed?,I've been getting to the point where I'm either extremely down or angry all the time and I can't handle it. I would really love too end it all. I just want some advice on how to handle it
"Applied for Jobs, Feeling Productive for a Change","I just applied for 3 different jobs today, all as waiters at 3 different restaurants. I'm feeling productive for the first time in a while! Proud of myself."
Failure,"I failed two classes and started getting anxiety attacks which I normally do not have. I stopped talking to my friends and I don’t want to leave my bed and go to class anymore. It’s contra productive, I know but I’m ashamed to face them or talk to my family. I invested so much time into studying that I neglected everything else but it didn’t pay off and the setback really messed with my already screwed up mental health. I have to try harder but I see no point in doing anything because I fell like I will fail anyway. "
Ghosted again,"Every time I tell myself its not me it's not me hes just a flakey asshole shes just a flakey cunt but how many times does it have to happen before I take a hint

I just want a friend. Someone who wants to have fun and spend time with me. But I dont think that's ever going to happen. "
I feel like my family only sees me as a burden.,"I don’t feel loved by my family. It’s like I’m just a financial burden. I have these thoughts that everyone would be better off without me. I feel like no one cares about me. I isolate myself from my family because I don’t think they like or love me. I’m an international student in Atlanta and I have no friends or support system. Some days I just want to give up, go somewhere in the woods where nobody will find me and end it because at least then there would be no funeral expenses. 

My mom can’t afford to pay my next semester’s tuition and I’m dreading being sent back to my home country, my suicide ideation is worse there and drugs are so accessible. I’m afraid of what I might do. I feel so helpless. I want to live, but I’m just so tired. "
i’m going to disappear.. and we’ll see what happens.,"i’ve decided this just an hour ago, because i hadn’t realized i killed three hours of my much needed day off from work, mindlessly scrolling on social feeds, and hating myself and my life that isn’t as good as the peoples’ on the screen.

no more instagram, facebook, or tumblr. i’m completely deleting the accounts and the apps. 


i’m making a new email, and only using it for important stuff like the doctors and bills.

i’m sick off shadowing my ex’s on social media, being depressed and missing him despite he abused me in every way. i’m worth more than that. i don’t care if i don’t believe it, but i’m saying it. i need to stop that shit. he’s trash.

i’m giving myself a max of one hour total allowance to be on my phone for misc reasons (only gaming youtubers or how-to Art tutorials. 

i’m going to start playing video games again. and start drawing again. and start journaling, and playing with my cat more often. he likes to play fetch.

i’m going to try to drink more water. and eat more food. and i’m going to make myself get into the habit of taking my antidepressants.

i’m cutting off people who are toxic. who use me. who use me as the mentally ill token friend. or who honestly are just fucking dicks or couldn’t actually care about me

i’m sick of feeling ugly despite wearing a ton of makeup, and having a closet with clothes that 13 year old me would die for. i’m sick of being the weird person with weird hobbies and weird music and weird goth shit. i’m always weird, weird weird. i’m skinny and gross. i’m sad all the time and hate it when people talk to me. i feel no sympathy for anyone and i’m never empathetic. im sick of it. i want to be brighter even though my whole world is black. (yes that’s a goth pun) i’m sick of not being good enough for anyone. and sometimes i get really sick of being told to my face that i’m just weird. “oh but in a good way” my ass.

i’m going to focus on getting my GED after major depression made it difficult to continue high school. i’m going to get into college. i’m going to do my hobbies i once loved. i’m going to volunteer at a cat shelter and help so many critters find homes. i’m gonna do it. i will fucking do it even if i get deeper eye bags trying to

i’m completely cutting myself off from whatever is happening online, from whatever negativity is around me, and from whatever is stopping me from growing in person. and succumb myself to what’s in front of me.

this will take a long time for me to kinda adjust to. and for me to successfully pull it off. but my first step today is erasing my phone and deleting apps. 

alas, friends... i’ll see you again some day. and if not, i hope it’s because you’ve been getting better. blessed be "
There's broken glass by my bed.,"Earlier this week, a glass fell. I don't remember what exactly happened, but it fell right by the floor near my bed and shattered into a million sharp little pieces. My first thought was to clean it up. How would I do that? There's no room to. My entire fucking floor is covered in other shit, how would I get that out of the way so I can just clean glass? 

So I step on it to go to school in the morning. It doesn't hurt nearly as much as you'd think, I haven't been cut or gotten glass stuck yet, but it still hurts a lot. I don't know what to do about it though, and I only have to deal with it twice a day. So I walk on broken glass every day.

It's kind of a good metaphor, but this did literally happen. It's still going on, actually."
Does anyone else get angry about the permanent effects depression has had on your future?,"It's one thing to deal with the direct effects of depression and to fight to return to some sense of normalcy, but for me the true devastation comes from all of the collateral damage. I've ruined important relationships, missed out on building new ones, ruined my chance of completing the degree I wanted and accrued more debt in the process, and lost all sense of direction for the future.  
  
My third year of university is almost finished and I've made no close friends or impact on anyone's life on campus. I had to change my major because I couldn't keep up with what I originally wanted to do, and unfortunately this means I need to take an extra semester which of course means more loans.  

And it's all because I couldn't get out of bed. I may as well have been in a coma; I hardly remember the past two years. Depression creates such pathetic failures."
Does anyone take care of plants to help themselves?,I hear it helps and i want to but idk where to start. Any tips? Preferably something that'll be low maintenance 
I don't think I'll ever get better,"I want to, of course. Who doesn't?

Will I? Will I stop slipping into this abyss time and time again, after thinking it has improved?

Probably never, let's be real."
Please help: I can't get a job and it's destroying my mental health.,"I have never worked a day in my life. I haven't volunteered ever, I've never held a part time job. I go to a online University and live with my parents. I don't have soft skills, and my resume is empty. No one will hire me. 

Not McDonald's, or Subway, or F21. I've asked around with family and friends at got nothing. I'm in the house all day, smoking weed and watching YouTube. I have no money to go out, to take myself to doctors appointments or to hangout. I spend my little allowance (I’m 20) on weed, because it makes me forget. 

No one will hire me. Not even an interview. And it's tearing me apart. People tell me to keep trying, but it's not fun when I apply countless times, only to not even be graced with a rejection letter. I don't have a resume, or any experience so I'm stuck at home. My friends know not to ask me out - I always say no. So now I only have one friend, who lives far away. 

I feel like I should punish myself. I've even considered making myself sit alone in the dark all day as a punishment. If I can't be a normal working member of a society then maybe I don't deserve to have friends and to socialize. It's horrible when day to day I wake up, smoke, watch Hulu and eat pizza. I don't move from my bed. 

It's getting worse and worse and I don't know what to do. I want to self harm, but that won't change anything. I don't know what to do or how to pull myself out of this. I just want a job. I just want to talk to people and have some money. I can't even manage that. 

This is a rant, but has anybody gone through this? Can anybody help?"
I’m so happy that I can’t sleep,"Usually it’s the opposite but today I guess I push myself hard. Working hard, listening to my favorite music, taking a long walk, eating well, writing diary, posting silly pictures. Doing all these in a day  is tiring but I guess it’s worth it!"
"Life is falling into disrepair, because I can't finish things. Avoidance. I think there's something wrong with my brain. Doc has no clue.","(Edit -when I say there's something wrong with my brain, I mean it light-heartedly and kind of tongue-in-cheek, I don't actually think that).

Hello! I'm 38, white male, college educated, live with a woman but not married. No known conditions, exercise probably 2x/wk and eat mostly whole foods, meat and vegetables (keto), in decent shape. Accomplished quite a lot before about 22. I do drink alcohol, usually every other day. Would like to cut down.

&#x200B;

(I wrote out a list of things I'm not getting done, but omitting it to make the post more succinct, I can list them if you want).

I have the discipline and attention to sit down and write this post for instance, but I keep avoiding the important things.

&#x200B;

I've analyzed that moment, when I'm pacing back and forth in my kitchen and thinking about the things I need to do and instead doing something else, and it's -avoidance. It's this feeling that I'm not ready yet, and that I can always do it later, when I'm ready. That's the best way I can think to describe it. I know consciously about the negative effects, but that's overpowered by not feeling ready.

&#x200B;

there is one other thing, which is my mother passed away 6 years ago, it was a slow death from cancer and I temporarily moved back home and helped my Dad care for her during her last 3 months. Basically exactly what you think, I watched her get frail and waste away. It was pretty terrible and I do wonder if I have some mental scarring from that or something. I don't obsess about it, but I do have some mental baggage about it that may be affecting things.

&#x200B;

I have regular HMO, my GP and all doctors I've seen just seem to have no clue, tried Zoloft for a while, didn't think it made a difference so stopped. Don't really feel depressed, just can't finish things.

Not sure what to do. Any advice other than go see the Dr.? Thanks very much.

**TL;DR: Putting things off because I never feel quite ready. Can't finish things. Tried depression medication, docs have no clue.**"
Anybody know of any good support groups (English-speaking) for depression in the Netherlands?,I found a few online but they are all in Dutch. I am an expat and still learning the language. I would anyway find it much much easier to express myself in English in a support group.
Engaging in unhealthy behaviors to decrease life expectancy,"I feel horrible, but yea the title sums up it up. Since I can’t end my life due to fear of hurting the people I love and fear of failure. I feel like I want to engage in unhealthy behaviors so that I don’t live too long. I can’t believe I’m sitting here trying to figure out ways to live less. If life expectancy is 75.... then 52 more years to go. I hate how I sound, I hate this, and I hate that I now think this way. How can someone be so hopeless and broken. Does anyone else wait to NOT WAKE UP. I am trying my best to fight this, but I’m afraid I can only survive in this life rather than live. Mental illness is horrible. "
I don't know what's wrong,"I don't know what's wrong. I think I have bdd but I'm not sure, whenever I think I have bdd a voice in the back of my head tells me that I'm just ugly and don't want to accept it so I'm just making up things. 

It's gotten worse over the past few years to the point that now i try not to talk in front of other people because it makes my already round face appear even rounder. I'm in front of the mirror all the time and if I'm not in front of it I'm thinking of how ugly I'm looking to everyone around me and how I should just off myself. I'm constantly thinking of taking a blade to my face and going to work because then id just look fucking scarred and maybe people won't notice how ugly I look otherwise. Whenever I feel happy and laugh about something im instantly reminded of how fucking hideous I must look and I should stop laughing so people around me won't puke.

I've had a lot of people ( chicks and dudes) tell me I look handsome but I just can't accept that. Everytime someone tells me I look good I just want to fucking beat them up, it's like telling a disabled dude that he'd making a pretty good swimmer, it's just fucking cruel. But whenever someone comments anything negative about my appearance ( it super fucking hurts) but I feel validated, like I'm not fucking crazy it's not all in my head and that I am ugly. Like for example one of my friends told me my face was kinda round 2 years back in a chem lab and I haven't stopped thinking about that since then.

I have a girlfriend an absolutely beautiful soul and I'm getting more suspicious of her by the minute. Like why TF would she like me she's fucking gorgeous. Last week I finally had enough and asked her why she even liked me and she told me that I look cute and that I was a good guy since then my mind has convinced me that shes just fucking with me and she doesn't like me and is doing it for for knows what. And the sad thing is even if she was screwing around with me, I'd totally get her I would even be happy for her.

Sorry if this is a wall of text was just looking for somewhere to rant before I did something stupid."
Emotional music,"Just wondered am I only who listens to emotionaly music just for cry? I think it's only thing that makes me feel comfortable being alone with my toughts. After that it feels like every problem is gone and I am happy again, until next night."
Depressed and unhappy yet doing well,"So I've been doing 'well' in societal terms. Great grades, kinda popular on the stupid social ladder with a good number of people to call friends yet, I am not happy. I don't know if I am greedy for more. I see my friends being asked out on dates, I see others being fit and doing things they want to do while I just sit back in jealousy. People keep in touch with me because I am approachable so if they need help with their college work, I'll be there to help. Or they need someone to listen to their problems.

No one really knows about my problems, about my feelings, about my life. Sometimes, it just makes me sick how people can be so ignorant towards others. I don't know why I have to be so emotionally receptive to others, why I want to solve the world's problems when no one wants to even listen mine. Maybe I'm just ranting here.

I just feel really alone even when I am always around people. It's either that or I just feel inferior to them. I just wish I could be content with the good things I have."

I just saw my ex girlfriend at work and it kills me to see here because I know she wants nothing to do with me anymore.....I don’t know why I keep going?? I know in my heart I’ll be alone forever, I always have been! I am a terrible person to others and I’ll never know what it’s like to have a healthy relationship.

No, me neither. "
Update on the loss of my girlfriend.,"You may recall 13 days ago my girlfriend suddenly passed away. (I don’t feel like going into details.) she was a beautiful 23 year old woman, who was a year away from graduating with a doctorate of Pharmacy and we’d planned to move to Oregon/Washington. Well that’s not going to happen now. 

Our two dogs Fival and Cash are bow living with her folk due to the fact that I travel at unexpected times for work. (Wildland Firefighter) Her mother is such a rockstar, I get daily pictures of my dogs and I know they are in good care. 

I’ve been having a couple “good” days but today feels different, like there’s a consistent wave hitting me against the ocean shore. Went to the doctor for a cold this week and he gave me a small anxiety medication but it only seems to mask my emotions and not let them out, is that normal? Or do I need to get more of the medicine in my system? 

I’ve been keeping up with my hobbies so I don’t think there’s major depression yet but more along the lines of acute grief. Do you guys have any tips for dealing with this besides it takes time?

Thank you r/depression and r/reddit 

TL;DR- Girlfriend passed away unexpectedly and it fucking sucks and I need ideas to help with the grief.

"It’s my first time posting in this, but I’m at a pretty low point, and I don’t want to feel like a burden to my friends/family.","So I’ll try to make this as short as possible.

November of 2016, I had to literally run away from an emotionally turned physically abusive boyfriend. My friend was married to a guy who owned a house, and they offered it to me, and I thought it was a blessing.  I shorty realized after about six months that the house was in horrible condition. The electric didn’t work in a lot of places, the roof had a leak, the plumbing was clogged beyond just snaking it out, and I found an actual hole in the house. 

I limped through this, and even tried to buy another house on contract, but that fell through because it turned out the foundation was awful and the owner refused to sell it to me (great guy).  So I was stuck in this house, which I take full responsibility for because I was scared and blindly took the house without a lease because we were friends.

I’m now in the process of finally moving, but my car has just quit running. It was paid off, I loved it, but there’s a security lock that no auto shop seems to be able to figure out, and I have to continue to pay diagnostic and labor fees, not to mention what it costs to tow it.  And now I’ve had to pay for a rental. 

So instead of being able to take advantage of my new landlord’s generosity and moving things in little by little before my move in date on the first, I’m stuck waiting and paying for a moving company. Not having drains or toilets that work, no car, not being able to do dishes or laundry has affected me negatively and it’s making me feel like a failure. My dad is on disability and my sister was just diagnosed with MS, so I’m trying not to burden them with this.  I just have days where I can’t even get out of bed.  My boyfriend and I ended things because we were both going through so much that it was not only affecting us, but his kids, which is unacceptable. 

I just feel like a loser. I paid off my car like I was supposed to, I go to work, I pick up shifts, I saved money for this move, I’ve downsized and I’m moving to a place that will save me money and allow me to go back to school.  Now I have to buy a car outright because what’s the point of moving to a place that’s cheaper just to spend the extra money on a car payment?  I feel like every time I have something to smile about, the universe takes it away. 

I’m not looking for sympathy, as much as a game plan. I’m completely overwhelmed, but I also know I can get through this. My question is, when I get to my new place (which is a blank slate with working facilities), how to I stop myself from those days in bed?  What helps other people?  Where do I even start?  I want to be a better version of myself, but I just feel lost. "
homocidal thoughts,"my dad is verbally abusive and he lives with his parents at 44 in their basement, he somehow has a gf and im gonna live with my momma that i love so much after 6 months of rehab but ive thought to myself ""imagine people looking at me and not knowing, thinking everything is normal, if i killed him and no one knew"" i wouldnt bc no parent no matter what should bury their child and id get in trouble, i love gory and dark shit and it doesnt blind me. i take certraline, guanfacine and methalphenadate
idk how to spell them

i dont fight in school bc id prolly kill the person by curb stomping their head.
ik where to shoot or stab a person to cripple or kill, idk how ik but i do. im getting increasing worried as the thoughts become more frequent, and more violent, id never hurt my momma tho bc i love her to death no matter what. (i have a psyc dr)

Trying to hang on.,"Why are all these posts so old?  Did everyone suddenly get “happy”?  In my case being around people (family) is what gets me so damned depressed. The biggest hypocrites in your life are your family members.  Or those you consider to be family.  They treat you one way to your face and the thing is they are so into themselves they can’t see your misery or worries and go about their own lives not seeing how things affect you and hurt you.  I may be rambling but it does feel good to write/type it.  Helps get that tension in your chest just a little less tight - through those great big sighs you’re letting out.   I don’t know if or when I will post again. This has helped me a little bit and I honestly pray that it helps someone else know that they are not alone in this great big world of liars, backstabbers, hypocrites and users.  I’m trying really hard to hang on. "
lost and alone,"I just wanted to get my feelings out. 
I lost my job about 6 months ago and since then I’ve spiralled into a deep deep depression. I have suffered bouts of anxiety and depression over the years but this is the worst it’s been. 
I have severe self hatred. I can’t see why anyone would want to be near me. Even looking at my own face makes me angry. 

I’m late twenties, living at home, no job and feeling like there is no way out. 

The thought of pushing myself back into full time work just makes me feel even more depressed. I can’t see a way out of this apart from the obvious. I am angry all the time, I can’t have a conversation without crying or getting cross. It’s a weird feeling, I don’t even want any help I just want to sort of slip away and not exist. It might sound strange to say but sometimes I feel safe in my depression because the thought of having to exist in the outside world again just seems too much.

I want to be left alone and forgotten. I’ve lost nearly all my friends because of this, I don’t reply to people’s messages, I don’t see anyone. It all seems too late. I cannot be bothered with anything. I haven’t left the house in a week. I see no point in anything.

Im sorry I just needed to vent in a place where I know people understand."
My start,"DAY 1 

I’ve decided I need a platform to post my thoughts anonymously so the people I know don’t freak out every time I’m sad or suicidal. Welcome to my thread I guess I don’t really know how this works."
Revenge,I trought I had friends but I didn't they all left me pls what should I do to make them suffer the most when I'm gonna kill myself
who else is in their late 20s-early 30s,"and hasn't done shit? I'm curious. 

check in here. "
I’m starting to feel sick,"Symptoms seem to be evolving.  My legs feel super heavy, my head aches constantly, and I feel extremely bloated and inflamed in my face. 

Everything physically hurts. "
I feel like I might as well lay down in a hole and rot,"I fucking hate university. I find my course interesting but I hate the lifestyle, and I am constantly feeling worthless. 

&#x200B;

I feel so worthless, I feel like its up to me to change things but I can't. Worse thing is that barely anyone understands me and what I am going through. Life just feels like a chore.

&#x200B;

:( I do feel like I should just be like other students and drink/smoke. Maybe thats why I am so miserable, but even when I used to drink/go clubbing I would feel unhappy/awkward in the club anyway while drunk"
Is this a symptom?,"I am a college student, close enough to graduating. 

I stopped trying to accept challenges because I fear that I will fail. Also no motivation to accomplish them. I used to be different, used to just do it. Do my essays etc

Lately, only the thought of these essays gives me anxiety. What if I fail? 
I don’t apply for jobs, because what if I’m not good enough and embarrass myself?

I know that just doing these things will make me happier but there’s something in me that stops me from trying. It’s like I’m stuck.

I am at a point where I should find out what I want to do in my life. Being at this decisive and crucial point in my life makes me anxious, like I’d rather stay at this stadium where everything is still open. I don’t wanna go in no direction cause that might close other doors. 

All my friends are leaving town this summer because they will have finished university and will start their jobs. I should feel happy for them but all I feel is jealousy because I also want to feel like I belong somewhere. It eats me up, and I have been feeling scared of life and kind of numb since like early 2018.

So my question is: Is this a common symptom, being too scared and hesitant to do anything?"
I broke down and went home an hour into my shift,"This is kind of a vent I guess, I don't know where to turn to right now.

I work in fast food and I've been managing fine for a year now. I haven't been late, haven't skipped work...

But lately my depression has been creeping in and I've stopped feeling satisfaction when doing things.

One of my goldfish died yesterday and I ended up laying in bed, motionless for most of the day.

Today I had to go to work but there were just so much stress. I had drive thru, there were cars just coming in one after another, I would take an order, turn off my mic and then another car would just drive in and start taking into my ear.

I ended up giving out the wrong order to one car and I just dreaded the fact that he would probably come back and yell at me in 10 minutes.

One of my co-workers removed all my side snacks from the fry screen so I became lost in what I needed.

One car that had a $20 order gave me a bunch of small coins to pay for it all.

When I was almost done with counting all the coins, a co-worker came up to me and asking a lot of questions about the order I gave out wrong which made me forget how much I had counted...

I just ended up throwing all the coins on the counter, saying ""I can't do this"", threw off the drive thru headset and stormed out...

I couldn't even clock out because I was the one in charge of both the registers and if I clock out, they won't work. You also need a manager to approve you clocking out with their own card...

I've been crying, considering going back, but if I did I would probably just break down again. I dunno, I feel that I just can't deal with anything right now, especially not work."
Anti depressants,"Are they really worth it? I’ve tried 3 not having much success, thoughts just keep getting more intense. I just don’t like how they make me feel but I want to feel better ..."
Feeling like an idiot and not being able to escape.,"I feel like this time of the year gets to me, especially with my academics and mental health. It’s been a tough road to get to feeling mentally better but there’s always a nagging feeling it’ll come back to me and it’s starting now.

Last spring I dropped a class due to extreme anxiety issues to the point where i was hospitalized. I’ve tried to not let that weigh me down but I cant help but feel like a failure everytime i look back on it. This spring i’m barely passing a class that has my entire career riding on it. Despite the encouragement and therapy i genuinely feel like i’m developing some sort of learned helplessness and unwillingly gave up. 

I feel lost, stupid, and worthless for just repeating my mistakes and not understanding what I’m doing wrong. every success feels like pure luck and every failure feels deserved. my future feels like it’s falling apart from the seams and all i can do is watch. "
I'm lonely,"Last night I completely broke down, I gave a million reasons to my family as to why this happened but I really only have one. I'm lonely. I'm lonely and it's no longer just surfacing as depression, it's surfacing as anger and hate for myself. All I ever wanted was to have a partner to confide to and share my life with, and I've never had one. I want to know what it's like to be in a healthy relationship and have someone show me love and affection, but I've never had it and I'm convinced now that I never will. Every day I watch with envy all of the relationships my friends are in, every time I'm forced to hear about my friends sexual encounters and the women they've been with something within me continues to die. I'm embarrassed over my nonexistent sex life and my lack of intimate relationships, and I know I've lost all the time to have these experiences as they are behind me and the future doesn't look like it'll shift either. I've gotten help in the past, I've been through therapy, seen counselors, and taken medication, but I'm through with getting help. Life isn't worth living if I don't have anyone to share it with. I confided to a friend last night that I don't intend on being alive much longer, and I'm true to keeping that intention."
"I don't want to sound like an asshole, but","whenever I feel down for whatever reason I check by here and see how many people actually have it worse than me (suicide, relatives / friends that died, etc) and althought I don't feel better it really makes my brain shut up.

can anyone relate ?"
How do you open up to a doctor when you're depressed but have an active life?,"I've struggled with anxiety and periods of depression for a number of years. I'm not really sure what happened, but this weekend I was with some friends and had a sudden realisation that I needed to tell somebody about it. My friends were already aware of my anxiety, but I openly told them that I've been struggling with depression as well.

After talking to them about it they told me I should probably seek some professional support, which I agreed to, but now I'm questioning how to approach it. Unlike many people here, I am somebody who has depression but also lives quite an active life. I have a job, I have friends I like (although I don't get to see them much, which partly causes my depression), and I regularly go to the gym.

I don't know how to go to a doctor and tell them that I'm not happy, when I have the ability to sustain a somewhat normal life. I feel like to a doctor it looks like I'd be faking it or something. I think because of my anxiety I've always feared letting the depression turn me into somebody who doesn't get outside and do things. I am so scared of being unemployed, alone and homeless that despite being unhappy I force myself to appear and live normally to other people. I'd rather be active and unhappy than isolated and unhappy, if that makes sense.

I don't know if anyone else here is like this, if so, how did you go about getting support? I feel a bit ashamed to tell a doctor I'm depressed when there's other people out there who are so bad that they can't get out of bed or make a proper meal for example. It would be nice to hear from other people in similar situations.
"
Please help.,What is the point of living depressed? I can't have what I want. Don't ask. I've only been existing these past 6 years. It hurts to wake up everyday. I just want to sleep forever.
Anyone here from India?,"



Just a bit curious, wanted to know how many people from my country are depressed, and why.

How do you know when to end therapy?,"I’ve been in therapy for nearly half of my life. I’ve made some decent progress and have some solid coping mechanisms and I’ve forgiven myself for a lot of things (though maybe not everything). I’m sure there are some things I could work on, but lately it feels like going to therapy is akin to picking a scab that is trying to heal on its own. My sessions feel stagnant and sometimes feel like they’re just drawing more attention to things that may just need to rest for awhile. 

My biggest concern is that I’m underestimating the impact of stopping or taking a break. At this point, however, I feel like therapy may be doing more harm than good or at the very least has become neutral. 

Has anyone else gone through a similar experience? I’m trying to decide whether it’s worth my time to continue with therapy or time to maybe walk away and take a break for awhile. "
Why do I always feel like crying?,Just all the time I feel like I’m holding back tears. My life isn’t bad things are actually going good rn but I’m constantly wanting to just curl into a ball and cry anywhere I am

I like to daydream about what the world would be like if I were never born.,"It's like that episode of The Fairly Oddparents where Timmy Turner wishes to see what the world would be like if he had never been born, and finds out how much better things could have been. Makes me wonder how much better off my family would have been without me."
Struggling to complete my education,"These past few weeks have been hell, depression-wise. I’m not suicidal anymore like I used to, but I’m highly demotivated, I have no energy and I’m in a deep pit of loneliness on the daily. Every time I try to talk about my loneliness with someone, they try to blame me for it, so I keep quiet about it. It doesn’t stop the pain, though. I’m on medication, Citalopram, and it worked for a while. But...

I’ve applied for university, but at this rate I won’t end up going. I spent 2 full weeks out of sixth form college and I’ve gotten so far behind it’s overwhelming. There’s long, long periods of time at college when I’m just surrounded by loads of people joking around and having fun while I’m just sat on my phone doing nothing. I wish I had friends. My family members and even my college mental health advisor (we don’t have counsellors in college because apparently it’s not the college’s problem if you have mental health issues) say my social skills are fine, so what’s wrong with me? Why do I have to be cursed with this godforsaken disability called Asperger’s Syndrome?

I could quit college now, but where would I go? Do I even have the skills for any job? I don’t know how to cook or clean. I don’t want to stay with my mum, either, as she’s really unsupportive. I feel so alone and I don’t know what to do. I’m going to be an actual, unironical basement dweller at this rate."
"I feel so alone, but have many friends. I’m caught in a loop, failing at all aspects of life ATM. What could I do to move on and stop being so sad all the time?","Hello, this is my first time reaching out to reddit. I’m a 21 year old male and lately I’ve been struggling so so much with my self esteem, personal relationships and life in general, I don’t know who to turn to anymore and I want to vent, I feel really scared because for the first time in life i’ve actually contemplated suicide. I know I won’t do it but the idea still lurks my mind in these moments. 

“They say the people with the highest smiles are the one’s who have it the worst”, that quote basically describes me at the moment. Nonetheless, let me give you a background of what I’m struggling with...

I feel like I’m a huge burden to my family. I can feel their frustration when I come in the room. They only want to listen when they want and not really when I need them. My father is recently in jail and i’ve become the father figure for my younger sisters. And I also am the support for my mother, I have a lot of weight on my shoulders. My decisions are wack, I’ve switched majors 3 times.

I feel my friends have a better time without me, they can easily be without me and go to parties without me and basically i know i’m less important to them. They get frustrated with me for being to nice sometimes. They are frustrated of listening to my current issues. Although they don’t know about my dad in jail.

My girlfriend is so done with me. She used to be my support but know she just gets angry at me all the time. She’s leaving to go abroad soon and she sometimes tells me she can’t wait to go to get crazy when she leaves for a year. Also, every time we talk we end up fighting because of ordinary things. When we hang out she ends up falling asleep by just talking with me, and whenever she’s with her friends she can be talking to them up to 6am. She constantly tells my i’m really mysterious and that she hates that and that she hates when I’m to close to her at the club, etc.

Basically I feel I’m failing in all aspects of my life at the moment. I haven’t matured out if thus situation and I can’t let things go. I’m failing to do basic things such as homework, exercise and I’m even failing at starting a business which frustrates me even more.

Reddit, what can I do to move on? I’m currently going to a therapist but it isn’t helping me at all. I feel okay for a few hours and afterwards I end up feeling just as bad or maybe worse. Are their any tips for feeling better? Any support groups? Any books I could read? Anything would help at the moment. Thanks for reading and sorry if the grammar is confusing. Good day."
DAE just have the urge to just quit,"Not only life but everything else within like job, going outside, talking to people, living in the same place etc, whatever it may be. Like I'm just so tired of trying to struggle to be okay (let's admit that happy is too far away right now) that I just want to make all the changes at once. I'm so annoyed with doing the same thing everyday. Its like im just going around and round in the washing machine of life, being slapped against the agitator again and again but the dirty of feeling like this never goes away. 

Some small part of me hopes that there will come a day when I get free but for now I just want to go somewhere else and litterally leave my problems and shit behind, become some unknown person in a sea of tourists or something. Its not so easy though because tethers keep us here in the mess whether it be family, brokeness, jobs or just the fear of being called lazy, worthless, disappointment. Death seems easier than running away. 

Something about the song Chaos in Motion by I The Mighty just speaks to me. 

This post is not even one cohesive thought :("
Every minute is a mountain,"Currently in the middle of an intense depressive episode. I know logically that these things come in waves, that eventually I won’t feel like killing myself, but at the moment I’m having a hard time getting through every single second. I made it to work today, which is something. But I just don’t know how to ride this wave. This happens every time. I feel like I’m in a hole that I can’t climb out of. Every minute is a mountain that I have to drag myself over.

Feeling like this also makes the times when I’m not feeling completely hopeless worse. Why bother feeling okay when eventually I’ll just feel horribly depressed again?

I can’t find a way to cope with this. "
Feeling pretty hopeless and purposeless.,"I’m an 18 y/o male. I go to a university in the US and I hate what I’m studying. I’m not interested in other fields either. I love art and have thought about transferring to an art school nearby for a little while but over the past couple of days my excitement has diminished. 

I haven’t connected with people at school on much more than surface level. My friends from high school have moved on to other things and for the most part I don’t talk to them now. I have a long distance girlfriend that I cling to because she’s the only person that I feel like loves me truly and gets me but I’m numb to the emotions I once felt for her and I feel like a shitty boyfriend because I’m not passionate about the romance we once had. 

I just feel so hopeless. I’m from an Air Force family and moving around so much growing up has made it so it’s hard for me to understand permanence and feel like I can’t settle into a place. I can’t see myself being where I am for the next 3 years but I really can’t see myself being anywhere else either. 

I’d love to travel abroad for a change of scenery but I’m scared that it won’t be any different. I just constantly want more and It’s never enough. 

Part of me wants to drop out and work so I can at least have some sense of purpose but I feel like it’ll be the same old thing where it’ll happen and I’ll still long for something else. 

Sorry for the long post. Thanks for reading."
Has anyone taken Lexapro and not gained weight?,"I’ve been feeling like I should take something lately, but don’t want to gain tons of weight. I’m not suicidal or anything, I’ve just had a very bad year and doing the day to day has been feeling like a struggle lately. My mother and husband both take generic forms of lexapro, and I think it would be a good fit. They’ve also both struggled with their weight since being on it. My husband has to follow a very extreme diet to keep his weight in a healthy range. My mother hasn’t gained a ton, but she is pre-diabetic now and has constant sugar cravings despite having a very healthy diet and exercising. Is this just how it is? I think gaining a lot of weight would run the risk of making me feel more depressed than I do now. I can’t afford to buy new clothes etc. Thanks for any help! "
Need help w computer stuff,"I lost my job feud do this depression.  Am hung ho about solving the problem. But am struggling w on line applications.  Been trying snag a job. But it keeps freaking out on me. One thing I noticed... and may be the problem, is my set information.  My address is wrong by 1 no.
Everytime I get there, the site freezes. I'm not sure that's a good explanation,  but I cant stay stagnant in this room. Am trying, to no avail. Want to give up, but wont. Anyone?"
What’s next?,"Next week I turn 18, I really should be more excited but honestly I feel as if it’s just going to be another day, there’s always one question in my head and that’s just what’s next? I never know what to do with myself and more recently I’ve come to terms with why that might be, when I was 13 in my first year of high school I started smoking weed and it was just an occasional thing to do I was warned countless times about how it affects your mental health but I didn’t see a problem with it, I was naive.

5 years later and here I am, I got great grades in school I got into the college course I really wanted and then I dropped out of college, I lost interested I really just couldn’t find anything I was passionate to learn about and ever since I’ve not done anything for the last 2 years, all my friends envy that I have no responsibilities and all this free time but I don’t think any of them realise when you have been doing nothing for so long it’s hard to find fun in anything.

Trouble is within the last 2 years the only structure I’ve really had is smoking weed and I think that’s been really detrimental on how I feel in my own head. I have the desire to go out and get a job, make money, be successful and live life with structure but I lack the motivation and confidence to act upon it,  I’ve had odd jobs of weeks work here and there and I’ve got on with it but never stuck it as I just come back to weed and it kills my motivation.

I’m stuck in a cache 22 as to help myself I need to leave weed behind and get back into a routine but every time I try and quit I have nothing else to and find myself being lured back in to it, the fact that all my friends also smoke it doesn’t help.

I’m not really sure what I wanted to achieve by writing this post but it’s been on my mind for a long time and if anything I just wanted to share how I feel.
"
I'm always losing passion for the things I love and I have no Idea why,"I've been in many fandoms, Interested in many things, but it all always just starts fading away overnight and I don't know why, its the same with some people I love, sometims my love just goes overnight, I just want to know if anyone else has felt like this before."
Depression and anxiety,"Hello everyone! First time being here but there a reason. It pretty obvious lol.

I feel so depressed it suck it honestly suck. I never knew how to felt to be wanted by someone or loved. I never had a best friend I never felt like I fit in.

I go to college but will be taking a gap year to work on my depression. I felt even worse after deciding to take a gap year to work on my mental health although I do hope to see a therapist and to get straight A’s to get into Harvard medical school a dream school of mine. Medical school is the only thing that keep me motivated tbh. 

I guess becoming a surgeon was my only motivation. Not really a person but mainly becoming a surgeon will always be my motivation. It somewhat sad because I don’t know how to feel motivated by someone else.

At the moment I work at McDonald’s there been some good times and bad times but even at work I feel unwanted by my co-workers. They were nice but started to ignore me once I got to know them. I said “hi how your day?” But they never respond.  In my head I alway think is due to my social awkwardness that prevent me from making friends but it alway comes up being with my appearance. 

Going through elementary to high school was alway difficult. I was a loner who was pick on and bully. I never found a true friend that I can look up. Most of my friends that I made were alway idiotic for doing stupid stuff and other were so ignorant they decided wanted me to suffer. 

Big rant I know lol sorry fellas. "
I got no one...,"So my whole life, I've never had a friend irl. I am a 20 year old guy and I'm currently a sophomore in college and I still don't have any friends, girl friends, or people to talk to on a daily basis, mainly because of my social anxiety. Everyone else around me at college has these people and it makes me depressed and jealous because I got no one. Online hasn't been going well either because I don't have anyone to talk to constantly and I'm still lonely. Online people keep leaving me without a trace as well or taking forever to respond. I'm tired of finding people saying they will keep talking with me but then they just rarely talk or just disappear. I don't know how much longer I can live with this pain."
"Recommendations of medical help, don't always help","I understand, medical help probably would help alot. But some people (such as myself) don't have the money or resources to receive that kind of care. I have epilepsy and am struggling to receive proper care for that. Every time someone suggest therapy or such for my depression, it just ""reminds"" me that I don't have what is needed to receive that kind of care. Which is one thing that I am depressed about in the first place."
I seem to have my life in order yet I'm still depressed and anxious,"2-3 years back I was broke struggling musician. I had a really tough breakup with my suicidal ex-girl friend who I cared for while she cheated on me. I was unhealthy, didn't exercise, smoked too much weed and I barely slept.

For the past 20 months or so I've been going to the gym at least 3 times per week. I lift weights and run. I do yoga. I'm actually in rather good shape. I sleep at the same time every night. I wake up at the same time every day. I now earn more money than all of my friends and family (which is nice considering I've never actually had a 'real' job). I've travelled around the world a lot (I even lived in Hanoi, Vietnam for a few months). I cook fresh, healthy food. Don't get me wrong - I treat myself a lot. But I'm balanced. I smoke weed once or twice every couple weeks. Each pillar of my life seems pretty well looked after. I mean, I don't have a relationship and I'd like to get laid a little more than I currently do but I don't think that's the source of my issues.

I'm definitely not as bad as I was before. Exercise is by *far* the best thing that could have happened to me in order to get my life together. But what's with these suicidal thoughts every day? I can't have a single tiny thing go wrong without visualising myself hanging from a rope or something along those lines. It's just so dark to me. They're like flashing images in my head whenever there's a slight hiccup in my daily life. I don't even think I'll act on it in the foreseeable future but it just seems strange to me. It's like it's a comfort that I know I can always kill myself if things get really bad.

I'm also super anxious 24/7 still but I feel like that's just engrained into who I am at my core. I feel like it defines me as I've always been a shy, anxious guy. This is something I feel like I can live with for the time being. It's the suicidal thoughts that I might not be able to live with in the long run.

If anyone can relate to this or give some advice, I'd really appreciate it."
No one would go to my funeral,"Everyone from high school thought I was annoying. I got ignored and excluded from every social circle and no one talks to me anymore unless they need my photography.

My mom might be sad for a few weeks but she’s got three other kids, she’ll be fine."
I don't know how much more i can take.,"I don't know what to do anymore. I had gotten into a graphic design school. Today, they took back my acceptance until I can get financial issues taken care of. It's not possible for me to take care of it. I'm a stay at home mom and my husband has a full-time job that doesn't pay much. Our taxes were taken by the government for his student loans. Our CPA had said that we don't have a livable income. I can't take all this stress anymore. Not one day goes by that I'm ready to call it quits. I love my kids but this is too much. "
How can I better support someone?,"Not sure if this is the right sub, but here goes. 
My boyfriend is feeling a little depressed. He was able to tell me that much. I've been trying to be a little more active and mindful around the house (I've been doing more of the cleaning and grocery shopping and such) to help him out and make sure he doesn't have to worry about it. I just want to make sure that i dont miss anything that might help him. He has a hard time talking about what he is feeling, so it's hard for me to see how he is doing or what might better help him. I feel like he isnt very talkative at all anymore. 
I love him so much and hate seeing him like this. Is there anything I'm missing? Anything else I could be doing?  "
Career Fraud,"So it's almost 2 years and a half that I am a web developer, I learned,created and when it was possible, I worked hard in this field. I was very depressed, I dropout a graduation in Engineering and had nothing in my future. But I received a opportunity as a intern in web development in a startup. I'm still very shy and I had dificult to impress and create value in my first months. But I am very good in self learning and I was able to even with my shyness behavior, demonstrate my value and proactive/self dependent as my programming skills grew up.I even became a partner from the company.  A lot of clients dropped out after some unexpected end of a company that currently was the system of our billing system. My partner told me that, but I hardly believed, I think its also associated with the drop of quality of our services and the time to adapt to that ( we had one month to integrate with another payment system, I did it but with a lot of bugs just in soon after the deadline). Since middle 2018, almost all the programming stuff I did, so I am felling very bad upon this and I am blamming myself for we don't have any option to avoid the end. I see my career as a fraud, I'm doing some interviews, but I'm still shy, I don't fell confident anymore. I'm scared with 28 years old. That's was my only job experience. I  am taking some meds, because I already had suicidal thoughts, and it's starting to come the depression again. I flert with suicide sometimes.I am affraid and scared."
Trying to find a post about a guy finally understanding his girlfriends' depression for my husband.,"I saw this post on her ea while ago about how a guy finally understood his girlfriends depression and anxiety, he felts bad for making her feel bad for being late and forgetting things and other things. This post really touched me and I wanted to share it with my husband as he doesn't understand depression and told me that he thinks its just ""chronic sadness"" If you guys can help me find this post I'd be very greatful. I've tried looking by searching for it but have had no such luck.  "
Falling for someone I can't be with,"I'm not exactly sure what else to really say. She is amazing, funny, and beautiful. She actually listens to me. She's seems to care. I trust her more than anyone else. She's the closest thing I have to a friend despite us being coworkers. The only problem is that she recently married. No, I haven't told her how I felt because she was always in the relationship since I met her (4 years). I probably won't ever tell her because she is the closest thing I have to a friend and I don't want to lose it. I'll just keep smiling and hopefully I'll get over it. "
Getting through the day?,"I dont know what to do. I woke up this morning and I  felt empty.  I'm at work sitting in my car, taking a break, trying to compose myself but it's not working. I really just am tired. I'm tired of fighting it and now I'm just afraid what will happen because I can't fight it anymore. I dont want to bother anyone, and I really hope this is the right place for this. I'm sorry if it's not. How do you guys get through the day? I just want to clock out and just drive until I disappear. "
Anyone here on meds?,"Recently started meds, and I have not been hungry at all, and makes me nauseous to think about food and eat. Anyone else have the same issue? Is it temporary? I know my doctor said to give it 3 weeks. "
Do you remember the “mom will be sad” meme?,"Even though some people find it funny or it’s their way to cope with it, I truly feel that’s my only reason to be here. My parents often tell me there so much I can do in the future and I shouldn’t give up but I just think I don’t want them to be sad :( but then again because of my failures they will be sad too "
What do you do when you feel there's no reason to live?,"I have nothing to live for. No friends, no career, I don't look forward to anything. The only reason I don't end it is because my mom deserves better.

"My hearts been broken so many times, I'm starting to think that I'm unlovable...",I also have a gnawing sensation in my stomach thats only getting worse and everything sucks.
Somebody to Love,"Queen -Somebody To Love 

I think this will be on repeat mode all day.  I wish I could find someone who was eternally mine. Someone that can’t wait to see me or be with me.  Someone whose heart beats just for me. Maybe that wasn’t meant for me in this world. Maybe I wasn’t meant for this world. 

My sorrow isn’t just about love. It’s about everything that encompasses me as a being. It’s the short lived satisfaction which spirals into confusion. Nothing is long lasting with me, my mind goes non-stop always wanting more, needing more.  Eternally unsatisfied. When things are out of line, when I don’t understand what happened or why, or even why I find myself where I am not supposed to be, I get very close to the edge. I don’t want to be there. I hate being there but my actions lately have me there with my toes right there, right on the ledge. "
Am I a Lost Cause? Would Meds Even Help Me?,"I have made this post in another subreddit but it was buried so I decided to post this again in hopes of maybe actually getting some responses this time.

I have been struggling with the fear of mortality ( Existential Crises ) for the past week. I get no sleep because the second me and my boyfriend are laid down and the room goes silent, my mind starts racing. It got so bad last night that I threw up. I don't know of I puked from something else but the anxiety is the only thing I can put together. 2 weeks ago I had that nasty flu that's been going around and I think thats what triggered my crises because I legit thought I was going to be one of those flu deaths. It was like my life flashed before my eyes and I can never go back to the normal way I lived my life. I am so jealous of anyone who is able to block out the thoughts of the inevitable. I am so so jealous. I wish my mind would stop thinking sometimes and that all this anxiety would go away. Every night since this has happened I have been waking up 3-4 times a night. I feel like I am getting no rest ( I have even been taking melatonin which I don't normally use but I've just been so restless I'm desperate for a full night of sleep ). I feel like no therapist or medication would really help me and Im open to the idea of going but I feel like they will just tell me I'm crazy or something and not to think about it. Idk what could a person like me even do. I just want to be able to have one full day without a panic attack or racing thoughts that make me feel like I'm just drowning.
I have a wonderful loving boyfriend who wants to help me so badly, he has been doing any small thing he can for me to try and ease my stress but I'd say it only works 30% of the time. 
Im so scared I'm adding so much more stress to his life that he doesn't need.. He says I don't but I am always crying now and having issues.
I just want to live my life 😭😭

I also want to add that when I started dealing with this crises I did a ton of research, which maybe wasn't the best idea for me.
I have been trying to work on having constant distractions, but the second everything gets quiet and I'm left with my thoughts, it all starts again.."
Does anybody here feel like they daydream all the time instead of living their life?,"Like I said. Daydreaming about the things I'd want to happen; about the things I can do, but won't, because of my social anxiety, which lead to my depression. Daydreaming about having conversations with people I know that probably won't happen. Daydreaming about not being lonely...

It's fucking exhausting, knowing that I can't make any of those dreams come true even though there's literally nothing holding me back, except myself."
Dealing with isolation at work,"Hello, just some quick background:

\- I work from home with a pretty good job, software engineer

\- Main office is 4 hours away, i visit once in a while, but it's a long drive

\- I've worked here for 15+ years

\- I am married with a family

\- Diagnosed GAD/OCD (if that helps here) - take antidepressants, low dose concerta from my doctor to help focus, not diagnosed add or anything

&#x200B;

I tend to be a pretty private person and pretty quiet, which is great and people/family understand that. I work by myself in total isolation in my office in my house, but for the past 3 years or so I've started really feeling the isolation. Even though I enjoy keeping to myself, I'm finding it pretty rough to not have much human contact during the day, I speak to others at work about once a day or so on my phone or via e-mail. I've always been a bit of a loner and enjoy time myself, but I'm beginning to do things like run YouTube videos on a separate computer screen or even live streams from places like cafe's, etc. just to have the (social?) contact, etc., as odd as that may seem, it seems to help a little bit. (Maybe even though I'm a loner, it's human nature to be social?)

&#x200B;

My wife works an opposite shift for me on most days. So aside from my kids, and my kids events/sports I don't have much social contact.

&#x200B;

Just by writing this out, maybe I've answered my own question, maybe i just need more social time for myself. Anyone have any thoughts or has anyone else worked from home and know something that can help out during long isolated days? ( I recently put daylight LED bulbs in my office which has actually helped somewhat).

&#x200B;

Thanks.

&#x200B;

Edit: Fixed a few typos."
I feel hopeless,"I used to have aspirations as a kid but now the only thing I can ever see myself doing in the future is killing myself. I'm stupid and have stopped trying in school/anything that will benefit me. My junior year is next year and while everybody is going to be applying to colleges I'm gonna be sulking the corner like the depressing fuck I am. Every group of friends I have eventually leave me because of my inclination to sit inside and play video games I'm not even good at. The group of friends who did stick around with me for some reason know I'm depressed but tell me to man up. I fell in love with a girl and every waking moment I can't stop thinking of her but one of my best friends also likes her and I don't want to hurt him. He has no idea about my feelings for her but he seems so happy even after seeing her for a few seconds. She barely responds to my texts and my anxiety always tells me she avoids me. I have a loving family but they just piss me off so easily talking about work and how they expect me to be just as great as my older siblings. I quit fencing, the only sport I ever did, because I was a fucking joke at my club and even the coaches knew it. My family tried putting me in therapy but I absolutely fucking hated it and I only feel despair. I just want to sleep forever."
My journey,"Ah man, I always swore to myself I'd never do one of these, but fuck it and sorry for the heaviness 

I remember crying for nothing when I was really young, a lot and having really bad mood swings when I was a teenager and throwing things off my bedroom walls for no apparent reason, smashing up CDs and the such. No rhyme or reason.
Just teenage hormones...

As I got older the feelings didn't go away though and they kept appearing in different forms. The most popular being utter self loathing and hatred. Feeling inadequate as a person. This ultimately lead to dropping out of college, dropping out of one of the UK's best drama schools, randomly quitting jobs,  self harming and some rather weak attempts at the old taking your own life, luckily I'm a big old pussycat. The thought of what I put my family and friends through still makes me feel ill with regret and shame. Thankfully I have gotten a hold of that physical aspect through medication, many wonderful health professionals and family and friends, but unfortunately the mental aspect still berates me from time to time.

Like a large percentage of the population,  I struggle with depression. Some days I'm fabulous and others I'm not so fabulous. Some days, most, infact, I'm on top of the world. Motivated,  confident... happy, but then comes along this big black train that steamrolls right into your life and cripples you. When this happens it is game over. I hate everyone and everything, I'm angry and pissed off at everything, but at none more so than myself.  I spend a lot of time trying to make people laugh because laughing is important in this life, I think. Seeing people laugh makes me feel worth while, it makes me feel liked. But when this train comes along, the laughter fucks off. And life without laughter isnt a life i want to be a part of.. Losing the ability to care about anything is pretty much what happens. I don't care about the things that mean everything to me on any regular day. A feeling of frustration builds up inside to the point that I want to scream and punch a wall, or myself. I want to burst out crying and hurt the people I love most. I want the world to just fuck off, I want there to be nothing...and that's not me. I don't think that's who I am.

Anyway..

The train has been making regular stops recently and it's been fucking garbage, but I also know why. I haven't been particularly well for the last few months, to the point i haven't been able to eat for weeks at a time, the plus side being I'm seeing numbers on the scales I haven't seen for a long time...silver linings. I haven't been able to study for a life changing exam due to not being able to focus or get out of bed. Anxiety creeped in, no sleep, stress, fear, resentment and now depression. As I've gotten older I've started to try and examine and identify the possible reasons or ""triggers""... and boy those fuckers are varied. Songs, smells, places, people, anything can be a trigger and when the trigger is pulled it's difficult to get back normality

Depression is a wee arsehole right and it comes in many shapes and sizes. It's ok to be depressed or anxious or stressed. Like it's really really really ok to be like that. It's ok to feel worthless and pathetic. There's nothing wrong with feeling like you want to just disappear for a while or to stop talking or stop laughing... What's not ok is believing that you are on your own, because you are not. The one thing I have learnt from my journey on this train and it's been a tough lesson to learn, taught to me by my wife and my family is that you are not alone. This world is a shitty shitty place at times but if we all try and stick together we might just be ok. No matter how much you don't want it, think it or believe it, we are good for one another. 

I'm trying to not give a fuck anymore. To not give a fuck about the things that mean fuck all. I'm trying to not give a fuck about depression, about being liked or being succesfull and that's why I'm posting this. I don't want to care if you think this cringey or attention seeking. If I wanted attention I'd get on stage or post one of my hilarious Instagram stories.. What I do give a fuck about is people not knowing that it's ok to feel like this or that it's not normal...it is normal, really fucking normal. I give a fuck that my family and friends and strangers know that depression, like a cold comes along out the blue and can affect anyone. The most likely or unlikely people. That yeah, it is normal and it is ok to feel like a fucking emotional wreck and a failure. . So let's all cut the bullshit and stop pretending to be people that we are not and be the people we are. Everybody wears a mask in life, but it's ok to take that mask off, be vulnerable, to not be ""ok"" and for you to do what you need to do. You aren't a burden and you aren't a weight. You're a gift and you are special and we are lucky to have one another.

Always a failure and always will be,Yesterday and today are just reminders of my position in life. How much of a failure I am and how much I will always be a failure. Too broke get get my cat from a vet. Now too broke to afford a flight to visit my father while he's alone in the hospital dealing with heart failure. I'm truly a shit person.
Struggling socially at work,"Do you struggle at work socially?
I just started a new job. The first days were good and I think made a good impression. But now I feel the might see another side of me. I become less talkative, I imagine they have a hard time figuring me out.
And I feel awful, why do I do this? It’s like I can’t keep up the “facade”. And I think the others must hate me, wish I wasn’t hired and so on. It takes nothing to make me feel left out, and it becomes a downward spiral.
I just feel so bad today. Feel like quitting. 
Would like to hear from others feeling the same and struggling socially at work."
Thinking about the past makes me sad,"the past just makes me sad

life was easier

life was better

i wont be able to see my friends anymore because we all went to different countries

damn its sad

&#x200B;

but its ok keep this positive energy up

i guess i kinda need to just let it go and focus on the future"
I’m failing my classes,"I started classes 2 weeks ago (they’re 8 weeks long)  I have already fallen behind. I start a 3rd class April 4th.  

I’m on academic risk since I’ve only taken 4 classes and my overall GPA is a 1.8 (even though I passed the classes with A’s& B’s). I don’t really understand how that works but that’s how it works I guess.

I only work weekends so I have all week to get my homework done, but I don’t.  I don’t want to do it. I don’t care to do it.

But then once it’s due and then past due I worry and try to get it done but I never finish and submit it.

At night while I’m trying to sleep I can’t sleep because I know how much I didn’t do, and I’m failing and I care enough to worry but not enough to do anything about it.

I don’t know what to do to get out of this hole I’m in. I’m on heavy anti psychotics, anti depressants,  ptsd medications, and anti anxiety meds. And they obviously make me feel even worse. 

I know I need to get my degree to do the work I really want to do, but right now I don’t."
I wanna talk,"Every word spoken in my life is either superficial chitchat or business discussion.

&#x200B;

Every thought, emotion and dream is stuck in my head, because I cannot open up. I do not want my friends to laugh at my preference for romantic movies, sad music and intriguing poems. I do not want anyone to know how lonely I am.

I thought I was doing better, but reddit is still my single place of honesty. You strangers are the only people that could understand me and I do not even trust you my name. The people I call friends just pressure me.

&#x200B;

I don't know if I will crack up or brake down.

Please, talk to me."
my emotional attachment ruins my life,"I don't know what caused this. my ex boyfriend cheated on me 2x and forced me to do things i wasnt comfortable with and i never broke it off, because i was too attached. i was so scared nobody else was going to be there for me. so scared nobody else would love me.

he dumped me last year, and i went through hell getting over it. only much later i realized how garbage i am.

fast forward to end of last year. i established a fwb-like relationship with a friend. i know, it's fucking stupid, but i really needed that dopamine and oxytocin lol. the sex was great, he's an amazing cuddler, we'd go to movie dates and impromptu dinner and a stroll in the park at midnight. it felt like he was my boyfriend instead of fwbs. and of course my stupid ass had to fall for him. so attached i had to alter my plans for the year.... for him.

we were in last year of uni. both international students. he told me he'd want to get serious if we end up in the same country - our visas were ending so we had to leave the country.

my plans for 2019 was set. get into grad school and enjoy the holidays. but because of what he said i began searching for jobs in said country, in hopes of staying there and him coming back because he's keen on staying.

but here i am, i got a job i dont really want in a foreign country. all alone. my primary motivation was for him. because I'm so fucking attached.

as for him? he got a new girl back in his home. i just found out today. we've been talking everyday since we parted and he told me this. he doesn't know if he's going to come back.

looking back.. i dont know what i expected. we were never exclusive. i just took a gamble because of my fucking attachment issues, he's not at fault, it's me.

I'm a fucking pathetic piece of desperate fucking shitbag that needs to die before I ruin my life again because I'm so easily attached it clouds my judgement. I'm so fucking lonely that even a hope of someone staying makes me like this.

sorry if this is incoherent, my first language isnt english and i just want to get it off my chest. to distract myself from everything. I've been suicidal for the past few weeks and I feel like this might break me I'm terrified of my own mind"
I’m selfish,I’m selfish because I want to die and I don’t care if others are affected by me dying. When I die other people won’t be my problem because I’ll be dead. Can anyone relate or am I just a heartless asshole?
Random Crying Outbursts (Possible Trigger Warning),"Hey Reddit, lately I've having outbursts of crying lately in front of people and they seemingly come from nowhere, It started Monday or Tuesday, i haven't cried in almost a year before that and i had tried to on multiple occasions. Its happened three times so far. On one of the times there was a direct cause, I had seen my brothers cat throw up, shes generally sickly because of her flea allergy but we try to keep her medicated, Anyway I'm used to cats throwing up, my cat has stomach issues, but this time was different, it looked incredibly painful, and i took an image in my head that I still cant get out.  Other than that the only independent variable seems to be that each time it happened, I was under the influence of marijuana. When it happens its not BAD though, i mean it kind of feels bad at first but its the best relief I've had in a long time. It usually comes on as an immense feeling of guilt or sadness that quickly shoots to an incredibly euphoric experience. After 5 minutes though the adrenaline goes away and I'm left with a dull feeling, Like everything goes numb. Usually followed by a bit more crying and sleep. If not that then i just feel like crap for a while. I'm just here to see if anyone is going through anything similar, and if there's any advice you guys could give me."
Don't get me wrong,"I dont want anyone to feel miserable, but I come to this sub to see other ones having problems as well and it kinda feels like a relief but also kinda bad. Pretty  fucked ikr? "
I feel “undefined”,"I’m not sure how much sense this makes. If I was asked to describe myself I’m not sure how I would answer. I’m not even sure if I could call myself average. It feels like every characteristic I’ve ever had has diminished and my personality is unrecognizable. I tried making a longer post but I ended up rambling so I deleted it. I was having trouble even defining what makes me feel this way. Hopefully I can collect my thoughts soon and try to figure out what I’ve become but in the meantime I don’t feel like anyone.

Does anyone else feel like this?
"
WOW!,"My dad just gave up on me. The only person who I was trying to impress doesn't want me because I'm not the son he wanted. I'm just some depressed, over worried, suicidal piece of shit who everyone would turn down. "
Help?,"I've been feeling almost completely numb and defeated recently, I find school nothing but a waste of time and feel no connection to me ""friends"". In short I feel stagnant and I see no way out of my current situation. 
Does anybody know what I can do to help myself, because I'm all out of ideas?"
Keep waking up in the middle of the night with dread,I keep waking up in the middle of the night at around 2-3am. The thoughts are so dreadful at this time. I keep thinking about how my life is wasted and I’ll be forever alone. I think there is a problem with my brain and sleep. It’s so weird because this only started happening 2 or so months ago and it happens every single day. Then after waking up and having breakfast the dreadful feeling goes away. Anyone know what this is?
I'm not to sure what to title this? just venting really,"I've been getting worse, after finishing school I've been so lonely because I've done nothing but drink, party and get high while my friends are making something of themselves, I thought about the army but they turned me away because I'm suicidal and covered in scars 

I miss being in a stable relationship, not fucking everyone in sight who would do it.. every weekend i risk pregnancy and for what? temporary happiness?

I don't wanna live anymore but I don't want to kill myself, I'd happily OD or get hit by a bus or killed in a car accident 

(sorry if this isn't the right place to post this, I just needed to get it off my chest)"
Stuck,"I feel so unmotivated n it bothers me. Like I rly do force myself to do stuff I want to do n it just feels like a drag instead or like there's something heavy on me. I always feel like I should be laying down, doing nothing. It's to a point where even the thought of watching anime is tiresome, which was something I use to do when I lay down. I just feel so stuck, and even when I explain it to other ppl they keep telling me to do things I've already tried. It feels like something is wedged in like a   broken popcorn kernel between teeth; once it's removed I'll feel better but I just can't seem to reach it."
Sudden Depression Onset?,"I tried to change my life around and made efforts to get out the house, meet people, eat right and all the typical advice. I found for about a year I really was having a much better time than I have had in the past. About a month ago it just started to be less effective until today when I am horribly depressed. I no longer care about anything. I don't think I've ever felt worse. It's like every joy in life just dropped away and left me a desolate grey landscape. Nothing is interesting, nothing is enjoyable. Every colour has been sucked out of the world. I can't even imagine having fun again. From my current position that seems completely impossible. 

I don't think I'm going to work tomorrow. I don't think I'm leaving the house. Nothing seems worthwhile. I'm currently trying to get the willpower to get some water. 

This is how depression is for me. There is no warning or feeling. I am truly a hopeless case. I don't think CBT can be effective because it seems unrelated to my behaviour. Antidepressants have no effect on me, I don't even tend to get side effects, it's like I'm taking nothing at all. I refuse to take them again, it's just a waste of time. I think something is wrong with my brain. "
Extreme loneliness,"I [20F] live on campus at my university and it sucks.
I lost my only friend here because I’m very difficult in friendships. I either get too attached or too distant and in this one I was way too attached. What pissed me off even more is that she told on me for having depression and all the things I told her when we were still friends. My therapist said it sounds like she was concerned for my wellbeing, but it was clearly revenge. The girls she told were RAs and I was trying to be friends with them because they’re in my major. But now I look so weird to them that I doubt they’d want to be friends. I have friends back home but I rarely see them anymore so they’re not active friendships. I’m also dating someone I met on tinder last month but I am faking it and hiding aspects of my horrible personality and I know she’ll leave me the second I become honest with her. In any friendships I’m trying to keep or start I have to act distant or else I will get attached and get hurt when they leave me. Or if I get attached they will get creeped out by me and leave me. But acting distant makes the friendship wither away. So that’s why I have no friends, and why I probably never will.

I wish I could cope with this in a healthy way. I guess all I can say is at least I haven’t done drugs or alcohol to cope. I want to play video games and draw because I know that will make me happy but I lack the motivation. 

This is just me venting. I really needed to get that off my chest but of course there is nobody in my life but my therapist I can share it with."
How do I get my libido back?,"I’m not sure if this is allowed here, or the right sub for it.  My logic is that this is a community of people with depression, maybe someone will have advice for me.

I’m a 30F with unmedicated bipolar II.  Last year I had to have 3 spinal surgeries in 10 months.  I’m disabled now.  I went from happily working two service industry jobs and living on my family’s farm to being alone 90% of my day two and a half hours from family in constant pain.

My BPII is getting worse.  My BF is a good man, but has never dealt with any inkling of depression outside the normal sadness over the death of a loved one/pet, etc..  The suicidal ideation is getting more common.  I won’t commit suicide because I’m enough of an emotional and financial burden as it is, that would just compound it.  

We rarely have sex.  I mean maybe once a month.  I have no interest in it.  Partly because intercourse is generally painful for me thanks to nerve damage.  Sometimes I fake it for BF’s sake, but he can always tell.  I like affection but don’t want to be touched in a sexual way.   I can sometimes muster up flirty banter but the thought of the actual act just stirs nothing in me.  He’s always patient but I can tell he’s frustrated because his needs aren’t getting met either.

Have any of you dealt with this?  How do I overcome it?

ETA:  I don’t have insurance so counseling isn’t an option.  The hospital program that covered my surgeries doesn’t cover psych (or pain management).  "
I'm a fucking burden on everything and everyone I ever met,"I am mentally fucking broken . I'm a lazy piece of shit and all of my family members and close friends are disappointed in me . I have let everyone in my life down including myself and every time this happens I tell myself: ""Don't worry you'll be better and you'll put effort into something ""
But I never do . Everyone in my life already knows this and have slowly started to distance themselves from me and the worst thing is that I deserve it . I don't know what to do anymore. I'm just a worthless piece of human garbage that upsets everyone to the point even my best friends don't talk to me anymore "
Didn't start my new job today felt to anxious and depressed.,I've been unemployed now for a few months and it's been getting me really down and frustrated. Finally got a job offer last week and started today but instead of going I drove past my new job and came home. It really feels like a vicious cycle of anxiety and depression I don't know how to break the cycle. All I could think of while driving was how I'm going to mess up and be fired so it's better to not waste their time. And now I'm back to square one with only a secondary school education and low skilled manufacturing jobs under my belt I feel defeated.
4 years living away from home,"Laying in bed almost coming up on lunch time and Ive yet to sleep and I'm starting to read happy birthday post on my fb and literally everyone I know is back home where I grew up. 

I moved away to make a better life for myself and honestly I dont think I've made a single right decision since I've moved away from home. Home being a 35 hour drive. 

I enjoy the job I work at but it doesnt make much and it's long days and I have no post high school education so I dont have many options for finding a job if I go back home but tbh I dont really care anymore I just wish I didnt move here and I messed up old friendships that I'll never get back cause of people I no longer care about and life was better when I could just go upstairs and hug my mom and now I barely talk to her and anything could happen and I'm being stupid wasting time away from my family for no reason and everything is shit 

Post makes no sense just wanted to vent before I fall asleep. "
Panicking and stuff,"Truth be told I’ve felt suicidal since elementary school. Even during what I consider “the good times” its always there. I recognize my weakness because I know things could be a whole lot worse. The thing is I’ve never lived for myself. So it’s especially hard to try to motivate myself especially in a situation that feels hopeless. So context I’m a senior in high school, I need 3 credits to graduate, and I’m taking just enough classes to get that. I’m sure I have some form of disability,  I was in one special needs class since kindergarten but i never bothered with a diagnosis. Struggling with sexuality And an abusive household did not help. I’m not trying to make excuses, just knowing shits fucked. Point being I feel like I’ve ruined my chances. There are less then 2 months till graduation and I’m failing everything. I’m not stupid in fact school is easy for me. I just missed so much because escapism is so much easier than facing your problems. So I’m at a point where even trying is pointless because I’ve already, by my own actions, ruined this for me. Pulling off that miracle is unrealistic and I know I’ll be letting everyone down if I don’t. I don’t really have friends so I can’t really talk to anyone. Im just afraid that if I blow this, which is more than likely, I will actually go through with it. I’ve already gotten a second chance and I blew it.  I don’t really have any goals or aspirations because I genuinely didn’t believe I would make it this far.

In the end the only thing I can do is try, it’s just a scary thing and the fact that it’s so simple makes me feel incompetent. Idk"
I relapsed into sleepless depression after hearing about terrorist attack in NZ,"Hello all. First of all, I want to apologise for my English. I always had problem with depression in school due to mocking and bullying and I suffer from emotional sensitivity.. And after I've managed to shape my life into something I was happy - news about NZ hit me. I am on other side of the world and I don't have any family there, but I couldn't stop crying for days. I don't understand how such evil can exist and I simply don't want to live in such cruel world. Also, shooting in Netherlands didn't help.. I can't stop to think how people felt before their life was taken away from them by a crazy lunatics.. I hope it's just me and no else is affected in such a way like I am now. "
I have given up.,"I am just getting really tired of being almost good enough. I have been depressed since eighth grade. I am a junior now and I was just starting to see some light and legitimate happiness for the first time at the start of this school year. I completely stopped cutting myself and was starting to have more good days than bad days. Since then, things have taken a pretty bad turn. The guy I liked and thought things were going well with was shit talking me to all of his friends. I do debate and I was putting in greater than 20 hours of week of hunting for evidence and I was getting consistently screwed over. We even qualified to nationals and got our qualification revoked, then had to drop the state tournament. In terms of school, it just seems like no matter how hard I work or study I am always seeing the same results. For example in AP Chem I spent an entire week studying for a test only to get a C. I just am actually trying now and the fact that everything is consistently just going badly makes me feel like I should just go back to not being motivated and just give up again. These may seem like small problems, but it is more of the fact that I was finally starting to get better and now I am just falling back into the same negative cycle. Has this happened to anyone else? How did you keep going when everything is telling me that I should just give up?

I don't want to live cause everything is pointless but I have to,"I really don't want to live. I feel like this life isn't made for me. I can't find anything or anyone that makes me happy. Every day is just trying my best to hold on, making an incredible effort just to do simpky tasks and normal routine things then going back to bed hoping I won't wake up the next day. I really just want to be dead. My life is pointless. I'm living in a psychiatric facility since 2 years and trying to finish school and find a job so I can go living on my own but then? What's the point? I don't even know if my psychiatrist will ever let me leave this place. And even if I leave I don't really want to do anything of the things I said. But I have to. I have to live for my family. I gave to my mum so much pain in the last 5 years and I can't give her also the pain of my death. I have to live. And I have to make my life a normal life. I have to finish school. I have to leave this place. I have to find a job. I have to find a house. I have to because I can't disappoint her anymore. I have to because that's what I'm supposed to do. But it's not what I want. I want to die. I want to leave this world that doesn't have anything good for me. I don't know what to do anymore. Maybe for once in my life I should do what I want and not what others want."
Just got told that having depression ist just being immature,"Warning: my rant is longer than I expected it to be 


I’m still living with my parents since I’m not able to work for one and a half year now. 

So I’ve had a discussion with my mom about how my sleeping schedule is totally messed up, how I don’t do anything meaningful each day, why I just can’t manage to fold the blankets on the couch each night before going to bed and just the typical symptoms of being in a dark place. But she just called all these things being immature and that I still need to grow out of that. 

Even though I’ve told her so many times that this isn’t some kind of being-lazy-and-having-a-fun-time-type of ‘phase’ I’m having right now. I can’t even describe to you how much effort I’ve put into explaining and talking about it to my parents. 

After many years of being in denial I’m finally in therapy for over a year now and even my therapist tried to reach out to her one time. For a few months I thought it helped her to understand or even just to accept that it’s not a decision. 

During the last year she seemed understanding and considerate. She even bought many things that she believed would help me and books about depression for her to understand it more. She did all that by herself.

Don’t get me wrong, my mom is a wonderful woman and the most caring and loving person I know. 
I love her to the moon and back but she switches from being the most caring and understanding person ever to thinking depression is a decision and being reproachful, in a moment. 
It’s like everything she ever knew about it vanishes completely from her brain each time. 

You never know what she’ll say or how she’ll react. Of course it’s also the impact of my dad on her, who won’t believe the fact that mental illnesses are an actual existing thing. They both won’t even say the word ‘depression’ out loud. 

It’s so fucking frustrating and exhausting going through the same loop over and over again. 


"
My boyfriends suffering with depression and wants me to fuck other people.,So my boyfriend and I have nearly been together for three years. We have an 8 year age gap (I’m 20) and he is struggling greatly with his mental health which is effecting our sex life massively.   He proposed the idea last night that maybe I should start having sex with random people every once in awhile. He feels really guilty about not being able to be there for me in that way right now and doesn’t want me to end up resenting him. My boyfriend thinks it will also give me back these pivotal years as a young person. He also feels like it would take a lot of pressure off of him if I were to go and get with other people. I am very much in love with my boyfriend and not worried about having feeling for others as I feel if you are prepared to do this in a relationship your relationship goes much deeper than just sex.   I am a really loyal person so I’m finding this really hard to wrap my head around.  He’s read a couple of article of people in his position and really thinks it’s something we should try. Does anyone have any experience or advice on this? I’m just so fucking confused. Someone help. Thanks.
Ready to start being loved,"It seems like everyone has someone that loves them, even people who are depressed like me. I’ve spent the last few years waiting on someone to like me, now I’m actively looking and it’s still fruitless"
i just cant be satisfied with who i am,"i just cant enjoy ANYTHING unless im good at it. i know in my head that it's supposed to be the other way around, but fuck, how can i enjoy my life and be satisfied with it if everyone around me is at the age where they already have that ""one thing"" going for them that they really enjoy and are good at.

ive tried and tried and tried but i just cant get past the grind needed. call me a lazy fucker but i dont enjoy the journey at all. i dislike failing and looking like an idiot while im at it. so now im this useless piece of shit that just watches anime shows and plays video games all day. all i can do now is rely on these as a form of escapism to temporarily forget how shitty i am compared to everyone else around me. i want to change but i just dont know where to begin considering the clusterfuck that i am right now

oh my god someone please save me from myself. im a waste of space on earth with zero ambition. i dont want to die but i dislike the fact that im just a breathing pile of flesh even more"
I can't function at all lately,"I have been battling with depression since I was young, but recently I've gone through some losses and it feels like I can't get a grip on reality. Last year my uncle has a severe stroke and then earlier this year he died from cancer. He was like a second father and the loss has hit me really hard. I also got out of a 3 year relationship with my girlfriend. We both suffer from depression and were letting it rule out lives and it killed our relationship.

She has been trying to help me do things for my depression and I know she is coming from a place of love, but going through my first heart break and grieving the loss of my uncle is too much!

It also especially sucks because during our relationship I kept trying to get us to do things to improve our depression but she was always so bad at doing those small helpful tasks. Now that we broke up, she's doing all these little tasks easily that she never did before when we were together. And now she's calling me telling me to do these things. She even said she would drive to my house if I didn't do things. I don't wanna see her and she knows this. It just hurts to see her being successful now and I'm just this blob that can't get my shit together.

I don't even know what I'm searching for with this post. Just needed to rant I guess. Any advice is welcome!"
"""No feeling is final.""","I know that no phrase is going to magically make things easier when you're in a state of mental distress, but sometimes this one does at least give me enough perspective to ride out the really bad moments. 

I loathe the phrase ""Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem,"" which is usually offered up by people who don't understand the nature of mental illness, but it may contain some truth in the sense that the acute suicidal phase itself will likely pass. Not that that makes anything better in a broader sense. 

Personally speaking, the problem with these reminders I use to get  me through a particularly dark period is that when I'm not in the thick of it and fantasizing about suicide it's usually because I'm successfully avoiding these feelings (through escapism/fixation/keeping myself busy), rather than making progress on them. I've just felt emotionally stuck for so long that it all feels hopeless.  I just want to isolate and avoid. 

So, yes, the more nightmarish emotions will eventually subside, only to come back later. It's a constant cycle, coming in and going out like the tide, but either way I'm still frozen in place, just staring out blankly at the sea (pardon the cheesy metaphor), a non-participant in life, lost in my little obsessions, seemingly incapable of change.    

Even when I feel relatively okay, I'm just killing time. 

Then again, even though I feel hopeless, I don't know the future for certain, despite what my depressed brain tells me.  As unlikely as it seems, maybe life will improve for me one day. If I kill myself I'll never know. "
I Hate myself so much,"I always felt like a piece of shit everytime my parents talks about the future. They always have a very high Expectations of me. Recently i’ve been fucking up so much there’s no going back. My Grades dropped real hard.I cant do basic things such as Swimming or Riding a Bike(eventhough i am 16) i have no Hobbies or Skill. Going to school everyday is hard, when people always thought of you as a weird weeb and always Bully me Emotionaly. My Parents work hard for me, while me here sitting in my room Masturbates to Women that dont even know me and then cry about mylife. I Fucking hate everything about myself."
Suicide vs living miserably ?!,"I often wonder if my kids would be more hurt if I took my life vs living miserably the rest of their lives.

They are the only thing keeping me alive at this point.

I don't know what I'll do once they're older and don't want me around anymore. Oh well..."
happy ending,"the moral of my story is that no matter how hard i try, no matter how much i want it... my story just doesn't have a happy ending."
im picking everything up and leaving everyone and everything,"sometimes it hurts to leave, but just think how much it hurts to stay"
The days are passing me by,"People don't care that i am funny, adventurous, athletic, insightful, musical, and kind. Im wasting my time doing pointless shit, and my opinion is so irrelevant in real life that i speak in a mumble-whisper. I think I've become unintelligent from social media and internet addiction. Im socially anxious, and it's impossible for me to meet new people let alone women who i am frightened will reject and humiliate me as has happened frequently in my past. I cant move on with my life. My high school friends want to stay in touch and i secretly despise them because they found better careers for themselves. My family and friends are sometimes helpful sometimes dismissive when i talk about suicide. I talk about it so much because generally i live in a panicked state. I thought a fresh start was some kind of magic pill to take but in actuality, it's really difficult, and i cant do difficult things. I've thought seriously about jumping in front of trains, off of buildings. But if im being honest im so scared to die. I think the best way now is hanging or helium. Although im so indecisive and afraid of breaking routine ill likely just repeat tomorrow. Everyone is judging me, mostly women, as to if i am: intelligent, successful, powerful enough, and i am never ever going to be any of these things. All of the good options, reading books, career training, etc are overwhelming and im busy being a hesitant little hoarder guy. "

i fought.

My family is fucking stupid,"And it's why I'm going to voluntarily become homeless. Well, that's probably going to happen anyways, but regardless. They are absolute fucktwats man. Fucking dimwits. One asks me to take them to one destination, I come all the way back home, another comes out of the fucking woodwork to ask me to take them to the same goddamn destination. Fucking little siblings not mature enough to handle real life problems such as not having the fucking money for things and not knowing how to handle that. Fucking parents mental capabilities slowly deteriorating as one had a stroke and the other just has some mysterious mental problem that's probably early onset dementia. I have to fucking budget for gas here. They don't have any fucking money. They can't fucking drive. And yet, here I fucking am, having to fucking dick around and waste prescious ass resources because my family is a bunch of goddamn morons. And it's not like I can just get away without joining the military, or like I said, become homeless. I don't have another tribe. There's nowhere to go. And on top of it all, I'm expected to help these fucktwits with their goddamn problems because they're too fucking stupid to just do something about them themselves. Fucking idiots. And here I am, nowhere else to go, needing a place to stay because I need the car that isn't mine so that I can get to work and try to get in a better place financially even though I'm just a goddamn wage slave. Fuck all of this shit man. Fuck my family to hell. They are incompetent morons and they make life for the people who support them harder. Goddammit. Making me waste fucking gas. Fuck them to hell. This shit doesn't pay for itself. It's not like they can. There's just no reason to be happy. I want to be rid of them completely but that's never going to happen until I man up join the military and literally never speak to any of them again, which isn't something I necessarily want to do, but human relationships are a fucking burden. They are a fucking burden. Taking care of people and not having any time to relax for more than twenty minutes is a burden. "
Major Depressive Disorder or Persistent Depressive Disorder?,"So for MDD, symptoms must be present for 2 weeks, but with PDD, symptoms must be present for at least two years. I've heard that PDD is less severe then MDD.

So: If I have extremely severe depression, and meet all the criteria for MDD, but I've been experiencing this for 3 going on 4 years (with one single episode going on for that 3 years, and never a break in symptoms), would that just be Severe Chronic MDD? Or would that be PDD?

Thank you."
Help me see the silver lining,"Hi there. I've struggled with a long lasting, low grade depression for about 10 years now. I've been to counseling for the last 7 years and it definitively has had a huge positive affect on my life. However I feel as though I can't shake this disease. Or at least manage it to the level I'd like.

I want to start by saying that I'm grateful for all I have. I have many blessings in my life. 
I have a loving family, a superb boyfriend of 1 year, and a wonderful group of friends. I'm working towards getting my engineering degree and I currently have an internship (it's a local company, but still) However my depression takes away happiness from all these objectively wonderful parts of my life. Things that should feel great sometimes just feel ""gray."" I find myself feeling down and on the verge of panic attacks more often than normal. 

I wish I could enjoy what I have rather than stressing myself to tears. I have no reason to grapple with this and yet I do, and it makes me feel immense guilt since I know I'm more fortunate than most of the world.

I'm just looking for hope that I can find a way to manage my depression so I can function fully. It just want to know that it can be done.

I’m afraid I will kill myself,I’m constantly crying for help and no one pays attention to me until I say I want to kill my self or hurt myself. Everyone wants to help me when it’s too late. I feel like a burden to everyone. I’m constantly scared all the time. One day no one will pay attention when I ask for help and I’m afraid I will end my life. It’s not that I don’t want help it’s that I get ignored by the people I love. I’m constantly hiding my emotions because I know no one will pay attention until I do something bad or experience a panic attack/episode in front of them. What’s worst is that I only have my mom and boyfriend there for me.

&#x200B;

This may be a long post but I feel like there are a lot of elements to my situation. A bit of background:

&#x200B;

We met last summer when I was away for my birthday (I'm from 30 from UK he's 27 from Ireland). He spent the whole weekend with us practically, coming to and from where we were to see me. We stayed in touch and he first came to see me again after 3 weeks. It is a long distance relationship but we were seeing each other every 2-3 weeks for a few days at a time after that. He came over for a whole week at christmas. I am also a single mother to an 11 year old. He spent time with my son and we all did things together.

&#x200B;

We spent a lot of time on the phone talking and texting. He always made me feel very loved and was always talking about our future and how he was willing to moving over. I have been hurt very badly in the past and this seemed so genuine and the effort he was making to fly over to me and see me, and how open he was about his feelings, made me feel secure. He met my family on numerous occasions and I met his parents when I went over to Ireland.

&#x200B;

Since about January he was going quiet for short periods, a couple of days at a time, but always came back to me telling me how much he loved me and usually gave me a reason - even sometime she admitted it was because he needed some time to think. I accepted that because I know he was struggling with decision to move over, even though he told me thats what he wanted and he knew he wanted me and loved me more than anything.

&#x200B;

We all went away, me him and my son a few weeks ago, and the trip was nice, he was his usual self, very affectionate and we had a great time. Everything was normal after that for a few days, we spent hours talking on the phone, and the day he went quiet he even sent me a screenshot of his phone with me as his background photo. He also forwarded on the first photo we had had together. His last message was that he loved me. And then silence for three weeks. 

&#x200B;

I obviously tried to call and text, but no reply and he didn't even read my messages until a whole week later. I contacted his mother to make sure nothing had happened to him, she wasn't very helpful and just said he had been working a lot. I tried not to contact him too much, but ended up with one last message last weekend just gone to say that I wished him the best and i understand that there was obviously something he was worried about and he didn't want to talk to me about it.

&#x200B;

He did eventually get back in touch at 3am thursday morning. I woke up friday with about 10 messages telling me how he sorry he was and how much he loved me and how amazing I am etc etc, he said he had had a melt down something had just flipped inside him and he fell apart. He hadn't been going to work or seeing his family. He said he had so many emotions and hatred bottled up and he just broke apart but doesn't know exactly why.

&#x200B;

I tried to get him to call me, and these kind of messages have been going back and forth over the weekend. Mostly him saying he hates himself and he's so sorry. I have encouraged him to call me but he won't, I don't think he can face it. He's been quiet again since saturday night. I got upset yesterday and sent him a message saying that he shouldn't be treating me like this and messing me around. I realised this isn't the best way to deal with this and so I sent another this morning telling him all the good things about himself that I loved to try and just tried him some hope and positivity that he could get through this and that I am here for him should he want to call me.

&#x200B;

I am just struggling with the lack of communication. He is in another country as well which makes it ten times harder. I don't want to give up on him in a crisis and I am just trying to make sure he knows I am here but I know I can't force him to communicate so I almost have to half move on and carry on as normal but let him know I am here. I don't think his family helps. I'm worried about him over there. he did say he had been to a counsellor on saturday though, so i hope he keeps going. I am worried he's just going to drink himself into oblivion to cope though in the meantime.

&#x200B;

I just want some advice how to deal with this and also to help me understand whats probably going on in his head. I feel like if I can understand it I can help him more. I do believe he genuinely loves me. 

&#x200B;

Thanks"
I just need somewhere to post the things on my chest,"I feel like I’m in a massive black hole and I can’t get out. There are defiantly things contributing to this but I have no one to talk to, so like anyone filled with feelings and nowhere else to go, I’m posting on the Internet.

I apologise if I’ve made any mistakes, first time poster and all that.

I have a job in another city where I work nights, it takes me over two hours to travel there and two hours back. I’ve been desperately applying for jobs in my area but most require a drivers licence, I can’t afford to learn to drive because I spend a fortune travelling back and forth between cities. I end up working opposite days to my boyfriend so I spend most of my time home alone. I used to play sport and that really helped me make friends and have an outlet when I’m getting down, but I both can’t afford to play anymore and I’m always scheduled in work on practice days.

It was my birthday a few weeks ago and my boyfriend couldn’t afford to get me my birthday gift. He said he’d order it when he got paid. That’s fine, I’m struggling with cash too and neither of us are shy about the fact that life is expensive and especially with me working in another town. 

I get suspicious sometimes, we all do. I had a relationship where someone cheated on me, a lot. So I know it’s bad to snoop through messages but I shopped through my boyfriends phone last night and looked at his Facebook messages. He’d gone out for a works leaving do (they’re all young, so it’s a night of clubbing) and I found out he’d spent £120 on (I think) cocaine. Before he left that night he’d promised to take me to the park to a cafe I liked the next day, I wasn’t really invited out because you know, work thing. I saw in his messages a girl who he’s friendly with at work, and messages to her trying to coax her to come out with the offer of free drugs. I know there’s nothing between them, I’ve met her before lots of times. It just absolutely shattered my heart when I’m already in a shit place that he’d go out and get off his tits and throw away his money to random people, but he still hasn’t got my birthday present. 

I tried to confront him last night, without disclosing that I’d looked through his phone. I asked him if he took drugs when he’s out with his mates and he was like “eh, sometimes” but wouldn’t say much more. I didn’t push it because I didn’t want him to know I’d looked through his phone. 

I’ve always chased jobs “with meaning” and subsequently ended up in jobs where I get drugs tested, so I can’t go out getting shit faced when I feel like it because I’d loose my job. But it just makes me feel like the boring old house wife when I think about it, and how ex friends and ex partners would call me boring when I asked them not to do it round me because I can’t do those sorts of things.

I can’t talk to my best friend because, as much as I love her, our relationship has become very one sided. She only wants to talk about what’s going on in her life, whenever I reach out to her it’s like she gives her opinion quickly and then brushes it off to discuss what’s happening with her.

Today I’m on my own at home and I feel trapped. I have to go back to work tomorrow but I’m exhausted from it, and I keep getting in trouble with my managers (largely because I want to do my job properly and not suck up). I feel masses of amounts of anxiety about going back. But I’m not registered at a doctors locally to go and get signed off. Which is everyone’s answer to everything, get signed off work so you can spend more time at home alone. When I think being alone so much is exactly the problem. But I don’t want to go back to my job.

I have an interview this afternoon, but it’s in a field I’ve never worked in before, so I don’t have high hopes. I’ve applied for jobs I’m more than qualified for and have loads of experience in that I keep getting rejected from. I’ve been applying for months now.

I tried to talk to one of the girls I’m friendly with at work, but she brushed everything off with “oh that’s just depression talking”. I don’t even really feel depressed, I don’t even feel sad, just massively overwhelmed. 

I told my boyfriend if I didn’t live with him and I died no one would even know for weeks, and he got upset thinking I meant that I wasn’t happy in our relationship, but that’s not what I meant. I meant aside from him no one cares. 

I don’t want to die or kill myself either, mostly because I can’t be bothered to do it. I wish I could hit a reset button that would give me a new, fun, personality that people would want to be friends with and I’d be good fun to be around.

Anyone else feel so nostalgic for the past when things were okay that it actually physically hurts?,even though i know i'm glossing over the bad memories....at least there were good ones as well
im ging to end it all...,"i am immigrant from india... life doe s not treat me so good here in england.

i have decided i cant go on anylonger. i am going to kill myslef. goodbye."
"Father and I have the same reaction, not sure if it’s depression.","Hi all,

Jump to the bottom if you don’t want to see me rattle off “normal” symptoms.

So I’ve been dealing with episodes that I think are depressive. I check most of the boxes for depression other than outright self-harm and not really sad, but a feeling like a dull knife. It really manifests itself by sudden weight gain (5-10% in a matter of weeks), being unable to perform in my sport at all where I can barely jog and my hamstrings hurt for no reason (national-level runner), I walk slower than my friends + coworkers, middle insomnia + weekend hypersomnia, concentration issues, no/low libido, and restlessness. There seems to be a pattern of episodes in the winter but there has been one in the summer. Outside of episodes, most of these symptoms subside aside from middle insomnia and libido. I also have a bad scalp picking habit, but I’m not sure that’s related.

Now to the one I can’t figure out. My father has and has had the same set of symptoms. But we both share a desire to escape and break out of our current lives as we feel there’s a lack of purpose or just boredom. I just graduated college, when my father was my age he joined the military and took a 6 and 1.5 month cross country trip in his truck during episodes. I quit my college’s team and nearly transferred and wanted to transfer to another country, took a bike trip where I very nearly died, and now I’m searching for a new job with a perfectly good one now and have been tossing around giving up software development for law school. We also don’t regret the choices we made later. They seem logical, albeit risky.

Is there a term for this? I can’t find any information on it but I can’t imagine we are alone in this.

Thanks."
How can i ever be happy when Depresson and fear seems to take over my life?,"

I want to get out of Georgia. What have this world come to? Every time i turn around i hear about shootings and everyone getting shot so i am getting to where i really don't want to get out the house anymore because that could be me. I live in a world of fear because i got real bad anxiety, depression and i feel like i will have anxiety and a panic attack. It is not even close to me well it is and i am scared to go far or even close to me i can't take it anymore i just want to run and hide is why most of the time i stay in my room because i don't want to be in the drama and the fear of losing my life. I thought augusta, Georgia wasn't going to be worst but it has gone bad to worst so i can't even go to the grocery store or anywhere and knowing something bad will happen to me when i want to live my life to have the best life even my dream to be a dancer so i guess that means i Won't ever get to travel. I wish i lived in a world that has no shootings or violence so i stay to myself but i really would want to get out of Georgia so i am crying right now because to be honest i don't know what to do because i heard shootings from past weeks going on and i just don't know what to say.

Someone i went to school with i know but don't know me well and him wasn't friends but didn't talk and all but he got shot but here is what i found out and that is like 13 minutes from me. There is another shooting that also happened a lady was driving off and another car pulls up and starts shooting inside of it and then i heard another shooting downtown it is getting ridiculous three shootings in 1 week and i can not travel like i want because i have no way.

Dating somebody with depression.,"So, this girl and I have been interested in each other for a while. Our relationship has been kind of a roller coaster. I’ve known her for about 5 years and we’ve been very good friends. We’d watch movies together, visit each others houses to play video games, things like that. We became so close that our families would even hang out together sometimes. October of last year, I was diagnosed with cancer, and had to be homeschooled. During this time, she was the only one who seemed like she gave a shit when everyone else basically forgot about me. She’d even text to me during class and would always respond quickly and comfort me. At one point, she confessed she had feelings for me and I told her I felt the same. However, the medication I was on made me unstable and gave me mood-swings and things, so because of this I told her I wasn’t quite ready for a relationship. We both agreed to wait a while and see what would happen in the future. Flash forward to mid-January of this year, I’m in remission and feeling way better my hair has grown back and I’m going back to school. I went to her house one weekend to hang out and with the intent  to finally ask her out. We ended up getting snowed-in so her parents let me stay the night since they know me so well. Around 11pm, we were awake watching Netflix. She suddenly moved in really close, so I put my arm around her and we sat like this for a while. I told her that I loved her, and she turned and kissed me. The movie finishes, she goes to her room, and I fall asleep in the couch. The next morning she wakes me up really early and sits next to me. She has tears in her eyes. This is when I learned that she had depression. She told me that she really liked me and didn’t want to hurt me, but that she was dealing with a lot and couldn’t handle a relationship at that point (de-ja vu). I told her that being in a relationship didn’t matter, that I’d be there for her regardless if I was her boyfriend or not because I cared about her. She hugged me and thanked me and I went home. I haven’t seen her much since then but we’ve kept in touch and I’ve talked to her a lot and was there for her through a couple low points. Flash forward again to just yesterday. Our families went bowling together and we talked. She told me that she’s a lot better now. She’s on some meds that seem to be helping and she’s seeing a therapist. She told me she was ready for a relationship if I was. I agreed, and now she’s my girlfriend. I want to know how to be the most supportive partner I can be for her while she’s going through this. I care about her so much, but I don’t know what to do other than be there for her when she needs me and back off when she needs space. If you have any advice for me, it would be greatly appreciated. Sorry for the long post, and thank you for taking your time to read it."
“You can‘t do that if you really are depressed“,"My fucking mother literally threatens me for having severe depression by not letting me do certain things because “I can’t do them because I am depressed“

For example I wanna go to a concert, she tells me shit like: “So you’re staying home from school because you can’t do it but you want to go to this concert and then you’re telling me your depression is gone?“

Bitch shut the fuck up, in what world does this woman live? IT. DOES. NOT. WORK. LIKE. THAT. MOTHER. Guess what, I still am depressed!! I just am trying to live normally for once as you want me to do!! And now!! 🤡🤡 What logic and what an intelligent being she is! I truly am impressed.

She just doesn’t get it. Not a single thing. I explain her and she makes the same points over and over again. As if she knows better about my fucking illness than I do. HAHAHAHHAHAHAHA"

Meds making BP go wonky? (Not searching for medical advice),"Just wanted to poke my head in here and ask if anyone else has experienced this. I've always maintained a normal BP until recently. I was on Adderall and then Vyvanse for a year and a half before I was correctly diagnosed and switched to Wellbutrin. The stimulants would raise my heart \*rate\* but not BP. Now on Wellbutrin my rate is much closer to normal but my BP now hovers around 130/75. I tried Celexa last weekend but it put me into mild serotonin syndrome with a BP of 146/78. Now I'm back to Wellbutrin and I'm holding steady in the 130s again.

I'm overweight with a meh diet, and I know that needs to change, but depression lol. Is this all going to bite me in the ass when I get older?"
Do you actually want to feel better?,"Can you tell if deep down you actually want to feel better? When I think really deeply on this I can't find a clear answer in myself. 

I feel so untethered from reality when I think this deeply about these things like I'm floating helpless and silent in space a million miles from anything and drifting ever further like theres no point in anything but its so calm. "
I feel like it'd be easier for everyone else if I was gone.,"I'm having a depressive episode, been prescribed extra meds on top of my regular ones to help with my anxiety. But for the past week, it seems that those who are meant to care for me, just don't have time. It feels like now that I'm 25 I should just be able to do this on my own. And I can't. And I'm sorry. I have to beg my boyfriend to talk to me, we have a long history of mental health issues between us. It's like he holds this power over me, if he can't be bothered to talk to me then I really fall down lower. I just want someone to ask if I'm okay without it having to turn into a debate about why I've fucked up my life.
I'm rambling by this point.
I wake up and I feel too much and I hate it.
I wish I could get rid of 80% of my feelings just to feel normal for one fucking day. "

Can't get over this one girl.,"So I've been dating this girl for almost a year and recently we broke up and I just can't get over her.
She knows everything about me and makes me feel really special and happy but for some reason I've had insecurities because of my past and I accuse her all the time and she's isn't happy being with me anymore, main reason why she broke up with me.
I really wanna move on with life and be hit the gym and just be happy again. What do I do? I need help fellas. :-["
"I don't want help, just want it off my chest.","I hate being excluded from everyday activities, especially when they are group focussed..

I know, it's not their fault always, it's mainly mine, because I'm too much of a nervous wreck. I know I'll fuck up someway. I have before, I will again.

I've had therapy, counseling etc.

Didn't help.

I hate being a ghost.

Fuck, this sucks."
Does anyone else struggle with feeling happy about random things in short flashes without any consistent happiness?,"This happens more often when I’m in a constant state of depression I think, like when everything in general feels gross but not when I’m having an acute suicidal phase or anything. Basically I can be doing anything, usually I’ll be pretty distracted or I’ll be taking in a lot of information. And suddenly something will remind me of something, like for instance I was just watching a YouTube video playing a game on my phone and something reminded me of Russian rap which I used to listen to. And for just an instant, such a short burst of time that it’s basically meaningless, that thought made me incredibly happy. But it wasn’t like, “I want to listen to Russian rap again” or “those were good times listening to that music”, it’s just this frustratingly meaningless burst of happiness that glimmers for a moment and is gone the next. It’s just like a reminder that I could be happy but I’m not, and it feels nihilistic and torturous, knowing that there was nothing to that moment and I have no idea how I would produce a state like that consistently. I’ve tried following these things like clues, for example with this case it may be like “well I guess even if I don’t want to listen to Russian rap, maybe I know that I’ll be happier if I do so I should give it a try” but it doesn’t work. The longer I chase these things the more let down I feel, so I just have to let them go. It’s not like I mind when these things happen of course, I just feel happy in the moment, but the more often it happens with no consistent happiness the more I pick up on the pattern, and it all starts to feel like a cruel horrible joke. Can anyone relate to this? I’d really appreciate it if I wasn’t alone here."
Is there a reason I care so much?,"Honestly, I want to know. I just care too much about things that don’t involve me, like at all. Things worry me and bother me and hurt my feelings even when they aren’t directed at me. Some things I read and it makes me feel so terribly sad and my ears start to burn, then I cry and end up just thinking about it before something else comes along. I don’t know why I care so much, and why it seems to affect me so deeply, I really want it to stop. I really hate the feeling and the thoughts."
Really don't want to work,"I hope this is ok to post here as this isn't directly about depression, but it's related to my depression. A bit of a rant.

So I don't want to work. I'm not career-driven at all, and I don't understand those who are. The only jobs I've had in my time have been in a bar, a supermarket and in a crumby, minimum wage office job - all utterly soul destroying, to say the least. I've been out of work for a couple of years now.

My fiancé and I had a bit of a heated discussion about it recently, where he is worried about my lack of motivation and care. He doesn't understand me not wanting to work, he thinks it's unhealthy to not have any drive, a routine etc. He thinks I'm just afraid, which I am in a way - rejection after rejection over the years would do that to a girl. I've had a few aspirations in the past, but none of them have ever worked out, and the failures hurt me deeply. I can't bear to put myself through them again. I also value having free time more than a salary. He keeps trying to push me into things, and I hate it. I feel trapped because I'm worried over time this will create a real resentment, but for me to join the rat race again will worsen my depression. I don't think I can bear it.

I do understand where he's coming from, but I'm just not interested. Don't get me wrong- I've tried to find ""my path"". I've made many attempts to come up with ideas about something I'd like to do. But frankly? Everything is just soooo boring. "
A hug,"I’ve been feeling really down lately. Is it chronic depression? Is it stress? Either way, my emotional state has very much been depressive symptoms.  I’ve self-harmed. I’ve wanted to stay in bed for ages. 

Someone I was talking to about it yesterday offered me a hug and I lost it. I cried and held onto them as if for dear life. It felt nice to feel that kind of support.

I hope that I can pull myself out of this."
Am I just denying my depression?,"I'm in a really fucked up headspace right now. I can't even articulate my thoughts properly. I've been wanting to get my shit together and do stuff. I want to study. I want to work on programming. I want to be productive. But I just can't focus on doing anything. 

There were days when I didn't want to do anything. I just wanted to lay down on my bed the whole day and be isolated from everyone. Now I want to do shit. I try to sit at my desk and start coding but I can't. I don't understand why. I'm able to laugh at memes and funny YouTube videos. I get cracked up by looking at silly conversations on reddit. So I'm alright then right? I'm in a good mood right? Or am I forcing myself to be like that.  One moment I'm listening to songs with a happy vibe and the next I listen to sad ones. I'm physically drained even though I've had a lot of sleep. I don't know what's happening. But I don't want to feel empty anymore. I don't want to just ""chill"" on my bed all day.This is so painful and frustrating.

I'm sorry if none of this makes sense to you guys.

Depression and Breathing issues,"I was recently diagnosed with depression after seeing the doctor regarding some breathing issues I've been having here recently. I know anxiety is a normal symptom when it comes to depression and that it can cause chest tightness and feelings of being unable to breath when it flares up but what I've been dealing with is more of a persistent  low level tightness and what feels like I'm unable to take as deep a breath as I used too. Also it doesnt HURT in the same way a cut or scratch would, it's more of a dull resistance that I feel when I take a breath.

Really what I'm asking is if it's normal to experience breathing issues like this while depressed or is this something that should be looked at by another doctor. They've checked me with a stethoscope and say I SOUND fine but that's not exactly the most reassuring thing they could tell me. If I don't pay attention to it, it doesnt bother me that much but it's still noticeable. And obviously when I do pay attention to it, it just makes me anxious and makes it feel worse than what it really is. 

Have any of you guys/gals dealt with anything similar? Or is this a just normal symptom of depression?"
SUICIDE,"the word suicide caught your attention didn't it?

the thing is suicide catches everyones attention.

its the cations that lead up to suicide that go unnoticed."
Three months is all it took,"I felt fine in December my whole life has been great, I even found someone I fell in love with and they like me back. Then it became January, I started feeling weird and having random waves of mania and depression (although they weren’t bad at all). Things kept getting better while my mental health kept decreasing at a scary rate. Only 3 weeks ago I still felt happy. It’s now March and I’m tearing everything I’ve worked for apart, my friends my family. I started cutting and I’ve asked for help without shame. It was only a month ago where I didn’t care about people with depression. But it’s so painful, so so painful. With an outside perspective I have to be honest. No one cares, your just a whiny asshole while they live the life.  I can’t stop idk why it won’t just stop, people are cruel and to fucking adaptable. Ugh"
"DAE use weekends to try to ""reset"" their week?","Friday comes along, and my built up depression, stress, and exhaustion from the week kicks in.  I don't want to do anything Friday night or all day Saturday.

Sunday comes along, and I'm ready to reset and try to unfuck my week.  I clean, I prep meals, I get some chores done, I've been doing slight reno on my house, and planning projects for the week.

Monday starts out great, I'm ready to go, LET'S DO THIS!

Okay it's Tuesday.  Things are okay.  Getting a little tired, run down, unmotivated.  Those house projects can wait.

Wednesday hits, and I'm ready for the weekend.  I'm ready to sit and do nothing.  I don't even think about the house projects.

Lather. Rinse. Repeat."
"Can’t Rest In Peace, though.","It all started when I graduated high school. My Mom told me that she’s unable to send me to college for an abvious reason - my Mom was a factory worker here in the Philippines, earning PhP130.00 a day. She doesn’t have a regular work schedule as the work is production dependent. Sometimes, they work all week long, 3-days in a week, 2 days, and worst, no work for a week or two. 

I am my parents only child - but our life never felt like they both have jobs. Although, my Dad was a full-time Carpenter and works regularly, he was also a drunkard, and a full-time gambler - so they got separated when I was around 7 years old, and now we all lost contact to my Father. 

So, after I finished high school, I was asked to stay with my Granny to keep her company as she’s always left alone because my Mom’s younger brother and his wife have to go to work on a daily basis (except weekends). Given that I was a top performer at school, being stuck and not going to college has got me so sad - so, after a year, I tried my best to apply for Academic Scholarships, and was very unfortunate, and ended up with getting an Educational Assistance Loan from SSS (gladly, my Mom had one, so we’re able to apply for it). 

I am dream chaser - I don’t wanna settle for less. I always go for A+. Sadly, life’s been so tough to me. 

I took up a decent degree in one of the State Universities in a Metro City 1.5 hours away from us, and rented a Boarding House worth P1,500 a month. Before I went to college, my Mom’s brothers and sisters all offered to help with my studies - but they never did. I had a lot of school fee’s and projects to be fulfilled plus a rent to pay - but all I get from my Mom is a PhP 300.00 allowance every week - which I definitely understood, given my Mom’s source of income. 

So, I decided to work while studying, but it never worked out because of the time required to fulfill all my schoolworks, plus I am not allowed to absent from work as it will affect the business’s service level (BPO). So, I choose to quit school without my Mom and relatives knowing it, and continued working thinking I can save money for my studies, then quit - but it never happened. 

I went back to school while working, thing that it’ll work this time around - bit it never happened. 

Instead, due to peer pressures, I ended up scamming my classmates and workmates just to have enough money for both my needs and WANTS! 

First, I told them that my Mom has a Bone Cancer, and needed immediate medical aide - which would require a certain amount of money. My friends, asked their friends to help me, and was able to collect around PhP 8,000.00 then gave it to me in cash - which I only used for personal expenses. I also had a classmate who’s Mom’s been giving me an allowance of Php 500.00 every week. 

BUT I STOPPED SCHOOL, AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO FINISH A YEAR OF IT. 

And again, due to Peer Pressure, and the WANT to help others even if I needed help myself, the Bone Cancer story continued... and I ended up loans + loans + loans + loans for Travel, for Gadgets, Clothes, and to help others financially - Yes, I am lending them money, sometimes taking them to lunch and dinner ON ME, without them knowing that I had it from a Lending Company. 

Now, since all my loans got stacked up, it went to almost PhP 110,000.00 and was unable to cope up with my bi-monthly payments. I told one person about it, and was advised to leave the city, and start a new life - which I thought (at that time), is the best idea - so, I did. 

But... it never went as we both thought. Lending Companies knew my resisdential address, and looked up for me. So, my Mom, and everyone in our Family Tree knew that I had a bunch of payables, and was very disappointed about how I ended up - I mean, they we’re all expecting a lot from me, and they thought I’m doing okay because every fvcking time that I go home, it’s like a fiesta, and I always invite everyone else to come to our house, I even buy vitamins and milk for my Granny - but I’m not as settled as they thought. 

Now, I am so far away from my family, I miss my younger brothers (my Mom had another family), I miss my Lola so much, I so fucking miss being with all of them. But I can’t go back, I don’t have enough strenght to face them, I DON’T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY FOR MY PAYABLES. I can’t go back still broke and unable to provide. 

I miss them... so much... but, I’ll guess they’ll never see me again. I’m ending this mess... I guess I’m just worth PhP 110,000.00... I don’t want additional people to be my victim... I have lost so many friends already just because I’m unable to control myself. I’m the worst person that has ever lived, I can’t live any more... sorry... "
I'm starting to feel really guilty about feeling this way,"All my life people have said ""well if you think if you have it bad, at least you're not \[horrible situation\]"" and I sort of just dismissed in a, ""well i'm not that person in that situation, so it doesn't apply to me and doesn't change anything for me"" type of way

But recently I feel tremendously guilty about feeling bad and wanting to kill myself.

I've realised I've been spoiled completely. The fact I have the time and mental energy to devote all day worrying about existential shit and just being apathetic and sad towards life as opposed to, say, wondering where my next glass of water is coming from means i'm definitely blessed.

But I don't feel like ""wow things are good, i should be appreciative of what I have"". I do feel that way a little, and i've become more empathetic over the years (to detrimental levels, mind you) but I mostly just feel like a spoiled little prick.

Not sure what to do with these feelings, i just feel so ashamed and frankly embarrassed by myself. Can anyone relate?"
What is happening to me?,"I can't find it in me to attend at least a full day of classes. I've been ditching a lot recently. I'm sick of going to work, but it gives me a reason to leave the house. I don't feel ""sad"" or do not think of suicide at all. I feel better doing nothing and just stepping outside for a bit. I don't feel socially isolated or anything. I literally just do not want to deal with anything. It's so hard for me all of a sudden. I don't fucking know why I can't bring myself to want to go to work, attend class, or do my homework. I just want to close the world off for a good month or year and just live with my computer and cat. I think I'm just tired and burnt out, but I'm not even working as hard as I did in highschool. I know I'm lazy, just like, ""naturally"", but I always, always, get my shit together and listen to my limits. I haven't been doing my laundry, I haven't been getting into any old hobbies, I haven't been eating normally, etc. I just feel miserable, but at the same time nothing? I can't sleep until I'm extremely exhausted, and even if my eyes are dropping I can't even find it in me to just shut the fuck up and sleep. I don't know how to explain it. Just since 2 weeks ago, things have been going downhill. What's worse is that I know all this--I'm living it--but I can't seem to...do anything."
"Does anyone else get so mad when people say ""I know you.""?","I've never been one to show anger. Whether me bottling up these feelings are cause of my depression or a result I'm not sure. I'm not even sure if this is right for this sub reddit.

My counsellor for one, wants me to be more open about my feelings. However just a little while ago I got angry when someone was pushing their idea on me - ""I know you well enough to know you would do this."" is something he said, and it really pissed me off. That presumptuous, condescending attitude - acting like he knows everything about me. It IRKS me, and I blatantly said so and ended up getting emotional. 

I think this is partially because I know that nobody can ever truly know another person - to truly know them would be to experience everything they have. And for someone to look at me and say ""I know you"" like everything I've been through is something that could be understood that easily - it really makes me want to scream.

People in high school would often say I was the perfect girl with the perfect life - of course none of them knew I had a bipolar father and a semi-depressed mother who supported a man-child and two kids on her own.

Am I being to sensitive? Should I not have gotten angry? Does anyone else hate people like this for the same reason?
"
"""You look great!""","I mirror myself this time last year. I have nothing, I worked so hard last year, I got a job, got rid of my depression, made friends, got a girlfriend. I lost it all after an injury I never asked for. Now I sit here in my room sulking away, trying to be positive, but deep down I know I cant be fucked to do it all again. I have no reason too, I just dont care anymore. And whilst I suffer inside people tell me how well I look and that I seem great. Nothing has changed, Im emotionally crippled. I have self esteme problems rooting as far back as I can remember. I can't spend the rest of my life just existing.

Wishing I were dead,It wish an accident would just happen. I don't want to cause everyone that pain but I just don't want to exist anymore
"Disconnection, self-doubt and unreliableness.","Hi, I am very new here and unsure about if this question has been asked before. I could not find anything similar but I am sure something close to my situation has surfaced this sub before. This will be a long one; I hope someone has the time to read this, but if no one does, I will be happy to at least have shared it in the best way possible. I finally found the courage to share this and I believe it will help.

I am young, about to turn 21. This makes people believe my mind state is but a temporary thing without much importance. However, I have not shared my feelings deeply before. I have never been to a therapist nor have actively looked for help. I would like to try to assess myself objectively and subjectively, focusing on the three words from the title of this post.

Starting with the tangible reality. I am healthy. I study a career which I chose and enjoy in its contents. I am a semi-professional weightlifter and I seem to have the drive to achieve goals. I deeply enjoy politics, history, biology, etc. I would say productivity is the greatest stimulant of the mind, in a good way. I am always in need of keeping active mentally and find great value in discussing with others (something I can't say I do usually). My family is mildly healthy, though I only have a real relation with my parents. My mother is healthy and my dad struggles severely with lung problems which I deem normal for a man his age who has been smoking for 40+ years. 

I will try to explain the words mentioned before, in order of the least damaging to the most:

* **Unreliableness**: I have never been one to have many friends. I am individualistic in nature and can sustain myself objectively well. However, I do feel I tend to overshadow the few people I have and don't give them enough importance. This makes me think of myself as an unreliable person, especially as a friend. Furthermore, as I analyse my objective situation in life I cannot make sense of the fact that I am so deeply saddened on the inside, this makes me believe in myself as a crybaby without reason to behave this way. This is what people have always told me, so I have accepted it as factual.

* **Self-doubt**: this connects directly to my previous point. I am filled to the brim with physical and mental insecurities. My physical insecurities are fueled by the happenings of the only relationship I have had in my life. My ex-girlfriend used to shame my body as too muscular or disgusting. Some other people have told me the same, while other few people have told me otherwise. I deeply loved that girl, her criticism destroyed my confidence. I cannot show my body as I would like to due to complete terror of being judged. I wish to not be influenced by outsiders' opinions, but I believe that in the inhumane world we live in, you must compete in the market place to sustain your own life. This last point leads me to believe that if I ever want to achieve any success in human relationships, I should hear what others think, though I don't allow myself to change my ways when other criticize me. My integrity and lack of love for myself contradict one another and I seem like a split image of myself, never truly aware of my wants or needs.

* **Disconnection**: I have actively tried socialising to the best of my abilities. The rule of thumb in my experience is that people my age look for different experiences when compared to me. They participate in different fun activities, of which I have never enjoyed any. I feel disconnected from the world as a young man. As if I could not ideologically connect with anyone around me. This contributes to self-doubt. I have recently gotten lazier in striving towards my goals and can't find the strength to keep looking for friends or a loving partner (things which I deeply long for, or so I believe). The way in which my roomates describe hook-up culture breaks my soul. University for me has been composed of reading and studying, but it seems completely disconnected from everyone else's experience. I don't feel alone, I feel disconnected and inadequate. This has found its way so deeply into my brain that I begin to think non-existence is objectively better than the opposite, despite the fact that I have innumerable intellectual interests which are the things keeping me alive. 

I feel shattered, I don't mean emotionally. I see myself as a broken conscience with pieces scattered all over the place, with no real order or sense. The façade I put on day after day is breaking me, my integrity is beggining to falter, I find myself going through the motions as a zombie rather than experiencing anything, my emotional stability is at an all time low. While all of this is happening, my own nature tells me that I should not be experiencing this as my objective situation is privileged in comparison to many other people, making me disregard myself and mentally punish myself even further.

Even this discourse seems scattered and without sense, like me. I can't find a real reason I should be in a constant feeling of deep sorrow, though I can't find my way out of this. I see myself as if I was between a sword and a wall, and there's no way out. Why do I feel like this despite my privileges? Am I really just that delusional?

I've never wanted to experience what non-existence is, that has just changed. I find it deeply troubling. I am scared, and I am alone.

&#x200B;

If you have made it here, I cannot express my gratitude enough. I hope all is well, I want you to know that you are an amazing person. I love you. Thank you.

I just can't take it anymore,"I hate everything every person that I know is cruel to me and don't want to understand my situation 

I am absolutely sick from school my only ""friend"" doesn't even talk to me really and I have to do everything for him I have to  bring up something to discuss and he doesn't even reply to me but with the others he talks a lot but not when I am with him and he doesn't even greet me anymore

And the other kids are basically fucking cunts their laughing and talking about such foolish shit and my teacher is feeling like I am the evil one out of my class

My parents don't understand me and just yell at me when something is frustrating me

My therapist doesn't understand that I am close to an mental breakdown 

From everything that I do I only feel a wave of sadness, anger and pointlessness nothing makes fun I hate everything

But for the most part I hate myself so God damn much. Why am I like that!??? !!!

What should I do know?  I just want to be in my room for the rest of my fucking life this is so unbearable "
"I can't go out, and here's why",I hate seeing other people my age and noticing how much more good looking they are than I. I know this has something to do with teenage hormones (M16) but it's gotten out of control. I can't even go to school anymore because of it. If I see anyone who's around my age I automatically compare myself to them and I can't stop it and it makes me hate myself so much. It's why I stay at home because if I'm at home then I can't see anyone but myself so I've got nobody to compare me to
Does anyone take Risperdal/risperidon? What did you use if for and what's your experience with it?,As the title says. Not sure if there's a subreddit where you can ask about medication experiences.
Sex drive question (relates to side effects of meds),"I've been contemplating changing meds because of sex drive issues, but I have a question for you. If you had to choose between one of these which one would it be:

1. dulled sex drive as a side effect but in a relationship at the same time
2. surge in sex drive as a side effect but single (either circumstantially or wanting to stay single for some time) and your single status makes that surge in sex drive to be inconvenient
3. Quit all meds and let your sex drive be normal (if it was normal pre-meds) - - ok that may be hard for people who need meds, I'm just trying to provide another option lol
4. None of the above (you have your own answer)

My situation at the time is #2 btw. lol"
I’ve officially lost interest in everything I used to love doing,"I don’t have the minimum will of seeing friends, talking to my family, reading (I bought around 8 books in the last month hoping it would give me some motivation but haven’t opened one), studying, making sports, even listening to music and playing videogames. The only thing I do is browse the internet and let the emptiness settle in everyday... again and again. I have even stopped going to school, but I’m studying abroad and I don’t master the language and don’t write any tests so they don’t care if I go to class anyways. I hope I can make it until it’s time to go home, I don’t even have motivation to kill myself anyways"
Anyone else feel worried that their only happy because of medication?,"I've been on some strong antidepressants for a while now and they work for the most part, (they get me through the day alive) but I've got the constant thought that in the brief periods when I do feel happy, it's only because I'm drugged up and it isn't anything to do with me. And as soon as I'm off the meds then I'll spiral back down into an even worse place than I am currently."
"I know there are far worse reasons to be here, but here I am.","Hi. First time posting here (and sorry for my English). I'm currently at work. I should be happy, I've got a work, I've got a salary. But I can no longer be productive, I think I don't deserve a work, I think I don't deserve a salary. I'm thinking of firing myself just to feel completely useless just as I am, I don't want to make fun of anyone, I don't want to steal money to anyone. Other people deserve a job more than me. 18 months ago I moved to Rome, 300 km away from home, just because my (ex) girlfriend lives here. After eight months I left her, I was (and still I am) addicted to depression, solitude, melancholy. I want to be left alone, I don't want people to be sad because of me. My work was the only reason I've decided to stay here, but now I have no more reason to stay. My dad looses his work, my grandfather passed away some weeks ago and I'm still here pretending everything is fine. I don't want to run away anymore. When I go home to visit my parents my mum cries every time. I feel like I've wasted my childhood and now it's too late to recover it. I can't tell them that I love them, every time the tears anticipate any word. I just leave without saying anything, and this is the only thing I'm good at.

I don't have friends here, and I don't really want any friend. Sometimes I stay at work late just because I don't want to face the reality outside, but I stay here contemplating the nothingness instead of doing something useful. When I go home I spend the evenings just crying, I find comfort only in my solitude with my sad songs, my melancholy, my sickness. I think I no longer have any motivation to face my days, my thoughts. The more I try to expose myself to people, the more I want to give up. I feel like my thoughts are slowing killing me, I'm trapped here in my mind and I can't enjoy this life anymore. Sometimes I try to write something, like a diary, but I can't find the words anymore. When I read them the fear grips my heart, I'm scared of my own thoughts.

I note that I can appreciate things only if stained by melancholy and suffocated by sadness that causes me the absence of oxygen. I would like to leave something to this world before disappearing.

Yesterday I was in Venice, my parents live near Venice. Now I'm in Rome. They are beautiful places, too beautiful for me, even the art and beauty of these places make me feel the heaviness of existence.

I'm here at work, writing this when I should be productive. I need to cry right now but I can't.

Anyway, thank you for reading this. I don't need help, I don't need comforting words, I don't want to feel better. I hope this can help someone just like other posts help me when I read this subreddit before going to work."
Why can’t I just have a happy social life like everyone else my age,Why am I so useless to everyone
dead,"i am ready to die, i don’t want to live anymore i just
want to leave this life. i hate it & i hate everything about it & i am not willing to fight for it anymore. i’ve lost hope, my whole life has been nothing but abuse, let downs, and disappointment. now i’m 21 all alone, picking up the pieces of my childhood and dealing with the repercussions of other people’s actions as well as my own and all i can think of is there is no such thing as happiness for me. i just want to be someone else and there’s not one thing that can be said to me to change my mind. i’ve heard it all before. if i could pay someone to kill me i would because lord knows i don’t have the guts it takes to do it myself. i am sick and tired of being sick and tired. i just want to die. "
I don't have anyone to turn to,"I've posted here before about not really having anyone, and it's gotten so much worse since then. My family usually abandons me this time of year. They go out for the weekend and I'm usually not invited since I don't have the best relationship with my mum and sisters. They think I'm weird, annoying, and a failure in life.

&#x200B;

Since they're all leaving for the weekend, I'm not exactly allowed to stay home alone. I was able to a month ago because this house I'm currently is a new home we've moved into and our previous home is just up the street. So if anything had gone array, they could check up on me. Which they did frequently, because they don't trust me here alone.

&#x200B;

And guess what. I'm not allowed to stay home alone for the weekend while they're gone. I'm 21 fucking years old and they don't trust me. And I have no one to turn to. I used to be able to turn to my ex's family. They've been so helpful in the past, but this time, his mum has gotten weird. Cancelling meetings with me, and stuff.

&#x200B;

And that's why I feel so alone. I have no one to turn to and no where to stay for just one night. I don't even know if I should ask her. I want to. But yeah, I'm scared she might say no.

&#x200B;

I was also stood up by my two friends. One I was supposed to meet yesterday but whom I haven't heard a peep from. And another who set up a meeting for today! A couple hours ago actually. I've tried messaging him a couple times to no avail.

&#x200B;

Everything would be so easy if I wasn't here. If I didn't exist. My family could go on all the weekend trips and holidays they want. And I don't have to bother anyone about anything ever. 

&#x200B;

No more nuisance, no more me to fuss over. Everything would be great and every one could go about living their lives, and stuff...

&#x200B;

Way waaay better if I wasn't here anymore"
"Not suicidal, but really i just dont want to be alive","I don't plan to kill myself or harm myself but i just wish i was dead or doing nothing at all, just sleeping in bed or scrolling my phone, mindless tasks because getting up and doing anything just sounds like its not worth it right now.

The emptiness inside makes the deep feelings of sadness feel good because at least I’m feeling. A girl broke me and I need help if you’re willing to read my short explanation.,"I’m just a broken person, that’s all, someone who’s been let down by people I trust and backstabbed in the same way. I’m truly a caring person and I never like to let people down or leave bad impressions or imprints on people. I just feel like I’m used and always taken for granted, I just wonder how people would react if I was just suddenly gone, I truly don’t know if they’d care for very long or forget me in a couple days. Idk, I’m just so used to feeling empty and alone; feeling sad is one of the most intense and powerful sensations I feel like I get the pleasure of withstanding. I have a lot of things I want to break down but I feel like such a thread and title can’t encompass my feelings and situations. 

    A girl broke me, or I let her I guess. Have you ever had feelings for someone but they just don’t consider you in that way? I know I’d treat my Jane doe with the utmost respect and treat her in the best of ways, she loves to do the same things and we’re literally best friends, which makes it so hard to escape my position. She just doesn’t see what I see I guess.. and that’s where the pain starts seeping in. I love being with this person and even just friends and she relies on me and enjoys being with me too. But this empty and emotionless personality has developed while I’m with her, I just feel so little when I’m with her now because I’ve just been so hurt by her throughout our time as friends... and I’ve been so held back. It’s at a point where I just feel trapped, I’ll never get closer because now I’m just held back by my emptiness when I’m with her but I care for her so much and want those feelings to be there again but I don’t think that can happen with the way she sees me in my current state. There’s just no winning and I’m getting lost. I need help. 

   Most people probably have no idea what I’m saying or feeling but any feedback is welcome to me, the feedback that hurts though is when people tell me I need to just forget about her.. it’s just not that simple, we’re literally best friends and she talks to me and comes to me when she’s had a bad day, I can’t just abandon this relationship even if it hurts me, I’ll still love her and look out for her even if I can’t be with her.

In thearpy what results should there be?,"Is it literally just all about talking about your past and that? Going over ex gf break up and stuff. Then hoping something clicks that improves your life or outlook?

I kinda feel like I don't have time to spend months just going over the past.

Not sure if I should be seeing a different type of therapist? 

Any advice would be great.

Thanks

Mirena and depression,"I feel really really really depressed. I got the mirena IUD on Tuesday 

Anyone know much about birth control and depression?

Need to make some new friends,"I need to make a new friend. 

&#x200B;

I've been struggling with depression for as long as i can remember. It got better, but then it got worse again and i think i know why. Yeah i know that people with depression regularly go through cycles of feeling ok and feeling bad but what i mean is that i went from having bad days every day of the week to only having bad days like 1 day a week and then back again. 

&#x200B;

Im an introvert and i don't like to talk. It takes a while for me to get comfortable around someone.

&#x200B;

Recently my closest friend moved to another country. And i don't want to sound like im blaming her or anything. She had no control over it as her parents had wanted to move and even if she did have a choice, its her life and she's not obligated to do anything for me. 

&#x200B;

My depression first got really bad during the end of my primary school years/the first year of high school. It leveled off and got a lot better in the second year of high school. Which is the same time that i became friends with her. I've recently returned to my original pre being friends with her depression level and it sucks. 

&#x200B;

I really miss her. And like i said before i don't blame her and this is in no way her fault. I just wanted to talk to someone about it without seeming weird or letting her know as i don't want this to be a burden on her. 

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do. Im really bad at making friends. I never talk to anyone. And its really hard for me to get comfortable being around someone. 

&#x200B;

So, yeah. I did sort of have a crush on her. She rejected me ages ago but it didn't really hurt. Like i liked her because she was the only person i was really comfortable around. I wanted to be in a relationship with her because that would be we could be closer together. I knew that wasn't going to happen when she rejected me but i was still ok because we were still friends and we still hung out. Honestly, it felt worse to have her leave the country then for her rejection. 

&#x200B;

Yeah. So. I need to make a new friend somehow. And i probably need to move on and find someone else to crush on. "
Is it possible to use illegally obtained Xanax/Valium to make me feel better?,"Me and my girlfriend of over 1 year split up yesterday. I feel incredibly depressed, lethargic and empty. Can using Xanax or Valium help me? "
I've been depressed all my life.,"Sorry if this isn't allowed but this is my first time posting in this sub and i'm new to Reddit. 

I don't know why i'm posting this but i just feel like i need to get this out of my system after everything being pent up for nearly 8+ years and so i can communicate with people who might understand this emptiness that i'm feeling.

&#x200B;

I'm 19 and I've been depressed and negative almost my entire life and i honestly don't even feel anything anymore. I've felt like this for so long that i don't know happiness.

I don't mean to sound pretentious but i feel like I'm more intelligent than other people my age and around me and better able to understand life and meaning. I'm a very cynical and apathetic person because of this.. i know that people always respond to these types of things with stuff like ""live in the moment"" or ""smile, it'll get better"" etc, but those just don't work on me, although i wish they did.

I can't even talk to anybody about this because i literally have nobody i can speak to. I don't have a proper parent/child relationship with my mother and we don't have conversations other than her telling me that dinner is ready, we are still friendly but it's not healthy and i know it. I have a older brother who used to bully and beat me up a lot when i was younger and we've never had a brotherly relationship because of everything he did to me. Sometimes i'm sitting in the living room with them and i realize that their practically strangers to me. I have never had a single real friend since i left my hometown as a child, i still don't have one. I've been alone for so long that i'm used to it and i don't know anything else.

The last time i was truly happy was when i was around 10-11 years old in 2010/2011, Even then i don't know if i was actually even happy or if my mind was just not developed enough to understand feelings and the world around me. When i was 12 my mother moved me and my brother away from our home city off to a tiny town in the middle of nowhere. This caused me to become shy and introverted which is still affecting me today. This is the root of all my problems in life so far and i'm dead serious. 

Now fast forward to more recent times, after staying in that town and becoming a social outcast and not attending high school we finally left and moved in 2016 to another city that is 3 hours away from our hometown which is so close, yet so far. I just got fired from my job because i just can't seem to catch on or have confidence in myself because of anxiety and depression, which means I'm also in heavy debt which is another thing to add on. 

I suppose the only real time that I've ever been happy is when i was in and graduated from High School back in June (1 year behind) and i took some amazing philosophy/religion classes with a great teacher who helped me get my life together and seemed to ""wake me up"" from this  and when my football team nearly managed to win the championship.

I've got 4 months left of being a teenager and I've never even been a teenager for a single day... almost 20 years wasted essentially.

Literally no one talks to me unless they need something,But it’s my fault for being so boring. I’m so anxious about the future that I invest no time into friendships
"I dont have wares to sell, or things to offer","One of the issues with being down all day all week is that I don't feel like I have things to offer other people. Where I grew up, you could just visit your friends without much reason and just give and take each other's time. And life wasn't so busy.

Now I instantly feel like a burden wherever I go, because I have little joy in me. I don't want to slow anyone else down, everyone seems to be struggling to stay afloat with what little time and energy they have. I wish there was more room to make small talk and just be lazy with another person. "
I don’t understand what to do,"I’m a navy veteran, who was diagnosed with depression while in the service.  When I was finally released from the military for my depression issues that would not allow me to sleep for days, that was it I was released.  I had no idea what to do, or how to go about doing any treatment.  I still do not have a full understanding of what I’m suppose to do.  I don’t even slightly know what to do, or handle myself.  I’m trying to go through treatment finally my wife has helped me understand a little about treatment.  I want to do better, and be better, but the feeling I have in my head about myself drag me down so down.  I hate myself, I hate the way I feel, I wish I could be better.  I use to feel nothing, I was just emotionally numb, but I’m trying to open up, and feel which not I don’t even know what I am feeling.  I’m a mess I use to feel nothing, now I’m feeling all these wrong emotions that are making me worse.  I’m directing my issues at the only person I have which is my wife!  They aren’t the way I truly feel, but my issues and starting to feel are messing with me.  I don’t know what I’m suppose to do, or how to feel.  I have no one to reach out to or to talk to.   I feel like no one would care.  I wish I would not wake up,  I wish so much I would just not wake up almost every night.  I don’t want to feel the way I do, I feel like I’m destroying the only person I have with my feelings, and emotions.  I don’t even want to be around myself, why would anyone else.!  I have appointments coming up soon to get me seeing whatever or whoever I need to I don’t know how I’m going to feel.  I’m so lost and feel so alone!  "
I am invisible,"I feel like when I talk, nobody knows my voice is mine. People walk into me, they don't respond to me in groups. I watch everyone and feel their emotions, I can tell what they need and I cater for that, but nobody has ever read me that way and if they have, they've keept silent. I get told how lovely and helpful I am but I have needs too. I need someone to look at me, into me, with no alternative intentions and just know me for once. But then again, why should they? Why would I deserve that?

I feel like a ghost, just watching life pass by despite all my efforts or the hours of work and study I put in. I feel so sad, unaccomplished, unfulfilled, in so much pain and like nobody can see me. Even when they do for a moment, when my mask cracks, they eventually forget and think I'm magically better. They say they are there, but they aren't. I feel my pain, and the pain of those around me, it gets so much that I lock myself away, I avoid it. There is too much going on around me that my heart hurts, my head hurts and my energy is drained. 

 It gets easier to act normal, just so it doesnt hurt when I'm forgotten or left out, but ""normal"" drains me so much.  I don't know why I even bother half the time. Everything that feels natural and true to myself is an unhealthy or harmful behaviour, everything else feels fake.

Sorry for my ramblings. I just need to be self centered and heard for once.

Advice on helping wife through depression,"Hey everyone, I'm looking for a bit of advice on helping my wife with her depression.

&#x200B;

She's going to a therapist who recently has been treating her for depression. The therapist also believes she might have OCD as well, though has not given her a formal diagnosis on that. She just started 20mg fluoxetine to try to help herself a bit. 

&#x200B;

For the past 2 years, we argue a bit maybe every week or so, though for the past 4 months, we've been arguing almost every day over simple things. I love her to death and would really like to do what I can to make her journey through this a bit better.

&#x200B;

Any advice on this? I'm completely lost in this and really want my best friend back."
How do you get/ hold down a job with chronic depression?,"I usually don't have problem getting a job since I only apply for jobs when I am well. But it is incredibly hard to keep going when the brief period of relief is over. It's getting harder and harder to explain why I've quit so many jobs and why there are huge gaps between them. I'm 24 now and my parents have graciously let me live with them but I feel incredibly guilty about it. They sacrificed everything for me and my siblings to have a good education and I want to be able to give them all the things and experiences they missed for us before it's too late. 
I would be grateful for some career advice. I quit college (surprise) and have some work experience here and there but no speciality. "
Anyone else listen to certain songs that bring out all your emotions/or makes you remember a certain time?,"Its probably not uncommon. Its an additive thing I do most nights, where I play certain songs that just bring out all my emotions, regrets, memories and nostalgia. It's kinda a way to letting it all out.."
I don't want to die unknowingly or in my sleep,I just want to die so bad that I feel the relief it would give me would feel like an amazing rush to say goodbye
Does anyone actually feel pain when depressed?,I don't know but for a while I've been wondering if anyone actually feels pain. I feel like my hearts hurting and being torn apart. Idk it just feels like my inner body hurts a lot and it sucks a ton.
"TFW you definitely need professional help, but don't have the money or energy to get it...","Guess I'll just die lmao

Will definitely commit suicide one day. 

I don't have any interest in pursuing hobbies or friends, despite desperately wanting them. I can't really feel pleasure from doing any activity unless I'm drunk. I never leave the house except to go to work. 

Despite all this... my depression is more of a symptom than a cause. 

I have issues with intimacy and relationship building. I get attached too easily. I want closeness, but I worry that because of my inability to feel pleasure in doing anything, I won't bring anything to the table so I just don't bother people :("
"Anxiety, Depression, and almost killing myself.","I can't even begin to type this out without wanting to just breakdown.. I've been sitting at my computer since 1 am, and well now it's about 4:15 in the morning, and I've typed this thing out completely and deleted it 5 or 6 times cause it just didn't sound right. These past few days, hell more like these past few weeks have honestly been a bit of a shit show for me. Was stuck working nights and with everything that I do while I'm there it has stressed me out like no other. I have more family issues/problems going on than I can list. I've realized I have a serious drinking problem. I've become a more careless about things that matter the most to me. I've let down, and hurt a lot of people that I have close to me.

These past few days have honestly been a fucking roller coaster of emotions for me. And I know it's been that way for some people that are close to me as well. Friday morning, I held a gun to my own head, for the second time in my life. The first time was almost 8 years ago, when my fiancé passed away and my whole life went downhill.

I was 20 years old, and on May 7, 2011, what I thought would be just another normal day, ended up being one of the worse days of my life. The day Elaina passed away. The day where my life, that was full of such happiness, and joy, and amazing things, turned into a life of constant darkness. Constantly feeling alone. Constantly drinking the pain away. Constantly having thoughts about suicide. And it stayed that way for the next 2 years. I lost my job. Lost contact with the ones close to me. Lost almost everything I had. I was right on the verge on suicide. I doubted myself, and I fought with myself, and I couldn't ever go through with it. Over time I slowly crawled out of that dark hole though, and started getting my life back on track. Joined the military. Went off to basic training. Went off to tech school, and then got stationed in the most wonderful shithole of a state. Kansas. Fast forward a couple years, and yup, I'm still in Kansas haha Enough of that though.

Friday morning, I almost killed myself. Do I regret holding that gun up to my head though? Honestly no, but that doesn't mean that I'm going to actually do it again. I saw it as a wake up call for me. I went for a drive Saturday night for about 2 1/2 hours. It made me realize a lot about myself too. I've let all my stress and anxiety get the best of me. I've let it all get to my head and just eat me up inside. I've taken people for granted, and I've honestly been pretty fucking selfish.. And if it wasn't for the 4 close friends that I have here in Kansas, I honestly would have killed myself.

I quit drinking. I've done it before once in my life. About 2 years ago, I stopped drinking for 4 1/2 months. This time though it isn't gonna be for just 4 1/2 months. I'm done completely. I'm done wasting my time and money on that shit. I don't need it in my life anymore. It's honestly destroyed more good things in my life than I can count. I plan on being sober for the rest of my life. Going to AA meetings as much as I can. To my 4 close friends; when you read this, know that I love you, and I honestly can't thank you enough for being there for me. I'm not going anywhere. This is just gonna be a long road to recovery for me. I've never been great at expressing myself or my emotions in person. I hope this helps.

Even since Friday morning, I'm doing a lot better. Granted I've got a lot of stuff to figure out still, but I'm not giving up. I'm not doing that to myself. Just need to take this one day at a time, and get the help that I need. I'll be back to my old self soon enough."
Anyone else get really sad seeing others succeed,"Like your friends are having the time of their lives, getting jobs, good grades, getting dates and I know I should be happy for them but it just makes me feel shitty about myself

Like why can't I be like them"
Its starting to feel hopeless again,"Right now it feels like I can't even see myself making it to the end of the week. I just feel like the biggest fuck up, I feel like nothing makes sense and I dont know if I can keep going on. I know people always say that things will get better but I don't see that happening for me, I just keep fucking it up over and over again no matter how many times I try. Something about me just does not care for consequences anymore and I think it's because I know that it wont matter in the long term because I won't be around to deal with them. I have been trying to get help but I feel like no matter what no one really hears what I say and everything I have done that has clearly been a call for help has been ignored . I just dont know what to do anymore.... "
I don't feel like getting better cause I'll never reach my full potential,"I have big aspirations. Like big big. And school was going great, til depression hit, and now I'll be held back this year, and my grades will never be what they could be. I feel like (and I know this isnt a rational thought) I will never be able to do huge impactful things in my future, and because of that I don't really care about getting better either....
Advice is always nice, but I also just wanted to share so thanks "
Need advice for my partner,"Hi All, I'm hoping to gain some better advice and knowledge to help my partner.  To give you an overview everything was ok no signs of depression just over 2 years ago then she gave both to twins boys, the birth process was pretty horrific and a bad experience overall.  At this point she was diagnosed with post-natal depression, which was fairly constant with feeling down, we had ups and downs and sometimes we would go weeks being more positive.  

&#x200B;

During this period we had many doctors visits, different medications (she feels very sick when taking tablets, unable to function and look after the kids.) Spoke to a mental health group.  Recently the last month I think she has hit an all time low, crying, lonely, will become argumentitive if you try and show support or help.  From what I understand she has fallen out with her best friend for a few weeks now, this happens alot and my personal opinion is this friend brings her down more times than making her happy.  This has also caused her core group of friends to take a side, so now no fault of her own she feels alone.  Also comments how she just feels like a mum and doesnt have her own identity, talking about ending things.  

&#x200B;

Last time we mentioned this to the doctors they seemed ok with the thoughts of this, and said people do think of extreme things when going through something like this.  I honestly feel like when I'm with her I can make a different 60% of the time and make her feel better, but I know this is a temporary fix, when I have to work it gets worse.  Tablets seem to have little or no effect or make her feel unwell, and her words are, 'talking doesnt fix the problem, they can't fix it'.  Even if she wants to get her identity back or how she describes it the lack of friends is an issue, maybe all this time being a twin mum leaves her with little free time.  I have them as much as I can when free but  she says I have nobody to see.

&#x200B;

Any advice, tips maybe something we can work on together to help her?  Apologies for the long post and if I've repeated myself."
How to better help my gf,"Hello all,

I live with my girlfriend for 3 years now, and she is the most amazing person in the world. Caring, generous, insanely intelligent and funny.

She also suffers from depression, she think since childhood. Howewer it was diagnosed only 5 years ago, and it was supposed to be ""cured"" since then, after a short treatment. She still have a lot of the symptoms, and she doesn't understand why because the doctors talled her she was better.

She doesn't want to go back to a therapist, because she think it means she lost the battle, and it's her fault. She says she  also doesn't have time and/or energy.

I know that many things that I do can make things worse. So I don't push her to go a therapist or remind her that she may be still have depression. I am here for her when things are bad, I listen, I do my best to make her feel better.

I made some researches. Long term, low grade feeling of depression is called dysthemia. Her doctors didn't diagnosed that, and I don't want to diagnosed her because I am not a therapist in any way. However I think she didn't received the treatment she needed.

How to help someone who is scared to get help, and who works that way since childhood? I want her to get better, because she is an amazing person and she doesn't realise that yet."
I can't stop ruining my life,"\[33/M\] I'm at the verge of total life collapse.

This is my third depression episode, diagnosed with severe depression and taking medication.

My life has been and is a mess. Terrible childhood with narcissist mother that abandoned me at 12-y-o. Distant and abusive father that hurt me when he found out I was gay at 15-y-o. Moved to another country at 17-y-o to escape from my father, and joined my awful mother that btw is mentally ill I believe. Lived with her for terrible 5 years and moved to another country alone at 22. In the middle I studied and had jobs. Had my first major depression at 24 while at grad school. Then was more or less stable for some years, because I crafted a new identity that buried my hurtful past (changed name and also lied about my origins).

More recently I had a burnout and quit my well-paid job. Thinking I had recovered, I took another job and had to go on sick leave immediately after starting because of depression. Soon I will have to rely on my partner financially.

I've been in a relationship for 8 years, and had a double life of cheating for 3 years. Now I feel guilty and wonder if I stayed in the relationship for fear of being alone or I really loved my partner.

I live very very far from any family, dont talk to my mother. I have friends, but I cannot share this fucked up background with them. I'm isolating more and more every day, drowning in my thoughts.

I'm doing therapy and all they say is that this takes time. Easy to say when you didn't go through what I've been through.

I feel like my life is over: ruined career, relationship standing but based on lies, identity crisis and dont know who I am as I denied and neglected my origins because of hurtful past, far/estranged from family, isolated. I feel like I'm going mad.

I kinda understand why I wake up every day feeling suicidal.

I read that after a breakdown comes the breakthrough. I just dont see how to continue with this baggage on my shoulders. I stay alive because killing myself would hurt my partner, friends and family. But I'm stuck in a life that I thought fulfilled me, but I was just escaping from myself and burying my traumas and problems being a workaholic, sex addict and crafting an identity and past that now is crumbling.

I'm desperate."

Thinking of going to therapy and getting diagnosed for clinical depression..,"[20M] A while ago I thought I will powered my way out of a depressive state. But I keep finding myself falling back in. I'm better in some ways but still have some feelings I can't get rid of. I feel apathy towards everything. I live each day with a lack of drive. So very little matters to me.  I'm able to will power myself to go to the gym, except I feel into a rut if not going at all for about a month. Getting back on track with that. But it's easier to do because I enjoy doing it, to an extent. Most other things, like the things I actually should be doing. I don't feel any kind of urgency. I'm also frequently angry. Usually myself but also with how shitty the system I live in is. I think talking to someone who can actually do something about it is probably a good idea. 

Idk 

I'm going to bring it up with my dad today. Hopefully I don't procrastinate that. "
I'm sorry,"I didn't tell you goodbye this morning, I figured you didn't want to see me.

The feeling of wasting your youth,"The thing that sucks about depression is the feeling that you're wasting your time that you have left on this earth. The interest in things that you once loved doing are not there anymore and even if you have an idea of what you want in life, the depression holds you back from being motivated and productive to pursue that wish. "
3rd year college student and I feel like I’ve wasted my time.,"Don’t really know any girls, so haven’t dated. Don’t really go out, just stay home and play video games most the time. I do workout and play sports occasionally which gets me feeling happy but everyone around me and in my classes are going to parties and know so many people and I just don’t know many people. I wish I could enter friend groups but I don’t know how since they all feel established. Because of this, my studies/grades seem to suffer. I have nothing to look forward to each weekend so I don’t really have any motivation to do any work until right before it’s due. I know it sounds privileged to say I’m depressed while I’m in college with all this opportunity in front of me but I just don’t know how to change it. I feel like I’m just stuck and life after college is spoken of as such a nightmare and people say “enjoy college while you can” which makes me miserable because I don’t enjoy it at all. Anyone else feel/felt this way?"

I want to kill myself everyday,"I struggled with depression in early adolescence that had a brief period of stagnation in my later adolescence. I’m 20 now, although ever since the end of high school my views about my own life have only gotten endlessly bleak. When I was a kid I thought who I was at this point in my life would be soo different than who I really am now, which is a huge disappoint. I’ve gone to therapy numerous times but it’s like the therapist may as well be talking to a brick wall.

I never think I’m good enough for any career, but even if I was it wouldn’t make me happy. I have a loving family and amazing friends and I work/go to school, am generally busy mostly all day everyday but any chance I get to be alone I cry uncontrollably. I’m hopelessly in love (or a feeling that imitates it) with someone I can never have, and I have to watch him be with someone else which tears me apart. I’m so scared I’ll never get over him, although I didn’t even date him that long I’ve never loved a person for who they are as much as him. It’s preventing me from dating new people which brings me back to thinking my life is pointless and stupid and void of any significance. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest since I don’t think I can be this honest with anyone in my life"
"Is medication doing this to me, or is this just the shit everyone has to deal with?

I haven't tried it (I'm too lazy, and it isn't something I could do to my family) but I have seriously considered it the last few days, (I did consider it before, but not with this level of regularity) and that kinda scares me, because I just feel like I simultaneously want to die and don't want to die if that makes any sense, so I spend long stretches of the day in apathy, barely caring about anything - I am just starting to get my academics back on ""track"", and that too after reducing my course load to a third just so that I don't flunk my degree - I was on course to do that, and I still might be. Behind that I need to look for a job - my sister reminded me of that, and I was so involved with trying to live that I just didn't pay attention to that, but she's right - its something I just need to pay attention to, and I haven't done that. I'm fairly sure she is disappointed in me - I am disappointed in me.

Like, I don't even enjoy games anymore. It just seems like I'm looking at my pc desktop more than actually playing anything, or opening and closing Firefox or windows explorer folders. Getting work done is fairly tough too, which is why that academic problem happened (academic issue started before the medication, and despite the suicidal thoughts I have started working better after I have started medicine). So i just like a moron spend a ton of time in my phone, not even really checking anything, just opening and closing different apps, before checking something before feeling sad that someone else is doing better than i am, and maybe it's just a thing like ""social media isn't real"", but at least part of it is, and I don't have any part of it.

I've tried to cry but I can't - like there is sadness but I've cried more due to cold temperature than due to emotion. Is wanting to cry bad, like I'm some kind of faker who wants to show off his sadness? I know I am super super lucky that I am able to be diagnosed and go to a doctor about this, and I am super super lucky in general, and many times it genuinely feels bad that I have had so many resources and a family that loves me, things many people don't have, and yet I haven't been able to make the most of it.

I dunno if this is something worth talking about, but i must feel like i must tell someone, and nobody I know js possible because they will treat it like an emergency - and maybe it is, but I don't want to be treated like an emergency, god knows I've been too much trouble to the people in my life already. Maybe people here will know, and will understand enough to help. Thank you for reading this."
I miss him,I can't stop thinking about him.... I miss him constantly. I know that it was all fake and that he was just playing with my heart. It's just.. hard to let go of the only decent memories I have.
My co-workers think I'm mentally handicapped,"I have really bad anxiety and depression and sometimes screw up simple things when I'm really nervous. Today at work I was asked to do something simple and screwed it up and my co-worker said ""what's wrong with you?"" 

I told her about my anxiety and she seemed apologetic after that but I hate the impression that other people get from me because of my mental illness."
breaking my own heart,i tend to get myself into situations that i KNOW aren’t going to end well and ultimately make myself feel like complete shit at the end but i do it anyways. i hate the sadness it makes me feel but i also find it comforting. i fell in love with this boy that i knew could never love me back and when he crushed my heart i felt like my heart was ripped out of my chest and like i couldn’t breathe.. but it was a feeling that almost made me relax because it was so familiar. like an old friend.. 
"Attractive girls make me feel borderline suicidal. Long post, i need help finding how to fix this, also would like to hear anyone elses experiences","I'm just gonna be seriously venting here

I've always been that sweet Mama's boy that many have seen as a ""gentle giant,"" the type that can only show love cuz that's all I know how to do. I've always felt like I will always be at a total loss compared to the next guy because I just feel to embarrassed and inadequate to do shit. I'm 20 years old, still a virgin, living with my grandparents and have had a girlfriend with whom I fucked it all up and acted like a baby because I was too fixated on our sexual situation. I know that being a virgin shouldn't even be that big a deal but I still worry that it's something that won't ever change. I grew up without much confidence in this field to begin with

Since a young age I developed a huge fear for attractive women, putting them on a pedestal so much farther above me in a place where I could never reach but maybe only view for a  fraction of a second from a distance until my view gets obstructed by thoughts telling myself to stop out of not only some mental fear of coming off as disrespectful, but the fear of rejection, and self loathing. 

Being half African American I also feel so much pressure for me to act a certain way and I can always see when I somehow didn't meet some girls expectation of me to know all the right words to say and come off as some sort of stud. And I know that I should say fuck them then for having some expectation of me that I'm not, a lot of guys do, but it's not in my nature, its just not how I learned to operate. A lot of the pressure to me seems to come from a place knowing how fucked my generation and the ones after us are, especially through social media.

I've always had problems with my body feeling overweight and at times as though no girl would ever find me attractive. Since middle school whenever any girl I fancied would walk by, or talk to me, or if I needed to talk to them, I'd start tearing up uncontrollably and just not know what to do. Going into high school, I had just come out of the hospital having gained much more weight while almost losing my life to a bone infection in my head, along with a face riddled with acne because of steroids to make me strong enough to handle the times they put me under and all the antibiotics. This was just another major hit to my confidence. This along with my situation when my ex left me really made me feel worthless, as I was losing my home and being evicted while being broken up with. Taking hit after hit it just feels like I'm not meant to enjoy things, as if I will never be happy because I'm not even allowed to see a cup that's half full, just a couple drops which isn't enough to even keep me alive.

Nowadays I've managed to get my body much more in check compared to how I used to be but I'm still nowhere near feeling comfortable with it, nonetheless that I'd feel it be fair for the girl. I still feel this way even though I'm not weak, and am actually pretty athletic .Over the years my weight started to level out more and ive become quite the handsome guy and get looks and eye contact but my heart still drops way too far for me to pick it up and actually approach or feel like I could ever say shit without mentally shitting myself. I also know that not everything is about looks, but at this point I feel like I've become too confused to know what to believe at all, because people are fucked up, and irrational shit seems to go on all the time when it comes to relationships. 

I've already been to the point of feeling bits of resentment toward women in that sense but I grew up raised by women and have a fuck load of respect so I really keep that shit to myself and in check, i have to see it as a feeling that I throw over my shoulder only to pile up behind me and I'm honestly not aware of how big the pile could be or how many piles I may even have. I'm seriously just laying low in my life working two jobs, not looking forward to college and the rest of my life, feeling like I'll be alone for the rest of it and won't ever get to be included in whatever is going on. 

I simply don't know what to do, and every day I have thoughts of wishing I was dead instead of alive at the time so that I don't have to roll my eyes in disappointment at the next attractive girl I see walk by because I can feel her shitty inflated attitude and ego piercing through my eyes and out the back of my skull. Don't even get me started on seeing couples, it makes me feel even worse, and I have to see them all the time as I work a cashier's job and a salesperson job. I'm forced to fake like I'm happy on a constant daily basis.

People say that this shit isn't a game and that it's not about being better or getting more girls or any superficial shit and I agree, if everyone could have they're special person then that's a fair statement. But what about the people who don't even know how shit works and can't even figure it out for themselves? I fear that I'm going to innevitably die alone."
Talking helps. Whichever way you do it.,"So I had a bad night. Didn’t want to wake up this morning. Didn’t want to face the pain again, deal with all my problems, face up to going out (I know I have to) or get lost again. 
My head was fucked, I couldn’t focus or sort all the things going around in my head. I thought I was having a mental breakdown. I decided to write down everything I needed to do. This list turned into an email to jo@samaritans. I finally fell asleep around 3. When I woke the list didn’t make sense, it also seemed a bit funny and sad. But it helped. I know I’m still going to have an awful day BUT it helped.  All I’m saying is talking helped. It doesn’t matter if it’s in person or an email to Samaritans or a text to a bud or a post to all you crazy (but really funny) people of Reddit or to a piece paper as a list. It just helps. Thank YOU for reading this and ‘listening’ 
I think you’re all amazing. Love you loads. "
Does anyone else struggle to cook when depressed?,"For the past couple years, I’ve been eating one meal per day (fast food) to avoid cooking. Sometimes I’ll buy groceries, but I just end up throwing them out weeks later when they go bad. Fast food is so expensive, does anyone have eating while depressed figured out better than me?  "
Anyone else wish tragedy on themselves to justify their feelings?,"I wish something would happen, maybe a trauma, maybe a near-death experience, or even a family members death. As fucked up as it seems I just want some sort of justification for the way I feel. Now deep down inside I don't truly wish any of this to happen but it's a fleeting thought that occurs frequently."

Anyone else wish their family didn’t care about them so they could kill themselves without the guilt,I have friends and family who love and care for me but I still feel so lonely. I feel like a living burden and if I kill myself then I’d be a burden of grief. My whole existence makes others around me worse.

I'm just so mad and hopeless. I'd ask someone to hangout with me,talk to me but I don't wanna waste their time. My best buddy got distant as fuck,and the only other friend I have doesn't even understand how I feel. I'm scared of the world,scared of my own thoughts,and according to my post in /r/RandomKindness, my headphones were a good distraction and a means to keep me calm. They were given to me by the aforementioned buddy when I was having a very rough time, who's now distant af.

I lost the one reminder I had that the world can be kind, I lost the last trinket of kindness my brother and best friend gave me. I need a hug.

Everything grew stale so I ended it. She wanted to stay together but just live apart, but I was sure breaking up was the right thing. We both were supposed to work on ourselves. Now she’s thriving and I’m so depressed again. I thought I’d be happier without her but it seems like she’s moved on and forgot about me. She canceled hanging with me tonight to go downtown. We share location and so I’ve been checking on her too much probably. I know she has work tomorrow but I see she’s not home. I think she found someone else just 2 months after we broke up. Fml"
A Few Weeks Ago a Friend Took his Life,"Hello,
It has been about a month since I found out a good friend of mine took his life from his struggles of depression, and I have not gone 3 minutes without thinking about it, crying, contemplating what could I have done, what I left undone, etc. He seemed to hide his depression well, as I had no fucking clue the battle he was fighting against himself. I never asked, because it never seemed like a possibility. I suppose I'm here, on this sub to ask how can I cope with the situation? I feel guilt.  It's hardly productive & I feel constantly thinking about it isnt helping. "
My story and self-harm.,"I need help... 

Hello all. I'm going to remain anonymous for personal reasons. I've decided to start writing about this to try and help myself as I cannot afford therapy at the moment.. So here goes.

I'm twenty years old, I've never been to school, I work a fulltime job, I'm supporting myself entirely and I cut myself. 

Yes, I'm twenty and I've never been to school. Growing up, my parents did not believe in the modern educational system. They believed that public schools taught kids to be ""communists"" and ""devil worshippers"". So naturally they never allowed us (I'm the youngest of a considerable amount of siblings) to go to school. Instead they ""taught"" us themselves calling it ""homeschooling"" when in fact it wasn't even that. I have no type of school record. No grades, no points and etc. Now, it wasn't that they couldn't afford it, they made plenty of money. Plenty. 

I moved out of my parents place a little over a year ago because I had the final straw with my parents when one of my parents threatened to kill me with a weapon. It wasn't the first time that they've done that however I decided it was the last. So I moved with the help of a family member, had a TON of catching up to do with adulthood. So everything was and has been rather tough for me. Trying to learn so many different things and adapt to a new lifestyle. I was lucky enough to get a fulltime job a few months back and since I've been doing okay for myself. I do not have anyone backing me up financially so I have to be extremely careful of how I use my funds.

I have depression and really bad social anxiety. I hate myself and I believe the world would be a better place if I were no longer in it. I fight everyday as hard as I can not to give up. On a few recent occasions I've come very close to finally ending it. I was completely finished. I was ready for it to be the last moment. I cut myself and then I blacked out. I woke up not remembering immediately where I was and looked at my clock and saw that four hours had passed by and I didn't even know what happened. Over the course of about ten minutes I started to remember what had happened. It was like waking up from a dream, all the pictures are there in your head but you just can't put them together scene for scene. I've been cutting for a few years now. 2018 was the longest time I went without cutting and that was for about nine months. But I've given in again.. The last couple months have been non-stop stress and upset.. I don't know what to do anymore and I don't know how to stay strong. So I'm trying every possible thing including this, writing about it. Something I am VERY uncomfortable with doing but I've exhausted other resources. I can't afford a therapist so I'm going to try and just write about it and see what happens. 

That's all I'm going to write tonight. I'll write and explain more as time goes on.

I'm going to be trying to write a little more everyday. Just get it out there. If you're suffering from any suicidal thoughts or anything, please feel free to comment what you're feeling. You are beautiful and you are not alone. Please reach out for help.. Don't hold back. I need help.. I hate saying I do but I really do. There needs to be a bigger awareness of people who are suffering. There needs to be more understanding and help. 

Please, I love you all. "
Explaining depression to children,"How do those of you with kids explain depression. I have two little girls and it is hard explaining why I am in bed, why I look sad, why sometimes I go to bed before they do. It is so unfair on them and they have so much energy and I am failing them."
"First time poster, I don’t even know what I need. I guess just to vent but damnit I feel so empty and I just don’t even know where to start",

I need help with my room.,It's gotten so horrible again. My room is  small (20'x7.5') so it looks extra messy n even tho I watched that documentary on Netflix I still feel kinda stuck. The clearest area is my bed but other than that there's stuff on the floor that idk what to do with. I kinda want to just push everything in a bag n toss it out...
My depression is getting worse,"Logically speaking, my Depression is getting worse. I've had depression for the majority of my life, it's something that has haunted me compounded by an awkward childhood, an abusive childhood situation and a feeling of alone, key ingredients. 

I'm 25 almost 26 now, so I've been battling depression since I was 3, I'm not here to glorify that I've had suicidal thoughts since I was that young, but I just want to say I have to get that off my chest.

As of the past 2 years my depression has gotten worse at an alarming pace, I used to be able to push forward with the motto ""men aren't bitches, you'll let down yourself and your family"" if you acknowledge Depression, but at this point I have to acknowledge that I am in a downward spiral.

I have zero energy, none. I tired at work, tired at home, tired at school, I sleep all day when I'm not doing anything but if I was doing anything I'd be sleeping. I have zero motivation to do any of my hobbies or talk to anyone. Games, no rather sleep. Hike, no rather sleep, cook, no rather sleep. So forth.

Now on top of this consistent tiredness everything sets off episodes for me now, primarily it's relationship oriented I understand that's a cliche depression bit but it is what sets off Episodes. 

I'm at a point where all I do is day dream about suicide, that's it. If I'm not sleeping I'm thinking about suicide. I don't see a future, and I'm at a point I hope something like a car kills me by blindsiding me before I'm in my 30s.

Thing is I don't want to die, it's hard to explain, I do want to die, but then I don't. The voice in my head wants me to die, the low energy I have wants me to die, but I myself the smaller voice that is actually me, doesn't want to die. 

I'm in a very terrifying place right at this very moment, and if I don't get help within the next year I could see myself killing myself in some fashion, I don't want to sugar coat it in any way. 

I don't know where to go to get help. I don't want to talk to a shrink and tell them my feelings, because frankly I don't care if they knew them and talking about it doesn't solve anything for me. I'm not having an crisis, I know who I am, I'm not a nihilist, I'm not looking for a higher power and all of that. I simply don't want to talk, I want results. 

I want to go to the doctor and say hey Doc ""I've been ducked in the head for 22 years, I'm either going to commit personal suicide or I'm going to do something wreckless in order to force suicide.""

I don't want to talk about my feelings, I don't want to get anything off my chest, I just don't want to blow my brains out, I need help, I want help, I'll pay whatever sum of money is required to get whatever medication it is, but if I don't get this soon, I'm gone before I'm 30."
I never thought I would feel this way,I’ve always knew I felt empty. Every day when I wake up I just want to go back asleep because being asleep seems better than being away and having to deal with everything. The other day I really wanted to run away and just kill myself. I thought I could be forever asleep which seems better. I’ve have held a knife to my wrists imagining what would happen if I just quickly spilt my wrist. But then I thought if I survived people will think I’m out for attention. I just feel so empty I don’t know what to do anymore.
I don't know,"Okay so last night something really weird happened. I think I felt love with my depression? Or I fell in love with my depression???? I don't know, either way I felt warm from my heart and smiled when I thought about depression. Anyone else had this? "
"I’ve tried, and I got exhausted","People say the passage of time will help, or being busy will. Well, for me, both didn’t. I have tried every kind of possible activity , I learned new things, I watched new stuff, I became better at what I’d loved to do. I waited for things to get better, I tried to have a normal busy life. I tried setting goals for myself. 

But again, the cycle is never ending, it keeps on going, and me trying to act normal is depleting whatever parts that are still me.  

I went to school when I was suicidal, I thought faking being normal would help. It didn’t, I feel worse and worse by the day. 
I cannot do this anymore. I just want this to end, or I’m going to lose my sanity. "
"Go to bed with suicidal thoughts, wake up with suicidal thoughts","Hi,

I'm sorry. I vent so much on the internet because no one would listen to me in real life. I want attention because I have social anxiety, but that does not make this a made-up story or anything.

It is so bizarre. While having social anxiety I played my first concert last friday and people told me it was really good, though I am socially awkward so I ended up sitting alone most of the time after the show anyways. Did not care at this moment, but the thing is only 2 days later I go to bed wishing I just would not wake up, wake up after 6 because I just woke up for no reason ( I sleep until 3PM on weekends) and the first thing in my head was just ""end it all"". I don't know why people say reach out, get help all the time. There might be people where this just won't do anymore. I feel misplaced in this giant shithole world, how can anyone help with that? I grew up without a single person around most of the time, there's no reverting that, I longed for friendship, true friendship where someone would contact me on a regular basis and askt o do anything after work or on weekends, but that didn't happen and I will always have these memories of no one wanting me because I am weird. I hate myself. I don't think I am ugly but still I am a trash human being that can't grow up. In my head I am still a fucking pre-teen, I am not mentally retarted but when I remember that it is 2019 I freak the fuck out and self-harm because the past won't ever be here and I hate the present. Not that the past was any better but I could lock myself in my room and play games all day then. It was not good but better than working and seeing how everyone pulls off being social and having friends like it's nothing. It's gotten to the point where I always get overrun by cars because I don't care to look when crossing the street, when I see a high building I always wonder if someone ever jumped, when I wait at the trainstation and a train is passing I wonder when I will take the final step on the rails. It's fucked up and I know but I don't really care at this point . From this point on everything will turn shit naturally because that's jsut how the world works. It's sad to think that I probably die without ever knowing what mutual love is.

I'm 20 btw, live alone and hate modern life."
I have no motivation,"Everything I start I eventually lose motivation and never finish. I've started a few hobbies in  the past 6ish months and they're things I really really enjoy but I just lose all my motivation for them and put them down. I've started several video games too and I just never finish them. I'm also in my first year of community college and I've hated it so far, I thought I wanted to go into music and I started last fall in the music program and not even halfway through the semester I withdrew all my classes because I didn't want to perform in front of people and it was stressing me out every day. My parents were paying for the classes and i agreed to pay them back and it was just short of $4,000. I only make $10.50 an hour at my part-time job and I'm only getting about 3 days a week 4.5 hours every day I work because our sales aren't good and the company can't afford to pay us or some BS like that. I'm also terrible with my money, I'm super impulsive and I usually go through my paychecks every 2 weeks. I took online classes the next semester which turned out to be one of the worst financial decisions I've made other than dropping last semesters  classes because I don't do my online classes, I haven't checked them in a month, the classes have probably kicked me out because I don't do the material and that's going to add to the $4000 I have to pay my parents back because I don't think its fair for me to have them pay and not do the classes. I push them aside and try not to think of them and my parents still thinking I'm somewhat caught up and they're both big on school and they're going to be pissed once I tell them or they find out I've been lying this whole time, probably going to be put on probation too which is fun. In highschool I skipped class to the point where my dean almost suspended me. I was depressed for half of my senior year, but when summer came around and I was finally free of that prison I wasn't really depressed anymore. I don't know why I just give up on everything, I feel like a failure, I couldn't really care less of what my parents think of me at the moment, I just feel like a miserable POS to myself. All i do is watch youtube and play videogames all day. I have no idea what I want to do besides the one thing I'd want to do which I'm way to anxious and scared to get into. I have no ambitions whatsoever. I don't want to go to college anymore because I think its a big waste of time and money and I have no clue what I want to spend my miserable life doing. Is this part of depression? I dont feel depressed but I've just been so confused lately that I dont know."
Cant think of a brighter future,"Been an achiever in high school and college academically. Was very happy then, and very positive about having a good life since i do see potential in myself.

But here I am, after all the hardwork, left a great job due to stress and fatigue, was hoping itll make my life better, but quite the opposite and now it bothers me everyday like a nightmare, i feel like im not good enough

Women i like dont like me back, maybe because i am too short and below average in height, am fat, and unattractive. My gf in highschool exchanged me for my bestfriend. The girl i liked ever since i was in grade school doesnt feel anything for me, but i did tried my best to show her i liked her, her friends tricked me that somehow she liked me back, realized just months ago it was a lie, and i feel like s*** holding up to it.

now have an ok job but cant be promoted due to techical issues and somehow fixing it is out of my control. 

dont have enough money to buy simple joys that i think would make me feel happy, 

father’s sick, almost all money i earn was given for his health or other needs my family require, overloaded with loans, cant stop thinking on how i can pay with my current salary, everyone in the family seems stressed over money and ny fathers health, cant think of a way to make this any better

cant enjoy free time i have, cause i need to take exams and review all i can think of is how to pass and how to pay for the exams

Im a smoker and now i feel worse about my health alot of issues that needs doctors attention, but it is actually the only thing i do that makes me feel alive, 

I cant see pass through all these. Had to talk here cause i feel like im dying inside. Cant sleep properly sometimes cause i just keep on thinking, cant share to anyone else cause i feel like theyll say this is just lame. 

I pretty much hate everything about myself and everything about my life. And i wonder if i havent been that serious in life, would i have ended up having a better life? "
"My friend is struggling with depression, and can’t get help in person. Does anyone know of any free online resources?","I just really want to get him help. I can try, but there’s only so much I can do. He needs to talk to someone that can say what he needs to hear. And he can’t go to a therapist in person bc his parents are really just, um, shall we say part of the problem, and he can’t pay bc he can’t explain the bill. I’m really just hitting a wall here. Everything I’ve found is behind a paywall, but he really needs help. He is open to online help, and would be ok w irl help if it weren’t for his parents. He can call, text, video, whatever. "
I’m not living I’m existing,I’m not living I’m existing and it’s fucked 
Intelligence and depression,"I feel like intelligence is significantly dampened in the wake of a depressive episode. As a kid I got these IQ tests from psychologists telling me that ""it"" was the best they'd ever seen (whatever the fuck that means) and now I lose track of what I'm doing when I fucking walk into a room. The mental acuity is gone and I'm not sharp in any aspect anymore. Work used to be a coping mechanism but now its just another thing to deal with. Anyways, I just wondered how many of you feel the same way."
What’s the point of living?,"A question I ask myself everyday. I try to think of reasons but they all lead to a “but why?”.

I’m not really living, am I? In existing, wasting valuable oxygen. The only time I’m really truly happy and care free is when my mind is numbed by alcohol."
what is life like with permanent economic stability?,I often wonder :( and daydream
Hey everyone,Hey well today I went and got a K10 test done for a mental health plan and I saw that the result was 37 which is seen as a possible major mental disorder and now I am scared and I am going to organise a meeting with the therapist that a friend suggested. Just wanted to tell someone cause if I tell my parents they will just stress me out like they always do. Thank you random internet users for listening.
I wish I could stop existing,"I'm only 17 years old and I feel like my life is already over.

I don't know why I feel this way, I have a group of close friends, two (somewhat) supportive parents, and I don't have stand-out traumatic moments.

I'm pretty good at a lot of the things I try, but I don't *feel* like I am.

I feel worthless, and that I don't deserve the people around me, I feel like no matter what I do, I'll never have the motivation to go through with it. I couldn't even pull the trigger to end it all.

Maybe it's because of the abuse my brother put me through, maybe because of the bullying in middle school, that ruined my self-image and worth, or maybe it was when because of that girl who shoved me into a closet and raped me.

Maybe I'm genetically predisposed.

Sometimes I think about my brother, and how I wish I could look up to him, or just have a conversation without wanting to vomit. I want to be able to tell my dad that I am bisexual, and for him to actually *believe* me.

I wish I could convince my mom that she is still beautiful, even if her skin condition has ravaged her skin, and that she is still incredibly smart, even if her brain expanding causes her to lose her train of thought sometimes.

I wish I cared more about my dying grandfather, who is an incredible person.

I wish I could cry more, and I wish that talking to someone about my problems and my hangups would make me feel better.

I wish I was more empathetic. I was when I was younger, but somehow through all the torment and sadness, I came out a shittier person.

I wish I could explain why I can't just talk about these things to my parents, and that whenever they ask how I'm doing, I could tell them that I'm not ok that want to just disappear.  


Normally after one of these nightly bouts of unyielding anguish and emptiness I'd just tell myself that I can just tough it out.

But honestly, I don't think that's true, I know that sometime soon, I'm going to lose. "
I can't do this,I've called the mental health team. Spoke to friends and family. Tried getting in touch with my doctor but unable to get an appointment. Five minutes after i woke up i was in tears and i can't stop. I feel the only way I'm gonna get any help is if i make it a life or death emergency. I managed to stop myself last night but now the house is empty
I’m just sad,"Just crying in my bed silently at 1:30 in the morning. Wishing I could stop feeling anything. Wishing I didn’t hate myself. 

Why does everything suck."
It's early Monday morning and I can already tell this week is going to be terrible,"I'm still laying in my bad an hour after I was supposed to get up in order to have time for a bath and relaxed breakfast. I have an urge to just stay in bed, especially after I woke up at the brink of crying.

I can already tell this week is going to be terrible..."
Not a single cent can make me happy in my current situation,"I dont have a future in life anymore. Im stuck in a maze full of unhappiness. I've done my best to be happy. I've done my best despite my mental health condition. I was hospitalised months ago because I risked my life and I am still fragile.

I wanted to move and start anew far away in a new country my financial situation cannot accommodate that. I went with a job farther away but I couldnt save a lot of money. I just cannot save due to the expenses I have. 

I would have been happy to learn all what I can work as a worker and a professional. I could not because I am simply not treated as a decent person. Im not treated human. Im not given respect. It is disappointing.

I cannot live here. I cant. Im struggling to live. I cannot understand why I have to live like this.

Im simply a mess. I cannot live like this anymore. Not a single cent will make me happy in this life."
"Haven't cried in 3 years, anybody else like this?",Like the title says i haven't cried in 3 years i genuinely want to cry because i miss the feeling of letting it all out but now its nothing. I can feel the need to cry but nothing comes out all i get is a terrible feeling in my stomach and thats it. Is anyone else the same way?
I wish my heart would stop beating,"*Thump.*

*Thump.*

*Thump.*

My heart works harder than the average person's because I'm obese, not like I'm trying to change that.

*Thump.*

Sometimes it skips a beat. In these moments I feel a sense of panic. Although it's rare, it feels... wrong. But so does the organ in my chest. I've wondered for years why it still continues to pump my blood. I did nothing to deserve this life. It's been one shitshow after another and I'm just done with it.

*Thump.*

It beats methodically, like a rhythm that's always on time. Perfectly synced with my slow breaths, or with my quick dashing around a room. 

*Thump, thump, thump.*

Oh, there's my anxiety again! I think too much. I wish I had more than one friend in this world, but I am appreciative of them. But they're so much more successful and social than I am, so their time is often limited. I know they don't really like me. They can't.

*Thump.*

I've tried killing myself several times. My fiancé jokes about how I'll have the liver of a forty year old at age twenty. That sure makes me feel better...

*Thump.* 

I can't do it myself. There'd be too many questions surrounding my demise, too many disappointed faces, and too many people feeling like they finally won against me. 

They got me to do it. 

I will not be defeated so easily.

*Thump.*

But if my heart were to just... stop.


Like a clock that's out of batteries.


It would just stop.


Obviously I can't cause this to happen myself, but I wouldn't be upset at my eventual fate. 

There's no reason for me to be here."
I feel like I'm about to slide into another depressive episode. Wish me luck and hope I come out of it sooner rather than later.,"I'm having to accept something that's not easy, and give up yet another important thing to me and it's really going to suck for a while until I find a way to live with it.

I saw my doctor on Friday and he's having me try vortioxetine for the next couple of weeks to see if that can help to elevate my mood.

Usually my depression isn't cognitive or situational. It's just a persistent lack of energy and interest in most things and has been going on all my adult life (18 years). Once in a while, I also get slammed with extreme emotions (sadness/anger) and go through one of these ""episodes"" which I feel like I'm about to go into and these are always surrounding some kind of situation or fact about me or my life that I don't want to face but have to because it really sucks.

So, that's what I feel like I'm facing right now and I'm really not looking forward to it, but I know that trying to resist it will just make things work and the best thing to do is just to dive in and keep going until I come out the other side of it.

Wish me luck!"
Whatever,"Instead of being happy and pretty like every other 15 year old girl, I'm:

* Depressed 
* suicidal
* Sad
* Lonely
* tired
* Have excessive body hair and probably have PCOS
* Have facial hair
* Have a terrible future
* hopeless

There's nothing I want to do more than kill myself. My father has a gun he keeps around the house and there's nothing I want to do more than blow my brains out with it. My excessive body hair makes me want to kill myself so badly. No one will ever be attracted to me because I'm so disgusting.

Might just kill myself during the summer. We'll see. I hope I get the courage to do it."
I’m scared,"I’ve been struggling with depression my whole life. I’ve been in therapy since 4th or 5th grade and haven’t stopped going since. I’ve tried so many different things and I feel like none of them have worked. This past week every night I’ve been sober I’ve been up into the early morning freaking out, and having to walk around my college campus to calm down. Tonight around 1 am I drive to a parking lot a few miles from campus and was going to try to sleep there. I don’t know what I’m doing. I don’t know why I’m still trying. I’m afraid that this isn’t going to stop. I’m getting desperate for help, I’ve tried talking to people who I wouldn’t usually talk to about it, I’ve tried meditation, positive self talk, and now I’m posting something on the internet about it. I feel so lost."
fuck i hate myself.,"i’m useless, so fucking useless. i try and do something and my self esteem just drops to 0 and then i just give up and go to bed.  i have no traits, i am just there, i exist. i hate that i exist, but i’m too much of a pussy to hang myself. i barely have any friends, i talk to no one all day and just feel like i’m too much of a waste of time for people. i don’t enjoy anything anymore. i barely eat anything all day because all i want to do is stay in bed and avoid my problems. honestly, why would anyone even want me alive. i’m annoying, i’m obnoxious and retarded. i’m useless, that’s all i am - useless. "
Does anyone else stay awake even past the point where your eyes hurt,"I'm sitting here with work in the morning in 4 hours. My eyes are killing me but I feel like I WANT to be tired. Like I deserve it. I don't deserve sleep. I need to earn it.


Anyone else?"
I feel most like myself when I want to kill myself,I notice that I feel most comfortable and normal when I went to kill myself. Anyone else?
Possibly something good?,"I’ve been struggling like normal for the past little while, but I’ve met a girl and for the first time in a while I actually feel a little bit motivated to be more outgoing because of her. I haven’t been intrigued by a woman in a long time, but I feel calm around her, which is a significant thing for me and my anxiety. I just thought I’d post here because it can always be bleak, but I see the potential for something good to happen in my life for the first time in a while. Here’s hoping the same might happen for some of y’all."
Tips on Kicking a depressive episode,"I've suffered from depression for about 20 years. It has usually come in episodes that last for a few months, goes away for a few months, then it always comes back. I'm lucky in this sense, that at least there are times when I get to breathe some fresh air. That being said, I'm surprised I'm here at all after all this time. Since I'm such a quiet person about my mental illness, the fact that I'm here is largely thanks to a strategy I've built to get myself back on my feet. I see many people on here struggling with similar situations, so here goes my strategy:

- Getting out of bed. If I'm going to sleep all day or watch TV, then do it on the couch.

- Taking a shower and shaving. Just this one little act of self care always makes me feel like I can do one more thing during the day.

- Talk to your doctor. Sometimes medications need to change or be altered. Always be sure to make them listen to your personal needs and goals.

- Drink water. Get a two liter bottle or huge cup and fill it up. As an alcoholic, this has been really important for me to get hydrated and give me something to do.

- Go to the store. There have been long stretches in my life where the only person I've talked to for weeks at a time was the cashier at a grocery store or a gas station. Just seeing another person does something to us as humans.

- Go for a walk. I live in the far north where it's winter for 5 months a year, but I force myself to just walk for 10 minutes a day. Listen to music, go to a corner store, take the dog out. Anything. Just get moving.

- Drink Tea. Night times are the worst for me, and alcohol has always been a crutch. I always start the night with tea or hot chocolate. It's a moment to do something intentional and get out of my head.

- Write. Your head is an echo chamber for bad thoughts. Write all that crap down to get it out. Burn it or throw it away if you don't want others to find it. But Always make sure to end every entry with something or someone you are grateful for. Also, writing here and responding to others can help. 

- Make it about someone else. Spend some time responding to others posts on here, or volunteer in your community. I force myself to volunteer twice a week. It gets me out of the house, and makes me spend some time not thinking about myself. To live is to struggle, and to love is to serve. I don't care enough about myself to treat myself with respect, but I will respect myself if it allows me to serve and care for others. 

- Call someone. Friend, parent, kid, co-worker. Anyone. Just to shoot the shit... Or if you have the gumption, tell them you are struggling or you need help. I never have the guts to tell people I'm struggling, but I encourage you to if you are stronger than me.

- Eat a non-carb heavy meal. Salad, taco, meaty something. Carbs slow you down and put me into the couch. One light meal and a short walk make me feel like a new person.

- Find something that motives me. Researching something on YouTube like wood turning (those videos are so satisfying to watch), going and getting some paints to mess around, discovering a new book. Find something to get motivated about.

These won't work for everyone, but for me taking a few minutes for self care like showering completely changes my day during a depressive episode. I hope this might have helped in some small way. I wish you all the best, thanks for reading."
One month,"I’ve had enough of feeling like this, of not mattering to anyone. I’ve decided i have a month to get things sorted, to get past my moms birthday then I’m doing it. There’s no reason to struggle any longer, I have nobody who wants me in their life, my existence just causes people pain. 

I’ve tried working things out, therapy doesn’t work, medication doesn’t work, every day I just feel lonelier and further from any chance of happiness. 

April 19th, that’ll be it. "
"Does anyone else feel particularly agitated, or is it just me?","I feel really burnt out after long (and I mean hour-long) study-sessions and loads of homework. My therapist told me that lack of motivation is part of my depression symptoms, and maybe he's right. I don't feel like sleeping, showering, staying awake, eating, starving, drinking, working or not doing anything. Each time I try to convince myself to do something I just get tired and frustrated, but when I do nothing I'm filled with guilt and hate myself for procrastinating. I'm also becoming very irritable towards my family even though I don't really mean most of what I said. How should I find motivation? I'm tired of feeling like a burden to my family but can't bring myself to do anything about it. Today I just stared at my biology textbook and cried for half an hour, I feel like procrastination is a blanket I always go hide under, but I don't know how to get out from it. Can someone (and you might've been through this too) tell me what I can do?"
Im afraid...,"hey r/depression, i was at a party a few days ago with a bunch of friends, some international exchange students host them (mostly Mexicans & Brazilians) anyway i was having a good night and i started chatting with this girl from brazil, we were having a good night. i asked her if she wanted to sit somewhere quiet, she agreed and we moved away. we sat for 10 mins talking and we both leaned to kiss, we made out for a good 10 mins before her having to go back home... i dont know what it was but ever since then i've been feeling somewhat depressed. nothing really makes me that happy and i've been on the verge of tears for since we kissed... what the fuck happened?! i was perfectly fine and couldn't be happier until after we kissed... i really need serious advice from you guys"
Not motivated to live,"A lot has happened. And I'm not even 20 yet. I am a weak person, and i depend on others. I've been to many hospitals for suicide attempts, long-term and short-term and nothing helps. It never gets better. I stay up all night and sleep all day. I am always gloomy, and it tends to rub off on others, making everyone avoid me. I feel like cancer really. I'm insecure as fuck. Always comparing myself to others.  Im only happy when I'm high. And thats only temporary. I've tried medication, therapy, venting, but nothing works. Honestly it hurts to be alive. And its fucking exhausting. "
Apathy and Overwhelmed with Choice,"Working in IT. I don't see myself in any other field but lately I just don't care. I feel like I'm overwhelmed with so much to potentially do in the field that I can't pick. I've always had trouble with picking something that will impact the rest of my life. 

I don't want to home lab or study or get better. I just want a paycheck. Im still pretty young but I don't really care. I used to care but lately it just seems like the time demand for IT just takes a ton of time away from the things I want to do. There is nothing I can do that will make as much as this now without heavily investing in education again and I'm pretty happy with a Bachelor's with only 5k left in debt. And there's nothing I am passionate about, but I chose competency over passion when I went to college. I've been playing it by ear ever since. I don't know if I even really feel this way. I'm just frustrated. I DO study and I DO learn and I like tech but I don't feel like I'm good enough. 

The sad part is I've basically thrown away my friends and moved  an hour and a half away for a career that I'm apathetic in. I want the big bucks (coming from a family that had to work factory or minimum wage jobs, it's big bucks). Nothing has ever made me passionate.

Also I'm probably going to be the only income provider for my house in the future when my SO and I have kids.  My SO doesn't have a degree, so there's no way I can change jobs unless I up our lifestyle, so I am stuck doing something I don't care about anymore. I like solving problems with technology but it's getting old and I just feel like laying in bed all day.

TL;DR Depressed, unmotivated, stressed and stuck. 

Sorry this was a general whining thread. I don't have to money for therapy so I'm venting. I may not feel this way tomorrow morning."
I need someone to just talk with me,"My life has been so fucking rough, four dads, one abusive mother, and now I’m lost and stuck laying awake at night next to someone who loves me, but that I’ll end up breaking the heart of. 

I want to die I think, like honestly want it to be done so I can just not have to deal with feeling so much of the weight of the past pressing into my chest and hallowing me out every time I take a breath. 

I know people love me, and J know that maybe someone cares, but I just want some other reason to stay alive besides the pain I could cause other people. Help. "
Scared to die alone,"GF of over 4 years told me we needed to talk the day before Thanksgiving ‘18.  The following day she told me that my suspicisions were confirmed: she was cheating.  She told me she planted her lips on approximately 6 total people, and slept with three (it’s probably significantly more, now).  I don’t have family and friends available to me which means I spent my birthday, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and NYE alone (all between November 25th and Jan. 1).  Needles to say, I was confused and deeply depressed, almost suicidal, for the holiday months.  I’ve since started to receive psychological counseling for about the past two and a half moths.
  
Recently, a large growth was found on my scrotum.  I called to tell her the news that I went unde the knife for a biopsy, that the growth was scary large, and that I was scared.  I had to drive myself to the hospital and endured the process completely alone, and drove myself home without anyone who knows me.  She said it was not her problem, hung up on me, and crawled back under her rock.  She mentioned ‘what if’ we had a kid, thanking god that we never actually settled down.  For a few years, she cohabitated with me and I was the one who paid the rent and bills as she got herself through school.

 The only thing I wanted was to convey on the phone was that I needed to share my recent issue with SOMEONE who knows me.  I couldn’t get in a single word, I was shouted down, and hung up on.  We were once in love, but maybe that was also a lie.  At the very least, I thought she was my friend.  I feel alone, scared, and completely misunderstood in what may be one of the final stages of my life.

Meanwhile, I’m in this bed, alone and concerned about my future."
Probability of being a doctor?,"Hello all,

I have been struggling with Bipolar 2 (diagnosed last year, prior diagnosed as depression), PTSD and ADHD for some time. To be honest, my grades in college so far have sucked ass. I'm planning on finishing my degree in 6 years instead of 4, and hoping on bumping my GPA to *maybe* 3.3 or 3.4. That's a HARD maybe. I'm in a computer science degree, it plays to my logical brain but it is brutally difficult and time intensive. 


Saying I want to be a doctor is short selling it. I can't imagine anything else. My heart has been on the ""sciencey side"" of medicine since middle school. Toxicology, Infectious disease, pathology, they all play on what I'm passionate about beyond words. 


I'm getting better, but I'm so scared it's too late. I'm terrified that I'll never get there because of my mental illness, and because of what it's cost me so far. 


If anyone out there has been in a similar situation please let me know. Sometimes I just need an encouraging words in my dark days. Hopefully I can come back to this and get some advice or hope in the future. 


Edit: spacing for readability. "
Ive struggled with depression for most of my life.,"I am a 23F and I've struggled with depression since a young age. I have a 36 on the BDI-II My life has been one awful circumstance popping up after another. My parents divorced while I was in second grade and I never really got to process it. In fifth grade I was raped by my mom's boyfriend's son. He continued to black mail me to sleep with him from then till 7th grade. I was teased most of my grade school career for being more reserved and nerdy than other kids. My mom stopped seeing his father around the beginning of my seventh grade. She got engaged to a different man when I was in eighth grade. He killed himself in front of us when I was in ninth grade. We were hiking and he jumped from atop 200 foot cliff while me and my mom were at the bottom. I still remember the sound of the smack when he hit the ground. After I graduated from highschool I thought things were getting better for me. I got a full scholarship to my top university (Temple, Japan Campus). I was out in Shinjuku with my guys friends at a gay bar when I was raped by a navy man in the bathroom. I got very sick after this and no Japanese doctor could tell me what I had. They thought I might have contracted HIV. I was flown home and had to leave TUJ and forfeit my scholarship. I was sick for four months and I thankfully it was EBV and not HIV. After that my older brother had a mental break and shot a man, he is now in prison. This took all of my families money to get a lawyer. My brother and I are very close so this hit me really hard. I feel like I lost my closest friend. I then got accepted to University of Hawaii. In an attempt to keep moving forward. During my second semester I was raped by a TA who had invited me to play overwatch with him and his roommates. I was drugged and he proceeded to rape me seven times while I could not move. I told my father what happened and he told me I was probably asking for it. This was the first time I admitted I was raped and so I did not tell anyone after besides my friends who helped me after it happened. My rapist had dropped me off a block away from my dorm on the sidewalk and so I had to call a friend to help me inside, otherwise I would not have told them. I left that school because my advisor had told me that my degree went under changes and that Id have to stay an extra year and a half. I was also so depressed at this point that most days I wouldnt leave my bed. It was so hard to even fathom trying to do anything. So I took a semester off and changed schools again, this time back to my hometown. I met a wonderful man and four months into our relationship we find out that he has cancer. He had a complete response to treatment. All of this while having extreme depression. I dont think those around me understand how fatiguing life is with depression. I can tell my bf is getting a little fed up with my fatigue. My mom is as well. I feel like I have to keep up with normal minded people but its so taxing. Life has been awful to me, as Im sure it has for many other people. I just wanted to share my story. Life is hard, life is unforgiving, and life doesnt keep tally of the rights and wrongs. When Im happy all I can think about what will go wrong next. Im always preparing for the next awful experience and its no way to live life. I dont want to be like this, Ive tried therapy and several different prescriptions. Nothing worked for me. Maybe its just my lot in life."
2019 seems to be the year for everyone to start crumbling.,"22F - I've had depression since I was a child. My childhood was rife with sexual abuse and events that forced me to see the dark places in life before I was capable of understanding them.
Depression has been a rollercoaster of thinking I'm improving before slinking to a deeper sadness than the time before and this year has been by far the worst. 

However it doesn't seem to be only me that 2019 is having this effect on, with the lives of almost everyone around me being a huge bumbling mess of stifled goals and insurmountable stresses. People keep telling me it's because of the current phase of the moon or that the year of the Pig is taking its toll on universal energies but I find that a little difficult to get behind as an explination. 

Maybe it's that my perspective on life has changed these last few months, that my 'fight or flight' wired brain is taking note only of the bad in situations rather than allowing the good things to shine brighter... I feel as though I'm in a constant state of panic, nervous breakdowns wrought with vivid flashbacks of abuse happening on an almost daily basis. I don't enjoy life. I scrape by with a heavy heart - clinging to those who still need and care about me for dear life, constantly searching for reassurance from those I'm close to. 

I have recently become obsessed getting a confession from my father for his abuse, as if it's the missing link to improving my mental health. His denial has been making me doubt every memory I have held since childhood, sending me deeper in to this funk. I have been watching my partner with his daughters like a hawk whenever he has them due to my ridiculously high anxiety, which is causing unnecessary tension between us -  sometimes sending me into full blown panic attacks over something as small as his 4 year old laying with her feet on his lap.  

I don't even know what my point was at the beginning of this, I'm so numb. So tired. My memory is like that of a goldfish because there are so many things happening in my mind at once that I can't retain information anymore. I'm fucked and I don't know how to get out of this. This is the first year I've considered dying and not even as in killing myself but just how much easier things would be if I no longer existed. 

Again, no idea what my point was but life sucks and then you die ✌ out

"
What if we're all dead,What if we've all died one day in our sleep and have now woken up in hell
"Tomorrow, at the age of 33, I’ll finally be attending my first therapy session.","I’m nervous, anxious, excited and scared. I’ve suffered through childhood trauma (sexual abuse and physical abuse). Due to the abuse, I suffer from depression, anxiety, ptsd and a lot of self doubt. I’ve lived life scared and afraid; so much so, that I was afraid to love my son for fear that I’d somehow mess him up. I’ve always put on the facade of being better than ok; but the more fine I seemed, the more I was deteriorating on the inside. I became unable to suppress my depression and anxiety when I was laid off from my job in December 2015. I felt completely used, defeated and lost. I gave up going to college to work full time in retail management and after four years of working over 40 hours a week and missing a lot of my son’s events, it was over. I met my husband around that time. He is an amazingly kind human. He has been the biggest advocate for my mental health. My family (not husband nor kids) are a piece of work. They constantly destroy any emotional stability I have. I’m easily derailed emotionally by their problems and feel obligated to “fix” their problems. With the support of my husband, I’m ready to address these issues and build the strength I need to let go of the unhealthy relationships in my life and create healthy boundaries within the relationships I choose to keep. I never imagined ever being able to feel this healthy and loved. I look forward to working with my therapist to understand me more and develop better coping skills. "
Nothing to offer other people,"As someone who craves validation from others in order to validate a shaky sense of self-worth, I hate feeling like I have no skills, practical or otherwise, that can be of help in other people's lives. I've lost the social acumen to be supportive and cheerful, and I can feel some of my friendships with others slowly dimming because of my apathy and uselessness. "
Toxic attachment,"I struggle with depression, and anxiety, i never have had girlfriends in real life, nor many friends, im a loner in every sense of the word, Everytime sumone comes in my life and treats me well and i connect with them, i get so attached, to the point im beating myself up every minute i dont recieve a reply back on social media. I get so attached and i start realizing im getting attached and start literally fighting myself in my head about whether or not to keep feeling like this, i get so depressed because its like not a lot of people i see have it the way i do, sure sum get attached but i rarely see people getting super depressed or whatever about the other person not replying. Does anyone know why the hell i feel this way??? Is it mixed with other possible issues? Possible insecurity?? I just feel embarrassed in a way to admit to people just HOW attached i am to them, i act out and get angry and super depressed because of this feeling, and it often leads the other person to wonder why im acting the way i am, but i never confess because im embarrassed."
Friends,"I just want one friend I can be completely and totally honest with, without judgement or bullshit. The problem is I feel like such a shit show that I would never trust anyone that much. I want to die, but don’t want to kill myself. I have a heart condition and pacemaker, and have seriously considered just stopping my medicine, but that would mean leaving my son. I feel trapped with no way out, but also feel like I deserve it."
Feeling alone? Wish you had someone to to talk to or just check up on you? Maybe I can help.,"Hey fellas, my name is sonny. I’m an average fella who’s suffering from depression and been a part of this subreddit for a while. I’ve been noticing a trend from users feeling like they wish they had someone to talk to or check up on them. I know what this feels like and I wanted to figure out a way to help. 

I’ve always wanted to start some sort of small business, but I know I’ll only be successful if it’s something I’m passionate about. I created my first website called [sonnyfella.com](https://www.sonnyfella.com) 

I’m providing a service where I would personally reach out to you on a daily basis and be that friend you’ve always needed. No two experiences will be the same as I want to build a unique relationship with each individual. I want you to feel like you’ve known me your whole life and I want to be someone you can be yourself around. 

Just a disclaimer, this is literally my first website and it’s not very professional looking. I’m not looking to become a millionaire plus I doubt I can’t handle millions of people by myself. Your business would help me financially and hopefully I can reciprocate by helping you emotionally. 

You can try me out free for a day to get a feel of what to expect. Just check out my page and click “get started”. No donations required for the first day. 

Looking forward to meeting you fellas.

Would you disclose your depression to employers?,"I landed my first full time job abroad and they have this form where I have to present my mental health history... They asked if I have any mental health issues i.e depression, panic attacks, anxiety etc., and the last occurrence. I was suicidal only twelve hours ago.

I'm inclined to say 'No, I dont have any mental illness history"" because I'm scared they'll do something discriminative about it.. It's in a country where mental health isn't seen as important and we're seen as a bunch of crazies"
DDD,"To me you're just dead inside, so why do you still choose to fucking lie. All that you used to do was bring me down, so now that I'm finally on top, you take the knee and bow. I've had enough of everything that you used to do, rip me from my roots and beat me with your boots. There is nothing that I would love more in life, then to watch your family bite the knife. I know now that one is gone, and that the devil has a soul to pawn. The others are not that far behind, so whimper and whine as their bodies turn to brine. You have nothing left to live for, and your time is now approaching, blood will flow through every pore, as you hear the demons voices ring."
Loneliness,Is anybody else lonely to the point that you don't even need a phone! Nobody cares about you no matter how hard you complain or cry. Nobody texts or calls. Everybody says that they're ur friend but never want to make plans. You only talk to them when you are at school and nowhere else. You beg to communicate so much that they call you annoying. Feels like I dont even exist....
what the hell happened (posted this on the wrong sub so someone directed me here),"like seriously. I used to be ambitious, i wanted to be a doctor, i won awards in school, i avoided drugs. now, im just a depressing, self depricating, nicotine adictted, borderline alcoholic. I spend my time lurking on 4chcan and reddit and looking at old pictures of myself while getting drunk and crying over nostoligia. I spend almost every fucking day telling myself that today is gonna be the day im gonna finally end it but in the end im to much of a pussy to do anything. i'll never have a SO because i spend every waking moment crushing any sort of selfestiem and worring about my parents finding out about me being gay. im a fucking failure in everyone's eyes now and now all that's left is the idea of the person i used to be"
I hate monotony,I hate having to wake up everyday just to work a job I have no passion for. I hate being constantly reminded how lonely I am by social media. I hate having ads shoved in my face every second. I hate how soulless art and pop culture seems to be nowadays. I hate how hard it is for me to find joy in the world. If it weren't for my family I would've off'd myself years ago. 
"Depression preventing me from graduating, ruining my future. But...","I was an A student, Club President, and routine Volunteer. Depression hit me like a truck and I haven’t recovered since. It’s crazy how you could go from competing for the top 10 best grades in your entire grade level to struggling to even graduate. Work wasn’t difficult and I failed classes because I just didn’t show up, didn’t turn in work. Got 100% on all assignments but obviously it doesn’t count if you don’t even turn them in. The thought of suicide was always on my mind and I felt like shit constantly. And for what? My life was perfect so why was I so sad? 

I’m not graduating. I’m a drop out and I’ll have to go to adult school. My peers and I used to talk about the universities and scholarships we would get while in our AP classes but now I won’t have any scholarships. 

I’m embarrassed and I feel destroyed. I lost everything. 

I told my therapist. I told her how much of a failure someone is for dropping out of school. How my life is ruined.
Then she told me something personal. When she was younger she had an argument with her sister. Her sister had also dropped out of school for depression and in that argument they had, she threw it in her face that her sister was a dropout. She didn’t get her high school diploma until she was 20. Well guess what. Next month she’ll be taking her dissertation defense to get her doctorate degree. She’s the reason my therapist got into mental health for her sister’s sake. 

She dropped out and graduated late and now she’s gonna be a Doctor if she passes. 
Maybe I should’t give up just yet. "
"is anyone else's only motivation the fact that things can be shittier? and if yes, is that motivation fading away?","i apologize for the poorly worded title, but anyways... i get out of bed so my mom doesnt tell me to do so for 30 minutes. i hand in assignments so i dont have my teachers on my ass. i take my meds and insulin so im not considered a 'threat' to myself and get locked up in inpatient again.

it's so tiring to live for making things less bothersome. i wouldn't even call it living, more like just avoiding death/annoying people/bad situations etc etc. i'd roll over and die but i don't even have the motivation to kill myself...

a few months ago they switched my meds and i actually felt somewhat decent, but i switched schools yadda yadda having to fight every day got tiring and it's like i'm not even on anything anymore. i get that can be left to me and my coping mechanisms at this point but i don't care enough to use them. i still have to fight because this school is awful (both subjectively and objectively) but like... why do i even care? yeah ill be able to take decent classes, have time and freedom, and be in an enviroment where i dont have to worry about being triggered but why does that matter? 

i dont want a future. i dont want friends. i dont want success. i'm perfectly content wasting away at this point. can i fix what's been done? can i make things right? can i get myself to a point of recovery? i guess. but do i care? nah lol. 

but i do wonder, is anyone else feeling like this? i guess lack of motivation is a common depression symptom but i guess i just feel alone in this. thnx"
Idk what day it is,Idk when she broke up with me. Idk how long it’s been. I can’t try anymore. I give up.
Been a depressing weekend,"Yesterday, there was a potential shooter threat on campus. Girl I’ve been crushing on and me are barricaded in the basement of the library. Decide I’ll tell her how I feel if I get alive. Shooter alert turns out to be a false alarm. Tell her later that day. Friend zoned. Depression just got worse, ever since I went to college I’ve been extremely lonely, even when I had friend group I never felt like I really had any real friends. No one to hold me at night when the darkness closes in on me. No one to comfort in times of hardship. I just feel like everything I love is fading. I’ve thought about suicide multiple times this week. I have a plan, was going to write a note just in case."
To the Scattered Army of Spouses/Partners of the Depressed from a Fellow Soldier,"I have declared this year the year of ""divide and conquer."" But really, what that means, is that I'm going to start asking for help and sharing my burdens.

I've been married almost three decades to a kind, funny, handsome, intelligent, and soulful man who has been deeply depressed the entire time. And over those many years, I've gone through (and recycled again and again) a litany of feelings and stages: confusion, frustration, anger, sorrow, lonesomeness, despair,  and overall the battle fatigue of having shouldered the bulk of the household and relationship responsibilities, including the raising of our two children. And sometimes, I've just wanted to run.

He comes by his condition honestly: a family history of depression on both sides, including suicides. And the nature of depression, at least in my experience, is that the person suffering can not often get the momentum to even get started in getting better. Missed appointments, un-returned phone calls, skipped doses of medication, overwhelming fatigue, a reluctance to talk about any of it are the pitfalls of a depressed person's day, week, month, year, and decade. And even with the help he's gotten, he's never really climbed up to anywhere close to ""better."" I've never really gone to his appointments (when his prescriptions need to be refilled.) I'm sure the doctor asks: how are things. And my spouse says: fine. And he gets another six months of his pills (that really aren't working. That haven't worked. That will never work.)

When we were first married, I could not understand why I wasn't getting assistance around the house. Why he slept so much. Why he was distant. Why he never had much to say. The TV, the bed, the video games, the caffeine, the isolation -- they were all part of his cocoon, and he said once that he felt in a way that his depression was a comfort, like a blanket. A few times I reached out to family members, and they said that everything looked okay from their vantage point. ""Maybe it's me,"" I thought. ""Maybe this is normal?""

My spouse was diagnosed about 15 years ago with atypical depression, which is actually quite common. Someone with atypical depression has a lot of the classic symptoms of depression, but they perk up and seem to be pretty functional when something fun is happening. Or if they get good news. That means that to a lot of the people we know, my spouse seems normal. If we go visit relatives, we're going to movies, playing games, visiting interesting places...and he seems pretty happy. And when we get back home, it's right back into bed for him, and right back to taking care of absolutely everything for me.

It is hard to care for someone who is depressed.

And it is lonely.

But I know that I am doing the best I can. And if you are the partner of someone who suffers, you are most likely doing the very best that you can, too.

Tonight I am thinking about you, the caretakers. I am one of you, and we are warriors.

We've got another appointment this week with a psychiatrist who is hoping to get a very clear diagnosis (ADD, autism spectrum were both mentioned as possible contributing factors.) The community we live in is small, so our resources are limited, and getting appointments takes time.

I guess I'm just not finding very much for online support for partners of the depressed. It would be nice to have a reddit group just for us. I doubt our local community has anything like that, but I will ask the psychiatrist this week what my options are as the spouse of someone who is still suffering from depression. I have not given up on him. I can see him in there, and he's fighting, too."
The end.,"I don't know what to expect for writing in here but I need to write this from my chest.
It's now a few hours after my[24] GF[21], who is the person I love the most on this world, of over 6 years ended our relationship.
It came out of nowhere for me.
I suffer from mild depression all year around and went through a really tough phase since November. Basically went suicidal over the Christmas time because of multiple reasons. (My mom got really sick and I was in fear of her dying, and the change to university triggered it hard)
I partly blame the whole desaster on it because I became mildly paranoid and overly attached because our relationship was also on stress because the university and work put us both under constant work, so we didn't see each other often.
She has her problems too, started seeing a therapist recently.
So why did it went down the gutter......?
The reason I got is she can't work on our relationship at the time. Before this we had an agreement that if anything is wrong between us we would talk to each other and try to solve the problem.
Looks like the problems got too big this time.
She says we both suffer at the moment because of her having issues. Can't have sex since months(we were low-sex since the beginning, no-sex at the last year) and physical intimacy is also of the table since recently. Not the greatest for me but manageable even for longer periods of time.
Then there is the issue that we had nothing to talk about. Communication went from texting ""good morning"" then the plan for the day, after work shortly how it was and then ""good night"".
I tried my best to liven it up a bit since our last talk about this issue, but it didn't help much.

I really don't know what to do now. I feel like I was stripped of all my purpose in life. Fighting for the relationship seems a stupid idea since she says she has not the strength to put up with me, has no romantic feelings for me and doesn't know if they are just temporary vanished or forever.

I don't want to fall back into a void."
The only reason that stops me from ending it all...,"I’ve been suicidal for the past 3-4 years and have had multiple self harm incidents. Everyday, I always have the thought of suicide cross my mind. However, the only thing that stops me is how others would feel. I’ve always been a nice and kind person, I’ve always worried about others rather than worrying about myself. The reason I waited a few years to spill my emotions to my parents was because I was worried how they would feel all the time and always be paranoid that their son might not be there when they get home from work.  I know that I would be in less pain and would be in a better place and my stress/anxiety/depression would be long gone. But, I know how devastated my parents would be if I went through with it. There is just no way I could let them go through that for the rest of their life. But I still contemplate it everyday because it never gets better. Sorry for the rambling...feels good to get it out
"
Depression negatively affecting my marks,"I’ve had depression for as long as I can remember. I barely made it through high-school. I’m pretty sure I was pity passed in high-school math because my teachers knew about my rape. After graduation, I went 7 years just working and partying. I finally went back to school this September. And I never do my homework unless someone is helping (usually my boyfriend). If he can’t help me, I stare at my homework, cry, and then just don’t do it. I feel like I am incapable of doing it by myself, so therefore I just don’t. I try really hard to convince myself to, but I just don’t. Multiple assignments have not been handed in because of this. Any suggestions on how to do homework while being depressed? How do I motivate myself? I’ve tried working out. It makes me feel happier, but I still don’t do my homework/study. "
My lifestory,"Trigger-Warning I guess

Hello,

so, I don't really have anyone to talk to. I feel like I am all alone and the friends I have at the moment will leave me soon enough like every other friend I had in my life.

I just want to talk about my life and I just want... support. I am crying nearly everyday and I just feel like dying. There is nothing for me that gives me some kind of purpose in life.

My mother was a single mom. I loved her so much as a child, but at the moment... I do love her, but not unconditianlly.

I have two older half-brothers (two differen fathers). When I was one year old my mother ran away from my alcoholic father with my brothers and me. At least that is what she told me. She came to a little town where everybody knew everyone. We where polish living in Germany. My mother came to Germany when she was around 25 years old with her first husband (as well alcholic).

I hated going to pre-school as the first person do every bully me was my teacher. Yes, she shamed me in front of all the ohter children although I only remember one time. I drew with pencil on the table at 5years old. She came to me and said: ""If you can't delete that you will have to pay for the table."" In front of all the other children, loudly. Doesn't sound so bad, but to a sensitive little girl who cried easily?

Of course all the other children started to act like the teacher because if the teacher does it they are allowed to act like that as well, right? Because a teacher is always right. (Fuck you Mrs. Veil) She even shamed me about my name, that it's written falsley which wasn't true at all because it was in my polish passport. Don't remember the things tho. But because of the size of the town every child went to the same school. After pre-school there are three possible schools a child can go to: Hauptschool, Realschool and Gymansium. The ""dumb"" ones go to Haupschool and the ""intelligent"" ones go to Gymnasium. Well, I went to Hauptschool. And the bullying from my first year in pre-school never really stopped. I was nearly drowned by a classmate when we were around 8 or 9 years old, they tried to inflict physical pain, wanted to shame my by putting stuff into my backpack and accusing me of stealing it.

The thing is tho... up to my 14-16 year I don't remember much. Really, I don't. My life... it doesn't feel like a normal life. It's as if I am computer where so many things where deleted.

And then there is my mother. My mother which I adored. I was so depended on her that it must have been unhealthy. I always wanted to be a good girl, to never make her mad. (I guess because I witnessed how she beat my brothers with a belt but I do not quite remember it. Just a tiny bit.)

Turns out she is a toxic mother. She sent me to ballet and to piano lessons. Which is fine but... she constantly critizised me. At every fucking turn. Everything I did felt never good enough for her. My brothers? Never really helped me with the bullying. Yes, my mom went to the teachers to complain etc but it never held long until the bullying started again. What she also did is manipulating me into hating my father but I only remember good things even though he was alcoholic. He taught me swimming, tried to make me happy with the little money he had. And the last time I saw him was when I was 14, too young to realize how I was being manipulated into never wanting to see my father again. But with him I remember feeling safe. Despite the alcohol. I think I was the greatest love he ever had. And now he might be dead. And I feel so guilty.

When I was 13 I tried to kill myself. No one knows about it. I wanted to drown myself in my bathtub. At that time I didn't know I had depression. Heck, up to three-four years ago I didn't know I had depression. Never even knew that was a thing. I was around 22 at that time. I slept with a knife under my pillow just in case I wanted to kill myself. The only thing I remember from that time is crying. But I went to the medical centre at the university and they helped me realize what I had.

When I was 14 my mother remarried. He provides for her and me and my brother, (the oldest brother has a job and lives with his grilfriend at the moment) but only because of my mother. He doesn' respect my brother nor me, is a choleric and my first memory of him is that I didn't want to learn for school. Somehow it escalated and I had a breakdown. (I was 10 at the time I think) I was so scared of him I hid under the table, crying, screaming. My mother held him back, but instead of coming to me and hugging me she went away and I was left alone. Please, for the love of God, never leave a crying child alone!

But with my mum it also got worse. When I was 22 I went to study for half a year in Great Britain. Sometimes I think it was the worst decision of my life... other times I think it was the greates. In GB the depression started and I realizied I would really kill myself if I stayed there longer. So I went on an Erasmus program for the second semester in Belgium. When I got back home after that one year... my mother was highly religious. Yes, she was religious before, me too, as we are from poland lol but... my God. She... She went crazy.

We had a huge argument after I came back. Around two weeks after my arrivel I guess. It was so bad we screamed and I cryed and I hid in the bathroom. Somehow she opened it up and stupidly I though she would try to talk to me and we could hug it out, but what does she do? Sprinkles me with holy water because she thinks a demon took possession of me, or something like this. From then on her obsession with religion got only worse. She started to believe every world in the bible to be literally true. Evolution is just a scam for her. No, she is not a flatearther, nor is she a anti-vaccer. Still.... the believe is destroying her.

I am a chaotic artistic person as well. I want to make my own money through art. My mom is very tidy and wants every room to look like a fucking IKEA catalogue. Which will never be possible while I still live with her.

Now my depression got worse again through the last couple of months. I can't sleep good as well and suffer from Insomnia. An houer ago my mom came into my room at around 4 am in the morning and critzised me for not being able to sleep, that it's my own fault and that my chaotic room is responsible for my insomnia. Oh, and my Assassins Creed poster is as well responsible for my sleep behaviour because ""It looks demonic."".

The worst of all which brought me over the edge and gave me a panic attack: ""Are you even human?!""

Yes, mum, I am a human. Just because I am not your ideal daughter doesn't mean that I am not human with feelings and needs.

Sometimes I really wish she would finally die.

At the end of the day... I just want someone to truly love me and be there for me. Like I would be there for that person. But... sometimes I don't have the feeling that I am capable of loving someone as I have never been able to fall in love, be in a relationship or hold any relationship I ever had in my life.

Fuck, I'm broken.

Edit:

Also I suffer from migraine and chronic pain."
Self diagnosed depression? Don’t wanna seek doctor’s help,"I hope I’m not offending anyone, but has anyone else kind of just labeled themself as depressed? I mean I know I have all the signs, or at least a majority of them. I’m always tired, down, etc.. but I really don’t wanna go to a doctor and start popping pills to help w this. At what point do I stop being stubborn and seek help ? I just keep telling myself: you’ll get over it on your own. Patience. But I’m sick of feeling this way when I have goals "
I can't sleep,I try for like 5-10 minutes and then go on my phone or get out of bed. I can't sleep unless I'm dead tired and then sleep for 10 hours and wake up mid day again. The cycle goes on and on. 
Can’t sleep,Insomnia is really bad...I hate when this happens especially when I have a lot of stuff to do the next day nothing helps and I can’t shut my brain off.  Melatonin doesn’t help either 
I try to get on tinder to distract myself from the loneliness but...,"I just keep swiping left because none of them are my ex.
And as much as I don’t want to admit it, I still don’t really want anyone besides him. It’s over, that bridge is burned. But it doesn’t change the feeling that he was the one. 
I hope it fades eventually. "
Depressed like Hell,"I am currently feeling so fucking down, Just took 8 medicines and 2 tumblers of coffee at the same time. I feel like shit!!"
At what point does the fatigue become a sign there might be more then just the depression going on?,"It took me at least 2 hours to get to sleep last night. It must have been 1.30 or later before i actually was asleep. 

I did get woken up by my alarm eventually this morning, but I was so tired i decided i would get a bit more sleep and get a later train to uni. 
Next thing i know, its 3pm. I've missed all my classes. "
I feel oddly bipolar.,"So, I've never used Reddit before but I hope this can help me 'vent?' I guess, I don't know the right word or what I'm even looking for, but I'll post here  


(excuse my grammar, I'm probably gonna have a lot of run-on sentences and bad punctuation)  


I don't really know how to start, I'm 21 as of February and still living with my family, I'm self employed but I'll keep what I do for work since I don't believe that's too important. And well, I haven't had many friends growing up, I live out in a very forest-y area and there were no families with kids around, I was raised in a family of 7, my mom, dad, twin brothers and two sisters and that was about all I had for ""friends"" but that didn't upset me.  


I'm probably rambling at this point so I'll get more towards what I mentioned in the title, I feel like I'm bipolar, kinda anyway. And every now and then I'll go back and forth between how I 'feel' and what I do in my free time, for a couple of days that is.  
I would like to think I'm emotionally strong but every few weeks I have a few days of feeling down, not terribly depressed but like.. not satisfied with how I am, and questioning how I am.  
Normally I act like I guess what would be considered a regular ""American"" type of person, I like guns (but please understand not in a harmful way, I do my best to be professional with that and composed) I just represent myself as a regular person, I don't talk much to people and I only know a few other people locally, but just barely.  


Now for the less ""regular"" side, please bear with me, but I am a furry too.  
Yes I know, kinda stereotypical of me, a furry with strange emotional issues.  
But- the ""other me"" is a furry, I have a lot of friends that I talk to that are furries but almost none of them live near me, this doesn't upset me but I behave almost completely different, I'm more social as a furry than I am as a 'regular' person. I want to feel 'cute' I want to snuggle with people and have regular physical attention, hugs and stuff, but..  
This other side of me just doesn't seem to be me, vice versa if I'm in more of my ""furry mood""  


Right now I'm making this post in my 'normal' state, but I also feel down. like I said earlier I tend to switch every other day and at points between I get upset at myself, questioning sexuality, how I represent myself, how I look.  
I look in the mirror sometimes and don't see ""me"" in the reflection, I had my haircut recently (it used to be long, just to my shoulders). I liked it, but then sometimes I get to the point that I didn't want to have it cut, same thing happens when I grow out my hair I can't decide if I want it cut or not.  


I'd like to think these weird back and forth feelings don't affect me a lot, but I'm just not sure. I question myself more and more as I get older, when I was 15 and 16 it didn't matter at all to me, when I was 18 this all started to happen more and more, is it normal for it to keep going? recently my mother got the family a new insurance plan and we had to go to the doctor to set things up, I didn't tell my primary care physician about any of this when she asked if I had bits of depression every now and then. I was afraid she'd suggest medication or something but it really isn't a massive issue.. I feel anyway.  


I haven't told my parents everything, but I did tell my oldest sister and mom that I was a furry a few years ago after I had a fight with my dad. My mom wasn't fully accepting of it but she tried to understand, she never even heard of this stuff, but later on I regretted my choice because she blamed herself.  
And I definitely regret telling my older sister, she's the type that assumed she knew everything about me when I said ""furry"". She thought I liked Disney characters, she said I need to get a fursuit to make myself feel better, she insisted I go to a furry convention and that it would help me, and the worst part is she tried explaining ME to my mom, biggest mistake ever. But when I told my mom that my sister doesn't understand how I am, she took my word for it.  


After all this my oldest sister said if I don't want to go ""be more furry"" she said she's take me to a psychiatrist if I wanted to, but that's just it.  


I don't know what I want, so I said no and that was about 3 years ago now. I don't know if I made the right choice to avoid going but I just don't know what I want, I don't know if I like being ""regular"" or ""furry"" I just go back and forth with it, questioning myself and my behavior, religious views, what comes after death, will I go to Hell if there even is a Hell, will I go to Hell anyway if I'm just normal..? just a ton of questions that fill my head every now and then as I go back and forth with these moods and behaviors, and I don't know what to do or make of it all.  


It's probably just a bunch of rambling at this point, I'll stop here I guess, there's a lot more but I just don't know what I'm looking for, or what I want for myself, if I want to stay one thing or something.

Apparently Suicide = Gay?,"Today I was scrolling through the front page and this post came up with a drawing of Anthony Bordaine. I showed it to my step mom and the first thing she said was that he was gay for killing himself and saying why someone would kill themselves and that he was in hell. I dont even know if she was joking or whatever but I felt crushed in someway. I had hoped that her watching A Million Little Things would have somehow showed her what it can be like. It just solidified in me the reason why I dont tell my parents or even my friends shit about how I feel on the daily. 

I am from a county where people are not as ""PC""/ sensitive / liberal as other places but I still feel so disappointed and out of place on top of the depression. "
My Dad is in a deep depression.,"He puts on a happy face. Nobody can see this but me. Nothing I say gets through to him. He claims we cant send both me and him to therapy but I know that's BS. What can I say to him? He claims he is a failure, that he can't support for the family, but I've had a wonderful life. Is there anything I can say that will get through to him? "
Why am I like this,"I've always wanted to die I feel like the world would just be better without me, I finally thought something changed last year when someone entered my life and we were speaking non stop everyday for almost 5 months, later down the line I find out they had lied about a lot of things but I still fell for them and now I just feel like an obsessed creep so to speak who honestly should just die so I can't disappoint anyone else or be like this -.-"
I’m extremely depressed at the moment because of my true realization that no one really cares about me.,"Ever since I was little, I could never really make friends well and I was always pushed to the side like I wasn’t even there. It got better when I got into high school, but that flame died out and no one really cares. I try to make relationships and ask people out but everyone says no, or there’s an obstacle between me and them. My “friends” don’t actually care and I never really feel accepted. They just go off into their mini groups and then I’m left all alone. Recently I’ve had major problems with relationships and I broke. I started crying for the first time in a while but I had to put my beanie over my face so no one would know i was crying. We are currently on a trip and when we got back to the hotel my eyes were so chapped and dead i looked like a zombie, staring down and walking all the way back to my room. I just want people to really care and I want someone to hold and call my own. "
"I hate everything about my anxiety and depression, but have a love/hate relationship with the insane IBS it gives me....","I know I’m not the only one out there whose body is affected negatively by their mental illness. I’ve lost hair before, my back will break out with acne, I have bad aches and pains, sleepless nights, or 18 hour sleep days... and the best????? IBS or at least that is what the doctor and I think it is right now.... hopefully won’t get worse and won’t turn out to be somethings worse....

   I have had body image issues for a long time, basically due to my mom and my most recent ex. And I’m in a very stressful living situation with my ex and my anxiety and PTSD along with depression is going full swing.... then one day BAM! IBS hits me after 9 years of “remission” from it.... I feel like there is something wrong with me bc I see it as a blessing, almost like self injury... I don’t have to actually hurt myself to feel pain... my body does it for me and I can’t eat much and I see myself slimming down a lot..... 

I think it’s messed up the way I am thinking, bc of course I hate it but I love it..... anyone else go through this before or dealt with bad IBS?"
Please reply,"OK, to give context, I'm a 15 year old junior in high school. I skipped a grade. The high school I go to is a very prestigious school; I'm in the hardest program in my city. It's a CTA school, and is very helpful in college and career preparation. The problem is that none of my friends go there. I've known them for a long time, and when we hang out, we have lots of fun. But the only times I've seen them is either at church or when my brother (who is their age) is hanging out with them near my house, which isn't often, and even after skipping a grade, I'm a year older than most of them, putting me two grades ahead. I've been trying to get invited to things, but its tough without sounding annoying or needy. Furthermore, the girl I like, who I've had a crush on for at least a year already, goes to their school as well. In fact, if I haven't skipped a grade, we'd be in the same grade and would probably have classes together. All of this is besides the fact that I'm terrible at making friends, and I don't really have any friends at my school. Oh, and I'm super depressed. I've been thinking about switching schools to be in at least the same school so we could hang out at lunch or on the bus, but we wouldn't have classes together, and I would be leaving a great opportunity at my school, where I'm learning about a lot of really cool, helpful knowledge for college, even though I absolutely hate it there. The school I would switch to would seem like fifth grade in comparison and I wouldn't learn a lot. My parents think I love it a my school, and would't want me to switch, but my friends are telling me that if I want to, I should switch. I told my mom that I have depression, and she just told a doctor from my church that did nothing for me. I hate my life, and I want it to change, but a) I don't think I can change it, and b) I don' know whether it would actually be better. What do I do?"
help you and help me,"i remember the time i had so much hate for this world, I know all of 7 billion people on this world has had a part of them self being not happy.Its a hard fight but its worth fighting [for,](https://for.you)

[ you](https://for.you) only get one chance at life, you guys helped me on my first post and because i have experienced depression i would like to give back that support and advice. everyone might find this super weird but im a person you could be willing to trust, if that means telling me about your heartbreaks,heartaches then come to me. I might be young but i have already had my happy place to  come, I have experienced love and i now know sometimes love doesn't come at both ways, but i hoping to find someone who does. i can even tell you stories,funny moments and create a  connection to you. my name is jules wall and I want you to help me and help you "
I feel stuck...,"The last few months I have been really depressed and lonely. I have many friends that all have said in the past they have supported me but over the years i feel as though they have just used me. Gone to have other friends and havent talked to me at all. I dont feel loved by my family and whenever my friend that still sometimes hangs out with me comes over all of my family wishes they were their son/brother. I feel like an outcast that no one wants to approach. I get attached to people really easily, feeling as though someone who says one nice thing to me wants to be my friend. A girl i really liked lead me on telling everyone that she was really in to me and asked me to sadie hawkins dance. But then during the whole night she was with a different guy and now they are dating. Along with that she started telling gossip about me that wasnt true to all the girls and guys she knew. So now no one wants to really talk to me. With everyone just avoiding me i feel so lonely that all i want is a hug from someone and tell me it will be ok. With all the gossip and rejecting i never feel like going out and talking to people anymore. Thinking that they'll talk behind my back about something i did. But even when im home i feel stuck. The thing that i loved which was my safe haven (video games) is now hard for me to love. People ghost me and never talk to me anymore. Playing games i loved by myself isnt fun. I reached out to many people that i thought could be my friend but they unfriended me and im alone again. I have so much anxiety now that i dont want to try anymore. I feel as though everyone is against me and i cant fix it. I dont know what to do."
I am one of the many social outcasts and it's eating away at me from the inside out.,"I don't feel like writing an essay tonight, so I'll keep it short.

I'm a fucking loser, people never include me, I try my best generally, but I just don't know how to fit in/people dislike my personality.  I'm not mean, I'm not hated, I just don't have any friends really.  I'm in high school, for fuck's sake!  Grad year - I see everyone getting together like never before, except me.  I'm out of the picture... nothing.  Never been to a party (never been invited), do things with friends outside of school once every year, and lay in bed doing nothing for 7 hours a day.  The most exciting time of my day is either when I go to work or school.  It sucks."
I don’t know how long I can take it,"Not gonna go too much into it because I’m already mentally tired. 

I’m trying my best to help out my mother with taking over the bills but my step dad is so clueless about everything and doesn’t have any common sense on how to act like an adult and take responsibility. My mother and I have had enough of his BS. Almost every night he argues and I’m always trying to protect my mom then call him on all his BS. And almost always threatening to kick us out even though we pay all of the bills. 

 I just feel like I’m going to break soon and surprised I’ve lasted this long. I’ve already gone through hell and back with living with my father and now dealing with it still. I’m scared it’s going to interfere with my college studies. I just got back into it and afraid I’m just going to give up because I’m not strong enough to keep going. I don’t know what to do anymore. "
The hits keep coming,My girlfriend just broke up with me because her parents wouldn't approve of us. Just because I'm Latino...
What do I do to gain the hope I lost?,"So I'm not officially diagnosed but I know I'm depressed. 
I am still young (20s) and I'm still in college. 

I have one more year to go and at this halfway point I just feel so hopeless. 
I'm getting great experience at school and with my current job (minimum wage) but I got hit hard a couple days ago. I was told if I were to stay by my college in the summer, my parents didn't want to support me in any way. 
But if I were to either stay home and work a dead end job I've been at for 4 years that I'd rather be dead than work at, that I barely make anything at, ""all my expenses"" would be paid (no rent or food i pay for everything else). I've tried before to look for jobs but nobody in a small, rural area is looking for summer help there. I've looked all over and got the same results. Nothing. 

Which is why I thought I could take some online classes over the summer, rent a cheap room, and get a good summer job by my school, I'll be fine.
But now I'm being forced to overlook jobs that would be fun just so I could have a higher wage.
I just got so mad and gave up. I thought what would be the point. 

This feeling has come at such a bad point in my life. I'm almost done with this semester and I just want to get through the rest of this. I just don't feel like I can do it.

The job at home makes me want to kill myself. I've actively thought about what I could do so I wouldn't have to go home or go to work. I usually go to my car when I'm working to go scream or cry.

I just hate the area because it's everything I don't like and I'm so fed up with it.

It feels like it's going to be forever before I have my full time job after the internship in the city, far away. 

Everybody at my job at home makes me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome. I've tried to look for other jobs but nothing is hiring, if it is it's for much lower pay and hours. 

I just don't feel like I can ever escape anything and start over. And I want to so badly it's driving me crazy.

What should I even do?
I just feel so stressed out and anxious and I want to not feel that way even for just a second."
So many things - Sorry,"I have a lot to talk about today. This is gonna be very long.

I'm going to start by establishing a few things. I'm 18, I'm a second semester freshman at a pretty good school in my area. I live on campus, my mom lives about 45 minutes away from me. No license, no car, no job, no job experience, no clubs, nothing.

Ok. Now that that's out of the way: I'm struggling. 

I feel like I'm just lazy and don't even deserve to talk about my 'depression'. I'm taking 10 credits this semester (part time student - honestly not supposed to be living on campus but haven't been contacted yet). I haven't showed up to one of my two current classes since the second week, and I start a minicourse next week. There's no chance I'll make over a 2.0 this semester, I had a 2.5 last semester. I was an amazing student in highschool, took college courses, got good grades. 

I have no money. 5 dollars in my bank account. I've been applying to jobs but I never get them because I don't have any extracurriculars or job experience from highschool. So I keep having to ask my mom for money. I feel like a freeloader and a failure. Every time I ask her for money she makes me feel like I'm a bum.

I've been in and out of therapy since I was 9. I'm telling you it hasn't done anything. I keep getting worse. My suicidal thoughts are getting more often, but when I tell my therapist she doesn't seem to care because I don't have any history of self harm or suicide attempts and I don't have a plan. 

My hygiene is fucked. I'm lucky if I force myself to take a shower once a week, and brush my teeth just as often. I know it's gross.  But I can't take care of myself.

I weigh 280 pounds. I've gained 50 pounds in the past 7 months. 50. I can't look at myself in the mirror. My weight inconveniences everybody around me and I look and feel like shit all the time. I can't walk up a fucking hill to my dorm without getting winded. My roommates make fun of me for it behind my back. I hate myself.

I haven't been taking my meds. I keep forgetting that I even have to take meds. I keep telling my doctor and therapist that I'm taking them, though. At this point I can't go back and tell them that I've been lying this whole time.

I don't know what to do. I just want to die. Nobody cares. 

I don't even know what I want from posting here. If I tell you I'm asking for advice, I'm lying. Because I'll never take it. I never do. It always goes in one ear and out the other."
I feel like I’ve already lost.,"Every time I start feeling relatively decent, I crash really hard and have to start all over. I feel like I’m playing a game I’ve already lost. Why do I bother working so hard when I’m not even sure that I’m capable of being happy? I’m exhausted... and for what?"
Depression is oddly comfortable,"I for sure go through phases where things get very bad and I hyper focus on things and get very down to the point where I become miserable. Or have major spikes in happiness where everything feels like it is teetering on the edge between euphoria and an eventual collapse.

&#x200B;

But, sitting under a blanket writing edgy (and probably very cringe) poetry and listening to sadboi rap while in my feels is oddly comfortable. It feels like home in some sense. "
Depression and Breathing issues,"I was recently diagnosed with depression after seeing the doctor regarding some breathing issues I've been having here recently. I know anxiety is a normal symptom when it comes to depression and that it can cause chest tightness and feelings of being unable to breath when it flares up but what I've been dealing with is more of a persistent  low level tightness and what feels like I'm unable to take as deep a breath as I used too. Also it doesnt HURT in the same way a cut or scratch would, it's more of a dull resistance that I feel when I take a breath.

Really what I'm asking is if it's normal to experience breathing issues like this while depressed or is this something that should be looked at by another doctor. They've checked me with a stethoscope and say I SOUND fine but that's not exactly the most reassuring thing they could tell me. If I don't pay attention to it, it doesnt bother me that much but it's still noticeable. And obviously when I do pay attention to it, it just makes me anxious and makes it feel worse than what it really is. 

Have any of you guys/gals dealt with anything similar? Or is this a just normal symptom of depression?"
"When your face feels like its inflating, does that mean im doing it right?",Please don't try to talk me out of it.  When strangling myself and my face feels like it has a lot of pressure is that enough pressure to kill myself?  I have twine tied to my foot and around my neck to put pressure on so when I pass out I continue the pressure.
Ever have those moments that stop whatever you're doing?,Those moments that make even taking another step difficult. Where it's tough to just enter or leave a room? Lately it's just been a struggle. I hope that if anyone else is in these moments just know you're not alone...
There's not a single thing about me that hasn't gotten worse over the last 4 years,"I'm 20 now and literally every single thing about be was WAY better when I was 16. It's been a pretty steady and dramatic decline ever since. I think really hard for even ONE thing that might be better about me now than it was then and I can't think of a single thing. My girlfriend even agrees. She says it without me even saying it first. I'm not better looking, I'm not smarter (I'm actually way less smart), I'm not nicer, funnier, healthier, more mature, any of that. I'm objectively a worse person than I was 4 years ago and I haven't heard anyone disagree when I say that. I'm supposed to be a functioning adult and I'm nobody compared to who I was before I could even drive. Great"
Nothing brings me joy,"I've getting medical help, and I thought I was getting better but I've come to realize that nothing brings me joy, not the books I read, not drawing, not the shows I use to love, the games I played or even going to my once favourite places. Everything just makes me tired of exhausted and miserable. It's like it's either sadness or numbness. I'm not sure what to do with my time, or how to fix this hole, I can try things but nothing works. 

Not asking how to fix this, not sure there's a way but any idea how to just live with it?"
You ever feel like friends are never really your friends.,"I'm not sure if I'm crazy or something but I feel as though my friends aren't really that caring of myself. I think that they just keep up the appearance that they are my friends but in reality they don't care that much. I always had a hard time connecting with people but it always feels like I'm the only one who wants to be friends and the only one that tries to continue the friendship. The feeling seems to stem from the uneasy feeling I get from hearing all of my friends talking about a best friend, every friend seems to have a friend better then me. As if I'm nobody's best friend. My friends won't share alot of details with me that they feel I shouldn't know, and won't let me talk to their good friends cause it's ""weird."" Nobody is at a comfort when I'm around or atleast nobody gains it from me.

Maybe I'm just a super jealous and clingy person, but it feels like I'm just super unimportant. They can talk about so much but just nothing personal but when I share personal stuff its always 1-way and not welcome."
[something sad],"Living with depression is so unpredictable like you're family member can die and you're like whatever, no feeling, then you drop a fucking soon and you're like that's it, that's the end."
Anyone out there?,Depression has hit me a few times. I always feel lonely like a social outcast. In the day I usually am all chatty and having fun with friends but at night sometimes I can’t sleep and depression hits me hard. When that happens I feel like I need someone to talk to so I’m not lonely. No I do not need to talk to the suicide prevention hotline I’m probably nowhere near that point yet. I’m just lonely that’s all.
I want to ruin my life.,Burn all my bridges. Give myself a real definitive reason to kill myself. Just a last little push over the edge.
College Sucks,"This is really just a long vent post bc I dont feel like I can talk to any one about this shit. 

Basically, I’m a second semester freshmen in college and I’ve dealt with depression, anxiety, and selfharm for 7 years. Since about my junior year of hs I’ve had all of this under control — taking my meds, going to therapy, using coping skills. Even though I knew I’d probably have this for the rest of my life, I felt I could control it.

Now, Ever since I’ve come to college it’s been downhill. I’m extremely numb, always anxious, and so overwhelmed by my course load. I’ve been skipping classes and failing tests. Even at my worst in middle and high school, I never let my academics suffer. So now, to not be understanding what I’m learning in a discipline I’m passionate about and knowing I probably won’t get into med school if I get getting bad grades, I’ve starting self harming again. 

Before this I hadn’t self harmed in 4 years and I feel like a child dealing with my problems. I have a major test coming up on wednesday that I’ll probably do bad on despite my efforts to study. I have close friends, but I feel like I can’t talk about the self harm because it feels immature. I never thought I’d go back this low and I hate admitting that I’m at bottom. I wish I could just drop out and give myself a break but I don’t want to deal with the stress of having to find a job and knowing that I would be behind in school. 

I just feel like a failure and I hate myself for falling back into self harm when I had stayed clean for so long. "
Anyone dealing with Depression should watch “After Life” on Netflix,"Just finished this show, and I’m not gonna lie....it’s a hard watch, but for the right reasons.

Ricky Gervais and his team take what may be one of the harshest and most unflinching looks at depression I have ever seen on film or television. But, the realism offers a very accurate perspective on the best way not only to deal with your own depression but how to help others going through the same thing.

As someone who has suffered from more than a few bouts of depression, it was very helpful and encouraging to see the subject taken so seriously an portrayed so realistically."
Life change/29/M.," 

The is my first post. I'd consider myself a schizoid, which I know a self diagnosis doesn't mean shit.   
I currently live in Chicago and work at a warehouse. I've been at my job for 3 years which I despise. It's about 40-50 hours a week. I'm not in a position that is challenging or interesting, which doesn't help motivate me. Also, I'll take some of the blame for not being able to move up. Sometimes I wonder what the incentive is to continue working there. The last few years have felt like a blur. I haven't accomplished much and I'm ashamed.  
With all that said, I don't have any loyalties, and would leave if an opportunity came up.  
I'd like a job, possibly for the city. Maybe some physical labor. Or a bartending job.  
Someone mentioned in another subreddit about getting a work visa and working abroad for a year. 

Thanks. "
Boohoo I'm sooooo sad,I need to grow the fuck up honestly. Nobody cares if I'm sad. I'm embaressing.
I hate that “I know I’m depressed bc nothing is wrong and I would normally be happy about xyz but rn idu what happiness is” feeling,"Found out I got the job I wanted (which is really great bc that means good healthcare and with my issues that’s a must)

Tmrw I’m seeing my favorite singer perform her first concert of her tour THAT ALONE should have me over the moon

And yet here I am trying not to think bc when I do it’s not very kind thoughts regarding myself...."
I need someone.,I’ve just had a horrible mental health day.... and I feel like I’ve been ran over by a truck I haven’t felt this terrible In a while...I’m trying to find things to do to distract me and I cannot...just need someone to relate and talk to..
Just needed to get this out,"A lot of this is just what other people have shared but this is everything about me that I need to let out.

I feel like I've run out of people to talk to or I've pushed too many people away talking about this constantly.

The last 7 years of my life have been left in loss, grief, bullying, and depression.

in 2012 I was told to find a place to live because my parents wanted to retire. Didn't really think much of this, in fact I was kind of excited for it at first. February of 2013 I find out one of my friends was killed in a car accident involving his ambulance when he and his co-worker were out on a call. Lady smashed into their side as she was texting and driving, she didn't see the red light, hit the ambulance, flipped it on it's side and killed them both.

This hurt because a few months prior the same friend helped coop me through coming out to my family.

Fast forward a year later. April 2014, I go on a short vacation to visit my boyfriend and start to plan a weekend for him to finally meet my parents. He agrees.

Exactly 1 week later I get a call from my aunt, my mom's sister, in panic begging me to contact my mother. I did. She tells me she's excited to see me...... seconds before shooting herself in the head.

I still hear that gunshot to this day.

I was already in a depressed enough state from that. Now comes my Brother.

He and I have never really been ""cool"" with each other. He's always the first to make a joke or insult about my current job, living situation, money, relationships, education, you name it.

It got worse when he found out I was gay and that my boyfriend wasn't from the US.

My brother today could very much be compared to the stereotype of a ""right wing extremist"". I don't care about politics so please save it. What I mean by that is that the minute he knew my boyfriend was Canadian, my boyfriend was no longer referenced by his first name. No, my brother would from that point and to this day call him ""The MotherCanucker"" because he has kids and doesn't want to drop an F bomb in front of them.

I bring this concern to family who all brush it off as a dumb joke he got from South Park. It killed me inside every time to hear it because I know what he's implying because he would also tell me constantly ""you know your boyfriend hates you right? Because he's Canadian, not American. All Canadians hate Americans""

It gets worse than name calling and bullying.

March 1st 2017.

I have a nice call with the boyfriend as we're now planning a 5 year anniversary (started dating in July 2012). We get off the call around 11am that day and I head to work.

I get home late that day and try to call him to play something, we enjoyed gaming together often.

No answer.

Next day. No answer the entire day.

March 3rd. I go out to buy his birthday present, A Nintendo Switch.

I get home to check messages, nothing from him so I start to worry myself and make some calls.

I call his roommate. My boyfriend had died early afternoon March 1st.

Ever since that day it's been constant depression. Crying, trying to hold it in, suicidal thoughts, whispering ""end it"" to myself all the time and overall just losing my mind.

I sit here typing this alone as I've ever felt. I'm pushing myself to go to a therapist for the first time this week. Almost feels like a last ditch effort to get myself somewhere close to how I felt 2 years ago let alone the last 7. If not, I don't know what I do from here.

I appreciate it if you read the whole thing. If not thank you for your time anyway. I just needed to get all this out somewhere before my head starts feeling like it's going to explode."
"How are we supposed to let people ""help""?","I envy people who can say ""When I get down, I ___________ and that makes me feel better"".  I have no idea what my __________ is, or if I even have one.

It's easy to tell people that I'm down, but what am I supposed to say when people ask ""What can I do to help?""?  I don't *know* what you can do.  I don't know what will help.  If I did, I would have done it before I let myself out in public.  It just leads to a massive downward spiral of feeling like I'm inconveniencing people with my very existence, and don't be sad, or people will get angry that they're TRYING to help, but I'm not LETTING them, and they're just going to get sick of my bullshit and leave.  

Part of that is from dealing with my ex-wife, who actually *did* get fed up with me and leave.  It makes it difficult to imagine that anyone actually cares, but rather they're just going through the motions so they can pretend they're not horrible, self-centered people.

What do you do to get out of it?  Or how do you handle the storm while you're waiting for it to break?"
Stuck in bed from 3am to 8pm,"I've been stuck in bed from 3am to 8pm... I got up a few times for food or medicine, but otherwise I went back to bed. I should be doing homework and club responsibilities. I feel so tired and demotivated. "
Question about making a post for a friend.,"Hey everyone,

     I came across this guys YouTube channel while searching for an old video game and I liked his stuff and subscribed. He wasn't posting much anymore but today I got a notification of a new video. In this video he explains that he has been dealing with a lot of depression lately and has also been unemployed and then youtube started demonetizing videos with under 1000 subs.

He has a new job and is starting to feel up to making new videos but he is still hurting from the demonetization and has asked for some help in getting over the 1000 sub mark, he currently has almost 700.

 So would it be ok to post his youtube info and ask people to give his videos a look and if they like to subscribe?
I don't want to break any rules so if this is not allowed I am sorry. "
"Am i the only one who's absolutely DREADING tomorrow? Momdays are the worst for me, and school just isnr working out and it makes me feel isolated and just like a waste of everything.",Like I get wayyy too much work. I don't have a life outside of school. I feel like some kind of zombie that's programed to do what others want me to do.
Trying to do positive and healthy things for yourself when clinically depressed is like maintaining a strict diet and working out constantly,"I can’t keep doing this constantly. If I take breaks, I will feel like giving up and being unmotivated. If I keep on doing this, I will burnout "
idk anymoe,All I do is work and just lay in bed. I'm so sick of everything. I'm so alone
Leaving,"I feel disconnected from other people. I still work and game, but I've lost something. I feel drained dealing with people, and guilty for saying no to the few that still want to see me. Even my own family tries to get me to come out of my room sometimes.

I'm lonely. I'm tired of having friends and they leave, or outgrow you. I'm tired of trying to find a decent girl that can put up with me, I'm tired of the luggage I drag from every rejection and betrayal. 

The world is so full of anger and bitterness, people can't agree on anything. War is coming. Who would even hope for a relationship, let alone some sort of future or kids?

But I've always been behind, slow to learn social things. Quick to learn destructive things like anger and alcoholism.

Ive had my job for seven years, and I've quit like four times. My boss keeps asking me to come back, and I can't say no to her because I respect her and care about the restaurant, and she knows what things to say to make me forget why I left.

Most of my family that isn't nearing the grave is far far away, and rarely visit. My closest sister got married without any of us and I've met the guy twice in five years.

I've fought with depression and suicidal thoughts for a long time now, I stopped cutting last year, I've really been trying to break out of this toilet flush of a mindset I have. Reading, exercising, changing the way I respond to abrasive situations.

I still feel like there is no real future for me. I feel like maybe if I died it would bring our family together again. Otherwise I'm just going to be stuck here, burying my folks and becoming an old man alone.
I'm not looking for a suicide hotline, or someone to tell me why I have to live.  I just needed to say it.

 I'm sure this will be deleted by a mod or something."
It can be so difficult to connect with people,"Even with family and friends that I have known for years. I pushed myself to spend time with several different friends this weekend but found myself struggling to find anything to talk about and keep coversations going. 

I'm glad I got myself to go out and spend time with a few friends, but it was hard for me to feel like I can really relate and talk with them a lot like I used to when I was younger. I'm 27 now.

I feel like my depression has created a barrier between me and people in general. I find it difficult to hold conversations for extended periods now. 

I know a few people miss talking to and seeing me more, they tell me this on occasion, however I'm tired a lot in my offtime and dont feel enough emotional/social energy to go see or call them. I keep thinking about writing an apology to them for not being around more but I'm afraid I will sound awkward and am unsure how to word it.

Tl;dr: its hard for me to conversate and connect with people, even friends I've known for years. I'm thinking about writing an apology to people I have pushed away."
I don’t know how to feel about my life....nothing seems....right anymore....I just want to disappear for good and never come back.,Does this mean I have depression?
I miss the girl I used to be.,"Sorry for not being so 'casual'  with my text but I don't know how to open up to people about something this down.

I'm so far from the girl I used to be. I think I'm pretty depressed, but partly because of stress. And I feel so pathetic for falling into the grips of stress as a freshman in art school.

I had an existential crisis lately, where I felt like I was so superficial and that my attachment to the things I love wouldn't make good art. I don't know how to explain it. There were way too many reasons where *I felt like I was never going to find my* ***real self***\*.\* That's the best way I can explain it.

I used to be a confident and (cute lol because i try to be) girl, a good conversationalist, really good at public speaking, funny and quick to think on her feet. I was a go-getter, a busy girl, reliable and responsible and never missed a deadline.

I was pretty proud. But I didn't really think others were lesser than me...except when I was constantly competing with my narcissist ex boyfriend. As a codependent, I briefly turned into a narcissist and now realize how arrogant and shameful it was.

Now I feel doomed, honestly. Several stressful, if not bad, things happened to me over the past two months. I feel bad I didn't deal with it well. I just feel like I...can't deal with it. I can't see any light. I had cases of body dysmorphia before, and such seemingly minor details such as the chemical burns on my face eats up my confidence.

Sorry for the rant. I just don't know where else to turn to right now. I know I have a lot of love surrounding me, I just can't internalize it and it sucks."
Being around friends that are in relationships depresses me,"I’m really curious if anyone feels the same way as I do... I don’t know why I’m like this. But like I wish my friends would be single so I don’t have to hear about their SO ever. I guess I’m really used to being alone and I feel very cynical about that. It doesn’t really matter if it’s a guy or a girl that becomes my friend it’s pretty the same effect whoever I meet. I guess I don’t like the reminder that I’m probably going to be forever alone, but it’s just another thing that depresses me even more when they talk about their relationships. Not that I would wish for them to feel alone, like I do, but I just don’t want to hear about it. This post probably doesn’t make much sense but it’s on my mind right now. Please tell me someone feels similarly."
I'm committing suicide.,"No, this isn't some sort of joke, or a meme. By the end of the week, I expect to be dead, one way or another. 

You see, it all started when. I got a card from my dad for my birthday (see my post on r/lifeafternarcissism for more details on exactly what kind of person my dad is and what it said. You will find an abridged version of what will be typed here there). Long story short, it's pushed me over the edge. So, goodbye everyone.

To my friends: 

Cayden, you are someone I'm proud to call my best friend. We clicked when we met, and your drawings are hilarious and well drawn. Your sense of humor is impeccable and you were the person who actually helped me develop my sense of humor beyond science jokes and dry academia. Keep drawing my friend. Take care of my drawings for me. Also, furvious says frick you.

Quinn, you are the first friend I ever had. You fostered my thirst for learning anything science related and you helped me when I first found out my parents were divorcing. Your knowledge of random facts is encyclopaedic and your passion is quite motivating. Persue that astronomy career for me.

Peter, while you definitely have a short fuse, your unique happy/sad/funny/WW2 fact combination is a wonder to behold. Also, you definitely introduced me to some swears I didn't know existed. I expect to see you commanding a giant communist army in the future. Don't let me down.

Qualia, your sarcasm and quick-witted putdowns are a force to be reckoned with. Also, your cookies are fantastic (and the tea, too). The incorporation of your sharp humor and your excellent handwriting make for some very interesting random post it notes (that I still have!). Remember, print media is dying. Lorraine, it's dying.

Zoe, it was very fun watching you squirm whenever Quinn and I got into a medical discussion. Your hyperactivity, while exhausting, was also interesting to observe. Make sure to visit brownie for me.

Violet and Eloise, thanks for laughing at all my depression jokes and generally being some of the most genuinely nice people I have ever met. I appoint you two to take my place.

Ben, your gaming obsession was something I publicly laughed about, but privately understood. Also, your demeanor is something I always wished to attain, but couldn't. Game on, and get an F in the chat for me.

Nic(or Baron Nicholas), thank you for just being such a good person. You are nice, smart, funny, and just an overall wonderful friend. Also, thank you for allowing me to call you Baron Nicholas.

Mia, thanks for entrusting me with whatever small scraps of feelings you wanted to talk about. You have no idea how good it felt to be needed. Thank you.

Annie(but actual name Anne), thanks for indulging in my ideas and even reciprocating and supporting them occasionally. Also, your sarcasm and honesty was just fun to be around. Thank you.

Well, I believe this wraps things up. I've never gotten as far as an actual suicide note, so I think this is it. 

And to you, r/depression, thanks for showing me that I wasn't alone.

Goodbye.

I wish I could feel like this 24/7 after bathing in direct sunlight for more than 2 hours,"Besides being burnt, I now feel more “stupid” or relaxed. Time goes by slower. I actually feel sleepy at night. It reminds me of childhood vacations to beach resorts in Mexico after spending hours on the beach then feeling hungry and wanting to explore afterwards. Everything feels novel. I completely forgot about my body so I am more confident. It feels humid in a good way. It feels like I can now get more lean. I feel contained. The sun completely evaporates my stress and reduces my blood pressure from anger. The sun is the best drug."
"I'm Not Alone, But I Feel Lonely","I want to start by saying that I am a happily married man, and I absolutely love my wife. She works from home and I am agoraphobic and unable to leave the house. This means we spend every day together, and I want to say that I don't mind it. We've been together 7 years and I'm not the least bit ""tired of"" or ""sick of"" her.

The problem lies in the fact that she is ALL that I have. That's not to say that I have absolutely zero contact with the outside world. I'm a serious gamer, and I play a lot of online games. In that sense, I have a decently-sized pool of online ""friends"". The problem I have is that none of these ""friendships"" is fulfilling in the slightest. Each and every one of them is EXTREMELY one-sided. None of these people ever messages me first or initiates contact when it comes to doing anything. Whether it be inviting me to a group in an MMO, or asking to play a match of Apex, or even just saying ""Hi, Val, how are you doing?"". None of these even happens as a result of one of these people contacting me, it's always the other way around.

I have exactly one real-world friend, and it feels like an extremely poor usage of the word to even call this person that. Like my online ""friends"" this person never initiates contact. As an experiment, I didn't initiate contact with him for 4 weeks. As a result, we didn't speak for 4 goddamn weeks. We've been ""friends"" for 20 years now, and he lives in my apartment complex as of Thanksgiving 2018. In that time, we've hung out 3 times offline, and twice online. And every time he's come over to visit, he just sits and does nothing. Won't play a game, won't participate in whatever is going on, just sits and talks while he plays some dumb mobile game on his phone.

I'm not sure what to do anymore. I've found myself not enjoying anything lately, especially new video games, because my only options are to play with my wife, which is ALL I do, play alone, or play with complete strangers who I'll likely never talk to again once the game is over. My depression and loneliness has gotten so bad lately, I've stopped doing basically anything. I get up, log onto my computer and just sort of stare at the screen blankly. Occasionally I'll browse YouTube or Hulu or Netflix or something. I'll start a video and pause it 5 minutes later, having lost all interest in it. 

I texted my dad, told him how hopeless and alone I'm feeling. He gave me a 3 word reply ""I'm sorry, son"". That was it. That stung pretty bad.

I'm not alone, Reddit, but I feel lonely. Empty. Broken. I feel like there must be something fundamentally wrong with me that I ""befriend"" all these people in these games, and it all feels so one-sided. I feel like I could die tomorrow and it would take them months to even notice. I don't know what to do. I don't even know if there's anything I CAN do. I just want to know that someone heard how I'm feeling."
Anyone else use stuffed animals/plushies to help with depression?,"When I get depressed, I like to cuddle an ""army of plushies around me while laying in bed. Is this wierd? Anyone else do something like this?"
Nowhere to Turn,"I’m stuck. I have all these emotions and thoughts inside. All this sadness and pain. Loneliness is killing me, and I don’t have anywhere to let it all out. I have no friends or family who I can turn to, I’ve tried to get counselling but I can’t find anyone near me.

Everyday I attend my classes and I feel these pangs of sadness as I see all these people, happy and successful while I’m all alone. I’ve never had many friends, never had anyone interested in me. I’m overweight, my hair is thinning and I just overall have nothing going for me. 

I just want it all to stop. I’ve tried so many times to lift myself up and become better but I always end up worse and worse in the end. I’m stuck in a pit, and everytime I try to climb out life just kicks me back down. I need a rope, a lifeline, but I just can’t imagine it.

I’m afraid all the time. Of the future. Of people. I just wish it would all go away and I could be at peace. I don’t want to be alone anymore. I don’t want to hurt anymore. I don’t want to be afraid. 

I feel utterly worthless. A waste. I wish my parents never had me. I wish I was never born because I can’t even remember being genuinely happy and content.

I can’t reach out. Nobody knows. I just hold it all inside and try to keep going when I really just want to disappear."
Feeling numb,"The thing about depression is that you can be all fun and okay for a moment, then suddenly everything starts feeling pointless. A numb feeling. Not happy, sad nor angry... just pointless. It starts to become a game of pretend."
I want to die,I have no reason to be sad but I have bipolar and I don’t think my meds work. And I just want to die. Everything makes me sad. I don’t know how to make it stop. 
Please help. I suffer from depression,"I’ve lost track of how many months it’s been since I last laugh. It feels like everyday I only go thought the motions of life but I seem to be unable to find enjoyment in anything. Each days seems to be progressively get worse than the day before. Only a couple of weeks ago I thought it couldn’t get any worse, yet it did.

Every night I cry and sob my loss. Every night I have the same recurring nightmares and they doesn’t go away. I’ve tried different things to get better but they haven’t helped much. I tried to meet new people but I suffer from strong social anxiety and I find it extremely hard to relate to people. 

Every day feels just as meaningless as the previous day. I’m not sure why to wake up if there’s nothing to look forward to. To me a Monday, a Friday night or a Saturday feel the same. I lack the social net that would allow me to get other perspectives. I simply have no friends or anybody that cares or wants to help. All I do is go to work, code and do some exercise. I live in extreme isolation and I feel like that’s not healthy.... duh...

I think the worse of all is that I’m afraid to look for help because I might loose my job. I feel like that’s the only thing I have and I wouldn’t know what to do if I were to go unemployed or homeless again. 

Please help me. I’d like to be better, enjoy life and maybe smile a bit more but I truly can’t at this moment. I don’t know what to do. "
nothing matters asdfgh,honestly just fuck my life. that is all
Afraid of dying alone,"I'm a 15 year old straight male and I know that things change, but I'm really afraid of dying alone. I've never had a girlfriend or had any girl be interested in me romantically, and I'm scared that won't change. I'll be honest, I'm one ugly motherhecker. I'm pretty dumb at most times as well, plus I'm not very interesting. I can be funny sometimes, but you'd have to have a dark sense of humor to think so, otherwise I come off as weird or offensive. I don't think anyone will ever be attracted to me and I'm scared of that. Is there any way of getting rid of this fear?"
I'm pretty lost..,"For the past few years since I've left home because of mental health and emtionally abusive family, being trans and that causing issues with them too, I left home and in some ways my life improved and in others it's gotten exponentially worse, I'm unable to handle a job and I'm running on government welfare.. living with a roommate that couldn't give a damn about me or the house we live in.. I'm not sure what to do, I'm losing it here."
I need help.,"This is going to be a long one, so saddle up.

I've had mild depressive episodes, but nothing that major. This is my worst one yet. I have thought about the idea of suicide almost every night (not actually going to go through with it) but as something to escape what I'm feeling. My friends know that I have these episodes, but I usually just hide it from them. Whenever I bring it up, there is an awkward cloud hanging in the air.

My parents don't know about it. They think I'm a perfectly happy, 15 YO who is just slacking off in school. My parents expect the best of me because ""I'm a smart kid"", that is all I've ever been told when I'm struggling in school. My regular grades are fine, but homework is almost never handed in. I can't find the motivation. They have a weird thing about homework where I HAVE to get all of it done, otherwise I'm a failing student. I have not handed in all of my assignments this term and report cards come in on Thursday. It's too late to hand them in and I know they will be pissed. This is just adding to my anxiety.

My parents have no concept of what being insecure feels like, it seems. When they discovered my older half sister was cutting her wrists because of depression, their first thought was to yell at her. I remember that night clearly when I heard the yelling above my room. They don't understand how it feels to just bottle it up all inside until it bursts. I could never talk to them about it because they aren't that supportive. When I first tried to bring up the topic of how I was loosing weight, they yelled at me because I was ""perfectly healthy"", I was 80 pounds overweight. During one of these discussions/arguments, it led to me to getting my health card to go to the doctor to see if I'm malnourished. I never went. They hate the doctor for some reason. I haven't been in over 4-5 years, and same for the dentist. I have 2 other siblings and this is the same thing for them. The only form of doctor I've been to is when I almost broke my arm and the walk in clinic.

I guess the reason why I came here is to ask how I can get help. I have no money from a therapist and talking to them about it won't do me any good. They use it as some sort of weapon on me when I told them I was insecure about my weight. they said ""Do you need to go to a therapist? do you want to end up like your <half sibling name here>?"" Like I said earlier in the post, I will never go through with suicide currently, and when I do I hope I will seek out help. I'm really stressing about Thursday because last term they took away my PC when they found out that i was missing 7 assignments. I probably won't be able to respond because my wifi shuts off in an hour and I also have school tomorrow. I will try to respond in the morning but, no promises.

&#x200B;

EDIT: if there is a way for me to get a therapist is there a way to keep it confidential from my parents? I also live in Canada if that helps."
"Not sure if this is counted as activism or not, just wanted to share my story and see if I can lend some help","(If this is a violation of rules please let me know I’m not trying to push feel good activism I just want to help anybody I can whose dealt with what I have.) I’ve dealt with depression myself a little bit now, since I was about 15 years old, seen lots of friends and people go through the same thing and even had a friend take his own life at 18 with out telling a soul he needed help. Considered ending it all a few times my self and still deal from day to day sometimes. I haven’t had a bad life per-say but I’ve dealt with some bad things in my life. Today I sit in a police head quarters taking 911 calls for a major city with over 400,000 people who are able to reach me or another call taker at the drop of a hat. I’ve spoken with countless of people, maybe even one of you. I want you to know if you need help and you have no where to go, no one to turn to, no one to make your last call to, call 911. Reach out to one of us please. I’m not gunna sit and tell you “it’s gunna get better”, I know what it’s like to hear that over and over. but I wanna tell you there’s people who care and want to get people that hurt a way to turn. When I was 16 I sat up till 3 am sobbing wanting to kill myself and just disassociate into the void of death but I had a friend to turn to, they help me through my pain and I’m lucky to of had that. I’ve spoken with young to old at my job, one woman had lost her husband and had no where to turn. No family and she got connected with me and we talked for over half an hour until help could arrive. Like I said I can’t promise rainbows and sunshine for your life but I can promise some help if you need it. 
(Mods if this is violation of rules or this isn’t something you want on your thread let me know I’ll take it down, couldn’t find somewhere where I thought was fit, thought I’d try to help where I could.)"
Why is it so hard to make friends?,"Why is making friends so difficult? 

&#x200B;

I always try to be nice, smiling and high energy, but that makes me have only a few ""friendly acquaintances"", but no real friend who ever cares about me, ask me how I'm doing, call me to do things. I'm from a small town, so I'm stuck on a small list of potential friends, and the big problem is that a lot of them are just into going out to drink, going somewhere cheap and shit to get drunk and I'm not that kind of person, I wanted a friend who liked books like me, to play video games, to go out to a cool and quiet place to talk and have good food, but it seems like these people don't exist, or are too much older than me, and when there is someone with these hobbies they are so or more social awkward than me, then it gets a very cringe situation."
Advice,"Hello there, who ever is reading this. I was kinda hoping for a new perspective or opinion on what to do. Been working alot and by alot i mean i have three jobs, Im the type of person that likes to socialize but been very busy so now i just look other people social media and see them having fun as well as other friends. Was talking to a girl whom i was very interested in but didnt go the way i wanted to, as well as other personal things that happened all at once and now i just sit here dwelling on what i really want for myself , holding my depression in because idk what else to do.

My girlfriend of about 3 1/2 years left me tonight.,"I've been going down a really bad road with her. I could tell she no longer loved me starting a couple months ago and even before that it was shaky at best. 
 I loved her with everything I had in me. Shes been with me through so fucking much and tonight I tried talking to her and she admitted to falling out of love with me.
 I watched her pack her stuff out of my apartment and leave with both of us in tears. 
 I am absolutely devastated right now but I think it's the only way I'm going to get better with myself. I already miss her so fucking much. I'm trying to be really strong I'm just scared about waking up without her. So I'm going to put sleep off as long as possible tonight. 
 If anyone out there is going through a breakup or is just really down on themselves right now, well I'm right here with you. 
 Thanks to anyone for listening. I just had to write this shit down. Cheers guys, I'm about to drink my night away."
What's the most pathetic thing depression has made you into or do,"It turned ne into a uber cynical stupid person who would curse and scream for no reason and who would just stay quiet all day and couldn't really talk when he was in school while hyper and figity at the same time. Made my life hell for...for what feels like ever.  I had a project that was just a 15 question poll-I couldn't do it before the due date. I know there's witchcraft and all that but it's like I can't attack back. I know because this isn't normal, I just know. I really feel nothing now. Just nothing. Just regret. "
URGENT HELP: need opinions on how to help someone to get through with depression before things get worst :(,"I have been diagnosed with depression and BPD recently, and happily to say im doing so much better fter seeing a therapist and on meds. But the real story is not about me.

I like this guy for a while now.  He was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder(GAD) and Depression. All this while I've been giving my best to be there for him and ensure that things dont go out of hand. He admits he has low self esteem and social anxiety.  For someone who have gone tru what he did, I have been making sure that he is on his

But over the pass two years, I would say he has been doing pretty well ever since the day we met. We went out a lot and do outdoor activities together.  He was more happier and active as ever.

However things got pretty rough on his side, financially, Thus, didnt allow him to continue with his therapy and meds.  Basically he has quit cold turkey. I have offered to pay for his  medical for the time being, and he refuses.  Over the past few weeks, he started to get worst. His GAD & Depression is eating him and he dont have the apathy to do anything. Whenever he is having his episodes, I will give him space and check on him once in a while to make sure. Sadly this time he is pushing me away completely.  He havent been texting me back for three days and idk what to do then keep gving him space.

I truly care about him and I dont want him to suffer and go thru it alone.  What should do i?"
I hate my program and school,"I've been working so hard for the last three months in my program, and its been driving me insane.

I've tried and dropped out of a program already, and this is my second attempt at an ""easier"" program, but the terrible stress and fatigue I was getting from the first program are coming back.

I work so hard for my studies but it never feels rewarded. There are quizzes and assignments for different courses every week, and it takes me several hours to study even a basic test because of the overwhelming knowledge and my short term memory.

I've been slowly loosing my mind, because I fear failure so much yet I hate all the work I need to put into it. Its like my body and mind are fighting eachother in what they want, and its driving me insane. I've always noticed this about me, but I feel like I will never be able to get a job or degree with this mentality.

Its pathetic. Im so tired. I want to be motivated and excited to learn new things but I can't. 3 months of this and 13 more months of this is starting to feel impossible to do. I don't know whats wrong with me."
i can only listen to depressing music,i don’t know why. i hate upbeat songs but i feel so much better but sadder at the same time. i love listening to depressing songs. no clue. i love it
What’s the point,"I moved to New York to become a comedian, the only thing I’ve ever wanted to be, but honestly it feels like I’ve been depressed since I graduated college. I’ve had my heart broken twice, lost jobs, lost my passion for my art, and moved away from my family. I’m in debt and I’m in a job where I’m not appreciated. I’m not doing anything I love to do. I apply to at least 50 jobs every day I hear nothing back. No therapists take my insurance. I just don’t know what the point is.

Depression is something that has affected me since... well it feels like forever. 

I hope it gets better but I’m not sure it will. "

Anybody else cut off your best friends/ family when you’re in deep depression but don’t mean too?,My family and close friends want to help me but I don’t ever want to leave my house (except for work) and then they start to think that I blow them off because I don’t like them. My depression is making me not care about stuff I used to love and I don’t know what to do anymore.
I don’t know where else to say this without feeling judged maybe someone else can relate,"My depression is weird it’s sometimes intense, sometimes in the background but as of the last few days it’s intense and mainly it’s mixing with my anger which isn’t any better. Something I’ve noticed with my depression and just the way my mind works is that I always picture different scenarios but one in particular of my own death. It’s a constant scenario repeating in my head that I want to happen whenever I’m deep in the shittiest feelings. I want to be shot at, no remorse from the killer and I just wish I could have my wish be granted so it wouldn’t be a technically suicide it’d just be a “coincidence”. It’s dark and twisted and yes I do go to therapy and I’ll speak on it when I’m there but I feel like nobody understands that certain feeling and just overall. If you read this thank you, I wish all of you the very best..."

Am I depressed? Or is this something else? I do commission sales for a living and I have stopped caring all together if I get sales or not.,"I don't know what ""depression"" is. 

So I do commission sales and I have been doing this for 8 years. Things generally ""go my way"" - Over many years, my co-workers have often commented that the people I get to deal with come in with the intent to buy - as if life had it ""easy"" for me.  

&#x200B;

2019 has been a different story. I have have days with no sales which has never happened before. I also got transferred to a new place this year with a much poorer community and the population I deal with are very defensive. I don't know what it is but I seemed to have stopped caring all together whether I get a sale or not. I still work hard but if I see the slightest hint of 'disrespect' or people acting extra defensive, I just walk away from them and just go sit on my office. Many things are going wrong in my life and I don't seem to react to any at all. I have this calm exterior. I don't react when things repeatedly seems to not ""go my way"" over and over. It is like I'm a playing a game with ""Life"" and it's trying it's best to get me to react and I don't seem to react. Things are falling apart and I don't seem to care! Why is this? Is this a strange defense or copying mechanism? The way of no reaction? I have always treated people with respect and gave them my best even if they were absolute jerks and I seem to have turned a corner, I only seem to have ""time"" for people who are open and nice. If they are assholes, I'm in a hurry to wiggle my out of the conversation and go sit in my office. My sales have dropped an all time low. I still don't have any plans to change as the weird thing about it all this is - I seem to have a ""feeling"" that I like this. Even though functionally and practically and financially ""this"" is not working out.. So what is going on? Please help me understand!"
found out something about myself.,"I known this for a while, and it really is annoying. I take a lot of things to Heart. An example, someone will make a joke and call me stupid and ill laugh about it, but I really just feel like shit and maybe even crying. Idk why this happens.

i have some sort of. martyr complex,"might be religious guilt and depression tied together but i can’t be happy. i feel like i’m going to hell. i have to push myself back down and suffer every time i start to surface. nothing i do makes me feel like a good person. i’ve gone delusional over the idea that god hates me- that i’m a monster, that i’m cursed, i have nightmares. i can’t bring myself to act on anything ‘good’ because i’m simultaneous very numb and lack motivation. i just simmer in it. i can’t let anyone love me because i’m ‘evil’. i can’t force anyone to interact with me because it’s a burden on them to *look* at me.  i can’t bring myself to be suicidal because i think i’ll go right down to hell. i just sit here in anxiety and make sure i’m still depressed so god pities me and that whatever might be out there pities me and i can atone for *existing*. 

i know this is depression feedback looping over and over and forcing me to stay this way but it’s become very tangible after all these years. i don’t know what to tell myself. "

Nothing in life feels like it's worth the effort.

Meds haven't helped, therapy hasn't helped, ECT hasn't helped, meditation doesn't help.

My college had an active shooter alert yesterday and I wasn't really scared of dying.

It turned out to be a false alarm (it was triggered by girls screaming and popping balloons) but today I feel far worse than I did yesterday.

I've just been having such a hard time making connections because my off-putting personality gets in the way, and no one else is open and honest. I don't have any coherent group of friends (maybe like 2-3 scattered) and I haven't been on a date/kissed anyone in over a year. I just feel so far, lonely, and miserable that no one likes me.

I'm trying to start a student org for eating disorder support at my school (because yay maladaptive coping mechanisms) but everyone on my board is dropping out like flies. I feel like this is because of me. And even if it isn't, Everytime in with people, the circle involving me has low priority. I don't feel loved by anyone outside my immediate family.

The thing is too, everyone in the campus community is going to prioritize the issues of those who were acutely hurt yesterday, over my issues of being hurt for years."
Help,I always feel lonely and it makes me sad but I’m not sure if this is the same thing as depressed does anyone know anything about this 
It's that day of the year.,"Today is my birthday and I turn 20. I truly resent my parents because they brought me into existence 20 years ago. I can't recall the last time I woke up feeling alright. I've either woken up miserable/angry or apathetic for the last few years. Thanks to them, I now have to deal with dumb bullshit for the foreseeable future due to the fact that I can't bring myself to suicide. I cant stand to look at them anymore. They see me suffering and straight up ignore it. Thanks for nothing, you ignorant fucks. Sorry, just needed to get this off my chest, can only punch the door so many times."

I lose feelings for my friend over time? Is this normal?,"I know this kind of doesn't belong here, but it kinda prevents me in solving my depression.

Thinking that this is probably the end of the road for me.,"Yesterday was probably the most painful day of my life. It was the day that, after five years of raising my two young children on my own, my ex-husband came and took them away from me. Just like that, they’re gone. It feels like my kids died. 

I’ve been in a long and drawn out divorce case with my ex husband. Over two years long. I had an attorney that asked for continuances five times due to personal reasons (going on spring break with his family, sick, etc.) which was exhausting. I just wanted it to be over and done. My ex is in the military, and my children and I lived 8 minutes away from him for 4 years. He only saw the kids every other weekend, bailing out on his weekends most of the time, saying he had to work. I would take my kids to get ice cream or run an errand and see his car outside of the local bar. He received orders to California, and moved in August. I can’t lie, I was elated. I didn’t have any family or friends in the town we lived in, he had his entire family and friends there because it’s where he grew up. I decided that I needed to make a change. There was no opportunity in that small town for me, and my daughter was miserable in her kindergarten class, and her desire and enthusiasm to learn disappeared. I made the decision to move to Missouri, where my boyfriend lives, in hopes that things would finally be easier. I was excited. My kids were excited. We moved at the end of November. I felt like life was finally going the way that I wanted it to. 

My attorney dropped me as a client, for not keeping in contact with him. The only contact that ever came from his office were the countless voicemails letting me know that the court date had once again been rescheduled. Was I supposed to call back and just say “okay!”? A final court date was set for February 6th. I came down with pneumonia 6 days before the court date. I didn’t go. I couldn’t even get out of bed, but by this time I had accepted the thought of giving him everything that he had initially asked for just to have the divorce finalized. I wanted to move on and forget this entire nightmare. I got a call from my ex husband on February 11th. He was calm, and spoke with an unusual happiness and confidence that I’d never heard before. “I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but I won custody of the children at court. I will be there in a few weeks to pick them up, and I will be flying back to California with them.” How could this happen? How did I not know that he had requested custody? I received the decree a week later. He had entered a  request for custody at the end of December, when he flew back to Indiana for the holidays. I had let him take the kids for over two weeks while he was there, for Christmas and New Years. He never brought up the fact that he had asked the court for custody once, he had never even hinted at it. He’s never had my kids for more than 48 hours by himself. He had always hated the responsibility of raising the kids. A judge had just handed custody to a man that has never had any part in raising my kids, all because I wasn’t there to beg the court not to do that. 

My ex husbands greed and spite is what triggered this entire thing. He balked at the thought of paying child support, consistently late on paying it and telling me he shouldn’t have to “fund” my “lifestyle.” He was furious that I had finally moved to be with my boyfriend, disgusted by the fact that another man was around his kids. I have never been a drug addict, an alcoholic, or an abuser of my children. And just like that, my kids are gone. I had 30 days to appeal the decree that was ordered by the judge. Because I was a single mother and my ex husband stopped paying child support, I was making ends meet on my own. I called my unsupportive mom to let her know what was going on, and she told me that she would pay for the new lawyer and we would have this decision reversed. One week went by, then two, and no returned phone calls or texts. The lawyer’s secretary having to tell me everyday that they haven’t received the retainer yet has been gut wrenching. I now have two days left to find a way to pay the lawyer, and I can’t. I blew through my savings with the move and other costs for my kids. I’ve exhausted every option, asked every friend or family member that I can if they can help. They can’t. People have lives. I feel like a failure. I let my kids down, I let myself down. 

My ex husband came and picked my kids up yesterday. My six year old daughter sat and cried all morning with me, asking me if there was anything I could do. “Can you call the police mommy? What if I hide when he gets here?” My son, four, is too young to realize what was going on. My kids are now 1200 miles away from me, and it happened in the blink of an eye. I’ve never spent more than two days without them, just on the weekends that they went to my ex husbands occasionally. I sat on the couch for thirteen hours yesterday crying. No tv, just silence. I woke up today and could barely move. I’ve lost every ounce of hope within me, and even though it feels like the selfish thing to do, I don’t think I can go on. The pain of losing your children is unexplainable, and I wouldn’t wish this on my worst enemy. I can feel my body shutting down, and I feel that it’s my time to give up. "
"I supposedly have a friend group, but I don't feel like I have individual friends","Yes, when we meet in group we all are friends, but I never see them one on one, individually, and I don't feel like doing that either, maybe I am afraid of intimacy, but I feel left out. And we do not meet that often, so I basically feel alone.

Maybe I like being alone, maybe being in a group gives you the chance to not talk all the time and just listen.

"I put myself out there (romantically) for the first time in ~6 years. It's felt like both a victory and a burden, and I just really need to talk about it.","Some background: I'm currently in college, and the person in question is in a lot of my classes. She's pretty quiet, as am I, so there wasn't a whole lot of flirting or ""talking"" leading up to me asking her out on a date. We have a lot in common, and she's always pleasant to be around, so I spent a couple weeks building up the courage and waiting for a decent moment.

My exact words were ""I know this is kind of out of left field, but would you maybe want to go out sometime?""

At this point I was working hard to keep from stuttering, my hands had gone numb, and my heart felt like it was going to burst out of my rib cage.

With a smile, she says ""possibly."" Apparently, she had been in a relationship that lasted quite a while, and hasn't really dated since that relationship ended (I didn't hear exactly what she said about this due to being pretty light headed at this point). I gave her my number, and she went to catch her bus. I turned around to head back to the lab to get some work done, and IMMEDIATELY tripped and fell. She didn't see that, probably didn't hear it either, but it perfectly demonstrates how much my bones/muscles had turned to jello.

I haven't heard anything from her about it, but interactions have been totally normal. Class hasn't been awkward or anything. It is the end of the quarter, so we're both pretty busy and stressed. I have to hope that's why I haven't heard anything, but I just can't be calm about it. At least a ""no thanks"" would've been definitive. I've been thinking about this whole thing nonstop for days, has she thought about it at all? Am I attractive enough? Interesting enough? Did I come off as creepy or unwelcome? I don't know how to process any of this.
"
Sudden feelings of sadness and loneliness,"I'm 23 years old and I've got out from college in october.  4 months ago, I started getting really sad and lonely out of the blue. 

When I am with people often uncomfortable, and sometimes I don't know what to talk to them. Mostly when I talk to someone for the first time, I pick my words and try not to seem weird, which blocks my thoughts and makes me seem weirder than I am. I often think about my high school days and how we used to have fun and how going out was fun. Now I really can't have fun when going out and I am constantly nervous when in clubs. Also, I feel like people don't respect me and don't really want to hang out with me.

I tried talking to my girlfriend about this, but she told me that I'm just tripping, but I don't think it would take 4-5 months. Should I see a shrink? :/"
"Fiancé depressed, I'm running on empty.","Fiancé(24) has had depression since  15, it was well managed with his medication. Until about a year ago, he was in a accident. Not severe but enough to hurt his back. He has been off work, and he now has anxiety. His regular doctor just upped his usual medication. And it was a downward spiral. A few months ago he threatened suicide and 911 was called. He was the the hospital for only 5 hours and they released him. He's had good days but now he's having a lot of bad days. Days he won't get out of bed. He won't eat unless forced. He started school while off work. Thinking that would help. But I think it's made things worse. I'm scared. And sad. Because I love him. And I want to help. He doesn't enjoy anything. I know I can't cure him. There's no magic word that will make everything better. But I need advice. How can I help even the slightest. I want to see him smile again. Please anything is appreciated. "
At what point is it okay to give up?,"I am now entering my sixth year with depression and anxiety. My physical, social, and mental states continue to decline rapidly. I seem to have lost any ability to motivate myself through intrinsically, with the only way I manage to get out of bed and get to work being my own anxiety of letting others down. 

When I first started seriously struggling at 18, I feel like I did everything you're supposed to. I started therapy, sought a psychiatrist, and started trying different forms of medication. I have now gone through about 13 different medications in classes from anti-psychotics to straight SSRI's, and nothing has helped. I have done a 6-week course of TMS, and that didn't help.

My parents are insistent that I either try entering a ketamine trial through a nearby hospital or try ECT, but I just can't help but feel like I'm pretty much done with it all. I'm ideating constantly throughout the day, am barely holding back tears in meeting after meeting, and feel completely exhausted all the time. This weekend I basically slept away, and I feel worse than I did before. The constant headaches, muscle pain, and the fact that eating any form of food is a complete chore and more often than not makes me vomit has completely degraded my quality of life.

My depression I've only been able to describe as a slow downward slope. So while from day to day things generally feel awful and pretty consistent, I can look back and realize I am in a worse place than ever before. I have no hope that things can get better, and can't even get myself to make simple changes.

So essentially, at what point is it okay to say ""my depression probably can't be treated, it would be better for me if I was no longer alive.""? At this point, I am basically staying alive solely so that I won't hurt my family, and what kind of life is that really?"
Self harm,I know people are going to say not to. But it makes me feel better. What’s the best way to self harm without leaving scars? 
Deleted Social Media,"As far as I can remember I’ve always felt like the failure of my friendships and groups. Seeing everyone hanging out with each other, getting texts from others when I’m with them, and not being invited to social gatherings has led to a constant flood of self pity and resentment towards those I love. 

I had a realization just the other day that this was all chalked down to Snapchat and Instagram. My girlfriend would endure my senseless ramblings about how sad I am to be left out of everything until it finally clicked in my head while watching a tv show. 

We are, for the most part, in control of our lives. We are free in choice and decision. We do not have to participate in things that ruin our health, and with that realization I found a great deal of courage and deleted the social media I had kept to stay in contact with old school friends. 

I was sick of being ignored and hurt through stupid apps. The pleasure and peace I felt immediately was incredible. A couple close friends texted me asking if I was okay and it seems I’ve fixed the greater part of my social problems for now. I was finally invited out and showed support I guess they didn’t notice I needed so greatly.

This is not to say it has cured my depression but my morale is at a new height and I’ll get out of the house to see people at least once this week. Pushed me to clean up the house and prep an outfit for the occasion, even. 

TL;DR Deleted Snapchat and Instagram, friends started talking to me again. :,)"
A girl at work asked me out..,"A girl from work that I actually like and have had a kinda playful work relationship with for a while asked me out.. She asked me what I was going to do this weekend and said that she would like to be taken to go see a movie.. My response was fucking retarded.. I just awkwardly said that I was going out drinking with friends and couldn't take her.. 
I can't understand what the fuck is wrong with my head. 
I ACTUALLY LIKE THIS CUTE GIRL. SHE BASICALLY ASKS ME OUT. I REJECT HER??.

I guess it's because I don't know how dating works anymore. I know that I would just mess it up by being awkward and weird.

Can anybody on here relate to depriving yourselves of the things you really want out of fear?


Sorry for the rant."
I’m having a really bad day,"TW: self-harm

Sorry for the format, I’m on the phone.
Sorry if this belongs in r/cyclothymia 

I (21F) have been diagnosed with cyclothymic personality traits alongside of anxiety and depression disorder. The psychiatrist said that he didn’t want to ‘label’ me... this “mild mood disorder” is so consuming and i don’t know if i can handle it anymore 

I obviously have good days and bad days, and I think I’m having a bad day right now. It’s currently 1:30am in the UK and I’m writing an essay. The past few days have been really bad and I’ve been thinking of self-harming because I feel so much pain inside. Anyway, I’ve started taking pro plus (a caffeine tablet in the UK) which I downed with a Redbull. I know that I’ve gone over the recommend caffeine limit for the day because I’ve had chocolate, coffees, redbulls and several of those pro plus tablets and I have abdominal pain at this point.

I know I have to stop taking more caffeine tablets but I don’t want to, I want to cause pain to myself enough to be sent to the hospital and enough to avoid this essay. I know how pathetic it sounds that I’m putting myself through this pain to get out of an essay but I think that’s just the front cover of it and really I just want to hurt so I don’t feel so hurt inside.

Cyclothymia is so annoying because no one understands how bad the bad days are and I figured that i just needed a rant."
Is it just me or is telling people your sad makes it worse???,Like I might talk to my friend and tell them I’m sad ( like sometimes I don’t know the reason I’m sad I just am ) then they start asking why and when I say I just am. They get mad and start listing reason they could be sad but aren’t. And it just makes me feel worse because they have bigger problems than me. It’s like their “flexing” but not in a good way. Maybe I’m just being a pussy and I should just suck it. 
"Making friends, meeting new people, or turning loneliness into solitude","Hey I was wondering if anyone in this community has tips or advice on how to meet new people. I suffer from crushing loneliness and I wish I had just one friend I could exercise with, or go to shows, or play instruments, or video games, or do LITERALLY anything. Just looking for guidance on where anyone of you have found friends. I hate coming home and spending everyday, month after month, alone with my thoughts. Please any advice would be helpful and immensely appreciated. "
Internal rage,"Hello.

I am 20 years old and I do all of the necessary things to avoid being depressed. Such as keeping active etc.. but I don't need validation on this part of my life. 

However I find that I have an incredible anger that lies dormant within me and only seeps out in times of failure. Such as when I lose a game of chess. This anger is also never directed towards others, only towards myself. If im depressed normally I have no interest in talking to people and will just appear very dull, but not aggressive or angry.

What I am not able to fully comprehend yet is why I treat myself like two people. When I fail something I think I must teach myself to not make the same mistakes by putting a cigarette out on myself or biting myself very hard. (Normally my teeth hurt before the skin is broken). Also it's worth mentioning that all of my self-harm scars are confined to my right leg. I have no intention of anyone seeing them to gain pity. 

Now the most common reasoning I see about this topic is return to a position of control but I would argue that in these situations I am the exact opposite of that. I just want to fucking eviscerate myself when I am not performing how I would like to be. 

It's like I am trying to discipline myself with negatively reinforced habits. I don't really know. 
Essentially I am angry that I am not capable of improvement after a certain point in anything. I am destined for mediocrity because even though I try very hard I am simply, not intellectual enough, strong enough or whatever it may be. Even though someone will tell me im very special and I can do anything, I realise this is horse shit. On the other hand some readers my get the sense that I am a moron incapable of knuckling down and putting the real effort in, also horse shit.

So how do I need more comfortable with the idea that I will essentially amount to a clone of a billion people before me. Semi-good at hobbies, average job, average physique, average intelligence but in no way am a going to excel at anything. 

I believe if I can let go of my dreams to become X or Y then I can happily consume resources and provide trivial work for my employers until I die Without getting worked up at my short comings.

Don't know what I expect, but save yourself the time and don't tell me the same half-baked shite you normally see on these subs e.g. take a step back and enjoy nature. Great I'll implement that into my lifestyle and further distract myself from the underwhelming contribution I have made to society. Like I stated earlier, I fill my week with as many things I enjoy doing as I can. All the same I loathe my inability to do anything to an exceptional degree.

Thank you for reading, I'd like to hear your criticisms on my undoubtedly nihilistic outlook and any advice on how I can lower my expectations of my life. "
I’m spiraling down,"I honestly am finding no meaning to life anymore. The pain is becoming unbearable and I’m numb to all feelings. I lost ties to the only family member I had and I just lost another job. I’m broke, I’m 10k in debt and I haven’t been happy since idk when.... "
Something about me must make me totally unfriendable...,"I was recently playing a game. Random squads. Ended up adding one of the guys as a friend and played quite a few matches with him. When his friend came in, the friend acted weirded out that i was in the party. Right as we were readying up to enter a match the guys left the party. I thought it was a mistake or a glitch. So I joined their party and waited for them. When they got back to the lobby, they kicked me without a word and he unfriended me. Im not a child. Im not a bad player. And it probably shouldn't have bothered me as much as it did. But I just didn't understand. We had won a couple matches. We were laughing and having fun. It just triggered a bottomless spiral of hopelessness for me. I started thinking...I don't have any friends....not one. The only people that want to talk to me on a daily basis is my husband, who is borderline abusive, and my grandmother, who judges my every move more than anything. So basically the only people who want me around only want to put me down in the end. Ever single person I've been friends with in the past never stuck around long. No one texts me or calls or messages me. No one sends me funny shit just cuz. No one invites me to hang out. Obviously, the conclusion that I have come to is I'm not the person people look at as a friend. I just don't know what I'm doing to run everyone off....what is it about me that is so unlikable? I will never know I guess. Can't keep anyone around long enough to ask. And you all don't know me to answer.. Makes me just want to end it all. Will anyone really be that effected.."
Why do they say 'temporary problem',Suicide is not a permanent solution to a temporary problem. I am just a dumb cow who can't accept the truth. I have worked hard for so many years. My brain is broken. I wanted so badly to exit our truck tonight at 80mph. But I don't want to hurt anyone else. I just want my pain to end. 
How do I gain a will to live?,
"If I woud kill myself, who woud even be kinda sad?",
Would really appreciate a quick chat,Dm me please. Just would like a quick chat and some advice. 
I feel like it stop actively clinging on to things that distract me from my feelings I’ll fall into another pit of sadness,
im tired.,"wouldn't it be so nice just to get hit by a truck or suffocate in my sleep.  i cant kill myself because i am a coward and i dont want to hurt people.  why do they have to care?  i want to cry but it makes me feel guilty i cant i cant i cant.

feeling like i fucked up my life.,"i am 19 years old, and struggle with a plethora of mental issues. i started college my sophomore year of high school, and was supposed to graduate one year after graduation with my associate degree. because of my mental illness, i have failed and withdrew from many classes, meaning that i will not graduate with my degree. 

i work part time at a gas station, and can’t imagine myself doing anything else with my life, as i know my manager personally (close friends with her daughter,),  and don’t need to worry about my crumbling under pressure because she knows my past and will not fire me over it. i am going to full time soon, and feel very scared to do this as my mental health is still not very good. 

i feel like i am wasting my life, and will end up as a cashier for the rest of my life, and that makes me feel irrationally angry at myself. i want to do so much, but i am terrible at school and tests, and don’t have money for college (my current college is 100% free.). i feel like doing a job like this means i’ve failed in my life, even though i know that it is valid employment. 

i want to die knowing that i’ve tanked my GPA, and that all failed and withdrawn classes will follow me if i ever  decide to go back to school. i hate myself for doing this to myself. i also want to not feel like a piece of shit for considering staying a cashier for the rest of my life. idk. just wanted to vent, i guess. "
Everything will be okay.,"After two weeks of being in a bad headspace, I finally had a revelation that basically ended with ‘what’s happened has happened, and you can’t go back and change what it was. Just live with this and move on. It’ll all be okay.’

And for the first time in two weeks, I’m finally believing myself."
Help,Pls someone help me I’m alone and rlly rlly tired 
would it hurt my parents more if i died or if they had to watch as i slowly fucked up everything in my life,like ripping off a bandaid innit 
Graduation,"I have thought about this a lot and I have decided that if I don't graduate on time I am going to kill myself. I am in my Senior Year, I got straight a's  the first semester, then this semester it all went down. I have no motivation to do anything anymore. Yes it's my choice to not do my work, don't tell me because I know. I just don't know, I have suicidal thoughts, harm myself. If I don't have the courage to kill myself, I will hire someone to kill me at some point in the future. "
Losing hope,"Please someone just give me a reason to live.
I want to slit my wrists.

I’ve been high for 3 days now I’m out idk what to do"
when u been struggling mentally for forever and u had a shitty ass day and u were thinking about some crazy suicidal shit,"and then ur studying asian ass gets a 59 on your physics test, the test u studied until u literally couldn’t see anymore on and u still have 6 tests left in the semester and u have to tell ur mom and u know she’s going to fucking kill u


just a quick edit: i know it probably sounds stupid and everybody has bombed tests but this has never happened to me and it’s not even the mark. buildup of shit and this is a tipping point. literally feels like the end of the fucking world and i don’t know how to cope"
Intrusive Thoughts,I can't stop these intrusive thoughts that are taking over. There are a couple people in my life who make me feel like the biggest pile of crap and today it's hard to try to ignore it. I usually try to stay busy or watch a funny show when I start sinking but today nothing is helping. I realize there have been a few minutes of the show that go by and I am lost in my own head hating on myself. Feeling physical pain in my chest and stomach that gets worse as the thoughts get worse. Can anyone please offer some advice about things that have worked for them/distracted them from letting these thoughts control everything? How do you not let the opinion of a few control your confidence/feelings about yourself?
I feel so alone and afraid,"I live with my bf of 5 years. We have no family or friends here, in the entire state we live in. But thats not abnormal for me, as it's really hard for me to make friends and the only family I have is my grandmother, who I love but she adopted 7 kids so she doesn't call or anything. My bf is on the complete opposite schedule, i work 7 to 3 and he works 330 to 11. Right now he's working 7 days straight cause his work just fired someone, so we haven't gotten to hang out lately.

It all just makes me feel so overwhelmed and afraid. What if something happens to one of us, we both dont have health insurance or family to help. Or what if he leaves me one day down the road? Then I would have absolutely no one. We own a house together and love each other a lot so I don't think that would ever happen, but I just can't help but think about it sometimes. 

Plus. Laying in bed all day definitely doesn't help.

I'd love to make online friends, to have people to talk to but I'm not sure where or how I would even do that.

Anyone else here feel the same?"
Nothing,"There is nothing left. There is nothing for me. There is nobody to turn to. There is nowhere to go. I hate myself and I hate everyone. Nothing has gone right, and it’s probably all my fault."
Today is the day I tell my parents about my major depression. But I have a few questions.,"I’m scared that they’ll say that it is just a part of puberty, or that I’ll be fine. But I’m 100% it isn’t. If I do get therapy and prescribed anti-depressants, how long until they work? Do they work every time? "
i feel so hopeless,"being truly happy with myself and life seems like such a farfetched idea to me. i’ve been depressed since i can remember and it never got any better. there are days where i feel happiness, but 98% of my days are me dreaming about not being here. i don’t tell people around me though typically because it’s stressful to have everyone constantly on my back and telling me life is so great and whatever. my fiance, my parents, my brother, and my cat are what keep me going. but, i feel like such a letdown to all of them each day with how depressed i am. i am always afraid one of them will leave me and it makes me even more depressed and anxious. life is me walking on eggshells around myself. i don’t think the people around me realize how intense my depression is. it is draining and i hate wondering every day when the suffering will end. my illnesses rule my life. "
I’ve been feeling so lost lately...,"My hobby as a cake decorator has turned into my career. I’ve been doing this for 5 years now. I don’t have any hobbies. I was recently at a dinner and someone asked me what my hobbies were and I literally had no idea what to say.... all I do is work and Netflix when I’m not working....(I do read books sometimes) I have struggled with depression and anxiety since high school. 

I feel so lost with where my life is going. I feel like maybe I need a hobby. A new passion. Sometimes I feel too scared of change so everything remains simply as  thoughts.





* I just started new meds about 3 weeks ago and go to therapy 2 times a week. 
"
My World Is Falling Apart,"Why did it have to be this year? Why was this the year that Dad got terminal cancer? The year I graduate, the year I get my first job, the year I get my first house. I was supposed to get married next year and have a wonderful wedding, but instead the wedding is now in April because I want Dad to be there, and now I find out that he might not even make it. Everything that is supposed to be beautiful and wonderful is drenched with grief and tragedy. I'm the bride with the ghost of a father. I don't have time for a bridal shower or engagement pictures. 

I've worked so incredibly hard and my world is falling apart, and there's nothing I can do about it. I'm so bitter and so furious that people are just going about their lives while mine has completely stopped. My depression has never been this deep, but I have so many things to do with graduating, moving, finding a job, getting married, and dealing with my grief while Dad is still alive. 
Even my wonderful therapist has moved into ""support"" mode, because there really is nothing for me to do except hang on to the flotsam that is my life while in this hurricane. Everything feels completely out of my control. 

This was supposed to be one of the best years of my life, instead it's become a waking nightmare that I can't escape from. I want to fall apart, because I feel like I'm falling apart at the seams of my heart, but if I do then Dad really won't be able to see all of the things I worked so hard for. I'm taking care of myself but nothing helps this tidal wave of pain, grief, and depression. I just want to wake up and rewind time and slap myself in the face for how naive and lucky I was. Every stupid little problem I've ever had was nothing more than a pebble I stubbed my toe on, and I want so badly to be that childish again. "
I can’t find a point in anything,"I don’t feel at home in my own house. I barely try at school anymore, when I’m not faking sick. I have no motivation. I’m a hollow shell of who I used to be. I feel physical pain in my heart and I just want it to stop. I want to sleep for a very long time. I’m a burden and waste of space. There’s no need for me. Someone who just sits in her room and cries. I don’t contribute anything. No one needs me. I want to leave. "
I matter to no one. I have no reason. I don’t make a difference to anyone. If I was gone nobody would realize. I care about so many people and I don’t think any of those peoples lives would be affected if I was gone. I wish someone would show me they care...,
i asked my wife to name one thing positive anyone had ever said about me,"she quoted two people i barely know who basically said i was nice and then my mom

how's everyone else's evening"
I think I’m anhedonic,"So I don’t really feel happy ever, it’s like the receptors for ”feel good” hormones in my head are just gone. I enjoy nothing and I’m not excited for anything, I have no motivation and don’t feel much towards people either. It’s been like this for a couple of years at least but I think it’s only gotten worse with time. People have said that I should try to deal with any hidden away emotions but I have no clue how to do that. Living like this is hell and the only thing that keeps me going is the hope of it getting better.

Anyway, sorry for the rant, just don’t know where to turn."
Quit my job and moved home to hopefully be happier.. still sad,"I hated my job, I was traveling and was never at my place. I was far from home. I quit because it was making me super depressed. Then I moved home because people told me being with family and friends would help. Well here I am.. still just hating life. I should be so happy but I have too many worries over my head and I just am always sad. I don’t know what to do anymore. I want to give up but can’t. "
How I miss you,"Sunshine how I miss you, the warmth of your gaze, the radiance of your beauty, the joy of your smile, the preciousness of your eyes, how you gave me new life.  I adored you to the deepest parts of my core, I worshipped your very essence.  I woke everyday ready to make you smile, I remember the good days and nights we had.  Now you’re gone, and all that’s left is the darkness of my soul.  May you find the peace and joy you were always searching for.  Our time is done."
Anyone else here?,Having a great day and as soon as your head hits the pillow it all comes flooding back and it destroys you. Listening to music and crying for the 4th day in a row.
Just gave away my old laptop. I can't stop crying.,"It was the first laptop that was really mine. Before 2016 (I was 15), there was no need for me to have my own computer so I just used the family desktop. I got this laptop 3 years ago from my brother once he bought a pc. For almost every single day, it was my only source of happiness. I remember simply sitting down at my desk and using it to binge a show or play games. At the time it seemed like no big deal, but now I wish I could relive those memories. It had a lot of flaws like a loose frame and battery life, but besides that I absolutely loved it. In December of 2018 I got a much better laptop since this one was getting old, and today I finally gave it away. I took a video and pictures of parts of the laptop so I never forget. The small things like the loose trackpad button, the broken vent bars, and the scratch going through the Lenovo logo are the things that I will never forget. I have this problem of becoming too attached to the smallest things, but with this I can't help but cry remembering the good times that I had. Just knowing that I will never see and touch it again hurts so much..."
I tried to save a frantic dog from running into traffic and failed and can’t forgive myself,"I am still shaken up so please excuse me if this isn’t well written. Yesterday was mine and my boyfriends 4 year anniversary and we both worked so we’ve been planning a date day today for a few weeks now. 
Well this morning on the way to brunch we were turning out of my neighborhood onto a busy street when I looked in my rear view and saw a huge black and brown dog running towards us at full speed. It was a long haired German Shepherd; my dream dog. 
So I yelled “get out” to my boyfriend who was confused and I got out of my car as fast as I could and tried to slow the dog down and get in his way. 
He had a collar with tags on it. 
I failed, he darted around me and onto the busy street and was hit immediately by a truck and the noise killed me, it keeps replaying in my head. It’s been about four hours. I had to run away down the street crying because as much as I hate to admit it, I cannot handle these sorts of things, I was traumatized the second it happened and would have rather been hit by a car than an innocent animal getting hit. 
I was screaming and almost puked. I was getting dizzy. I couldn’t been I hadn’t fixed this situation. My boyfriend, the driver of the truck that hit the dog and another couple were at the dogs aid immediately. He/she was rushed to an animal vet who i later called to check on it and they told me legally they couldn’t give out info but that the owners were had shown up. 
I feel like a failure. I could have saved a life and I didn’t. I can’t eat, I can’t drink. 
I thought going home and loving up on my dogs would help me feel better but instead I feel more sad for the owners of the dog that was hit because they can’t be doing what I’m doing right now. 
I also keep thinking if that dog were  mine this wouldn’t have happened. I can’t wrap my head around the misery I feel right now and I have nobody I can talk to. I feel lonely and sad. And I’m hoping this isn’t a permanent feeling. Please somebody tell me it’s not."
I need help describing symptoms I cannot explain.,"Okay, so this is going to be really hard, if not sound like nonsense.  But I’m going to do my best to describe it, as it’s been making me into an absolute anxious and depressed wreck this past week. 

So I’m pretty certain I have dysthymia, which essentially means that depression is kind of a low grade cloud that’s always hanging around.  On my best days, it’s chilling off in the background of my mind somewhere.  On my worst days, I’m pretty much a zombie, caught in swirls of thoughts and just absolutely keeled over.  

I’ve felt “like this” (aka depressed) for as long as I could remember.  And it came with anxiety too, which was another level to deal with.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt, what my mind describes, as “normal people”.  There has always been a certain “off-ness” about me that was in my peripheral, even as a kid.  

I’ve never attempted to take my life, nor actively engaged in planning anything of the sort.  But the intrusive suicidal thoughts are so fucking distressing it’s unreal.  I honestly get so worked up that I end up bed ridden for days or feeling like I want to run out of my skin and mind.  It really is just debilitating.  Whether it’s an anxiety or panic attack, I don’t know specifically. But it sucks to wake up (after a fucked up sleep schedule), and then enter full blown panic mode, yet afraid to move. I hate this shit so much lol. 

Anyways, here is a thing that’s been driving me up the fucking walls with anxiety.  I don’t know how to describe it best, so bare with me.  So, essentially it *feels* like an intrusive thought. But it’s not. It’s like a rift in the thought streams.  I can feel it in my head and around my inner ears the most. But I don’t know how the fuck to describe it.  I experience it like I would a thought, but it doesn’t actually *say* anything. It’s like a quick jolt or “bloop” kinda sensation.  It doesn’t sound like anything, and it’s not auditory in the sense that it’s coming from outside.  It’s in my head, but I don’t know what it is.  I can’t put it into a sensory experience, as it’s interpreted as a thought.  But I get such a surge of anxiety pumping because of it and I feel like I’m gonna go crazy or something.  It’s not my tinnitus, at least I don’t think, because I can distinguish between the “eeeeeeeeeeeeeee”.  

I don’t know.  If this sounds familiar, please share your experience.  I hope that this is a named and known phenomena that I could bring up to my psych and therapist to work at.  I really don’t just want to sit here like a punching bag and take this in the background, while I go through the motions with my docs.  

Thanks for reading. Sorry for the novel, guys. "
Ideation turned to planning,"But I am scared that if I attempt sucide, that I will fail and ultimately be more of a burden than I already am. I don't want to fail and be a vegetable. Driving home from a trip today, I thought seriously about jumping out of my vehicle. Is that guaranteed? No. So then I thought about jumping out right after we passed a semi but then I felt guilty about involving someone innocent in my charade. Thinking all about all of this with my two month old and 11 year old in the backseat....so I remembered I have a Norco prescription I never used after I had my son. I am going to Walmart on my way home, thought about getting a bottle of tylenol PM but my husband may be suspicious. I work part time until I go back full time. I wonder if when my inlaws come watch my son, I could go get my tylenol PM and take my norco instead of work? Find a place to park and that be it?"
This is just a rant. Need to vent. Sorry this may not make sense.,"I wish I could get help from somebody but I hate being such a burden. I used to have friends I could call brothers in my hometown but after money problems in my family, we had to leave and move to FL. I hate FL, it's been almost 3 years that I've been here. 2 years alone, sure I have my dad but social wise it wasn't until my 3rd year here that I made 2 friends. I've met plenty of people here but everyone including those 2 friends only like smoking bud. For the most part I like having them as friends. When I'm with them though I'm pretty quite and feel like the only things we have in common is liking weed and playing some video games.

 I like to smoke cause it helps me feel something but I feel like it's the only thing to do. Even stuff that I used to enjoy I barely find fun anymore. I wish I had someone I can just be open and normal with. I hate having to put on this show for people here. But if I don't put on the show people see how boring and sad I am. So I always need to either smoke or drink. There was a point where I thought this whole sad time was ending. I started being happy again and people noticed. One of those two friends is actually a girl I used to have a big crush on and during my good time we used to hang out more often. But I fell back into this hole and she definitely noticed. We don't hang nearly as often anymore but at the same time it's like I don't care anymore. Everything is boring even smoking is starting to get pretty boring. I don't have any plans for the future, I don't know where I'm heading in life, I have no goals, no dreams, not even a damn personality, I just have nothing.

Even if I told somebody this, what would they say? What could anybody possibly say to help? That's why I keep my mouth shut cause at the end of the day nobody can help me anyways. Telling people this stuff only makes them uncomfortable. I've always avoided posting in this subreddit cause I didn't want to admit that it's gotten to this point but I feel like I'm just at my limits. I'm sorry for making this so incoherent but I just need to throw some of my thoughts somewhere. "
It’s hard when you’re supposed to be ‘better’ now and things are starting to get worse again.,It’s like watching things slowly slide back into the dark hole you thought you’d finally pulled yourself out of.  It’s scary because I know what I’ve come through and I’m terrified to go back. 
Fucking people,"Why do i hang around people that don't really care whether i die or not, i mean they say they care but i know they don't cause they never talk to me about anything, lie to me on the regular and then blame me for my problems. U don't know i just kinda needed to rant to someone who will actually care about me and i guess this is the only real safe space i know."
hey,yo what up im dom on xan no anxiety anymore ooooooh my god i forgot what this was like... this is the last time im taking any hard shit tho for a while at least cause this could get addicting real quick... hopefully ill get better for good eventually
"I had a good day, then i got home.","So, basically, I went to my friends baby shower today, it was nice, i gave her some gifts to help her with the baby and what not. I talked with my other friend and had a blast, ate cake, you know. My friends mom drove me home, and we were having a blast in the car. Eventually I got home and started chillin at home, and whatdoyaknow, i start thinking about my ex. Seriously it's been months, since September, and i can't get over him no matter what. I've tried looking at other men, and i feel nothing, i feel like i'm cheating on him, like i'm bound to him. I just want to cuddle him, and i can't. He hasn't texted me back for at least a month now, and i swear it's driving me crazy. I just want to blow my head off, i know that's fucked up, but it's how i feel. I miss him so bad. I really love him, i don't know how much longer i can go on without him. No one else pleases my eyes, my eyes are only for him but he decided he didn't want me anymore after being with me for a year and a half..."
Does it get easier?,"I had my first day at my first full time job this past week. After a year of unemployment, I finally found this and I thought it would honestly help me. But all it’s done is made me feel worse. I got hired along with this other girl who is super fucking extroverted and happy all the time and almost immediately, my boss and co-workers swarmed her with kindness and welcoming attitudes and just ignored me. I don’t think they like me at all.

Annnnnnd I just got through having a breakdown because I don’t think this job is right for me and if it means that I have to be this Mary Sunshine/smile-y person for 8.5 hours a day, I don’t think I’m going to survive. But I can’t be unemployed again.

Does it get easier? God, I wish I was normal."
Everyone in a group chat I'm in forced me to leave because one person in it doesn t like me,"Honestly I just need to rant, I got added to the group a few days ago and everything was fine, but one girl in the group doesn't like me, and as soon as she saw I was in the group she asked "" Who the fuck added [my name]"", leading her to say if I don't leave she will. I said she could leave then, and almost the entire group told me to leave, saying ""[my name] < Girl"" and ""Just leave"". 

I really thought that I was making progress, I'd stopped cutting for over a month and haven't really felt suicidal in over a week, but I just cut myself probably near the worst I've done and tried to kill myself again. What do I even do in this situation? It was a class group chat and I've got that class tomorrow, which I'm dreading going to now, especially because I sit next to the girl. What should I do?"
My mental state is the equivalent of a spoon in a garbage disposal right now.,"About 3 months ago, I had a messy breakup in which I’ve sort of gotten over, but I’m a wreck for other reasons and I don’t know what to do. 

I’ve been over evaluating my social ineptitude way more, I keep cutting off people who get close to me or ignore them for a few days, I’ve been anxious and zombified.
I don’t feel myself but I don’t know what myself is really. I’m not used to being alone again I guess. I was hooking up with this guy after my breakup and he would give me attention and then pull away and I acted pretty messy about it, freaking out on him and criticizing/questioning why he said he wanted to be with me and then acted as if he didn’t, instead of doing the normal thing and moving on from someone who wasn’t interested. 

I’ve always been awkward and played it off as quirky but lately I’ve been harsh on myself and I’m mentally scolding myself every time I act weirdly but I’m impulsive and it’s just all a mess

I’m on medication for ADHD and recently started Zoloft for social anxiety

I’m sorry that this paragraph is vague; I’m really frazzled right now"
"It's not just that I'm worthless, we all are!","This is just how I see the world. There's  just shy of 8 billion people on earth. That's 8 followed by 9 zeros. 8,000,000,000. I read somewhere the human brain can't picture groups of things past like 100 or something that could be wrong idk. But the point is there is quite literally an unimaginable number of people on this planet. Why the fuck does my life matter? I make up less than 0.00000001% of the population.  I am a minute tiny speck with no reason or purpose for being. So without purpose or reason for being I am useless and with ~8billion others I'm certainly not valuable. But this doesn't apply just to me, no. Every single person is as worthless as me. Despite what you may believe you don't have a reason for being you've just stumbled into something that fills a void inside you. You are also purposeless. On our own we a worthless and useless. En masse we are worth a little more. Too bad I hate all of you."
im emotionally numb at 14,"well my pain started when i was 7, that's when i found out my father left me when i was 1 month old,then when i was 8 some kids lied about me and nobody in school wanted to talk to me, imagine a 2nd grader all alone, no friends,nothing, so my mom put me in a different class(schools are different where i live) i met someone who i thought was my best friend it turns out he hated me, since i had no one at age 8 my family moved...again, 2 years later we moved again just when i thought i made friends,i went to this school im currently in i changed many friends but it wasnt really easy for me since i was really fuckin shy,1 year later and i was 11 i found out by accident that i was supposed to have a sister but she died 2 mins after being born, and that hurt me a lot,i always acted happy and stuff, so here we go to 2018 i finally thought i made friends with these people,one of those friends asked me to promise him that i wont go with this girl he had a crush on to prom(sry if that makes no sense) and me being a good friend promised him, 2 days later he told me i can have her,i was happy once in my life,then after that girl and i kissed he made up some lies about me,then that girl got mad at me and everyone from that group of friends turned out to hate me,theyre all fake,so i was alone without any friends for like last 3 months,then i started hanging out with this guy who i thought would actually be my friend,i met another girl,turns out she was just playing with me for fun,my friend is mad at me for no reason i wanna die,people hurt me to the point i cant feel emotions any more "
Meds: How should I be feeling?,"Hi. First-time poster, here. I’m a 45yo guy who, due to family and relationship issues, has had low-grade depression for about 20 years. It took a turn in the last 12 months or so, and I finally saw a doctor about it. Now I’ve been on citalopram for about a month and a half, but I’m not feeling a significant difference. The trouble is, though, I’ve been down for so long that I’m not sure how I should be feeling.

So I’m wondering if anyone out there has been through something similar, and was there an “aha” moment where you could say, “yes, this is working.”  Or maybe that’s just not how it works. 

Any thoughts you can share are appreciated!"
How do you get past knowing there are horrible people doing horrible things.,Every time there’s a mass shooting it triggers something in me that I just can’t control. How am I supposed to be happy knowing that there’s so much hatred on the world. Why are there people that want to cause hurt in others. I don’t understand. I feel so helpless and small. I wish I could flip a switch and solve all the worlds problems. I wish I could save everyone who has ever felt attacked. Why does the bad in the world seem to be winning.   
pointlessness,"(Venting) Recently my depression has got a lot worse than before. I struggle to do anything. brushing my teeth, feeding my pets, getting out of bed, let alone going to school. before I would struggle but much less than now. Anyway, a few months ago when this started I was certain that getting a horse would help (been riding and around horses for years) because it’s the one thing that I really enjoy and am interested in. My cats and dog can help me feel a lot better when I’m down so I thought this would be a good idea for my mental health. I had a huge phase, made me so happy fantasising about it, but I never asked my mum because I knew it wouldn’t happen. I think a horse would motivate me to leave the house and get exercise, daylight and basically just stop me feeling sorry for myself all the time. I forgot about until today my mum said that in summer when she gets her pension we could be able to do it (she sees that being around horses helps me and counselling hasn’t helped, otherwise she wouldn’t say this). I was so set on getting one before but right now I doubt and loathe myself so much. It makes me so anxious. And these phases I have make me worry that I would just ruin the horse or not spend enough time on it. I’m so useless. Everything seems so pointless at the moment."
What do you live for?,"Personally, I fail to answer this question when I ask it to myself. Why should I struggle to my education to ultimately find a job to ultimately lead a boring paycheck life with not meaning? "
Hello.,"I go to school with a few friends. (Wow big surprise) 
Only one of them know about my ""situation"" but I frequently show my ups and downs. (Mood swings etc.) 

I don't know if this is a thing that happens in my school or anywhere else, but whenever the slightest inconvenience happens, that person just acts really depressed and tells me that they want to kill themselves. 

This is understandable, its a tough time, you're not happy with that result. But the thing is, they say it as a joke. Even my friend who knows my condition (not fully but to an extent) says this and nothing bad has even happened (eg gets a 75% on a test.) 

I just stop for a minute, and wonder, 
""are they making fun of me?"" 
""Are they serious?""
""Why are they joking about it?""
(I ask them something along the lines of: 
""Seriously? Why are you saying that?"" And they just respond with 
""Its a joke.... chill. "")

This just really pisses me off, but i cant really do anything. I hate this- its just literally saying you feel suicidal for a joke. 

Im sorry if you think this is stupid, but i just really needed to write this out somewhere and get it out my system. 

Thanks for reading this useless rant. 
"
How can I get over my penis causing me so much depression,"Back in September long story short something happened to my penis skin, no pain it’s just different and not how it used to be. It was straight after masturbating so I only have myself to blame but I tell myself it was going to happened one way or another. I’ve had incredible depression over it the past 5 months and it has ruined my life. I’ve seen 3-4 doctors and dermatologist’s who tell me it’s looks fine. I know there’s is nothing I can do for it but I just can’t get this loop of being absolutely obsessed with it out of my head. It makes me suicdal.

Some days I’m fine about it and feel happy then I fall into a pit of depression obsessing over it and just continuesly touching it and it’s just a reminder of what’s wrong with it. It’s just a permanent loop I have created and can’t break out of.

My doctor suggest a therapist, what else can I do? "
A small achievement today...,"I don’t remember the last time I ate something healthy. All I’ve been eating is processed food and energy drinks like crazy. Today I changed that. I had a caesar salad and some grapes. I finally ate something healthy for the first time in a really long time. A small achievement, but it kinda makes me feel good. "
I’m waiting for my parents to die so I can kill myself without any regrets.,"I lost all hope things could get better.  I tried everything and it just didn’t help. I never wanted too much from life, just what my friends had, but I couldn’t get it becuase I was born ugly. Now it’s too late and I won’t ever be normal again, no matter how much I would try to. 
I don’t even know why I’m posting here, I don’t really come to reddit very often, I’m jsut very drunk and I try to do something on my iPad so I don’t throw up."
What is happening to me,"Since about a month I feel like my mental health is going down, fast. This week has been hell. I can’t make any decision, everything I do scares the shit out of me. The thought of doing anything terifies me. I feel like a small kid. I can’t eat, I can’t sleep without crying. I was never like this. I was optimistic, motivated and curious. It really fucking scares me that I completely lost this.

My mother saw I was a little down and asked me if I was okay, I made some lame excuse that I was just a little sad that day. I’m scared to tell her, I don’t wanna feel so weak. 

Normally I’m good at recognizing personal problems and try to solve them. This time I feel different, I’ve never felt like this before. I can’t control it. "
******TRIGGER WARNING ******So I’ve actually done it. I’ve cut for the first time.,"I always thought cigarette burns would be the way I went but who knew it would be the razor. 

I’m fucking done.  "
Why should I try to be a “good” and kind person when acting solely for my own pleasure is the only way I can feel content?,"I guess you could call me a depressed, hedonistic cynic. I never felt this way until I became depressed. Why not just do whatever I want that can give me some happiness, regardless of morals? And don’t bring up religion, I’ll take my chances. I’d rather have fun and go to hell than be bored and live forever. "
"When I'm doing bad I write, maybe reading it will help somebody feel a little less alone knowing they're not the only one","How many know what it's truly like to look the world in the eye?

Flash it a smile,

Say you're doing fine,

And have nobody know you told a lie?

You'll cast out your truth,

Thrown deep down the well

So the world can never see

The true you. 

Hidden

Oh so well

So smile and wave

As it's what they all crave,

And maybe convince yourself that everything's okay.

But deep down you know it's your lie.

It's your farce, and everything's not fine.

You're alone in this fight,

Just try to keep walking the line"
Always hated life,"Life never really made sense to me.I hate racisim and how I unwittingly perpetuate it by my actions and words. I fucking hate school. I hate happiness now that I know the world, it doesn't make any damn sense. I really only love God, I know he'll deliver me from myself and others. I hate the pain, I hate my self induced beta male features. I hate how everything is the opposite apparently. I hate how I never kept it real. I hate the human spirit. I feel like I'm already...already dead. I've always loved my family.I just want to die before any of them do. Life isn't fun. I did a lot of stupid shit and fucked it up.I made this bed and I'll sleep in it to. How life goes. Sorry, I always loved you guys(family)."
When your habits depend on others...,"I just realized after dating a woman, that my habits to live a better life depended on the attention she gave me.  
When I felt her intereset I became motivated to change my life, start working out, fix my day schedule, my eating habits and even working on a future plan.  
As my doubts rose that we might have a future together that motivation got lost. I lost all the strength to change my life.

I am procrastinating and numbing my emotions with endless hours of gaming , because while gaming I have social company and keeps my mind off the negative thoughts.

I have that feeling that I need someone that gives meaning to my actions..."
Feeling alone,"Just got out of an abusive relationship a couple months ago, and its official. I am completely alone. I had a few friends before said relationship, but the guy I was with made me get rid of them all. He made me get rid of my social media too and I feel like I'm not connected with anyone. I have no friends and feel like I have nothing going for me. I recently graduated highschool and now work at a fast food restaurant. I'm not currently going to college and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. The worst thing is I'm so unmotivated. I keep filling myself with this false feeling of happiness. That I'm going to get my shit together, start eating healthy, start going to the gym, start going to school, start putting myself out there. Meanwhile I do nothing to make it happen. It's genuinely so hard to make myself do the simplest of tasks, let alone get my entire life together. I think I might have depression, but I don't even have the motivation to call a fucking therapist and schedule an appointment. I WAS seeing one for a bit, but stopped. She wasnt really experienced, and I didnt feel like it was helping. So now I'm here. I don't know where I'll be in the future. I dont even know why I'm writing this but I feel like I have to get out how I'm feeling to someone. I guess I just want to see if anyone can relate."
I feel like my problems don't matter. Everyone has it worse than me.,"I'm so tired. I can't talk to anyone. No one will ever understand me. I feel so different from everyone and also fucking crazy. Like i cant really confide in anyone with the things I feel and the experiences i have/had and its pretty exhausting feeling so fucking isolated inside of your own head. I have no support system. My problems aren't even serious, I don't even know what they are, I just feel like shit. all. the. freaking. time. It never stops. I'm antisocial as fuck, I only have one real friend who has it so much worse than me so in comparison I'm nothing. I'm so privileged and have a comfortable life. I don't have anything traumatic happen to me in the past. And yet I'm feeling horrible all the time. It hurts and it's the kind of sadness that's so deep inside me, it never leaves, it's engraved inside me. 
I wish I could find someone that takes me seriously. Someone who cares and understands. Maybe someone who has the gone through the same thing, of feeling like you're not sick enough. I'm sorry for venting I'm just feeling so bad right now and I don't have where to go."
I dont know whats wrong,"I've been in a depressionalized state for what seems like my whole life. My memory is blurry, days pass by without much emotion. I am losing my life, i dont know what this is. I've been fighting my whole life for a proper diagnosis, I am getting tried of trying. 

I have a young daughter that i have to be there for. She she three and during those years i have madly sought out a fix. I've tried ayahuasca, tcds, thousands in of dollars worth in supplements, nootropics, research chemicals like nsi-189, and a few different ssri(  celexa, dextromethorphan, i only take wellbutrin now)

I dont know what i have, it could be anything based on the descriptions I've read. My symptoms are horrible memory, lack of focus, extreme fatigue, emotional dullness, tightness of muscles. Its almost like my bodies natural state is to dissociate. I've  had this all my life i feel, im tried of fighting but if i dont fight ill lose years in the blink of an eye. I want to go back to school but i cant if i dont fix this. Im 26 and i feel like growth is an impossibility in this state, all i want to do is learn! 

Ive gotten an mri and neurological exam(basically an iq test with some other things) both came back well aside from the memory issues in the iq test. I scored 130ish on all other tests aside from the memory based. Which lead me to getting on adderall. I guess it help the first few times i took but the come down was horrible. Im seeing a therapist and psychiatrist now. Is there anything else i should be doing? I want to get better more than anything."
"Does anyone else do good in the morning, but at night , that’s when you get depressed?",Because fucking same dudes/dudettes.
Life is just full of struggles.,"Idk if its even for here, but literally everywhere else would just make it worse.

The past few months has been a real struggle with finding jobs, and a few weeks ago i just got a job i could work the hours i requested (basically every bill is covered and a little more by this salary.)
Yet. I have been having struggles not crying at the job, everything is so heavy for me and i cant take it anymore. 
I feel so stupid and useless because of it, and the worst is that i cant stay home due bills i have to pay. 
I know i need to ""get out"" and ""try my best to do the job anyway"" but i literally cry everytime i have to go, even for a few hours. 

I just dont know what to do anymore, i need the money, and i need things to do, i just cant have my health going any lower as it is right now. 
I hate myself so much for having these struggles atm."
Being me is miserable,"I'm so tired of being me. Its such a burden. More than a lot of people in my life think.

Just now, I was with my family eating at a restaurant. Nothing was wrong. Good food, no one in the family arguing or anything, chill atmosphere. But my mind started doing that stupid depression thing. 

I got lost in negative thoughts at first. Then when I noticed and wanted to come back to reality, I had a REALLY hard time doing that. It felt like I had a fuzzy block in my brain that was keeping from fully....feeling in the moment. Feeling alive. I think that was my dissociation that happens because of a childhood trauma. 

I'm just so tired of this. I felt so disgusting and sad. I wanted to cry or yell out but I just had to pretend I was doing ok. 

I finally came to, but its so fucking scary to lose myself like that. Its especially scary when I can feel it, and try to regain control but can't. Am I going to have to go through this forever? The rest of my life? Is living even worth it if I have to go through this time and time again?? I've started feeling so hopeful after going to therapy and achieving some successes in areas of my life. But then I have these extreme lows that make me feel like none of that matters.

Maybe its time to try anti-depressants? I just want control, not to feel like I need help all the time.

"
My Different Forms are Killing Me.,"In some areas of my life, I am good, but in others I am so Bad, and those bad forms are killing me.

For example, I am very generous with my friends and will always go the extra mile for any of them, and in any capacity and I respect and love people and would never want to do anyone harm.

Yet, I’ve cheated on my girlfriend, and I often have bad thoughts and I just can’t stop them. I don’t understand how I can be both good and evil. I just want to be kind and nice, but I feel like I get in my own way. "
Has Anyone Tried Psychedelics???,"LSD, shrooms???? I never have, but I'm curious if the affects were long lasting or just temporary. I've read accounts of people doing acid and it changed their life. Of course, most of these accounts are of famous musicians that I admire and they weren't necessarily depressed or have a personality disorder like I do (avpd) plus they had their talent and in most cases fame....Just curious if anyone ever took a trip that really changed their perspective. "
Overwhelmed with School,"I am currently on ""Spring Break"" and have an inordinate amount of schoolwork to complete. I have a 12 page paper and  two exams when I return (one worth 35% of my grade), and one is based on SIXTEEN chapters from 2 different textbooks. The professor gave us no indication of what would be on the test, just information from the readings (in addition to separate information covered in class). I got unlucky by registering late this semester, so I was forced to take all the worst rated professors and now I am really struggling. I feel like all I do is study and read, yet I'm barely making it through. I earned a low B on one of my midterm exams, when over half the class earned failing grades. How is this fair? Can a professor really fail an entire class? I feel sick when I look at the thousands of pages worth of reading I have to complete (literally over 1000 in total) over the break. Not only do I have to read, but I also have to make notes and study the material. It's also very dry, technical reading so it's difficult to get through it. I can't even ""skim read"", especially since the second professor tests us on very specific phrases from the reading. I also have multiple 15-20 page papers coming up, in addition to final exams in a few months (which will require tons more reading). Most semesters I have gotten by simply skimming readings, taking notes, and completing my assignments. I have never had this much reading in my entire life. This has been the most miserable semester of my entire life. I don't go out, I don't watch tv, I literally study so much, yet I'm still struggling. I feel so miserable and depressed. I don't know why some professors are so intent on making students completely miserable. Most other people in my two hardest classes look depressed and exhausted all the time. One professor also constantly boasts about how  ""long and difficult"" his exams are and how ""students always complain about his exams"" and how he ""never curves"". I don't understand why this is something to be proud of? I have also started abusing adderall pills to stay up to finish readings and assignments, most of the time I don't sleep at all before sitting through an entire day of classes (8am- 4:45), since I'm taking six courses. Three of my classes aren't that horrible, but the other three are absolutely crushing me. I have lost a bunch of weight and feel tired and miserable all the time. This shouldn't be so difficult. "
Idle,"I was feeling pretty good the last couple of days, but then today. It feels like I was cruising along and then just ran into a wall. I haven’t been able to do anything. I feel horrible. My poor kids."
"Sometimes I get so distraught, all I can to is writhe in bed.","It’s ridiculous really, but I’ll just start to feel so empty, and yet so full of frustration and sadness and general hatred for myself. In those moments, I can only think to climb into bed and let my body contort like I’m having a fit. It’s confusing and kind of scary, but it feels like writhing around like a baby snake in its egg is the only form of expression I have to let out this deep-set torment that I’ve had for so long. It almost feels like possession; by letting the depression expose itself to me physically, I’m tiring it out so I can maybe attempt to think clearly. I don’t know if anyone else who does this, and I’ve never been able to express it to anyone in my life because they don’t understand what exactly I’m doing or how I’m doing it. "
Should i tell my close friends,My counsular wants me to tell one of my close friends or multiple of them about when my sister killed herself but I don't know how they will respond I don't want to put my emotional baggage on them but I think I should get it off my chest i don't know if I should 
Indifference,"I feel i will not be able to go on. Im so tired and living aimlessly. No matter what i do, i feel my reactions and feeling are fake. I don't know if I'm love or not, i feel so empty. "
I'm out of reasons to keep going,"I don't want to kill myself, but I'm really over living. If a freak accident occurred and a plane crashed into my apartment, I'd welcome it.

There's nothing in my life that brings me joy. I had a girlfriend until recently, and that was the only thing. And even then, I was strongly considering suicide. I bought rope and tied a noose while we were dating. So the last thing that made me not feel like absolute shit is gone from my life. 

I'm graduating soon and don't have a job. My friends all do. They're going to be leaving the city and going across the country. Meanwhile, I'm here, unbelievably depressed and alone. The antidepressants that I've been on for 10 years aren't doing shit. My therapist can only tell me that everyone goes through a rough time.. like that fuckin helps. 

The only thing keeping me going is the fear of hurting my parents, but I don't think that'll be enough for much longer. I hate everything about my life and don't foresee it changing for the better."
I have too much empathy and it’s exhausting,"I feel like it’s so stupid and I feel kinda selfish for feeling like this, but I’m so empathetic it’s ruining my life. I lose so much sleep over specific criminal cases cause I feel so much sadness for the people actually affected.

I don’t know if it’s just me being overly sensitive, but I don’t know how to deal with this and I don’t know where else to post this.

I went to my therapist the other day and she just told me that I have to remind myself that I am not in control of these things I get sad about, but it’s really difficult to remind myself of that."
I could disappear now and no one would care.,"It's a weird realization. Like, how long until my friends notice? Would they even care or shrug it off? I think the latter. Who would care about a piece of shit like me anyways? "
Does anybody else feel too exhausted to be the person they want to be?,"So I have mental and physical issues up the wazoo. Despite this, I am still really interested in life. I have a lot of dreams, hopes, and goals. Desire and love still burn bright in my heart. 

The problem is I don't have energy for anything anymore. Even the most menial task seems like an Olympic feat for me. So I spend my time doing things my brain and body can handle: mindlessly browsing social media, playing videogames, etc. These things in turn make me feel more depressed, because they just contribute to my stagnation. It's such a vicious cycle and I feel totally trapped.

Can anybody relate? Why am I (we) always on empty? I got places to go, Depression. :/ "
My family doesn't help,"I'm 16, living with my mom. I smoke too much weed because deep down i really hate myself when im sober. I've tried to talk to my brother about it, and he just says something along the lines of ""whatever sadboi"" or whatever the fuck. I know as a fact that he's struggled with depression and i dont understand how he can be so cruel when im just reaching out for help. my sister is great but she's never around. I tried to talk with my mom about it and she tried to have me institutionalised. my therapist is probably one of the only people i can talk to, and recently she's been cutting out appointment's short.

&#x200B;

My sister gave me a journal for christmas this year and i used it for two months. I wrote a suicide note in it and i haven't opened it since. 

&#x200B;

I'd been doing so well just not caring about anything and just living the best i could but it's catching up to me

&#x200B;

i just need to tell someone that im struggling. thank god this sub exists"
I went from having my dreams coming true to having nothing,"[Warning: long post , don't need to read I just needed to open up somewhere]


Since a certain point in my life I was always successful at everything I did, I had beautiful women wanting to be with me I learnt 4 different instruments in the space of 5 years and became a professional musician

Life seemed like it was all set for me up until till last year  I lost all sense of purpose and had somewhat of an Identity crisis. I felt like I didn't have anything worth living for except for the woman I loved and intended to marry.

Little did I know, last December as I was contemplating the idea of writing a suicide letter as a catharsis (but not actually doing it) my girlfriend told me she wanted to talk and then confessed to me that she fell for another guy, I got even more worried when my initial reaction and feeling wasn't pain or anger but I was perfectly calm and I started giving her advice and told her if that's how she felt then she should go with it and find her happiness even if it wasn't with me.
Again, this is the woman I was sure I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.

And other things in my life weren't so great either from this point, I lost my best friend, I released an album 2 weeks after my girlfriend left me and it flopped hard.
But I still had that spark in me from when anything I did just magically worked, so in February I developed a crush on someone and did a gesture on valentine's day only to be rejected and then when it really hit me.

I couldn't grief what happen but couldn't move on either. I quit all social media and cut all social contact, everything became a heavy chore, even eating or playing music.

I refused to admit that I was depressed but I can't hold it anymore and I really feel like I can't open up to anyone about this, I just feel like not only do have nothing to live for, but everything I lived for is now long gone.

And I am for the first time in my life genuinely afraid of the future"
I need help.,"I've been doing this for too long. I need help, but in a way that includes not having to tell anyone (except the help person). I'm a teen by the way and my parents or teachers don't know about it, and I intend on keeping it that way. Can anyone help?
Edit: to the people offering to help, I would accept but the comments don't wanna load. "
How long until lamotrigine/lamictal starts working?,"I'm at 50mg now, currently on my third week. I still feel just as depressed as I did when I started taking the meds, and I've been waiting for them to kick in so I can enjoy my spring break and get some homework done, but they still aren't working. The strange thing is that when I first upped my dosage to 50 a week ago, for a brief period that night I felt something I haven't felt in a long time. I actually felt legitimate contentedness with my life, and all my anxiety and depression was gone. I felt like a real person, not a foggy-headed, lethargic mess, and was actually motivated to do my homework and excited to do things. However, when I woke up the next morning, I was back to my same depressed self. Was that how the medicine makes you feel? How long do I have to wait for this effect again? Sometimes I worry that the medicine will never help me, and I'll feel like a hopeless mess forever."
Haven’t been able to get out of bed today. Feeling scared.,"Hey all, just wanted to share that I’m in a pretty low place right now. I’m trying to be strong but the idea of even going outside or leaving my room is too difficult. I’m really scared because I’m feeling extremely hopeless. Any words of encouragement would be greatly appreciated. I need that now more than ever before. "
Fear of mornings,"So maybe this is kind of hard to explain, but, through the years I have developed a kind of fear for mornings. Without trying to sound over dramatic, It feels like I have been traumatized by years of having to get up early to do things that I don’t want to or fear having to do. School has been a great part of this. I was always behind on homework,lagging behind, and always lived in some kind of fear of not being able to finish school, get a diploma, get a job, etc. So now, I dread mornings and having to get up even slightly early. Every fiber in my body wants to stay in bed, fearing ‘having to do things’ and just hating the fact that I *have* to do things in the first place. Mornings in general are ruined for me. It takes busloads if energy just to get up and do stuff, go to work, etc.
Maybe someone out there can relate.."
I miss my parents,"I’m 16 years old and have been feeling more and more depressed since my parents started drinking when I was about 8. They used to be really sweet and kind people but now I don’t even know them anymore. I don’t even know how to put into words how much it hurt me to see them change into such empty and aggressive people. They barely ever talk to me, I also don’t have any friends and went from having good grades to barely passing. I try so hard to convince them to try to stop drinking I’ve talked about it with them so many times I just don’t have anything to say anymore. They’ve been gone this entire week drinking somewhere, they don’t even answer my calls. It’s so hard to get out of bed but I have to go to school, take care of my 90 year old grandma and take care of our dogs. My older brother doesn’t visit anymore because of my parents. I don’t know how to deal with this anymore, I feel like giving up. "
I'm terrified of my depression,"
I've had a formal disagnosis of depression for about 4 years now, probably was suffering a lot longer than that. It's been one hell of a journey with one shitty thing happening after another, but I am finally feeling stable on a medication tjat actually works for me. 

Recently I got some bad news. Not even that bad, I had even worse news a couple of months prior but this time I just felt worthless and awful and I was taken over by thoughts of suicide. That if I just ended my life then I'd stop being such a constant source of sadness and disappointment to everyone around me. Those thoughts passed fairly quickly and now I feel like I'm living in constant fear that they will come up again. I'm expecting some news on Tuesday and if it's bad I'm so scared that I will do something I would later regret. As awful as they were, I only hope they just pass quickly like they did last time. 

I'm not really looking for advice exactly, I will be bringing this up with my doctor next time I see him but I just needed a place to vent, without making my friends or family have to listen to me again, I'm sure they are fed up with me by now"
?,"I have one friend, he is only friends with me because i sneak booze into school. A little vodka goes a long way for my social interactions, helps me loosen up so i can actually talk to someone without being uncomfortably awkward. Is this strange? Should i stop drinking so much and sacrifice any hope of a social interaction?"
PPD,What to do when I have PPD and so much stress I just want to cry and cry!
I need help but i cant get it,"Im depressed, its really an on an off thing but when i am i feel like its just been buried the whole time, i cant tell my parents because i dont trust them and honestly theyre a major part of it, i dont know who to talk to because people in life that i open up to could care less, if you know of a hotline for people that just need someone to talk to and open up to thatd be great :) :("
it's a lifestyle,"*Me comes late*

anxiety: Wow! Great! Look, they're all thinking about how annoying you are

me: No, they're not think about me

depression: ever. "
just tried to kill myself and now i'm not sure what to do,what use is anything now? ive never felt so lost
Im doomed,"Hey I am 17 I havent been in school for almost a year and a half. I have absolutely no fucks to give about anything. Its not that I choose to be apathetic to everything I literally cant will myself to work or go to school. I have to force myself to do tiny things and it is so hard.

Yet I am bored all the time. My family doesnt get it at all. They tell me:

""Just get a job""

""Just go to school""

""Just volunteer""

I dont want to live anymore. I cant commit suicide but I really really am just so bored of life and I don't want to go through this anymore. I will never be able to work or live on my own whats even the point of carrying on like the empty shell of a person that I am."
I really really don’t want to go into work tomorrow,"I really don’t want to. I feel so bad right now. I don’t want to go to sleep and I don’t want to go into work. The thought of going into work makes me want to throw up. I just want to stay in bed for a little bit longer. 

But my class is relying on me. They don’t get on with supply teachers and they have their class assembly on Wednesday. I have to be with them to help them rehearse it.

I don’t know what to do. "
Read this for some hope ❤️,"I won’t make this too long, but I (19 F) noticed I have changed so much in the past 3-4 years. I struggled with depression / had even had unsuccessful suicide attempts since I was 11. And then when I was 15 I went into this downward spiral and made a lot of bad decisions, nothing “too crazy” per say but definitely a very different persona to the “shy” “quiet” girl I once was. I struggled with diagnosed depression & panic disorder for over 6 years .And then one day I woke up and I just told myself it’s really up to me to make myself better. The change has to come from within me, I can read as many inspirational quotes I want, complain to people how unfair life really is etc but it’s going to stay this way forever until I choose to change. And so I did. Looking back I think you can change your experience by changing your precipitation (obvi not with all cases) but in general. I slowly became very spiritual and I’m so much happier than I was 3-4 years ago. Sometimes I wish I changed sooner but I know everything I been through as corny as this sounds brought me here today to even write this. 

Let me just say: 
1. The past cannot be changed. What has been done has been done. 
2. Happiness is found within you
3. Opinions do not define your reality 
4. Everyone’s journey is different 
5. Things get better with time 
6. Judgements are a confession of ones character 
7. Overthinking will lead to sadness 
8. Positive thoughts create positive things 
9. Smiles are contagious 
10. Kindness is free 
11. You only fail if you don’t try 
12. What goes around comes around 

I don’t mean to sound pretentious but these are truly things that have helped
Tonight do this: watch the sky at night. See all the stars .. all the wide space..you need to understand .. we are on this rock just floating through space .. constantly moving..moving in a place unknown, world unknown..it’s so much bigger than you can ever imagine..and this isn’t unreal.. it’s happening at this very moment ..and nothing can compare to this. Look at up at the night sky ..it’s not a world dark and scary but a beautiful thing filled with mysteries. 

You are here for a reason. Our time here relative to the universe is less than a snap of a finger. It’s short, life is very short. Please do what makes you happy, live a good life. Be grateful for the small things. Live life the ups and down are a part of this journey here, feel emotions. Time does not wait for anybody. Waking up tomorrow is not promised, truly, this life is yours and yours only. 

If there are Gods and they are just, than they will not care about how devout you been but welcome you based on your virtues. If there are Gods and they are unjust, then you should not want to worship them. If there are no Gods, than you have lived a good life and it will live on in the memories of your loved ones.  "
I hate it when people force you to talk about why youre down,It just possibly caused me to lose my closest relationship.  I still love her and she made me talk about it and now I'm pretty sure I just lost her again.
"Girlfriend left me, mother won’t speak to me, I push everyone away, and I deserve to die.",Title says it all
"""If I say you're not depressed, then you aren't"" - person, who knows better apparently","I mean yeah it's definitely bs but still... it makes me question my disease every time... Hun, my doc says I am and your bs won't fix me... but okay. 
Or things like ""You have no reason to hate yourself"". Yeah well, tell that my fucking brain 🙄 
Just ranting a bit. Probably nothing new (sadly). "
No one cares.,So good bye
I wish I could be the man I am when I'm drunk.,"I can see how people get addicted to drugs and alcohol. I've drunk a lot tonight but I feel great, enough that I still know what's going on but not too much I won't remember it in the morning.

I wish I could be like this every day, I'm confident, I can talk openly without judgment. I don't have a care in the world.

I can see how easily it is to do this every day and honestly I'm contemplating it. I much prefer this version of myself and I hate that this isn't my regular state.

I'm sad that this isn't my regular persona, life would be so much better if I was drunk 24/7 but obviously, I know that this isn't practical. 

I don't even know why I'm writing this, hope you all have a good night. "
"When I spend time with people I love, I always seem to just get worse...","I spent a lot of time with my family recently and it has made me completely fed up with interacting with others. I dont want to tell anyone because then they ask me questions and it just makes everything harder. I am not looking for advice, I just want to see if anyone else feels like this... "
"Does anyone else just randomly say to themselves ""I'm gonna kill myself""?","I don't know what it is, but through out the day I'll just think of how much I hate myself and then tell myself ""I'm gonna kill myself"" I don't feel suicidal although I know I'm probably gonna kill myself later in life. "
Depressed after face surgery,"I am 20/m and had double jaw surgery to correct a bad crossbite. This was a little over a year ago and almost my whole chin is completely numb, including my bottom lip. They said that if I experienced any numbness a year after surgery, it would most likely be permanent. This effects me every day, from eating, to speaking, and even smiling. I feel so unlucky. I was already dealt a terrible hand in life and now I was unlucky enough for this shit to happen.

Soon enough, I am getting my deviated septum repaired because it is very broken and inhibits my breathing. I am honestly terrified of more of my face becoming permanently numb, or me losing my sense of smell. If this happens, I am probably going to go crazy or end my life because of how unlucky I am."
I just had the best day so why cant i just go home happy,"Ive had depression for going on 6 years now (I'm 19 for reference and I had a lot of family troubles at 13. I thought 2018 would be my last ever year on this earth untill I met my now girlfriend(21 y/o). She changed so much for me and really helped me get through new year's which was tough. Today I took her to meet my mum, step dad and 3 brothers (9,7,4 y/o) and it was great. We had a nice Sunday lunch and watched a film together and it was something I'd always wanted. But on the way home I now can't stop other thinking everything and I've ruined the day for myself. I won't be able to look back at this day as the perfect day and it's so frustrating. I just want to be able to be happy for one day so I can at least look back on it and remember a day of happiness. "
When someone leaves you on read.,"Me and this girl have been talking for a while. I'm not sure if I have feelings for her tbh. Anyways we were talking (I initiated the convo) and she seemed to be in a good mood it kinda made me happy that she was happy but after I asked how she was doing, she just left me on read. I figured that she at a party or something but she nevered responded back to even when it's been like a week and I'm like alright... whatever. Of course shes one of those girls that are like ""I'm always here for"" and all that nonsense even tho she always forgets about me. I nevered talked to her again but does anyone else feel heartbroken when someone left you on read and they just never responded back? Especially from quote on quote ""friend""?"
My Cousins Suicide,"First of all, My Cousin Was severely depressed he visited my grandads grave everyday Got kicked out of his own house and FaceTimed his ex all the time.

My Cousin Had been wanting to kill himself for a while( i believe)now and did it 12.08.18 He Attempted once before but failed( tryed to suffocate) but he went in to my aunts Kitchen got a knife and slit his wrists and bled out. By the time My aunts boyfriend had just walked in to find his body and dragged him into the garden trying to wake him up. "
Falling apart at the seams,"I was first diagnosed with depression when I was really young; 7 or 8. I had a pretty rough time in my teenage years and a bad experience with medication (Prozac seemed to do more harm than good). I think I was a lot better for most of my twenties, and then I had several people I was close to die, one after another. The grief, trauma and guilt snowballed and when my Dad died.....it’s like I’ve turned into a different person. I’ve always been sensitive and introverted, but now I just feel so much less able to handle things. I cry constantly. 
I’m almost thirty and own my home and run my own business. The problem is I’m almost 18 months into running the business and it’s not going well. I’m not doing well. I’m just losing money pretty much every month, and I feel like I have nothing to show for it.
I remember having a healthy lifestyle in the past. For a while there I was exercising, eating right, feeling great and looking good. But the stress and time commitments of the business have eaten away at me. I’ve gained back most of the weight I lost when I was healthy, and it makes me so uncomfortable and miserable in my own skin. Oh, and my skin. I tend to break out when I’m stressed and my skin looks terrible right now, it has for months. It hasn’t looked this bad since I was caring for my Dad during his illness. I have such bad anxiety and I obsess over things, I just can’t seem to put my feelings or negative thoughts aside. 
Worst of all, I know all the right things to do to help myself but I’m doing the wrong things instead. I’ve been binge eating and binge drinking. I usually work 6 days a week, often 12 hours (sometimes more like 14) and on my day off it’s a struggle to do the basics of maintaining my home. Even just doing my laundry or washing my hair. Sometimes I spend that whole day off drinking. I know I should stop, I’m just finding that really hard. I hate groups. 
Yesterday something really humiliating and awful happened to me at work, after a series of other mishaps that kept setting me back even further, when my sales are the lowest they’ve ever been. I had suspected something like this was going to happen and I had thought “if it does, I will kill myself”. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts for about a year now (terrified to tell my therapist because I can’t be hospitalized) and even once sat in my garage with the car running for a few minutes before talking myself out of it.
So the humiliating thing happened at work, when I was already so tired and worn down. And I thought, well maybe I will kill myself. And as I walked home I thought about how I could do it (don’t have a garage anymore). And then I thought “Well maybe I can just self harm”. I thought, maybe just a little and then I would go to sleep and maybe feel better in the morning. So I stopped at the gas station and bought cans of wine and I got home and took the last of my anxiety medication and chugged wine and cut myself, and reasoned that soon I would pass out and be unable to do anything worse. I thought about calling my therapist and saying I was in crisis, I thought about going to the hospital. But I really can’t be put in a hospital. I feel like it would just make my life that much worse when I got out. Not to mention adding more financial stress.
So yeah, I cut myself and I drank and smoked and passed out and woke up on the couch at 3 am and crawled into my bed. Now it’s my day off and I just laid in bed all morning. And now I’m on the couch. And I know I’d feel better if I cleaned up the kitchen and ran errands but it feels like so much. I just want to lie here. 
I have a doctors appointment on Wednesday and i’m going to ask about taking something daily for my anxiety and depression. But I’m anxious about that too.
I think I can keep going, I think I can get there. But some support from a community like this could really help. 

"
I'm a vain stupid piece of shit,"I can't stand the way I talk and interact with other people. I can't stand the way I look and how disgusting I am. I have this deeply rooted fear that my only actual value is how I look, and I'm not even good looking enough to be able to rely on that in any practical sense. I started drinking red wine cause I'm vain and I heard that in comparison to other types of alcohol it helps skin age better. I hate the taste, but I like numbing myself every day/night and I figured since I'm already an alcoholic piece of shit thats never going to change I might as well save the only thing about me that people care about. 

I'm pretty sure it's the only reason good things have happened to me in life, and the drunker and sadder I become, the lesser the likelihood is that people will put up with me and how annoying I am and how much bullshit I've got. When I'm old and the outside matches the inside, people are going to see me for who I really am, and I don't think I can handle that."
Help me please,"13 M (ik young age to be depressed or at least my parents say so ) i have had a happy life till around I was 8 where i started getting slightly sad, then every year more and more sad. I have a friend to cheer me up but my shit school separated us to ""make more friends"" which didn't help. I've been wanting to tell my parents but im afraid they will make fun of my,or say that im wrong.ove had some new friends but not any best friends, and i usually have suacidle thoughts, and i cant go to therapy cuz my parents wont allow, same thing with meds. Please help me

Edit:i didnt tell my parents but i think they will make fin of me or say that im wrong
Edit 2: i know they wont understand cuz a 30-year old co-worker they have has depression and they say that he's to young to have depression"
Yeah I just wanna die,"Yep everything just goes wrong, fuck up everything I do. Ending it all tonight. Or not cuz im too pathetic"
I really feel like i have no one,"This is gonna be a long post i just feel like venting about my life for once. 

My mom and me has never really gotten along since i was a teenager. I would live in my room and only come out to eat or go to the bathroom.
Been addicted to cannabis since age 13 or 14 and guess i used it as a way to relax and escape my family problems. That has brought its own issues in that i feel nothing and now im using it to just feel somethinh (not true but my feelings are numbed down alot).
My school life was always the loner and class clown. Never had more than 1 friend at a time if any, this Means as a now 22 year old i have no idea how to talk to people at all. It dont matter if its a guy while out smoking at work or if its a girl i wanna get to know, i honestly got nothing inyeresting to say to either of them.

I have been alone for 5 years now without friends or family i trust and i hate it everyday. I could cry everyday if I just let myself but i say that im strong and just ignore the feelings in videogames and weed, but today i couldnt hide it and went crying home after vising my mom.

I was sitting on the couch pretty much just staring into the air with no real talk going on, the i try to grab one of her cigs and she tell me off becouse its her last one wich i respect. Anyway this leads to her asking if i used my money for this month already and reply: yea pretty much.
She then procceds to go on a rant how i need to just stop smoking weed and be responsible with my money. nothing i havnt heard before, its the same Thing i been told my whole life and saying it for the 1000th time is not gonna change who i am or the feelings of nothing i have everyday I dont smoke. I finally just get enough and is about to cry becouse i think we will never unserstand eachother so i trew what ever i was fidging with in My hand and just left while crying half the way home.  

This is the first time i ever talked about any of this, most likley becouse its easier to do it online where i got all the time in the world to find the right words where as in real life i would most likley have many pause and akward moments where i got no response to easy questions that i would overthink until i got the perfect response.
I started this post with tears in My eyes but the more I wrote the less i cried and i feel a little better now. 
 Thanks for letting my vent 



"
Everything else ive tried failed.,"My life. Is in no means good. I was born to a single mother, white, and was on minimum wage. I spent near enough my whole primary school a victim of physical and verbal abuse. I found crying was a really good defense mechanism. So i kept it. Until secondary school. I had to learn life as i realised how emotionally unaware and socialy incapable i was. If you want proof of how nothing actually phased me that much. My grandma (one of the closest people i had) died and i was the only one in the family who did not feel upset or cried. It just felt inevidable. Because of this, any work id be given. It was easy. There was no challenge to it. Well, eventually. Im naturally an idiot. But somehow i adapted to learning on the spot. Became way too smart. Now im not talking, smart for school. I mean, smart as in i could manipulate my own and others brain with psychological tricks (yes i was fucking psychotic and insane, but i didnt realise). So secondary school comes, and i get reputation as one of the smartest in the school. But i had seriously no interest in education and it only furthered bullying. But at this point i was completely de-sensitised to hurtful comments. I tried some things cause there was the social part of life that i had yet to experience. Turns out, being weird and abnormally athletic was a decent option.

Now, onto. Why life sucks. And. Idk what to do anymore. Now every kid grows up with a best friend. I think. Mine changed. Alot. Why? Because every goddamn time they would leave. Some people stayd, but i never got as close as i did back then. This genuienely hurt as my only social identitiy kept being taken away over and over and over. Then came secondary school. Holy fuck. I had already thought i felt no attraction to other beings. Nope. Day 2. Develop a crush that would fuck my life up so much. I didnt think anything. Spent the first year. Just thinking about her and glancing at her every now and then. Next year it got worse. She dated my best friend at the time and i actually managed to force myself to stop liking her. But, she only dates him. For a day and a half. I also sat next to her in one of my lessons. Found we had similar interests. I still wasnt risking it knowing she would just leave even if i did succeed. Next year. Ok. At this point. I wanted to know her. So i began dropping subtle hints that wouldnt come into effect into later (all this coming up just to try to be a fucking friend im dumb af) Eventually, she didnt catch on. But my friend did. And i played it off by first playing along with it as a joke. Then i would ""actually start liking her"". And boom, now im friends. Next couple of months got close. Began to know alot about her. I fucked up big time with my efforts tho. I made in total 6 promises. Some of which wouldnt change much. But the others. Well. Fuck. I promised to: Not Lie for negative purpose (i have kept this surprisingly). Force a further relationship. Give up on her happiness. Now heres where i get fucked up. I promised not to change my personality again (too long a story). Not to self harm. And not to assisst in my own suicide or cause it. That last one in particular. The only thing i havent tried to fix myself is death. Hell sounds really fun right now.

Onto. My current life and where things went wrong. After 6 months. She leaves too. This one hurt, because i didnt get a reason. They didnt leave. They just cut me off. After every tear and every amount of money and every sweat drop and literally passing out from thinking about -her- problems. I didnt even get a reason. So problems. Im fully aware no matter how hard i try at this point. I wont get reward. In fact i might be punished. Im de moralised about everything. No matter what i try i fail to move on. Theres nothing i enjoy anymore. Its all boring. The last time i truly smiled with true happiness behind it was the day before i was cut off. I physically can no longer think straight, always thinking back to her. Overthinking causes me to hyperventilate now. Meanwhile, i seem to be able to predict how people will give me advice when i barely even touch any of the reasons i want everything to fuck off. When i say always thjnking bout her. I dont mean like, when you just cant stop thinking about her because you only remember the times you remember thinking about her. I literally mean, i cant stop. Used to be able to distract myself. Nope not anymore. Cus fuck me right. And my current 'friend' i want to get rid of cus he does nothing but makes me feel shit about things and blames my suffering on me when there im pretty sure this was the best outcome i couldve gotten.

Long story short. I have not motive to live no purpose, been like this for ages, and i cant even commit suicide cus for some fucking reason i dont hate her."
I thought we we're friends,"I'm feeling a mixture of emotions this weekend I believed I had made a friend. We've been talking best part of a year and now it's different. I don't know what happened. I'm worried to ask. It's bothering me so much though. 

I know it's pathetic crying over and even more pathetic trying to write a post about it I really don't know what to do. "
Anyone else numb to love?,"I've been in a great relationship for 10 months now. He's a really sweet guy and I know he loves me unconditionally. Around the time we got  together, my depression was kinda going away. But its been slowly coming back as the relationship went on. I loved him so much at the beginning but now I feel nothing. I'm sick of living in this lie but I know he'd be heartbroken if I told him that I don't love him anymore. Honestly, I don't know why I can't love him. I used to love him so much and he's been nothing but good to me. I don't love anyone now. I hate this."
Anyone else having a hard time living “in the moment” ?,"I woke up, played games, went for a walk and that was it. Now it’s 10pm and it’s bed time, work tomorrow. Where did my day go?

99% of u guys will say the game hijacked my day. It’s probably true too, but I don’t even enjoy the game, but I play it anyway. Cause it’s better then laying in bed doing nothing for the entire day. Playing games means I have to use my brain and do something, and focus.

It’s also easy to feel guilty when playing games when ur irl life is horrible. No friends, part time job, no hobbies, no plans for the future. I have an urge to do something with my life, to fix to make friends, get a real job. But I have no idea at all what to do. Legit 0 clue. I been struggling with this for like a year and a half now. I live in nowhere. My biggest hope is that I match with a guy on tinder (I’m gay), and he “saves me” which is an awful way of thinking about it. Cause u shouldn’t relay on someone else to save me, that sounds unhealthy. But there’s legit no other way. If there is I don’t see it."
become the doll of flesh-shattering an innate framework,"i've always wondered if i could stand removing everything i like from myself to make myself go blank, to be human yet without desire. think about it, construction drones are basically slaves but they don't care because they're incapable of desiring anything, desire is the very foundation of the human mind. even if one is selfless, they still have the desire to remain that way, so if desire is removed then suddenly nothing is bad. its also likely that if people were raised not to mind pain, then they wouldn't mind pain. i sometimes want to indulge the worst emotions, like fear, rejection, loneliness, and see how it all turns out. obviously im the only test subject i have. maybe one could call this concept ""mental masochism"", my mother seems to hate me for that though, and i understand why"
"Does anyone else think about their life getting better at a certain age, but once you reach that age it never turned out to be what you expected?","When I was 18 the only thing that help me cope with my depression was  constantly thinking about my future self. Thinking about how happy he would be, more confident he would become,  a clearer picture with what he wants to do with his life career-wise. I set out to accomplish those things that a yearned for in my head. I made progress but it was never enough to be satisfied. Once I actually reached this age of when I thought my life would improve it turned out I was all wrong. 

My image of the future me was shattered. No matter how much progress I made it wasn’t enough to satisfy me and I realized that. No amount of hard work and trying to improve will get you to the levels of happiness you think of for yourself. It will never happen. At least it didn’t for me. Maybe it’s the way I view life, but why even try anymore when I know I’m just going to end up disappointed in the end.

The only coping mechanism I had to deal with depression, looking forward to the future, finally left me. If I don’t have the things I look for in me already I never had them to begin with."
I can't stop worrying,"I'm so afraid of being alone. I have a boyfriend rn, but I'm always worried that he's sick and tired of me asking for reassurance all the time and that he'll leave me. I try and remind myself that these are just thoughts, and to try my best not to push him away like that, but I just feel so scared that he'll break up with me because of all this shit. He knows about my depression and he's been really good about supporting me I guess, but everyone has a point where it just gets too annoying and they ditch. 

I get it though, I used to talk to this guy who would always be like ""do you still like me?"" and stuff and it was really annoying, if I'm going to be honest. I don't want to become like that, but idk how :(

thanks for listening to my rant, lol."
Depression due to shame of sexuality / kinks - anyone else...?,"After a very, very long time, I have figured out what makes me depressed. I hate my sexuality. Well, not true. I don't hate it, I just feel ashamed of it to the point where it seriously troubles me. It doesn't matter what it is that I have, all that matters is that I feel shitty about it. I feel I shouldn't have it because it's wrong. But I also feel that in rare moments when I embrace it mentally, not even acting upon it, my depression lifts as if I were never depressed. It's probably just society and what it tells us is acceptable or not. Dammit. 

&#x200B;

I wonder if this is worth it, if my idea of what I should feel or be like is worth being so unhappy and crushed. I don't want to talk with a therapist about it, simply because I don't think that would help, I believe it is innate and not acquired, I have always been like this. I wish to add that it is not a kink that would harm anyone if I ever acted upon it, or be dangerous or a crime. Nothing that would actually be a danger to others. 

&#x200B;

Anyone else feeling depressed because of their sexual identity..? Anyone who has had that feeling, but maybe overcome it...?"
My parents told my aunts and uncles about my anxiety,"I haven't been to school for a while and haven't really shown op to any family gatherings. I am having a ton of problems in my life due to depression and anxiety. But not that long ago I found out that my parents told some of my family members about why I don't show op to their party's. My parents didn't tell me that they where going to be so open about the problems I have. I just don't like thinking that if some of my aunts and uncles come home one day they will act different around me knowing I have some anxiety issues and that I haven't been to school for a while. Should I be annoyed that my parents told some of my family members about it without telling me first?

&#x200B;

(sorry if my english wasn't the best)"
I don't know how to talk about how I feel.,"I've been in a hole for around 6-7 years now (recently turned 23) and I've never really talked to anyone about it, choosing instead to just put on a happy face and ignore it.

The last month or so has been a particularly bad patch for me and I've realised that I can't pretend that I'm okay anymore and that I can't keep going on if it's going to be like this.

I will often spend hours thinking over in my head about what I would like to say to explain my situation but when it comes time to do it I start doubting how I'm feeling, like the reasons for feeling like I do are stupid, or I forget about how to articulate them like I had been in my head for the past few hours and don't know how to explain them, so I don't say anything. Even as I'm writing this I feel like I couldn't explain it, even though just an hour ago I felt like I had everything that I wanted to say together. Part of this I'm sure I can attribute to being a little socially awkward in terms of being incredibly nervous talking to people and lacking any real connections with people because of that.

As much as I want to talk about it, I also really don't. I don't want to be potentially bringing other people down, or making them feel like they have some moral obligation to help me when they have their own lives to live and their own issues to deal with and that keeps me from reaching out to friends because I don't feel like my issues are important enough to potentially be a burden on them.

I often just wish the people I consider friends (sort of) would reach out to ask if I'm okay, because in a way that would at least make it seem like they care and want to help rather than me trying to force my problems on them which I do not want to do.
 
"
Helpless,"Yesterday I thought I was going to have lunch with this cute co worker of mine as a regular date... little did I know that yesterday was the most difficult day I’ve ever had to deal with.

Long story short I learned about her family history, she was literally being locked away by an abusive dad and step mother for most of her high school years, dealt with serious mental issues resulting in the admission to a mental health institution, dealing with sexual harassment in multiple work places. And finally the thing that frustrates me the most...

She’s in a relationship with an emotionally abusive guy who has made her believe she is the one failing their “relationship” and I’m just so frustrated and angry at this guy for treating her this way...

Anyways I tried reminding her she doesn’t have to be “better” for this horrible guy but because of her mental state my words don’t go through... After we hung out I couldn’t sleep for the rest of the night, sure I was just a friend/co-worker of hers but... she shouldn’t have to feel this way. Its so messed up when I asked her why she sectioned off half of her food and she told me “I was never really allowed to eat dinner, so I feel like I’m not allowed to eat this much” EVEN THOUGH SHE BOUGHT THE FOOD HERSELF... That literally broke me but I can’t do anything but support her

And on top of that I have to figure out a place to live where I can still work and be there for her and I’m fighting my inner demons of jealously and selfishness of wanting to be with her even though I have to get her out of this bad relationship...I-I couldn’t stop thinking about how she thought she wasn’t allowed to have all of the food she bought... Why... Why are people so messed up, like she is an amazingly beautiful and kind person but she has to deal with ptsd and emotional distress. Why does this ever happen...?"
Nothing is worth the hassle,"I hate this so much. I’ve gotten to the point where I rarely get sad anymore beyond the constant feeling of hopelessness and despair. Everything just feels so bitter and pointless. I cant find any reason to DO anything anymore. When I find myself unable to get out of bed and wanting to curl up and cry, I used to force myself to get out because I didnt want my dad to get pissed at me for not getting up. Now, I DONT get out of bed. I would rather get yelled at by my dad and face the consequences, than have to get out of bed. Because I DONT CARE ANYMORE. Its awful. I hate it. I feel like nothing in life is worth the hassle anymore. Theres no reason to do anything worthwhile. 

Ive realized that I cant even see myself being at a place of success in life, or holding responsibilities. I already cant handle having any responsibilities, im so bad at everything. I just want to kill myself, but even that is too much of a hassle. Anything I do in life that goes beyond doing nothing, isnt worth it. All it will bring is more stress, anxiety, self hatred, criticism, pain, and failure. I hate that im seen as a shitbag loser now. But its better than seeing a shitbag loser look like an idiot and try to do shit that he cant do and fucking fail at it. "
I don’t understand how people can just wake up and not care about you anymore,"Just don’t get it - some people flip a switch in their brain and suddenly want nothing to do with you after saying they love you. Today’s been rough, I was able to take a bath and write a little so that was good though. "
I've got a lot on my mind.,"I've never really considered myself as someone that suffers with depression however, over the last few days I've been sadder than i have ever been in my life and I honestly can't pin point exactly why.  I've faced an ultimatum between relationships recently but I'm not exactly sure why i'd be feeling sad about it because I haven't made up my mind yet.   I guess I've just been thinking about shit over the past week."
"Am I depressed, or have I just become lazy?","Throwaway account.

I’m 16, 17 in 12 days. I’ve been doing pretty bad lately. My grades have fallen from As and Bs to mostly Ds and Cs. I haven’t done any of my laundry since the year began, because I just don’t feel like I have the energy to.

I used to draw a lot, but I rarely do that anymore either. I haven’t even showered for a week. I feel like everybody would probably be happier if I was gone at this point, since I’m not helping anything in any way. I think I might have depression, but I also think it might just be me being lazy. I’ve tried to mention it casually to my mom before, but she usually asks me if I have depression in a condescending way, like: “oh, do we have to take you to the doctor and get you on happy pills? Is that it?” and it really makes me doubt if I’m depressed. 

I’m afraid to ask to see a doctor, because if I don’t have depression it’ll just make my mom upset and make her think I’m making excuses for just being lazy. 

My birthday is coming up soon, but I’m not looking forward to it at all. I don’t feel like I deserve having a birthday at this point, because I feel like I’m just a lazy person who helps nothing.

Do I have depression, or am I just really lazy?

"
Anyone else feel this way?,"Hello again. 
So, I've been meaning to really ask about something else- I'm not really sure what it means.
I just feel... guilty. For everything. For breathing, for eating, etc
Even for going to the therapist, yknow? Someone else could get that help, someone who needs it more.. those thoughts just cloud up my mind sometimes..
I feel like a parasite, as stupid as it sounds
I can't explain why. I have wonderful friends who help me out and have helped me through the darkest moments of my life, but I still can't shake that feeling of constant guilt or dread.
Will it ever go away?"
So what the hell are you supposed to do if you can't afford antidepressants?,I can't fight the depression and anxiety anymore. You might as well super glue cinder blocks to my feet and tell me to climb Mount Everest. The only option I see is suicide. 
My friends past haunts her..,"Hello, my friend is having trouble getting away from her past, she’s a very good person and she be laughing and giggling in the outside world. But In the inside she has been isolating her thoughts. She tells me her past haunts her and she isn’t willing to tell me nor her parents. https://imgur.com/a/XwAHdTA/ here’s some screenshots of my convo and hers. I tried to talk to her to see someone or talk to her parents. But she can’t, so I turn to reddit to help me to comfort Her."
Am I the only one that actually DOESN'T want to get better?,"I feel like such a faker because of this.

I don't want to get help. I don't want to feel better. I don't want to stop cutting.

I want to be miserable for the rest of my life.
"
ever wonder what it's like to wake up in hell?,it isn't good. trust me. i do it everyday.
When most people say that something 'made their day' or similar.....how?,"i'm sure they're exaggerating to some extent, but when i see a cute picture on /r/aww or something, i feel little to nothing. i agree that it's cute but it doesn't actually affect anything; i'll have forgotten in 5 seconds or less"
"My story, from the cliff edge to just holding on","*The below is a massive wall of text, taken from something I wrote about 2 years ago, which was 2 years after I attempted suicide. This post is not a love story for depression, nor me giving any recommendations, for anything. It's just a long, rambling note I wrote one night about my experience. I understand most won't read it, but if you do I hope you can take something away from it.*  

  
  
  



> In many cases, suicide is used as a long-term solution to a short-term problem. That’s the phrase they use on suicide prevention hotlines, online message board posts, and it’s even the way some mental health professionals phrase it.
> 
> It’s often said by someone who takes it for granted, who sees it as just such an obvious point that no-one would disagree with the statement. And I would imagine it could be used effectively, perhaps especially with the type of suicidal person who wants to end their life because of some recent traumatic event.

> 
> To me, life is a long slog. It’s a grey chore. It’s years upon years of unhappiness, regret, disappointment. It takes real work and determination to get through it. And for all this perseverance and hard work, after decades of drabness and pain, we come to our final destination and our reward: death.
> 
> Death is our prize, our medal for finishing the tragedy of life. To me, this makes life simply not worth living.
> If there were some great goal for us to work toward, as some religions tell us, then I can see myself viewing life as just a test, some great pile of papers to get through knowing that if I do, I’ll be rewarded with something worth the work.

> 
> Some people will say that the good parts of life; the joy and laughter that punctuate the grey, are worth experiencing. And that may be true, but then the question becomes is life more joy or more misery? If your answer is that life is comprised of more misery than it is joy, then I see suicide as a viable solution to that problem. If I’m going to die anyway, and the remained of my life until that death will be miserable, why not bring forward the end?
> 
> The only issue is that you don’t know the result of this morbid equation until you’ve reached the end of your life. But I feel as though extrapolation can work for me here. If I’ve lived an estimated one third of my life already, and in that third I have experienced more negative than positive, I would see it logical to extrapolate that the next two thirds of my life will follow the same pattern.
> 
> Of course, huge turnarounds and surprise changes do happen in people’s lives. You meet the person you’ve been searching for, you witness the birth of your child, you get the dream job you’ve always aspired for but never thought you’d achieve. But there’s always the chance that these things won’t happen, and even if they do, will they tip your balance towards positive?

> 
> If I was going to do it, I wanted to make sure the job would get done. I didn’t want to survive and end up institutionalised or kept on watch so that I couldn’t finish the job later. I also didn’t like the idea of someone, most likely a family member or friend, discovering my body. These criteria left few options. I considered either jumping in front of a train, or laying my head on train tracks. However, although this would almost definitely result in my death, there would be a train driver who would perhaps feel somehow responsible, and at the very least would witness something horrific.
> 
> I therefore considered jumping from a tall building at night when nobody was around to witness. However, this would create a huge amount of mess and that mess would need to be cleaned up, again by someone who didn’t ask for it and may again be affected by what I’d done in an immediate way.

> Once I had booked the train tickets and hotel room for the night before, it really began to grow in my mind that this was going to happen. That, unbeknownst to those around me at work and at home, this would be the last time they’d see me. My goodbyes on my last day at work were not abnormal enough to cause any investigation, but to me I was saying my final goodbye.
> 
> I travelled by train to the nearest town to the cliff, and found myself whistling on the way. Such a banal thing to do, but it made me realise that I was the happiest I’d been in a long time. This was it, I was finally on my way to the end. The finish line was in sight.
> 
> When I reached the cliff, it was daytime and there were tourists and other visitors. Not many, perhaps ten or twenty people in total. But this number included children, and my bid to prevent a traumatic scene would not be possible for now. I headed into the small pub nearby, but I didn’t drink. I heard later that most people who came to this place to commit suicide entered this pub, and they drank heavily – perhaps to give them the courage to do what they had come all this way to do.
> 
> I decided not to, because I wanted to do this with a clear head. Knowing my luck, I would have a few too many, get to the edge, have a sudden change of heart and then end up drunkenly stumbling off the cliff anyway. So I drank only soft drinks, and kept an eye on the cliff through the window, waiting for the tourists to leave and the sun to set.
> 
> Once it was dark, and I knew that the tide would have gone out – which allowed a greater chance of my immediate death – I headed out the door and onto the windy clifftop. As I learned later but did not realise at the time, the staff of this pub had been specially trained to identify the signs of a suicidal person. And they had a plan of action when they thought that a patron of their pub was planning something morbid – they contacted the local priest.
> 
> This priest was not based far away; in fact, he had a small house on the clifftop itself. He, and a few others like him, had dedicated themselves to volunteering their time to keep a watchful eye over this suicide hotspot. As explained to me later, they have a strict set of rules they abide by when attempting to persuade someone not to do it. They won’t mention religion or god in any way, and they won’t physically stop someone from jumping.
> 
> I was at the top of the cliff. It was pitch black and the only light was that of the moon and stars. It was a very windy night, and I was waiting there for one reason. I hadn’t told anyone, of course, what I was doing that day; but I couldn’t leave this life without saying goodbye to those that matter to me, and making sure they knew that I loved them. But I hadn’t written a suicide note, and anything I had on me when I went down would be washed away by the sea. So I was waiting to send a pre-written draft text to my mum – but I didn’t have a signal.
> 
> I was ready to die. There were no doubts in my mind, no cold feet. All I needed to do was send this text and then I’d be set for oblivion. But before my phone could connect to the network, the priest found me. He called out from behind, and it shocked me so much that I stepped away from the edge. With a move I’m sure he has used before (and as I later learned, he has used to save many lives),  he inserted himself between the cliffedge and myself.

> Now this presented a problem. I was there to die, but to do so I’d have to get through this priest. I couldn’t risk taking him over the edge with me, however, so I was forced to stay put and listen to him. And as he asked me simple questions, I found myself sobbing. I admitted why I was there and what I was planning to do. He asked if I’d like to follow him to his house, where he had tea and cake waiting.

In those darkest moments, those nights where I let it all go and decide this is it, the final straw, now I’ll die – just wait, and hold on. And it works. Like a passing storm, the winds die down and the feeling subsides.

Anti depressants worth it or not?,I'm honestly running out of options so idk what else I can do besides chemically alter my state of mind
I can’t do this anymore,"My health is such shit. I’m undiagnosed in almost everything. 
Some days seem impossible. I don’t understand why I was born ready to self-destruct. I don’t understand why my most comfortable position still hurts like absolute hell. I don’t understand why I have no energy, why I can’t stop eating without my mind screaming, why my abdomen is constantly being stabbed, why I feel like this.

Honestly, I think I’d rather go to hell. 
Can’t be much worse than this."
I'm so sick of cycling through this,"Not sure if I have only depression but I can definitely have my extremely low moments where nothing matters and I hate everything. But then for no apparent reason I'll come out the other side feeling on top of the world. But then just like it came. I'll slide right back down into the pit. I can feel it happening right now. I go to the gym 4 times a week. Take my supplements religiously. Count my macros and nutrients. Go to work. Attempt to invest in my hobbies but no matter what I do, it always creeps back up on me. Then all of a sudden I just want to sleep all day and sit in the bath and compare myself to what everyone else is doing and feel horrible and exhausted and that everyone hates me. I don't know what to do anymore. I can't seem to stop this no matter what I do. "
I'm exhausted,"I feel like I'm constantly trying to bring myself to the top of an escalator going the opposite direction. I never make progress, and every time I slip up I just end up setting myself back. I'm starting to think I don't really want to get to the top, maybe I should just let myself go down. "
hecc me life.,i feel like committing scooter ankle should i do it? my momma will be sad tho so :/
"Even though I am with the girl of my dreams, I can't find happiness","I'm in a relationship with a girl I know I want to spend my life with. I see Her on weekly basis, 'cause we' re living in diffrent cities. We're together for 1,5 years, but I can't even remember when whas the last time we kissed. I feel, like I would be a tool, like someone, that comes once a week Just to talk a bit and watch something on the internet, nothing more.

We used to live without being able to stop thinking about each other, but now I feel like I would need to wear a mask every Time I speak to Her. She's still very nice to me and tells that She loves me, but I can feel our relation is getting colder, and every time I try to talk about it, she cuts me off saying ""stop being so negative"". 

My friend once told me to Just let her go, but I don't want to lose Her. I'm too affraid of being alone, and after a couple of earlier relationships I know She's the One. I don't know what to do anymore. Once She was the reason I didn't kill myself, and now almost every memory of Her is bringing me only pain. "
Can depression ruin a relationship?,"Things have been going very downhill latley and I have hit my lowest point. My girlfriend have been drifting away from me too. It’s harder to talk to her and be around her than ever before. We have been together for a year and I love beeing with her, but latley I’ve just wanted to be alone and play videogames. She used to be the only thing on my mind all day long, but now I nearly never think about her.

I forced myself to go visit her today and I feel like things got a little bit easier, but not as good as I want it to be. Will things become better when my depression starts to fade, or have I become a bad boyfriend?"
dae,"do you just sometimes just . just sit there and hardly breathe at all , shallow breaths as fuck . no drinking no eating . no moving . nothing . everything to do feels like the weight of the world on your shoulders . i don't even want to breathe properly i feel so weak or scared . or i don't know how to describe it . i don't want to leave my room to go to the bathroom and i'm a girl so i'm just holding it . i isolate from everybody because i feel like a burden to those i actually enjoy and to those i don't , i keep my distance from them . and when i come out of my room they try to talk to me and i don't want anything to do with them . so i stay isolated . i had a toxic ex and lost all of my friends . i'm just completely alone . i keep breaking out and i keep binge smoking weed or drinking alcohol . i'm 23 i just feel like i've wasted all of my life . yeah there's more to come but these are like my years of youth . ............................. it will never be the same"
"I thought I beat depression, but it just hit me like a train..........","I have battled depression for 8 years now. Previous sexual abuse, mentally, physically, and emotionally abusive relationship. Family problems. It just feels like it’s always been one thing after another. 
A year ago I thought I had beat it. I went through the worst rut of my life, crying on the bathroom floor for hours, begging a higher power to help me leave the toxic relationship I was in (we were living together). Having to kick out your boyfriend is one of the hardest and scariest things you can do. I knew that but I was so miserable everyday. Not leaving the bed, not eating, in nursing school but running on two hours of sleep. Having to wake up next to someone I absolutely hated but had been with for years so it felt impossible to leave.  After that  night I woke up and kicked him out. I moved to a different city, switched majors because I was solely doing nursing to be able to live closer to him. I was finally happier than I had ever been. But that was temporary because my happiness always is. 

When you aren’t happy with yourself, you tend to find other things to try to fill that void. Mine has always been relying on another person and I know that’s a terrible trait but it’s what I do. So another guy comes into my life during this time and I fall so hard. He is everything I had wanted but........he was a drug addict, I just didn’t know the degree to which he was. 

That didn’t work out well. A mess of drugs, depression, previous heartbreaks, and sex. It was bound to end and it did. Now this year we rekindled. He got clean, moved, started a new life and we finally started working. 

Friday we ended. He told me that we were too far gone. This same man that days before told me he could never get married unless it’s me, is now telling me he can’t deal with baggage I come with. (I had a bad assault happen to me that he knew abt that I am still recovering from) he knew and he decided months in that now he can’t take it. It’s devastating sharing your secrets and fears with someone and then using it against you. He told me I was a massive reason for his addiction. Telling me that im making them miserable bc everyday for me is not sunshine and rainbows.So now for two days I’ve been blaming myself. If I didn’t have the baggage I do then I would not have this problem and we would have been fine. Questioning if I caused his addiction. Or if I am always the problem in a relationship. I am miserable. I feel like I’m on the verge of a heart attack. Reddit seems to be my safe haven right now to say what I feel "
Wearing Masks,"I know this might be a stupid reason to feel sad compared to all the real problems that people seem to be having, but I really, really hate my face. I got rid of my mirror because I couldn't stand looking at my face anymore, and well, I just wanted to know if it's legal to wear masks in public, and if it isn't, I would appreciate some tips on how to cover my face in public. Sorry about wasting your time with this bullshit, but this is really making me uncomfortable cause I feel like everyone keeps staring at my face for some reason. Maybe I'm paranoid, I don't even know anymore. Also, sorry about my english, It's not my native language."
Hi,"Hello there, I'm quite unsure about posting anything on this theme, seeing that I'm not actually diagnosed with depression, but it's not like I've went to any kind of psychiatrist. So this is just a heads up, if you think it's not appropriate, I'll delete it.

So yeah... I find it weird that I'm constantly sad, given the fact that my mom is a psychologist, and I'm not that bad off in life... Like, I've found a career I like, which I'm working towards now,  and all that... (17m, btw)

Long story short, I was an outcast from 5th to 8th grade, I managed to make a few friends at highschool but I always feel alone. People know me, and I'm amazed by how many people I can gather, but in the end I feel like nobody really cares about me. Most times people don't even notice my absence... Let alone presence.

I've given up on feelings for the most part, at least feelings caused by other people. I don't really trust anyone, but I don't distrust them either. 
I come home every day to an empty house and I can't comprehend how I spend nearly 6 hours doing nothing. Some days I'll go to some event or concert I have some work at, but for the rest...? I've realized I don't enjoy concerts as much as I used to, not if I'm part of the audience at least. For the last dozen concerts, paid or not, I've want, sat through a few of the bands, and at some point realised I don't enjoy any of it and went home, or, wandering around the town, aimlessly in the night for a few hours, until the concert supposedly ended, then went home.

I constantly lose myself in thoughts, thinking of past experiences, relationships, trying to relive those days, those months. I hate it most times but I still do it.

I try to write songs, or stories, or draw, but every time I stop mid track and scrap everything. I don't feel like I used to, I don't enjoy doing it, it all sounds and looks like shit.

I wake up every weekday, go to high, spend a good 5-7hrs doing fuck all, talking to people whose names I can't even remember, wondering how could I strike up a conversation with one person or other that seemed interesting, then go home, spend the average 5-6 hrs doing fuck all, then go to a particular bar nearly every single day and just grab a spot and start reading for hours on end, drinking a beer or two, wishing someone I know would enter that door so I could have someone to talk to. Then I go home, lie to my parents saying I've met with one friend or another, and go to sleep. Repeat.
"
Weekends are the roughest part of my weeks. (M 19),"TLDR: I feel weak and have trouble breathing on weekends, and I think it's related to my depression. Has anyone dealt with this and what helped? 

During the week, I'm usually productive despite feeling drained and stressed. On weekends however, I feel like I can barely move. I go from being lively and active on Friday to feeling like I'm tied to my bed, and when I do get up I feel like I have to support myself on railings and walls. My chest also feels really heavy and breathing is difficult. I've even had some chest pain in the upper right quadrant. I used to think that it was related to how busy I was, and I thought if I could distract myself it'd be easier. That's not the case though, it hit me last weekend while I was at a conference and this Friday night while I was on a date. So it also seems to be somewhat independent of how socially active I've been. I've started dating someone and she makes it a little better (especially during the week), but even she doesn't help much with this and I think meeting her is the best thing that's happened to me in years. My parents think it might be related to anxiety, but anxiety hasn't been a major concern of my counselor. I just want this to stop because I have too much to do on weekends and they're really my only free times. I don't want to waste them feeling like I can't move or breathe. I'm meeting with my counselor tomorrow, and I think I might try and get some prescription meds because I don't know what else to do. If anyone has dealt with something similar I'd appreciate any advice. "
He needs to know that people care.,"Recently one of my close friends revealed to me that since January he started cutting himself, and was thinking about suicide, Im trying to talk him through it and help in whatever way I can, but this is very new to me, and I’m not sure exactly how to go about it. One thing I do know, is that he needs to see how many people care, he needs to know, that ending his life won’t help, and that people CARE, his life isn’t his alone, he needs people to guide him through this tough time. If everyone could leave kind and thoughtful messages to help, that would be much appreciated."
Mind jumping back to previous states/mindsets in time. Sign of regression?,"Not sure if this is the best sub to post this, but I think my depression is highly correlated to it.

Past few years I’ve occasionally felt like my brain jumps back in time to different mindsets/states/personalities that I’ve had at different points in my life. I’m wondering if it’s some sort of self-protective mechanism to escape my present reality. This seems to provide some comfort pretending as if I still have lots of friends and plenty of opportunities (versus the numerous failures that have accumulated last few years) but it also makes me get messed up with the cognitive dissonance when I realize how much things have changed and how so many people I used to be good friends with have moved on. I’m hoping this is just temporary as I need to face my present problems to start making positive change.

Is this a sign of mental regression? Does anyone else have this issue? "
Why,I want to kill myself. I constantly think about it. I hate everything about myself. The zoloft isn't helping. I think my wife hates me. Everything I do annoys her. We don't even sleep in the same bed anymore and she spares no affection torwards me. Everytime I look over she is talking to someone else (part of her secind job) but she can't even message me back on fb. I am an asshole to my kids for no reason. They are better off without me. 
"I can’t tell anyone what’s “wrong” with me anymore. And it’s not even because I don’t want to. It’s because every time I do, that person I tell finds a way to invalidate everything i say and make feel even worse then I already do for complaining about it.",
How not to comfort a person with depression,"""I used to be depressed years ago, but I worked passed it...""
Like I appreciate the intention, but it makes me feel even more worse. The difference between you and I is you got out of yours before it fully manifested into an illness, and I didn't. I wish people would get that."
What was your moment of realisation?,"I had mine 4 months ago when I realised I was bored with my friends, family and even my dog. It was my day off and the weather was great that day and I remember getting up early just so I wouldn't have to sit down with my family and eat breakfast with them, later that same day I took my dog for a walk and half way through I realised I had no energy to play with her and to take her to the park so I got her back home after 20 minutes because I once again wanted to be alone.

We all have that ""I guess this confirms it"" moment, what was yours and how did you cope?"
I just want to be happy.,Just once. I’m tired of being miserable all the time.
Another layer of low.,"I’m in a really dark place. Long story short I have a job which I realized I have an unhealthy attachment with. I’ve been there almost a year and I took so long to get comfortable there. The environment is very toxic and mentally unhealthy for everyone involved. Ive lost 40 pounds due to stress,don’t sleep for days on end and am in a continuous state of anxiety. I’ve applied to a dozen new jobs but I am sitting her crying everyday scared of any new beginning. I think of dying almost everyday(don’t have a plan) and question my entire life. Even when I do leave this job I don’t think I will be able to overcome to emotional trauma from the last job. I can’t take this. "
It is all night. There is no dawn.,"I'm slipping into an abyss. My relationship with my wife is destroyed. She is threatening to take my son and leave and ""find him a new daddy"". My work life is shit. Its a high stake workplace and the immense stress of it all is aging me dramatically. Credit for every professional accomplishment I've made has been stolen from me. My health is poor due to long term illness and serious physical trama in a serious car accident a few years ago. I'm in my 30s but I physically feel like I'm 50. I have no friends within several hundred miles of where I live. I hate everyone anyway. I feel like I'm biding my time until death takes me.

I dont know how this is going to ever get any better. I've been experiencing increasingly dark thoughts over the past few months. I'm starting to scare myself. At night sometimes I see shadows move as if something is closing in on me.

Ive been in therapy for years. Nothing helps. Ive tried every drug, every therapy ""method"". Ive even commuted myself before, but those ""it will get better"" professionals are full of shit. QThe world keeps getting darker.

I dont know what I'm looking for here. This post won't change anything."
I'm completely relapsing and it sucks,"I dont care if anyone reads this I just need to get it out. Ive been on 40mg of prozac for a couple of months now and I had been starting to make some real progress. I wasnt spending all day in bed anymore, I was looking after myself and eating really healthily (lost loads of depression weight), I was going to start volunteering, helping out in the community and I felt like I could single handedly take on the world. My grandads dying of leukaemia, my boyfriends father is also dying from cancer. Ive known this for about a month but just saw my grandad yesterday and realised I dont want to do this. I so badly do not want to go through this, the biggest way to get out of it is to kill myself.

So tonight I almost implusively killed myself. I was eithet going to drown myself in the bath or slit my wrists and get in the bath. Boyfriend called me and I just absolutely broke down. I dont want to watch people I love die, and i really dont want to go through any more pain, even if its something everyone has to deal with. Tonight was the first time I got really selfish and didnt care about who it would hurt, despite everything thats happening at the moment. I just wanted no more pain and suffering. I can see positives in almost everything, even at my worst with my depression, ive always found some sort of silver lining. There is no silver lining when an otherwise healthy man is dying from cancer. And this has all made me realise I dont want to watch any of my loved ones die. It's illogical to kill yourself so you dont see anyone else die, but honestly its all I can think about. I'm making an emergency appointment with my doctor tomorrow and hopefully I can get some help. 

I was doing so fucking well, I had even starting telling people life was a precious gift and I actually wanted to go into a career helping others with mental health. And now here I am. I don't want there to be a tomorrow, but here i am trying for what feels like the 1000th time."
Things have gotten worse,"I’m a 19-year-old male who has hated pretty much everything since I was 11.

Summary of the past 2 weeks:
- I found a porn poster and have been quite addicted to watching it on online.
- I cut myself for the first time on my hand.
- I have started a new trend in which I continue to tie and untie a rope.

I have fucked up yet again right? Another question, will parents always love me even if I’m an asshole?"
im 18 but i feel 80,"like anyone feel like this? its so fucking bad, i have no energy for nothing and i lack motivation to do anything it sucks."
In need of an ear?,Just wondered if anyone else was in need of someone to talk to? I have supportive friends and parents but struggle to open up about how I feel to people that know me well
Hopelessness," Just needed to share something in a tough time, hope that’s okay. 

I’m very worried about my future as I feel behind in education and work. University has been quite a struggle and it doesn’t seem to be benefiting me that much. My health is also not that good because of stress and insomnia. My eating pattern is becoming irregular and unhealthy from fatigue. 

My mind is often completely jammed with anxious thoughts. This makes it difficult to focus or sleep. Honestly, I am feeling more and more hopeless with each day. I’m confused about which field I should focus my career on, so it is difficult to move ahead with practical things such as internships if I don’t even know where to aim. It feels horrible knowing that I might letting down family or my teachers. Aimlessness is making me procrastinate a lot. 

At almost 21, I should be getting my life in order, but it’s not happening even though I have put in effort. It’s as if all the hard work was for nothing. If I continue like this I might lose my friends, my savings and prospects of a good job. I’ve self-harmed in the past. I also thought about suicide a lot out of desperation. Isolation from other people has been quite painful as well. Perhaps I have a mental disability or a low IQ, I don’t know. I just wish this nightmare of a life would end. "
I feel so alone.,"I have been told that I  seem very intimidating, cold and too formal. Contrary to that, I absolutely yearn for human interaction in my heart but am somehow labelled as above. This has made me question whether I can even be loved or not. I am ostracized and honestly feel very depressed about this. I just wanted someone to understand to me."
I don't even know,"I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety three years ago I believe. I take 20 mg of estacilopram, 1g of xanax, and 50 mg of amitriptyline every night. I'm 32. 

Because of different reasons I live with my parents but in a room separated from the house. 
About a year ago I was forced to resign from where I worked because I finally learned how to speak for myself and do what is right without doubting. I got a partial job in a University as an English teacher, and recently got a steady job at an English academy. Yet I'm not ok.

Every day is a struggle to get up, there are good days and bad days, days I manage to look in the mirror and put lipstick on and dress a little nice, and days I just can't even handle to speak. For those days pregabalin does the charm.

Still I come home and go toy other job, when I feel extra bad I cancel. Everytime I talk to someone it's like my life is being siphoned out of me. I just collapse in bed for hours and eat junk to feel better. I used to play video games but now I can't find the strength to even do that. Just watch YouTube compilations, and I manage to push the stupid mon-feeling away.

I manage to dissociate myself and that brings me solace, helps see everything differently, but I can't do that for long. 

I'm having issues and no one in my family understands, they think I'm alright because I'm good and faking I'm ok. 

My mom also has depression. Anxiety  and fibromyalgia. Yet her depression and anxiety seems more high because she just explodes and tells her feelings. Since I was a child I learned to just bury things down. That's the difference. I might look ok but I'm not. I feel broken and lost. The only moment when I feel ok is while teaching and with my bf. 

But that feeling in going away slowly and is being replaced with fury. I'm too logical to harm myself but the thought of doing it beats in my head harder each day.

I've tried talking but ""don't compare what you have with your mom, she has it way worse""

I believe is not about comparing, it's about understanding, but there is no room for me.

Just keep on being strong, maybe someday something will happen that will make them see just how bad your feeling...

Thanks"
Getting it out there (kinda long),"My story in it's entirety has been on my shoulders for a while. I haven't been able to share it in its entirety with anybody in my life, due to complications that will be explained, but I'm so dragged down by it at times. I'll just get right into it.
I've grown up admiring my older brother who is 25 (8 years older than me) and who has been living together with my family and his girlfriend for years now. While living with him and growing up with him, I got to see some really dark sides of my childhood role model. He has his own sad issues with depression and anxiety, and while he's been working hard to improve, a few years ago, his coping was very unhealthy. He drank when things got bad, which felt like a lot back then. There were many things that happened due to this that shook my view of things, but what really has taken its toll on me is when he got violent with his girlfriend. I had been fairly close to his girlfriend at the time of one incident: It was the middle of the night, and she had herself locked in the bathroom.  I could hear from my room the sounds of him banging on the door. I went down to investigate, and I was lucky enough to miss him and was let in the bathroom. She was scared. I was only about 13, but I really had to be brave. I could tell she just wanted to wait him out in here for the night, but I knew more needed to be done. Especially when he started banging on the door again and shoving a knife through the bottom of the door. I stood there and convinced her to call the police. She was apprehensive and upon making the call, looked at me and said, ""Am I doing the right thing?"" I had to be certain because nobody else could be. I said yes. The call was made, and my older brother was taken away for a few days. Nothing that bad ever happened again, at least while I was there, but the dynamic between he, his girlfriend, and I had developed. I felt protective of her. I really loved her, and my feelings got really strong over the next few years. One thing led to another, and I told her how I felt. At first she told me no, but things developed as they did and we both fell in love and started somewhat of a secret relationship. We had a lot of doubts  in the beginning. There was a lot that could go wrong, but we stuck with each other and promised that no matter what we'd be open and there for each other. That's how it was while we were dating. That's how it had to be. I got really used to the confidence boost she gave me and the support being there. She was a lot of first times for me as well, to say the least. I'll stay out of the details there, but you get the point. Over the course of our relationship, we had both developed more unfortunate doubts. Hers, she kept to herself, sort of going against the open-ness we established, but I understood why. Eventually I got worried though. She had bouts of being anxious and depressed because she felt she was taking a part of my life away from me and keeping me from experiencing other girls and relationships. I told her not to worry about it, but seeing the pain it gave her really hurt. I felt like it was coming from me. I eventually proposed something needed to change. We settled on a break. A short time, where I'd try my hand at experiencing other girls. I figured I knew how it'd go. I'd either find one person who didn't do it for me, or I wouldn't find anyone and come back to her. I figured either of those outcomes would comfort her, because she'd know that I was committed. She seemed okay and even a bit supportive of this idea, and didn't speak up in terms of any qualms with it. I made it clear that I had every intention in returning to the relationship.The break started, and with it, she started distancing from me. She wasn't even there as a friend very often any more. A few weeks of this was all it took for me to ask her what was wrong. She said she was uncomfortable with me still showing romantic affection towards her on our break. I said that's alright, but if that's the case, I didn't want to deal with that. I was still in love with her and if the break cost me our friendship and our affection, I didn't want to have it. I offered to end the break and she took a few days to land on an answer: No. I was heartbroken. I got really depressed and couldn't help but wonder why. She said she wanted time to just be herself. I suppose I could understand, but at the same time, I didn't realize I was keeping her from that. It was a really hard time for me, but she assured that she'd put more effort into being closer and being friends. A few more weeks passed and she didn't follow through, to my dismay. I asked her again, what was wrong, and she told me she had a date. I got anxious and asked her for just one more chance and she said no. That nothing's going to happen until I'm 18 and under the condition that we're both single.  I kept spiraling and spiraling to a point where she didn't talk to me for days, and she really wasn't even my friend anymore. My life had been about her. I've never cared about somebody or been cared about by somebody as much as we cared about each other.  Her relationship with her new boyfriend has developed for about a month now, and she's so infatuated. Upon starting to date him, she broke up with my brother. (The reason which kept her before, was because he threatened to kick her out of our home, which she couldn't afford to deal with.) Our friendship had been returning to normal on the positive side. She's been spending time with me, telling me that I'm the only one she'd consider if not her boyfriend, etc., but I feel so empty and unimportant in comparison to her new man. It looks like she's going to move in with him, and our time together will become less. I really worry that she won't be as present in my life anymore. Despite all this, she's still the closest person to me, and she means more to me than anyone else ever has. Every time I see her, I fall a little bit in love again. Recently, I've had to see her drool over her boyfriend and admire so many things about him. I broke down and when I was alone I hit myself because I felt so unimportant. I'm not suicidal, but it scares me that I was so willing to hurt myself. I can't get my mind off of her and I can't seem to move on. It fluctuates in severity. Sometimes I actually do feel confident and glad she's happy. If something's going to develop with us, then life will lead us there. If not, it's not meant to be. I've got things figured out in my head, but in my heart I'm a mess. I miss her, I think about her all the time. Almost everything reminds me of her in some way, and I feel stuck. I've tried pursuing other girls, but I really don't want to be with anyone else. I'm so depressed about it and I have really harsh feelings of inadequacy, especially in regards to her boyfriend. 
So that's the story. I apologize for the length, but if you've read this far, thank you for caring. I suppose what I'm looking for is advice to move on without sacrificing our relationship entirely, and support. Maybe mechanisms in dealing with depression and self-hatred. Thank you to anyone who reads this. I've never been able to get this out before."
how do you deal with having no friends,cause im having a hard timeany tips
What am I to do?,"I’ve lost all my friends due to secluding myself from them. I barely got fun by hanging around them because I started becoming quiet and unapproachable (or so I believe).

I’m an ugly, 19- year old Arab, living in Canada away from any family I know.

I’m at university failing at what I’m supposed to study due to this depression. Couldn’t go to 90% of my classes and I’m merely seen as “changed for the worse” by my friends.

Am I to survive my own suicide attempt for there to be a life worth living now?

How is death now a more soothing option than continuing to live through this. I’d lived all my life not really understand how people could kill themselves for feeling this way. After I’ve felt this pain myself, I know I won’t even wish it upon  my worst enemy."
Anyone else’s depression hit hard at night?,"I know this has been talked about before, but just felt like sharing. Anyone else’s depression hit hard at night? This happens to me a lot. I will be fine the whole day, yet once nighttime comes around I start thinking..

For example last night. The whole day I felt great! But once I sat in my bed I had literally one thought of how lonely I felt and then it spiraled out of control. 
The day prior I felt great as well but once I laid down I started thinking about the future and how I am unsure about my passions and it went downhill from there. 

I’ll sob uncontrollably, think about death, you know the whole nine yards, but once I wake up it’s like it never even happened. 

Like right now I’m thinking about last night and I don’t even feel a quarter as bad. I don’t know. Anyone else?

As anyone written out all of their thoughts before?,Sometimes my brain just goes on autopilot and I write every that comes to mind. It’s so overwhelming and it scares me sometimes
Whenever i try to think about or take steps to get better as soon as i as much as get a negative thought in my head i just say,"""fuck it theres no point"" then go back to realizing i will just sit in my room all day everyday until i die "
Does depression make it extremely difficult to find ajob and do job interviews?,Im so depressed i need a job cant live life for much longer if i dont have one but ibdont believe in myself enough so how hows an emplyer meant to believe im right for the job? May as well fucking kill myself 
Since when I built my dream body in the gym I feel like an asshole all the time,"I've always been a super skinny guy all my life, and always been very obsessed with my looks. So 4 years ago I decided to take action and I started going to the gym. I'm now 27, 6'2, good looking, with a body of a greek god, I worked very hard and it paid off. But my life is still a complete mess. I've never had sex, never had a girlfriend, i've been suffering from depression for years for various reasons and I thought that having a fit body would have been the solution for all my problems. I thought that I would have attracted girls like a magnet. The only things that I attracted are depression, loneliness and anger. I mean I get way more attention than I used to, but I am very very shy and girls never approach me, and I don't know if its because of my shyness or because they fill ""intimidated"" by my appearance. I feel like I don't even deserve to have a body like this and I feel an asshole all the fucking time. I feel like people judge me for being ""obsessed"" with the gym life and that they think I'm just a selfish prick full of shit. The truth is that i'm in the worst time of my entire life and I feel suicidal almost everyday. I'm obsessed with sex because I've never had it but at the same time it scares the hell out of me for the same reason. I feel like someone like me should be some sort of playboy or something like that so basically I feel I'm a complete joke. I'm considering going to a psychiatrist because I'm going insane, I feel so bad I don't know what to do anymore, and it gets worse everyday.

Am I going mad? What the fuck is wrong with me?

I'm sorry for this rant, I just needed to release my stress somewhere"
so i’ve been doing better,for the past week i’ve finally been able to be happy and i’ve finally figured out how to block out all the people that were making me feel terrible and all that stuff i’ve been sleeping better i hope this continues. i love feeling happy i’ve missed this feeling so much i feel like i can do so much more and i hope to do more.
Don’t know what to do anymore,Back to october i had surgery and ever since ive been having an anal fissure. For those who don’t know an anal fissure is a cut in your anus that causes extreme discomfort and pain when using the bathroom. I don’t know how much longer I can last with this pain and ive missed school some days due to the pain and its been on a daily to cry from how frustrated I am. I’m 18 and i dont know how much longer i can last 
Do You Ever Feel Like You Don't Want to Get Better?,"I've started therapy recently, and I've caught myself being sort of afraid or anxious about getting better.  There's some part of me that wants to stay in the loop, it feels like.  

I might be mistakenly thinking that staying this way will help my art or something, I don't know.  Or maybe I'm scared my friends are only my friends because they think I need help.  

I have no idea why I feel this, but am I the only one?"
Anyone else feel like depression has made you asexual?,"I have been alone for quite a time and have never had a girlfriend. But it starts to not bother me anymore, i am starting to lose interest in girls. And my sex drive is long gone aswell."
I think this is the end of my life.,"I've been in a relationship for roughly five years. I was happy... I complained about the small things nonstop and I wasn't able to fix myself in time for her to forgive me for being horrible... She's left and found someone else... I'm alone and I don't know what direction to go in anymore... At first I thought maybe us separating would help me focus on myself, but I'm finding that the only reason I wanted to focus on myself was to fix myself to make her happy... I have nothing left emotionally and I don't think anyone will ever love me again... So I guess this is it. I think I've made up my mind to end it and be done with everything... I don't have anyone I can talk to anymore so I'm ranting here instead... "
I don’t know who I am,"When I actually start a conversation with someone (which is rare anyways) it’s never a normal conversation. It’s not a fun one, where we just discuss something we like or what we did yesterday. Somehow it always turns out to be emotionally draining and the other person ends up telling me their whole life story and how horrible everything is for them and then when they’re done they don’t even ask me about my life or what I think. I literally always feel like I’m a fucking rock that you spill all your worries on and you don’t have to worry about it judging you because it’s just a fucking rock. I don’t want to fucking listen to how no one ever listens to you even when you babble on and on about your hundreds of friends and what they texted you. Like, tell that to your friends?? I’m not gonna save you or anything. I’m tired of listening to people’s bullshit. I literally am so fucking tired of everything. Have I been a rock my whole life? Just there, taking it all in because I’m expected to not act out. I feel like I don’t even “live” anymore I’m just there and nothing ever changes. No one fucking cares for you, no one notices you. Oh cool, you were top student in 6th grade? Congratulations you are such a good kid! Not like everyone else, everyone else sucks and you should not be like them, they all get in trouble which means they live horrible lives. Don’t talk to those people. Keep being a good little kiddo and your life will be perfect! Lmao, you fucking meet someone and they ask about you and all you have to tell them about yourself is how good you were in school and that’s what your personality is based on. No fucking friends with that. "
Thanks you all.,"I've discovered this sub today, probably because I didn't want to before. I'm 23, yeah it's still young. But for the past year I'm no longer myself. I used to be alive, doing stuff and things all day. 
Now I can barely hold a day without having a mental break. I used to paint and play, but I can't even focus on it for more than few minuts. 
My depression cost my girl, my friends, my family. Because none of them understand. Because they couldn't stand the frighten, broken man I turned into. I cannot sleep very well, I just wait to pass out from exhaustion. 
Every time I watch myself in the mirror I just see a broken version of me, who gain weight, except on the face, with eyes who lost their will. 
I didn't feel human contact for a year, not a hug, not a kind word or normal conversation. But still I am here, telling all this to a bunch of strangers who have a similar issue.
It's the first time I manage to write this, but it doesn't really help. 

What does is to know that you are all here, with sometimes similar issues. That all of you know what it's like. And seeing others sharing... It helps. It helps knowing I'm not mading all up like the rest use to tell me. 

So thanks you. From what's left of me and my heart, thanks you all for being here. For sharing. For speaking to each other. 
To live with it, and yet, managing to find the time to help others. 
Thanks you."
Never been more depressed and alone in my life,"I’ve been struggling with depression for years now. I’ve learned to live with it somehow. Four years ago left my home country to move to USA. My depression gotten worse, I had no friends. I met my boyfriend he started accusing me of cheating, we are doing much better now but now he has this need to act though and I need to be the good woman as a “joke”. My depression really gotten to the worst point of my life when my grandpa passed away last year. I didn’t feel like doing anything all I do is sleep all day. My boyfriend is out now celebrating st Patrick’s day with my parents and his parents because I said I don’t want to hang out with my mother because shes been harassing me about my grandma and her huge credit card dept that probably my money crazy cousin, aunt and uncle made.

Been three years,"I'm always deeply depressed during this holiday. It's been three years since I had my abortion. I was wondering why my ex was all the sudden coming up in my dreams and I was feeling more depressed than  usual.

Three years ago, I started using the patch for birth control. It was my first time using birth control and that was the first option I was given. I was also starting to lift weights so I was also sweating a lot. I remember the first week I wore my patch and it fell off in the shower. I freaked out and told my doctor about it. She told me that this issue was common and told me to wait 24 hours to put on a new. On the safe side, don't be active unless you are use protection or the morning after pill. After that incident happened, I did my best to make sure the patch stayed on, I even moved the patch to a different place.  But, the patch ended up coming off that area as well and I was sexually active as well. I was pregnant and didn't know. I knew that I didn't want kids at that time, I wasn't ready and my ex was not ready either. He was beginning to go down a dark path and our relationship was suffering. I made the decision to not to have my child, when I do have kids I want my kids to have a good life and I knew my child wouldn't. I talked to my ex about it and he agreed to the abortion. I went to the clinic and the experience was horrible, the protesters there threw praying beads at me and told me I was going to hell. When I got inside and told the security guard what happened, he just sat there and did nothing about it. I had an ultra sound done and I refused to see it. I was under nine weeks so I was able to use the pill option. Instead of my ex being there for me, he told me that St.Patrick's day is his holiday and that he should go out and party. I remember the meds taking a huge toll on my body and I just remember waking up feeling intense pain, in  our bedroom, call out to my ex and he wasn't there. I was crying and in a lot of pain. There was a lot of blood so I crawled into the bathroom.  That was the night when I told myself that my ex was no longer the man I met and that the life I thought we were going to have it wasn't happening. How in the hell can I marry a man who leaves his girl bleeding in bed crying?? She has made this huge decision that affects him as well and NOT BE THERE!! I never wanted him there more than anything that night.  When the morning came and the abortion process was over, I never looked at him the same. The love I had for him was gone and three months later, I broke up with him. I look back at that sad night and I feel depressed. But overall, I made the right decision. We were not emotionally stable enough to bring children in the world. The crazy thing is that right after we broke up he got another girl pregnant. It just validated that I really didn't matter to him, been together for almost four years... I think about this around this time every year. It's hard to talk about it, I was ashamed about it all so I hid it from everyone. I finally told my sister about it and low key she wished that I didn't have the abortion. She is all about family and togetherness and I understand that, it's not like I don't want kids, it's like I told her, I had a gut feeling that right now wasn't the right time. I will have kids someday but this doesn't feel right. My family didn't understand my decision but it's okay because I do, and at the end of the day that's what matters. Still, I feel depressed about it and I feel that now is the time to finally bring this up in therapy because it's a situation where I need to forgive myself and find peace and closure with."
I just couldnt give a care anymore.,"Life’s going downhill? Sure. Ill just let it happen and Im not going to do anything about it. Im pretty certain I tried to get better, but I guess it doesnt work for all of us. Something bad happened? okay. Let the life takes its course. 

Now, Im just addicted to self-loathing. Even by existing is so fucking tiring, I mean, how can anybody do this? "
You know you’re fucked up when constantly dream about suicide,"It’s happened many times that I dream about things I’m most afraid of in real life, the crude reality I want to avoid and don’t want to accept.

After my suicidal thoughts came back stronger than ever, I’m dreamt from time to time about being at parties or being with my ex-classmates from high school and college where everyone just made me feel like shit and laughed at me even my few “friends” while suicidal thoughts crossed my mind or they’d encourage me to do it.

Today I dreamt that I was with my school classmates (when I was in high school) in a weird gathering idk it’s like we were at a party but for some reason there was a dam right below where we were. 

There was this girl I used to be with in high school humiliating me saying I’m worthless to the rest of the group and how stupid I was. Then my “friends” were like jokingly saying “*my name*, why don’t you throw yourself at the dam”?? 

The last thing I remember before I woke up was preparing to let myself fall,drown and die while everyone watched. 

The worst part is that my dreams are very vivid so even if there’s subconscious part of my that know it’s a dream, those feelings of sadness and neglect feel very real. When I wake up I feel kind of uneasy, relieved it was a dream, but then I realize it’s not that far from reality and the sadness awakens."
I’m on Effexor and mirtazapine and it took me months to feel better.,"Curcumin, Ashwagandha, Omega3, YTE/Youth Tissue Extract (really amazing!), sobriety, meditation and regular exercise got me straightened out. Feel great now.  Started microdosing mushrooms also which helps a lot. "
I (22 M) might be getting Depressed again...,"I was depressed after making some poor career choices about 3 years ago. I was lonely, ashamed,  and suffering. I couldn't sleep, eat and thought I was useless and a burden to my family. 

My father is a hard working man, I always hoped to be half as capable as him. I am the eldest son, so I felt, that I had the responsibility to be a role model my brother. I was afraid of not being able to live up to these thresholds that I set up for myself. All these thoughts, would run around in my head, I would end up crying and pass out. I was close to contemplating suicide, but luckily my family found out I was depressed and helped me out.

Fast forward 3 years, I'm in a different career and Happy. For the past 3 years, I kept telling my self that I'll never be depressed again and it was working. I kept believing that I have moved on ahead stronger and better.

But last Friday, I got depressed again, had similar thoughts of uselessness and burden. I laid on my bed and wept. I'm not sure what triggered this sudden bout of depression. I'm unable to pin point the source of it, and hence I arrived at this conclusion.

Some members from my mother's side of the family suffer from depression, so I might have gotten it from there. 

My mother also suffers from Spondylitis (a form of Arthritis, around the spine and neck region) ever since I was born (She was 22 when I was born). I never realized her pain, until my neck started hurting couple of months ago and last Friday, it reached its peak. I was unable to bear it, and had no pain killers available. This Physical trauma, may have caused my mental breakdown.

I have to go to a doctor and get my neck checked whether if it really is Spondylitis or something else. I really admire my mother for living with Spondylitis for 22 long years and she is still going strong.

I don't want to feel depressed again..

How Do You Deal With Love,When the person you're smitten by couldnt care less about you?
My wife said that she wants to leave over a tattoo for my father...,"A little context, my father died in front of me and my mother in his home last month. Since then, I have made three “splurge” purchases. Paid off my car (~$2700), a new glass piece ($100), and a tattoo memorializing my father’s memory ($240). All of this from money I have saved and none of it affecting what I’m saving to buy a house for my family. 

She found the glass piece and flipped out and left, taking our daughter a week before her 2nd birthday. I know I have to be strong and there for my kids, but there is no point if I can’t be there by force. I also have an 8yr old son from a previous relationship. I don’t care about me, I just don’t want to cause any more hurt to them or my mother anymore. "
To jjmoose318,I think you are being mean and hurtful. Why post if you dont want responses. Maybe people are mean to you because u r mean to them. Grow a pair 
I am weak again,"It have been 1 month since I get rid of my depression, I thought I was cool, feeling confidence and self assured, then boom, things came in and challenged my belief, boom my good self image broke into pieces, and here I am sitting here try to trash myself again, surfing reddit, doing nonsense stuff. But It is just a relapse, I told myself,""Relax, bro, It gonna get better."" "
I feel like nonone genuinely cares.,"I try to make friends. I fail.
I try to find new places to meet people. I fail.
I try to improve my social skills. I fail.
I pick myself up. To no avail.
I turn to those who are my ""friends"" already. There's no genuine care.

It's a constant circle, and I just want to meet people who genuinely want to be my friend, who want me around but this circle will just keep going, and eventually, I won't be able to pick myself back up."
let me help you and you help me,"i'm a thirteen girl who is  struggling so much.I feel no one will listen to me, my best friends name is Cearra or I thought she was my best friend before she says she always to hangout but really only means that to her school friends cause we dont go to the same school. feeling trapped cause your parents dont get whats happening after you tell them your story of hurt,or how you found someone you've never felt before and turns out they just wanted to mess with you for fun. having to cry in the shower so no one can see you or here you,how you hide your true self and plaster a smile at school trying to really fake your way through happiness, i know what its like to have so much hurt and feel pity for your [self. How](https://self.how) you feel so trapped and the only way out is to take your life, even i know not to but the truth is a i want to. I JUST WANT SOMEONE to listen to me,who can make me feel good about myself. my mom is a girl who hits me when she thinks i'm a horrible creature, she smokes ,she calls me  down as a  whore,slut but at the end of the day im so done,i just want someone to help me ,i just want to stop crying for help, pls listen to me."
"My ""best friend"" hung up on me","Someone I really considered one of my close friends, my best friend and longest friend, hung up on me one other day. 

I was really depressed and I've honestly been having a lot of suicidal ideation. But, that's not what this post is about today. 

No, she said ""I can't handle this. I'm not doing this."" And hung up the phone. 

Now, as someone who has talked to a lot of people when they're suicidal, INCLUDING HER -- multiple times before, I can't help but feel a little... Angry, rejected, unwanted. 

I just wanted support and I thought she'd understand. I had already called my parents because the hotlines were backed up and I couldn't get through.

This isn't the first time she's ignored me when I'M the one not feeling well. Hell, I had stomach flu and she didn't even ask if I was okay (I kept almost passing out, so no, I wasn't.). 

She messages me the next day. Claims she just hung up because there's nothing she can do, so. 

So her reaction is just to hang up??? It wasn't even a, ""I gotta go, but I care about you, ok? Please try the hotline again."" 

EVERYTHING is always fucking about her. I think this might be the final straw, with her. Maybe I'm the bitch here, but fuck you [name.] Next time you are talking about how low you are, don't call me ever again. I've clearly spent enough HOURS of my life on that with no return when I needed it. 

Sorry, this has been really bugging me because I don't have a ton of friends or anything so, a loss hurts. 

She's just so damn selfish. I shouldn't be shocked or hurt, but... I am and it does. "

You are the architect of your own depression,"I've come to the conclusion that ultimately you create your own depression. You obviously don't mean to. And it's so easy for humans to slip into a depressive state. If you create it, then it stands to reason that you can destroy it. And YOU are the only one who can. Therapy and medication help, they definitely help. But they're never the final fix. The final push. The final breakthrough has to and can only come from your inner willpower."
All of this is pointless.,I'm tired of being a numb and dumb mess. Guess I'll just end my life.
My dog died and I need help,"Today at 9:39 our dog Eleanor was running through the forest and ran into the rode. She didn’t have a leash in, and was killed by a car. It was quick and painless.

I kissed a girl,"Hello everyone. I'm 30 years old women. As a child I was molested by my father. Last year I was close to be dead. I took pills and my husband found me and saved me. I have had depression for about 
10 years. Now I'm starting again. I'm changing my thinking paths and it's awesome. But sexually I was like 4 years old baby. Yesterday I've met my female friend and we kissed. We kissed a lot. My husband is ok with that. And now I can't stop thinking about it. I feel like a teenager. When I was 14 I was with girls. But every encounter was with shame, with guilty. Now I feel great and I  want more.  
I just need to share that with someone other than my husband. I'd like to know if anyone had similar situation. "
"Honestly, I just want to feel meaningful","I desperately want a meaningful relationship. One of those deep ones, where I would feel like I meant something to the other person.

Ive internalized a personality that is not me.,"Alt for obvious reasons.

Im 17, still in school and doing great, but i really dont care.
I stopped thinking about my future a long time ago. People are trying to preassure me to think about what i want to study in university after school, but i cant decide as i dont really see any sense in that. No matter what i do ill never satisfy my expectations in the future, and they are far beyond realistic anyways. What is wierd that i wouldnt concider myself antisocial. I have lots of friends but i dont really care. Every time im around them i just feel sad because i see them having fun and being happy which i for some reason cant really do.

Ive been bullied from the 5th grade all the way to the 10th (im in 12th now) and even tho i dont really thought it had an impact on me because im still doing fine i think i have deep scars that im only noticing now. It has left me kind of empty.

Im not from some bad family or financial background, my family is great and im sure they would be very understanding but ive never told anyone how i feel expect for my 25 year old brother when i was drunk.

I basically feel empty inside and dont see the sense in the future. Im playing with the idea of suicide more and more every day. I dont have any romantic relationships because i feel out of place whenever im talking to someone i am interested in. Ive been told many times that im worth nothing and now, two years after, im starting to believe it.
Everyone thinks of me as the bright, funny guy but i feel like thats a facade i cant take off.

I need help but im too scared to tell anyone because it totally goes against what people think im like. Help me."
Just say hi (please),"I’m in a really bad space right now. There isn’t much I can do - and I have no one to talk to - I just need someone to talk to me, say hello, remind me this is temporary. Please."
Life,"What is the point really anymore?

my last 3-4 months have been so shit. All of my previous interest like football, fashion, art etc don't interstest me any longer. I actually dont care for all of that. I'm also constantly ignored by all of my friends, like I'm the guy you always forget about and never invite to anything. I really dont have any true friends no more and the friends I have makes fun of me all the time and lowkey talks shit about me behind my back. On top of that my gf dosen't want to see me anymore because I've lied constantly about how I feel and what I've done in the past (I've lied about being this big-shot guy who've gotten laid a bunch of times and have so many friends.) - even my friends have found out about my lies now and they've embarrassed me. I can't come to tell them how I actually feel. She was really the only light in my life.

My mom and dad is always disappointed in me. I have a little sister who's the complete opposite of me. She's smart, got loads of friends, gets good grades and is happy all the time. So at least they'll still have her if I commit suicide. In school I'm a fucking loser who can't even talk the the fucking teacher. Exams are very soon and I'm 100% failing all my classes. Oh and did I tell you guys that I have anxiety? Everyday when I wake up my I feel like my life is pointless. I'm thinking if I end it all, I wouldn't think about anything anymore. No stress and no anxiety. Sorry for rambling and my poor English certainly dosen't help me. I can't bare to talk to anyone I know irl about this and I probably never will.

I'm just so tired about being a complete loser and a person nobody really cares about. And no talking to my mother about it or some bullshit is not gonna work. I don't have that type of a mother-son relationship."

I'm too shitty to fix myself, I have tried over and over again. But she's begging for me back. She sent all of her money from her bank account to my PayPal and told me she doesn't know if she will stay alive without me. I don't know what to do. I don't want her to die I love her but she doesn't understand I hate hurting her so fucking much. I'm miserable and I don't know what the fuck to do. "
Everyday is another step closer to the inevitable death by suicide.,"Everyday it was just small steps, lately it’s been GIANT leaps. My best friend since 2nd grade has mostly stopped talking to me and involving me in things ever since he began to like this girl he talks to even more. I know it’s selfish to think this way, but I don’t want to be alone, why do I want to keep others down with me? "
Sexual Abuse Recovery Help,"hey yall, first time posting here. so for context, i’m 20 now, and i was molested by my best friend when i was 16. i’ve tried therapy, writing songs, journaling, and even confronting the man himself, but nothing seems to take away the pain or sense of worthlessness that i feel from that happening. Anybody been through something similar that has any advice on how to move on, regain a sense of self worth, stop the nightmares, etc?"
Please ignore this 2.0,"Following my previous thing, there was a few other things I wanted to touch on that I could not. Things like whether I wanted it to be better or not, whether I could have fixed some issues or not. During my teen years, I had some issues here and there, I wasn't the brightest child, in fact I was believed to be the grossiest kid. While others cared about their studies, I care to get friends. The friends I had were those that would not think twice before disposing of me, knowing this I still stayed their disposable pawn. If I had known beforehand that I would still be this sad... Darn.. I have alot of friends now, friends that are kind, straightforward, understanding or even friends i can relate to... People like them always find ways to help me. But the most common way they do so is by saying ""You are still young."" Saying that, always makes me feel like I need to grow up sooner, but in fact... WHAT IS GROWING UP? It's not like I have yet to tried growing up right? What's so good about it either, doesn't everyone want to stay young? You can fake grow by acting matured. Act is not the truth, you can act but it doesn't mean much. I know my flaws, I'm rude, sensitive, I blame but I don't show much anyways. If you asked me, I won't be my friend. Gloomy, always depressing, friends with emo kids. They say you have to love yourself before you love others, that's impossible for me. I will possibly never ever find a day where I can love myself, but I can hope I can influence others to not hate themselves. Ironic, how I want to help others before myself? Ironic how I'm saying this? I know, life is sentimental. I don't get some things adults do, nor do adults get some things I do. Growing up is what they all call it. It is not the act of being sensible that makes you grow, it is the fact that you listen to others, expand your horizons and reflect, reject insults and be yourself. Until then, I shall be the same. I don't want to change for people who do not change themselves. I changed a lot, I became someone who is the funny person out of many others who seemed more childish than I was. I did try to show myself as different from them but they never once did think of me as mature. I'm writing this to see how many flaws I have as a being, also as to see how useless I am. Basically, I'm still young and I'm hating on the world. Being an adult, surely life doesn't always go one's way either. You can have a good job, but not love what you do, you can have your favourite job, but not what stables your lifestyle. All these depressing songs from Hatsume Miku, Gumi, IA and Lumi. I can relate to most of them and that's not what I want to show here. I do not want to show that my life has been boring. It's not like being lonely's the thing I chose since the start right? I tried everything I could, but can't see the end, you tell me everything I've been doing was all for naught? What are you, my savior? My hater? You don't have the rights to call the shots now do you? But no. Obviously people who can voice out tend to have more influence, or else everything will move awkwardly. The classes in schools can't function properly. Take for example the song Irony. 'I can't seem to walk anymore' symbolizes the fact that you do not feel like you can do it anymore. The song's basically about how you have friends, but your not happy. I can relate to it, but mine's different. I have caring friends, they helped me alot, but my case now, can't be helped by simply words. Nor do I actually want to confide in them, they might brush it off or lose my trust. I don't trust easily thanks to some incidents that happened a while ago. I no longer try to find someone to love as they don't deserve it. There are good people I get but the people I don't like always seems to get more influence towards me. I am so weak to the point I can't even cry, therefore ranting to anyone whos reading this sad story of mine. I lie so much when I say I don't want anyone to see this, or I lie so much that I'm lying about this. I don't get this life either. I was born short, I don't see any meaning in life. Where's my special talent? The fact I can elaborate my pains like this? What's the point, anyone can do that with a little practice. For anyone who thinks I'm pitiful should just not do anything, I don't want your pity, not to be rude or anything, I had enough of pities. I'm sensitive to rude remarks, and I take my lies that I can't retrieve to my grave, which is why I don't want friends. I mistreat them, my conscience won't allow my ignoring them. I can not see the end of the road, and it seems like it always stops halfway for me. People who do not want me to die, they are good people who in turn actually weights my burdens further to the point I have to fake a smile or two to calm. When I cannot even calm myself down. I talk big, like how I can thrash others in fights, when I have yet to had a real fight, I'm thrash. In every generation, there ought to be thrashes and I'm one of them. You can tell me I'll be fine, I know that myself, but it's too long. The fact I'm ranting is to hopefully ease myself anyways, so it is not like I'll suddenly be okay all of a sudden. I do not expect this depressing life of mine to be better. Love,friendship,respect,trust,feelings, things that shapes life, I don't got none. My feelings are like manifested from my cheerful thoughts, and my real feelings are hidden behind my smile, which is the suicidal self. I know I talk big about how I always want to suicide, but it is not okay for me to just burden down my classmates, friends, family right? See? I'm just making up excuses now that I can't kill myself. I'm a useless cunt who can't save his own sorrows for himself and rants on Reddit. Out of this whole world, I'm not the only one suffering from depression, in fact most of the world population is. You can ease one's depression, but you are depressed yourself and need help. It's like a trauma you can't solve just by adding a few words here and there. For me, words don't add feels to me anymore, actions might, who knows? I'm so broken I think I'll laugh maniacally if someone asks me if I'm okay.
  Sorry for anyone who had to read through this to kill time or what, sorry to kill the mood, sorry for apologising, sorry for being a burden, sorry for wasting your time, sorry for being so useless, sorry for being so depressing, I don't know what to do with this weak life of mine anyways."
I thought getting a job would make me feel better but it's the same old shit and I can't catch a break from this devil named depression.,
Depression relapse in the middle of exams,"Studying at college has never been a problem for me. I'm more active, interested and productive here but suddenly from the day before yesterday I've fallen back into the hole I thought I had gotten myself out of. I can feel myself slowly retreating back to all my toxic habits and this sudden bout of depression is hindering me from studying for the exams I'm currently taking. I have an exam tomorrow and I haven't studied anything. It really feels like I'm 17 again lying numb on my bed doing nothing for hours on end just staring into empty space."
Not sure what to do,"Hello,

I am a 25 YO M from UK pursuing graduate higher education, apologies for being vague.

I have been hospitalised once with my depression, and I was on Antidepressants until 3 or 4 months ago.

I had been doing pretty well, working out regularly, etc. But have found myself struggling again. A lot of what is the point of everything, no enjoyment from my work, not interested in dating etc. 

I was in quite a turbulent relationship approximately 1 year ago and we ended up breaking up. I really liked her and recently I’ve asked her to come back into my life , which she has said no. Obviously broke my heart and feel silly as she has asked me to try again with her multiple times and I declined. My friends think she is bad news for the way she treated me (I’m a complete pushover, hate conflict so don’t stand up for myself). So I don’t think we’re right for each other but it still sucks and I feel very undesirable and not wanted. 

Just unsure what to do with myself, I feel very much like I am pointless and my existence isn’t worth anything. I don’t see what I offer people. I know I am a very nice guy I do try hard to be nice to people, but don’t feel I am offering anything.

Tl;dr 25 M grad student who lives alone having existential crisis "
I have no energy,I have no calling. I have no motivation. I don't want to get my life together. I don't want to think about it really. I don't even want to feel motivated. I should probably just leave and become homeless because I can't bear to let everyone else do all this work but honestly I don't feel like doing it either. Life sucks. I guess I'm just a complainer. I don't even want to feel motivated. I don't want to be burdened with responsibilities. I don't want to just keep distracting myself with goals and things to do. Studying. Cleaning. Working out. Learning. Planting a garden. Working towards a better future. I just don't care. I'm sick of the shame associated with being this way. I don't want to change. I don't want to grow up. I'm addicted to depression. I don't want to turn away from it. i'm too tired to be involved. This is why I'll never get anywhere in life. 
Am I a bad person just because my school grades are not great?,"I don't want to bore anyone with a very long story or anything like that. For short, I've had an emotionally abusive mother when I was young, she basically forced me to study all day, every day. Now that wasn't such a big deal for me at the time, I was quite young, and quite good (just like we all are in our early years in school). However, as soon as my grades started to drop just a tiny bit, I would get yelled at and called all sorts of things, one of them being that I'll end up as nothing more than garbage if my grades weren't perfect. That was made worse by the teachers I had in school (and now in high school). With the exception of a few teachers I genuinely have respect for, all others, in both middle school and high school, would have no problem calling me stupid or useless in front of my classmates. Even the private math tutor I went to for a year would call me all sorts of things for not being good enough (at one point, I remember she laughed at me in front of the other 3 or so kids who were also with me because I couldn't solve a problem). I've never been diagnosed with depression or anxiety or anything like that, because my parents think it's a waste of time and keep telling me ""oh well, you can just fix yourself! you don't need a doctor, we all go through bad times!"". I've been feeling like this since 7th grade and it sure as hell didn't get any better, nor did I manage to help myself much. I plan on getting diagnosed as soon as I become 18 (currently 17), until then I just have to keep on going like this.

&#x200B;

There's a lot more I could say (and probably should, to give a bit more context if people care), but all I need is to be told that it's okay to not be good, it's okay to fail. I'm not the best, I know. My grades are all around C's and D's (i'm not american so i'm just approximating since a lot of the posts here that are school related are in the US) and I'm failing my math class, but please, I'm begging you, just tell me it's okay to fail, tell me that even if I were to drop out of school, I could still live a normal life. I don't need money, I just need to feel ok."
I don't know what to do anymore with my mom and her business,"I've been depressed for about 2 years, and had to drop out of university last year because I couldn't do it anymore. 

I've been helping my mom with her baking business (she bakes from home). The problem is lately I have trouble waking up, and it doesn't help that I have a completely messed up sleeping schedule. I think it's all a coping mechanism. I also am a naturally slow paced person. 

She's extremely upset that I don't help as much as she would like. I really think I'm trying my best considering half the time I don't really want to be alive. But it's not enough. 

I understand where she's coming from. She's been sacrificing herself for this family. My dad doesn't work, he drinks alcohol and slowly spends all of our money. 

I know I have to do better, but it upsets me that I've been forced in this position of caregiver. "
Depressed over something stupid.,"Im scare to drive, and every chance i get to drive a car i get anxious and start to panic. I hate this. Not driving has cause me not to find a better job but to work a shitty one. This has always always made me upset over the years."
I just want it to end...,"The unwanted feeling. 
The not being good enough feeling. 
The I will never be able to climb out of this hole feeling. 
The my friends hate me feeling...
Wait, the, “what friends” feeling. 

I want it to end, I want to be “normal”. I can’t fucking stand being me. "
Trouble forcing myself to go to sleep,"I am always sleep deprived. I used to average about 9-10 hours of sleep in my early twenties and now in the latter half I get a bit more than 6. I don't have trouble falling a sleep -- I just can force myself to go to bed early enough.

Logic tells me just to put myself into bed, but instead I will mindlessly browser website and refresh them waiting for new content to appear. It is a waste of time, I know, but a part of me has this unsatisfied feeling that nothing interesting happened and I want to feel a bit happiness somewhere, and **then** go to sleep.

And strangely, despite it render me tired all day, emotionally stay up feels pretty good. It might be subject and anecdotal, but I think my mood swings to a happier direction (comparably) when I stayed up late and waked up late. Having a healthy sleeping cycle seems to destroy my emotion balances."
This morning,"This morning, I woke up and felt normal, for the first time in a long time it felt okay. I woke up and looked in the mirror and didn’t hate the way I looked, and I tried to get along with my family too. I have a lot of stress weighing on me right now though, so that occupied my mind. But I feel kind of free today. I hope everyone reading this can experience something like that soon, and I hope that this lasts. I started St.John’s wort a week ago, so it may be the reason this is happening, but man I feel great!"
"I thought about ending things today, something in me both regrets not doing it and hates myself for that feeling","I was trying to get my life together after having had a very destructive weekend. I was washing my dishes, when I started drying a kitchen knife. I noticed it was very sharp. I spent longer than I'd like to admit fantasizing and taking comfort in the idea of how easy it would be to just shove it handle-deep in between my ribs and stop my heart. How quickly I could just disappear from my bad decisions, abandon the people who get nothing from me but a burden on their lives. Looking back, part of me is sad to have contemplated it. But only a small part feels that way. A bigger part regrets not doing it, not giving myself the opportunity to leave the world a better place, to show the people in my life how much better off they are without me. Another voice inside hates myself for allowing that feeling to have intruded. I can't help it though. It's a voice I can suppress less and less. I'm medicated and not planning on hurting myself right now so please don't be scared for me if you're reading this. I just like to imagine how much happier people would be if I had never entered their lives, knowing I have at least this way out. "
Just to share with someone,"I think I feel like shit right now, but I don't really know. I don't feel like doing anything I would enjoy, I would rather just get consumed but my own apathy and despair. I feel like time is both moving at a snails pace and flying away at the same time. Thinking again, despite me not *feeling* like shit, I am miserable
Sincerely, yet another hopeless soul"
Do anti-depressants help much?,"I've heard that initially they make symptoms much worse, i feel like if that happened then i might kill myself, so im hesitant to go to the doctor"
my anxiety tells me that i'm a bother,"I've been revisiting the same problem that has always kept me from making friends, whish is that my anxiety tells me that by asking someone to hang out I'm bothering or annoying them.

Does anyone else have this problem?"
"My sister in law talked behind my back to my boyfriend, and I feel super depressed","Recently, I accepted a job offer that's part of my career path, higher pay, and a short commute to my apartment. I celebrated with my family and my boyfriend over dinner because I can finally leave my minimum wage, toxic work environment for a much better job.


What makes me really depressed is while I was using the bathroom at the restaurant, my sister in law told my boyfriend that I am too dependent to my parents. She assumed that I got my new job from my parents connections. He got my back and told her that I found this job on my own without my parents' help. I didn't ask for any networks to help me land this job. My boyfriend told me this and I got really upset and depressed.


My sister in law is a stay-at-home mom and a housewife. She's fortunate that my brother works at a hedgefund company who pays him a lot. What she doesn't understand is that I was working at my minimum wage job. Food prices went up in my city area, so I go to my parents who can make food for me. I got lucky when I entered the affordable housing lottery and pay my own rental apartment.


My boyfriend tries to comfort me, saying that she's super spoiled because it is uncommon in this economy for wives to be housewives at this century. He is right but it really hurts me that I worked so hard for, and then someone brings me that I am too dependent to my parents just because I am not financially rich."
First post here wish it could have been a happier first post (Vent),"I don’t really know what to say since I don’t really post but... 
*venting ahead* 
my girlfriend broke up with me last Thursday and I’ve been feeling like garbage. We dated back in October and she didn’t do anything like cheat on me and whatnot but halfway through she just never showed that she cared anymore. I already get swings of moderate depression and the fact that she was avoiding me and not really wanting to talk even though I see her everyday in my group of friends really hurts. She has her own problems too so I can’t entirely blame her. She has seasonal depression disorder? (The depression in winter time) so I thought it was just that. We used to be so happy together and I wished we could go back to that...
Her problem with me was that everything she did stressed her out like if she didn’t talk too much or talked too much to me. She said we could still be friends but as much as I want to I still can’t get over the pain. She told me not to blame myself, just that “we weren’t right for each other” but I keep thinking back to the beginning and wonder how I messed up to let this happen. I know I wont physically hurt myself or kill myself or something but man do I just want to get rid of this constant pain in my chest. The worst thing is that I still love her but I know we won’t get back together or something. 
(Is it ok if I don’t say my age? I’m new to this so idk if i should or not) 
*vent over* 
Sorry I just had to rant all of this cause if I try talking this to my friends they tell me to stop being dramatic and get over it "
Help me,"I can’t stand being around my family anymore. I always used to tell myself that once I turned 18 I would never have to see any of them anymore but I can’t take anymore. I’m not going to be 18 for 5 more years and I don’t think I can wait anymore. 

My mom just hates me for no reason. She treats me like garbage and always calls me stupid, constantly make fun of me for no reason and she gets mad at me for everything. She always likes to put the blame on me when it’s not even my fault. She’s tried to publicly humiliate me many times. She always complains that I never talk to her, but whenever I’ve tried to she will ignore me or start yelling at me for no reason. I really just have nothing to say to her. I just want her to leave me alone,  but of course she won’t. She will start yelling at me for no reason sometimes, saying a bunch of hurtful things to me and will get mad at me when I start crying. It’s like she doesn’t even understand that I have emotions. I’ve considered killing myself a couple times just because of her. This morning, we were about to go to church, but then I was having a migraine so I went to go sleep it off. My mom asked me why I wasn’t ready, and when I told her that I was having a migraine she hit me several times and got mad at me because I didn’t tell her, even though she’d get mad at me if I told her. She treats my other siblings normally but it’s different when it comes to me.

And then there’s my dad, who I hate even more than I hate my mom. I only have to see him once every other week cause my parents are divorced, and thank god. He’s abusive, entitled, and absolutely disgusting. He gets mad for literately everything and he hits me for things that aren’t even my fault. He once threatened to slam my sisters head against the wall. He acts as if he’s better than everyone else and that he has the right to do anything he wants just because he’s my dad.

I can’t handle any of them anymore. I’ve considered running away before but I’d have nowhere to go. I’ve been seriously considering suicide but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. I don’t know what to do.

"
Depressed to the point where I’m wayy down the rabbit hole.,"Ill get attracted to almost anyone that does something nice to me, if someone even does something nice to me. Ill fall in love with someone who says hello or high fives me. That shit makes my year. I ll literally wanna be with that person that said something nice to me because I feel like they would care. "
Incapable of stopping myself from doing things that are emotionally damaging.,"Is this a symptom of depression, ADHD or anxiety? I've been diagnosed with all three and have been struggling with various medication for the past 6 months. 

Lately (but in reality, my whole life to some extent) I have really become aware that I have an almost unstoppable desire to only do what I want to do, not what I need to do. I'm talking more on an emotional level, not physical. For example, I become overpowered by my positive emotions and need to cling to them, so I don't stand up for myself, or I do something I know isn't logically or emotionally the best thing to do, or I convince myself I I'm in the wrong when I know I'm really not. It's turned me into a complete doormat with men, incapable of standing up to my somewhat irrational mother, being bossed around unreasonably by clients, being treated like shit by a boss....you get the picture. It's like I don't feel like I deserve NOT to be treated like that. 

How do I fix this. I don't even know what it's called. But it's something that is legitimatly ruining my life. "
Why is medication such a bad thing?!,"So I Just need to get it out. There's the depression shit that I live with constantly, the aches and sometimes excruciating pains from fibromyalgia made worse by depression and stress, the constant emotional instability, and the constant self-doubt. Yet I keep going, keep pushing through doing what I know I need to do. If I hadn't been guided to know I have a purpose here I would not still be here. If I didn't have a family I cherish I would not be here. Depression is a bitch.

I have tried everything non-medicinal to try to heal myself. Improved diet, more exercise, more sunlight, more meditation and prayer for mental and spiritual improvement, utilizing cognitive behavioral techniques in the moment, but everything feels like a bandaid solution. The cause of my darkness is deeper than that. It's a weight I wake up with every morning and fall asleep with every night. It brings suicidal thoughts, apathy, and the most uncomfortable feeling I have ever felt. Daily. Relentless. And each and every morning I tell myself ""One more day."" And each evening I tell myself ""Congratulations. You've made it through the day.""

Outwardly I appear strong and full of light and love. The person to go to for advice and care. Inwardly I fear no one will ever be able to help me. No one knows the answer. No one knows the cause. Maybe these thoughts I have about myself are true. Maybe I am not worth it. Maybe I am as horrible as I think. Maybe I should stop pushing myself forward and just give up. Maybe I won't be successful in anything anyway. All day long. Relentless. But I somehow find the strength tho shunt this negativity aside and ignore them. Except on the bad days... which if left unchecked can easily turn into months. 

Every day is a battle for me that no one knows about. I just keep fighting. 

I am currently in a very dynamic part of my life's path. It is terrifying, the stress is overwhelming, and quite honestly I would love a week-long vacation where I stay in bed to sleep and cry. But I can't because giving in even a little means throwing in the towel for the entire game.

If you are one of those people who don't give depression much weight, let me tell you that the weight of depression makes rolling over in bed a monumental chore. I am closer than ever before to where I want to be spiritually. And yet I still struggle with this shit. If it was spiritual or mental then surely it would be gone by now. My guess is that it is purely physiological and medication is the only way. And yet medication is so heavily frowned upon that it causes me to hesitate and second guess. 

**tl;dr:** When a dragon is eating you from the inside out and your only hope for survival is an herbal tea, do you listen to those telling you that the tea has negative spiritual effects?"
Does anyone else feel like they are addicted to feeling sad,"When I’m in deep depression I absolutely hate it, but when I have a good day I can’t help but crave the ‘sad’ feeling. Does anyone else feel this way?"
I self harmed again,"So yesterday was a shit day, more so than usual, and waking up today was a bitch.

I have to clarify that I don't really self harm regularly and it's not ever serious as I don't want my family to actually find out.

But today scared me bc it was so sudden, I wasn't even feeling sad at the moment just bored. Saw the knife and just did it spontaneously.

It is really scary for me bc when I usually feel sucidial, I imagine cutting my hand's veins while sitting in warm water.

What if one day I just do it? Makes you think death is so close and yet so far at the same time.

Anyways, sorry for anyone that read this I don't even know why I posted.

I just wanted to get it out of my chest I guess, I don't have anyone to talk to as no one knows anything about my mental state.
"
Teenager rant,"Ok so I'm 17.  Idk if this is a teenage thing or what but I'm miserable. 
I don't even know why im still here. Oh yea i don't have a gun that's why.
Fuck my life. 
I'm guessing feeling like this is a part of your teenage years, but all the people around me who are my age don't look like they're going through what i am going through. Not even close. They look all fine, ik now if you're reading this you'll say that's just the surface. But no its not, ik they are fine. Ok even if I'm wrong, they're not thinking about killing themselves. 
I'm just a failure. 
This is just a rant. If you read it till here, then idk thank you for your time. Say if you wanna say anything. Idk anything. "
Get your bloods checked.,"So, long term sufferer of depression here, I’d say around 5+ years of awareness and I’ve tried anti depressants with no real results. If I’m honest I was planning my suicide, I couldn’t break out of the low mood or negative thoughts and sleeping 12 hours a day isn’t really living either. Until I got a new job, pay is good but I realised most my money was going on food, and I’m not over weight. 

Even on an easy day I’d get hungry, then shakey, light headed and feel like I was going to pass out. I’d be eating 4000+ calories a day to stop this feeling. After a few weeks of this I went to the doctor, I was clear of everything major but my blood results showed my vitamin D was “depleted.” Straight onto the strong tablets, a day of headaches and nausea and all shakey symptoms had gone, then a week later and I realise my mood is vastly improved. More research turns out many suicide victims have low vitamin D. 

It’s been 3 weeks and I’ve not thought of suicide once. Please get yourself checked, you can get vitamin D tablets across the counter and you should regardless, especially during winter. This was news to me, my doctor basically looked through my medical history and was shocked I’d never had my bloods tested before. My life’s been changed by this. Good luck. "
How can i fix me...,"  

I feel completely lost in life and like I’m stuck in a tar pit. I don’t know how to drive, was never taught nor do I have the money for driving school. I cannot find a job because I have no experience what so ever. All my friends and support have died either from drugs or some form of cancer. I was never guided in any direction in life so I have no clue what I can do to fix myself. I sit here every day in my chair in front of my computer, hoping that one day an answer will come. My day consists of waking up at 5am and spending the whole day playing video games or watching YouTube, that’s all I’ve ever known. I do Yoga everyday and i workout but lately I've been struggling to see the point anymore when i am stuck in and environment that drags me down to the point where i want to kill myself. i've been told before i have environmental depression and i can see that. i'm not like this when i'm out but once i come back here i fall hard. I live at home with my mother and she could care less what I do with myself. She bitches and moans whenever I get hungry and I need to eat or she has to go shopping, she uses my name for cable and on her taxes, ect. I feel like she wants to keep me as her personal slave because she will not do anything to help me further myself or help me in anyways other than keeping me alive to serve her. I cook and clean up after her everyday, no she is not disabled but she does smoke pot. she is very capable of doing all these things herself. I have tried to ask for her help to get my license or take me to a job interview and I always get told no. I have no reliable transportation and any job that I can walk to won’t hire me, I’ve applied numerous amounts of times. I have zero money, well $200 in my savings that my recently deceased grandfather left me. He left me more but my mother needed some. I just want out and to live my life. Oh and to make matters worse i'm 32….and I have yet to have any real life experience, Job or do any type of ""adulting"" in my eyes. Judge me if you’d like but I just want help and an understanding on how to break free and live!

also, i don't know where to post this...i hope this is a decent place. i am only looking and begging for some form of help or guidance."
My friend saw my cuts,So I was at his house my sleeve slipped up he saw them went what the fuck and then I started to cry he said its alright he’s just worried but I feel disgusting about people knowing 
i wish my family understood,i wish my family understood that no one spends their whole days in bed because it feels good being absolutely useless. people do it because they have a problem. i have a problem. shit feels fucking bad and they just make me feel more guilty and useless and ashamed 
"""It's just your depression talking.""","No it's not my depression talking. When I say I have no future, I mean it. When I say I have no skills/talents I mean it. When I say that I'm a worthless human being with nothing to offer to anyone, I mean it. It's not my depression talking, it's just the brutally honest truth."
I regret coming home from Uni for spring break,"A few weeks ago, I attempted to take my own life. Without getting into the details, suffice it to say a friend got to me right before I pulled the trigger.


Since then, I’d just been waiting for the right moment to do it again. I have notes written out, everything is pretty much ready to go. I had nothing to live for. A close friend of mine killed himself a couple of years ago and the way that everyone just kept going about their day really got to me. After spending the weekend before break at a cabin with some friends, I was convinced that that was the last time I’d see of them again. Nothing really felt fulfilling.


And still nothing feels fulfilling. But after spending the week of spring break with my parents and younger brother I don’t think I can bring myself to do it anymore. I can’t imagine the years of therapy they’d need. I know my parents would wrongfully blame themselves. For that reason I regret coming home. I wish I had stayed on campus where it wouldn’t have mattered as much - I had left my parents to go to college on bad terms. I know that this time when I go back they’ll be expecting to see me again. 


I’m still absolutely tormented by my depression, but now I don’t have an out anymore. Suicide is looking like less of an option but things aren’t getting any better. Maybe they won’t. I’m considering making it look like accident once I get back, but if that’s the case I can’t really say goodbye to anyone. 

I just wanted to get this off my chest, first time posting here."
Major depression and infidelity,"Hi everyone,

I have a question about your thoughts on depression and infidelity. I have read about this already in the past, there seems to be a direct connection. That doesn't mean that infidelity is ALWAYS happening because of depression, but it can apparently happen as a coping mechanism / reckless out of character behaviour due to major depression.

I have read that during depression, the frontal lobe of the brain is affected, and this is also the part of the brain where both sexual and social behaviours are located. So if this whole area is somewhat altered, it makes much more sense that this could be related.

I have heard from severely depressed people who kissed other people than their partners or full on cheated that what they felt at the time was just a desire to feel anything at all and escape the numbness of anhedonia, to feel something that made them feel closer to life than to death, and to feel an ego boost by being regarded as attracted by someone else which helped with the low self esteem that can come with depression.

At the same time, I've heard that depression can disconnect people quite strongly from those who are actually closest to them, husbands, wives, boyfriends, girlfriends, family and friends in general, and that depression can lead to reckless behaviour because, especially when one is suicidal, one kind of just doesn't care anymore. One is just in basic survival and paradoxically in self destruct mode and uses a coping mechanism to somehow distract oneself from the darkness and pain of depression. 

I would be interested to hear your opinion with regard to depression and infidelity; what do you think it causes this if not any of the above, or do you think the above is similar to what you have experienced? If you have been unfaithful due to depression, how do you feel about it and what made you do it..?

Apologies if this is very personal, but I am really very interested in this subject because knowing more about it can help a lot of people, I think, because it can cause so much unnecessary pain for the partner as well as for the depressed person who went off track, and understanding these connections a bit better can be very positive for people. I believe this is a subject that has not yet been discussed or researched as much as it should be. Healing and forgiveness/self-forgiveness starts with understanding.

Thank you very much everyone and take care.

"
The way I feel.,"I feel alone. Trully alone. I see others on instagram or in real life. They have friends. I also have friends, according to the worlds perspective. But it’s not that type of friendship that I always wanted to accomplish. I always wanted a REAL friend. My only friends are my classmates. That’s it. But they don’t care about me. And I care a lot more for them than they do for me. There are and were birthday parties that I never got invited. There were birthday parties that I got invited but I never went to because they would think “oh poor guy, I’m invinting him”. There were times in which they went to hang together, but I never got invited. I say goodmorning, and they seem to just ignore me. It’s sad. And well, I see others. Having fun. Together. My “friends” and other people that I don’t know. They are happy. They laugh. They... they are what I wanted to have. But it’s just strange. I’m strange. And I’m writing this because I probably would forget. This will be a memory. 

People always say that childhood is fantastic. I find it not true. People always competing to be the best, the best looking, to have a girlfriend, etc. etc.. And here I am, looking for a friend. A REAL friend. One that would understand what I feel, how I feel, one that once felt the same. Loneliness. But I also wanted someone cool. Not THAT cool, someone that I felt like it was cool. And I also wanted to feel cool. Not from them, But from him. I just wanted one friend. One TRUE friend. But I can’t just snap my fingers. I would have to search. Where could I search? Places where my was interest could be located. Well, that’s the problem, I can’t really do it. There aren’t that many places in my area that interest me. And I also lost practice.

I once had a true friend. That was true friendship. D. was my true friend. But, we were both young. He left the school. I tried to make new friends. Never happened until 7th grade. I already talked with him once, but he changed. He wasn’t the funny guy anymore. He wasn’t fun anymore. I didn’t find him cool anymore. He didn’t find me cool anymore. Some things changed. It’s life, it can’t be changed.

In 7th grade I met a new friend. From the start I already new it was not the same. R. was a football player. He knew a lot of people and even though he considered me his “second best friend”, I knew it was not true. I would get replaced a lot of times, even though I was his 2.º best friend. But it wasn’t from his best friend. It was from other people. It reached a point I changed my plan. Rather than staying friends, I decided that I would try to be really friendly towards him, and once high school hit, I would just stop talking to him. Stop interacting with him. So he could experience how it felt. Of course it didn’t change anything. I was already replaced. Shame on me.

I still sometimes miss some things from him.

On 9th grade I started hanging out in the breaks with a group of girls. They were and are very nice to me. The problem is that after school some days they all hang together. And on weekends. And I never get invited. I never understood why. Is it a girls thing? I never got invited to their birthday parties, nor get included in some conversations. Is this normal? I don’t know.

Last year started. I, again, made another friend. I, again, was replaced. I was lost. He was lost too. We started playing, he was focused on school, so did I. But. But the reputation of being cool was stronger. And yet I lost another friend, he started hanging out with “famous” people from school. He did not only replace me but also his 2 true friends. Only for fame. Instead of a good job J. decided he wanted to be a cool kid for 3 years. Shame on him. 

Just before last year ended, I started regaining hope. I started giving attention to a quiet guy who also was most of his life lonely. He was and is kind for people. Like I am. I wanted to show him that I was there if I needed. I started talking to him, so he would know I was there for him. I supported him. But this time, I was not replaced. I was not even chose. It’s not his fault. P. just sticked with other people and that’s fine. I don’t want to obligate people to be my friends. Even though I was not replaced, it once again felt like it. Shame on me. Even though it happened, he is still one of the most enjoyable guys from the class, though. 

Lately I have been having strange dreams. The first one appeared after some time I started talking to a stranger online, around my age. We share the same interests and problems. He seems interested, and so I am. He did appear in one my dreams. It was about me running away from my problems, from school, from my house. And he was there. He helped me. He conforted me. Even though it was just a dream, C. was there for me. That dream is what I call friendship. That is what a true friend is to me. If this friendship lasts forever, which I hope it will, I will have to thank a random guy who made a post asking for a subreddit to make friends. Thank you, kind stranger. And thank you, C, for being there even though you weren’t there.

Another dream involved F. I never talked to him in person. But he seems like a good guy. He helped me and drove me to Spain. We ran out of school. It was an illegal thing what he was doing. But he did it for me. I felt nice and relieved until I woke up and realised it was just a dream. 

But as most people say, college is the place to make friends. I hope I will find people that have the same interests. Mature people. Sadly there are more 2 years between happiness and this moment. I’ve been through much already. I’m almost there.

I’ll be fine, I guess. 

If you read this, I have to say thanks. This is just the way I feel. I don’t even think I’m depressed (I can find happiness in some other things), but I felt like this was the sub for it.

Once again, thank you."
Should I tell my counselor how depressed I TRULY am?,"I've recently started to go to therapy. In my first couple sessions, he did a couple tests on me, which seemed to indicate that I have some form of depression, along with anxiety. Combined with ADHD(I've had all my life), it's hard to deal with things. I do not want to kill myself, nor do I self-harm, but I constantly wish someone would run over me with a car, or something.

&#x200B;

Long story warning ahead

&#x200B;

I guess if I had to trace my life back to where I started to first feel this way, it was about two years ago. There was A girl I met who worked at a local convenience store I somehow became friends with, and well, instantly fell for her. Nothing ever happened between us. Six Months later, she hit a moose in a car accident and died. On the day I find out about her accident, I discover that one of my supposed friends had been  sleeping with her for sometime. But that actually wasn't what pissed me off. What made me furious and wanting to attack this friend, was that he admitted the night she was killed, he was talking to her on FB messenger(while she was driving at the time which her accident would occur) and she was driving and talking to him on the messenger app on her phone, distracting her. As far as I'm concerned, he is entirely responsible for her death, and I will never forgive him for killing my best friend. The worst part is, a few months after, he got to run away to ...somewhere in the West Coast of the U.S.(Cant remember, just glad I dont have to see him again)  , and start over, while I was left here to rot away in my  hometown, grieving for my friend, with all these memories.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Fast Forward to January of 2019, I had to move back in with my parents at 29 years old. I had to move in because I thought I had finished my last semester of College in December before I could graduate, and since I thought I was a graduate, that meant I couldn't continue working in my work-study job at my school (which helped me pay for my old place). It's bad enough moving back in with your parents, but even if I had found another job, I couldn't stand dealing with my garbage roommate anymore.

&#x200B;

 Only about a month ago, my adviser from the university e-mails me and says I am actually behind 12 credits before I can graduate in May, so I had to enroll in B.S. elective classes a month late in order to try and beat the deadline and get those credits so I can graduate. I was able to get financial aid(and my workstudy job back) for the time being. I've discussed this part specifically with my counselor in the few sessions we have had so far.  

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Should I tell my counselor about how depressed I am, specifically how I wish  a car or something would hit me? I don't self-harm, or plan to off myself, because I have too much going on, and it would devastate my parents. But I am afraid if I tell my counselor, he might have me locked up/committed, and I can't afford that currently. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

My counselor thinks meds of some sort would help me.  He gave me a referral to a psych specialist of some sort I am supposed to meet with. Basically to ask me some questions and properly determine which meds for the depression/anxiety would benefit me the most. 

  

&#x200B;

with any luck, I am supposed to graduate in May, and I can't be locked up two months before that. "
"21, f***ing depressed, thinking of ending it soon","I just don't know what to do anymore. I'm 21, studying, I've ""got so much potential"" but I can't do anything because I'm so depressed.

"Seizures, confusion, and jeez I'm feeling bad again.","I messed up real bad.  
1) A simple mistake, a product of me being the fucking airhead I am, and I messed up my girlfriend's life. She might be facing suspension in her school she tells me, and we haven't talked in days. I don't think she blames me, but I hate myself for it.   
2) I've had two seizures this year, where I spaz and black out for 30 minutes each time, and I have no idea why. Lack of sleep? Brain tumor? Stress?  
I'm good at nothing, I feel so lost and there's so much shit in my head, I want it to stop. So many voices telling me different things, I can't feel a certain way.

Purpose,"I'm lost. I have no reason to get up each day. I have no reason to keep going. I work a job in which I feel like I just float through for 40 hours a week. I play video games, read books, and watch movies looking for some inspiration or truth to awaken my soul, if such a thing exists. People ask me what I think or believe about politics, religion, or whatever, stuff that most people deem important, and honestly I don't care. I often fantasize about sitting in a lawn chair, naked except aviator sunglasses, whilst watching mushroom clouds sprout in the distance or a meteor stiking the planet; obliterating everything. I'm tired of everything and I'm tired of trying to transcend from just existing. I want to know why I wake up everyday to... this. I want a reason to go on. I want a reason to live. I want to know why I am here. I want to know what my purpose is. "
Hey again,"So I’ve gotten my meds doubled and I’ve been REALLY TRYING in school, well, I’m still getting Cs on average and my parents just took everything that makes me happy away if my best gets me this than why should i stick around?

Help me please "
Being born with mental retardation has despoiled me from ever being an equal amongst people...life ain’t fair for us. (Might make a YouTube video about this post),"This is an immensely long thread scroll down to TLTR: or chose sections of the paragraphs. If you wish also some are already mentioned in my previous posts. 

(Discovery of my mental retardation and how it effects 3% of the world population) 

Upon the discovery that my parents withheld information about my mental disabilities (Aspergers and M.I.D.) for 18 years of my existence my initial reaction was sheer detest directed to them for deceiving me my entire life. however I’ve grown to understand why... nevertheless they should’ve told me (even though they’re the direct cause of they I have it) and why I am, the way I am and why I cannot never be par on any social and intellectual standards. and seeking the answers to the questions I’ve been yearning for . Being diagnosed with mental retardation and Aspergers has prevented from ever being a normal person. People like i, are  more or less 1-3% of the world’s population according to research and make 85% of people diagnosed with mental retardation. The average iq of a person in the Western world should be  85-115 however people with Mild Intellectual Disability (although it may state “Mild” it still effects our everyday lives immeasurably) have the iq between 50-75. 80 iq if some of us are dedicated to erudition till their 30’s achieving to  that extent. Although I may seem to some as relatively normal with my approach and saying big loquacious words and all but it’s just nothing more than a false facade because my iq and maturity levels is  of an average 12 year old and I recently failed an iq test conforming it. although I’m an 18  years of age and normal people usually prepare for university around that time. 

(Depression and confusion has lead me to ensure and endure my entire life in result of it) 

Honestly M.I.D. Is the reason why I’m not able to make friends, not able to properly function social environments like school, parties, and other relating social environment. I always knew that they was something wrong with me when I realised at 14  that “everyone has problem with me and they’re not the problem I am”  which has lead me being perpetually depressed for years almost every single day since i was 8 I even attempted suicide at that age even though I didn’t comprehend what it was I was just so sick of a being a bird trapped in a open caged.  

(Psychological breakdowns, no one can ever understand me) psychological breakdowns are frequent on an monthly basis for the past several years for me. Since I’m alone 9/10 of the time it’s usually never present when I present myself to people however I could have one in front people if I feel pressured or harassed by certain for a long time. The worst part no one will or  could understand even if they tried to emphasise. The only thing that’s keeping alive is only music. Artists like Capital Steez, Kurt Cobain,Marlin Manson etc. give me some sort of subtle human empathy. 


(Boring story about the only friend I had skip if you wish)

I used to be extremely mad about the last friend I had he practically ignored all of my calls, messages, invitations to a rendezvous without really stating a reason he just wanted me off of his timeline even though I should’ve realised he didn’t like me like that much even though I’ve been friends with him for over 4 years and chilled with him a couple times (even enticing him to go to one of those underage parties with me you pay like 25 to get in and like a ranted hall mixed with 16-21 year old practically a mini-club. He had a really good time so did his other friend that tagged along but it was horrible to me and realised I’m not the kind of person who should be in those environment... being short and fugly doesn’t help either I’ve digress) and I thought our friendship was in a great position. He was really the only dude I felt he was only person he actually kind of cared for me even though it was transparent he didn’t care all that much about my trails and tribulations but he still listened at times. I’ve always loved him more than myself until he axed from his life. 

(More about people with Intellectual disabilities and how we function in our social lives) 

People with M.I.D. Are unintentionally very insecure people with unintentional disrespectful behavioural patterns. I’ve disrespected An innumerable amount people because we (the people with intellectually disabilities) can’t forsee the consequences of the words we may say or even understand what’s disrespectful about the words we unintentionally blurred out until later. it usually takes me three days to recognise how someone who interpret my statements and questions as uncalled, demeaning and shallow. Offhanding statements that can lead to altercations and being ostracised from everyone. 

(In regard how I function in social circumstances and people typical responses)

I usually get ridiculed as a “dry cunt” because my brain can hardly function in social barriers and even when I do try my best it still never works in my favour leaving mr better to be secluded in social circumstances than to be involved in social circumstances because people will see how why people hate me and I can’t control it 9/10 of the time being an unlikable condescending asshole or an antisocial loner.

(The flaws in result of my disability) 

It’s the reason why I can’t make friends, establish an amorous relationship, never being capable of being accepted to university 

(Denouncing my sexuality and the ensuing lustful predilections and bloodline may have caused it)

I’ve utterly denounced my sexuality because I’m confident my disability is caused by genetics because unfortunately I come from an Arab purist Muslim background meaning my family tree has a long history of centuries old incestors first cousin shagging on both side of my parents bloodline. However my parents aren’t blood related but my dad can’t  write beyond child level literacy in his native language and English who probably has the iq of an average 13 year old likewise with my mum even though she was born in the west. 

(Why my hypothesis is why we shouldn’t sire kids but adopt kids instead they we are psychologically capable) 

 Because It’d be incredibly selfish and senseless for someone with hereditary disabilities Genetics to sire a child who are Immensely more likely to inherit the disabilities compared to normal people. They are already to many people of this earth and people like us shouldn’t sire a child who will are likely to suffer just like us or even more. If your someone like me I suggest to adopt a child if your intellectually capable due to disabilities like us don’t sire a child who may get your lifelong disabilities. They are more than 140  million orphans in the world you could adopt and change their lives. By doing that it’s one less suffering in the world.

(Too dumb and unqualified to get a job, broke, living on government benefits. ) 

I dropped out of school in year 10 believing it was best for me considering that fact I still had year 6 intellect, and failed all of my exams. my principle abided by my wishes as long I could get a job. However I did get a job a in a construction site I was to mentally slow, physically weak, and overall not reaching requirements within 4 months I got fired. spending a year and a half jobless and lying to my school that I’m employed so I don’t have to go back there. I had few other jobs one with my bother in-law being a roofer. He fired me being to mentally to adjust slow adjust  after a month and other jobs that lasted usually a week for similar reasons. I am going back to school attempting to get certificate a year 10 certificate. However they are difficulties that pose as incomprehensible to me in the classes which was financed by my government. And if I fail it I have second chances on their benefits. 


(Islam and Muslim culture could be the reason of my disabilities) 
 Muslims half of the time give their sons and daughters as token of troths to their their cousins who  may or not be three four times  the age of the child forced into the marriage against their will because on their defences will be is that 1.  “we must keep the money within the blood” usually the people who say this literally are one of the most poorest people you’ll ever come across also extremely idiotic and undereducated 2. “How could you allow your daughter to merry some stranger ? He’ll kill and rob us all !” As hard as may be unbelievable but theses inadequate humans filth have phobias of Strangers marrying their kids unless their very close family friends they might abide it or a family being in a very economically great conditions which they allow their kid to marry so they could leach off from them. 3. “We negotiated a deal between him and his parents you must marry him or else”  I literally know grown men women who were physically and mentally  abused by their parents on a daily basis for refusing marrying cousins at 13 to someone as old as them who are also being also groomed or someone in their forties who sexually abused them. Mohammad has dammed us all from greater Arabia to India. However Muslims won’t blame Muhammad as Muslims Arabs and indo-europeans apologist or jihadis will say 


TLTR: mental retardation has ruined my everyday life can’t get a job, living on government benefits due my disability, not capable of higher education, iq of an average 13 year old, can’t make friends nor progress in life, also denouncing my sexuality so i can’t sire kids who may suffer like me. Just want to be like everyone else. 

and I might make a YouTube video explaining about it just like that dude who made video about being ugly and unlikeable. "
why do i always end up going back cutting myself,i always think it's over. i should have learned the last two times that it never ends.
Failing @ school and at everything,"Its my last semester, or should be but i already failed 2 classes  (again) because I stopped showing up due to my depression. I want to take a break but I'm already on Academic Probation. I'm at a really good school pursuing art but I came to hate what I love. I am alone in a city where idk anyone. "
What can I do to help?,"She's always been so strong, never telling us her problems. Now that she's hit rock bottom I don't even know what I can do to comfort her. I rarely see her and I don't even know if I'll ever see her again. What can I do to help? "
Anyone tried transcranial magnetic stimulation?,"I had a consultation for it last week and will be getting it, pending insurance approval. It’s relatively new as far as depression treatments go, so I’m curious to hear about others’ experience with it. "
I just want it to end.,"I always feel so isolated and alone. I always picture how happy people would be if i was gone, because i'm already invisible anyway. I sat at work thinking about how i was going to kill myself the entire time, and i'm still thinking on it. I'm so tired of being alone, and dealing with the bad thoughts in my head everyday. I'm tired of battling with myself. I just want to be gone. Everything i've wanted won't happen, and there's nothing i'm going to miss 😔"
Fuck this bullshit. Enough is enough!,"“Sometimes the smallest step in the right direction ends up being the biggest step of your life. Tiptoe if you must, but take a step.”  

I know it’s whole hell of a lot easier said than done, but fight back today against this horrible illness! I’m sick of getting kicked in the teeth by my depression everyday! Aren’t you? Life definitely isn’t all sunshine and rainbows, but there’s gotta be at least one thing or two that you still enjoy in this world even if it seems impossible to find the strength to get up and do it most days. DO IT! Prove to yourself that there’s still some happiness to be found in this life if you just do a little searching for it!

Your recovery starts today. No more putting it off for month after month like I have. 

Wherever you find some hope TELL US ABOUT IT! I could use some positivity and inspiration in my life, and I know I’m not alone.



"
I resent my existence so much.,"My parents were/are two of the biggest losers on the planet. My mom committed suicide was I was 14 even though she kept me from having a relationship with my father. Though we did have good memories together and she truly wanted the best for me, well most of the time. I mainly resent her decision to give birth to the child of my stupid brute of a father. He ended up having four kids with three baby mamas, four failed marriages. For some reason or another, did not stay in any of his kids' lives for the entirety of their childhood. He's ugly af and I inherited it. But at least his baby boomer ass is educated with a dumb ass psychology degree. lmao. Then he had a stroke at around 50. I'd have more empathy for him if he wasn't an alcoholic loser which probably caused it. He doesn't even feel bad about not really being a father to me. Not taking me on any trips, not taking me and my friends out. My mom did 100x more for me. I wouldn't mind giving him a bloody nose for giving me this miserable existence."
Existential depression,"I live a pretty ‘normal’ life. I do things with people and have ‘fun’, but nothing has ever brought me happiness in life. It’s not like I’m a rich kid who has it all and now is like well what else is there to life; I’m in a low income household. There’s so much more to do in my lifetime but nothing I’ve done so far has brought genuine happiness. I’ve come close to committing suicide multiple times but I just keep backing out last second I guess because maybe there is something out there that will bring me genuine happiness. Life just seems so pointless and I’m thoroughly convinced it is.
I had a massive post ready to send but figured it was too big so I made this smaller one to see how that goes. And what I mean by “how that goes”? Idk. I might not even have depression considering I can get out of bed, but feeling pointless feels pretty depressing imo."
Supporting someone with depression,"I'm not sure if I'm in the right place, but maybe some of you could offer me (F 25) advice on supporting my partner (M 27) who suffers from high-functioning depression? Or maybe point me in the direction of forums for this so I can post in a more appropriate place? I guess I just want to talk to other people with similar experiences who can offer me advice. 

I don't know what to say when he tells me matter-of-factly that he will kill himself when he's 30 or 40 or 50 (whatever age seems unbearable to him at the time) because he will never accomplish anything with his life or feel happiness. He's in therapy but his therapist doesn't seem particularly helpful, he's even voiced that he'd like CBT homework but she told him she mainly focuses on talk therapy. I've considered assigning him worksheets myself from self-help books, but, of course, I'm not his therapist and this is not my job. He doesn't have the motivation to help himself, he has internalized this ""fact"" that he is worthless and a terrible human being. He doesn't want to take medication but I feel like it may be necessary to get over this lack of motivation and lack of energy (he can sleep for 12+hours at a time). I have supported his decision to go without because I don't think it's my place to make that decision for him, but how could I go about telling him that I think he ought to try? I also worry that giving him motivation/energy without self-esteem may drive him to be more... proactive? about suicide. I don't know. I'm proud of him for finally being open and honest with me about his feelings, for a long time in our relationship he felt it necessary to hide these things from me and distance himself (and even break up with me once) because he didn't feel like he could ever be good enough for me. I hope I've finally convinced him that I can make my own decisions but I still worry that one day he'll think he's ""saving me"" by leaving me.

Also, I feel like I can't support him as well as other partners could because I have a pretty severe sleep disorder which causes me to sleep at incredibly irregular hours of the day. For instance, today I slept from 3pm- 11pm and last week I was sleeping from 8am-4pm. I constantly have to cancel appointments and social events because I simply won't be awake. I take classes online but I don't know if I'll ever be able to have a regular job. I have a CBT-I therapist who assures me it is possible for me to maintain a regular schedule with the right interventions (light therapy, timed melatonin, regular exercise) but I've only attended two sessions so far and it hasn't been anything I haven't tried on my own. It's frustrating to feel that I may never be able to do something as simple as schedule an exercise class for my partner and I to attend regularly. I can say that I often enter a sort of depression due to this intense insomnia but not in the same way as my partner. Generally I'm more anxious and not suicidal, though I certainly feel hopelessness, listlessness, and lethargy. My partner will wake up for events that I tell him are important to me or when he's scheduled for earlier shifts than usual, perhaps because he doesn't value his own sleep/health enough to care about waking up. I'm sure that if it were possible for me, I could get him to wake up for regular exercise and, potentially, improve his mood.

TL;DR: Partner has high-functioning depression (has a job, can keep social engagements), I have a sleep disorder and am currently low-functioning (no job, online school, can't keep social engagements). I don't know how to help."
I don't even take good care of my pets no more.,"Their litter is always full, I constantly forget to feed them and fill their water up, God I don't even play with them anymore. It makes me feel horrible and I don't do anything about it. And they cuddle against me all the time and I just ignore them. I just want to stay in bed all day and not do anything.

It's made me not want my pets and they were the only reason I still got up.

I fucking hate my depression and I can't fucking wait until it gets so bad that I try and kill myself."
Why is it so hard to ask for help?,"I'm afraid of talking about my problems and depressive thoughts because I don't want to seem weak or hurt anyone. I feel like I'm not allowed to speak. I can't tell anyone about my feelings. It makes me feel guilty.

I've had depressive thoughts for many years now. I have never talked about my problems to anyone, not even to the closest people. When my mother found out I was having depressive thoughts 4 months ago, she was comforting me for hours. She was being so understanding and sweet but even then I wasn't able to say a word to her or move an inch even though I really wanted to. I just hid my face and cried. I couldn't watch her in the eyes when she spoke to me. I didn't want to see her sad because of me.

I want to go see a therapist but I feel like even then I wouldn't be able to say a thing. Why is it so hard to ask for help?"
Brain feels psychically sick ?,"Very difficult one for me to even try and articulate, but anyone else actually feel like ( like a physical feeling, in the same context you would feel a tummy ache ) their brain / head is ill / (physically sick)? A heavy head. 

It’s accompanied with a sense of impending doom, a lot of panic and anxiety and a general sense of dread and doom / gloom. 

It’s not just depression and anxiety, it’s something much worse for a period of time.

Unrequited love and total loneliness,"I used to have a girlfriend for two years and after that we decided to stay friends. Recently she started new serious relationships and I realised, that she was that special to me, I couldn’t even imagine being that happy with someone else. Then, after I told her about that, she said not to talk to her ever again. I’m completely alone and lost, there is no one who cares about my despair. I feel like I’m going to commit suicide next month, but how can I escape that?"
"Go for walk, get a bagel!","I have been going through a tough time in my life for the last 9 months or so. But things have gotten better for me in the last couple of months. A few things that helped me was writing about my feelings. I would write about everything that I was going through and how that made me felt. The simple act of penning everything down made me feel much better. And the other thing was talking to people. Not about your problems per say, but just anything at all. 

A lot of us are going through a depression, and are somehow just trying to make it through the day, one day at a time. Know that you are not the only one in stress, look around, there are many more. I know this doesn't help, of course, it doesn't. But you know what does. Talking to people. Not about your problems. Talk about anything, with anybody. Random things, that meme you saw the other day or how the new Zomato logo is shitty or how Indian politics is going to the dumps. Just try it. A random conversation can do a lot to lift your shitty mood.

This definitely helped me. Hope this helps you too!! :)

"How do i know whether it's my depression telling me to isolate myself, or whether it's the people around me causing my depression?","I have found at times that being completely alone has helped my depression, i mean like supplies delivered directly to the house, enough books to read, slow internet and no tv/news and such, i go into a state where i'm sort of detached from the world. 

It is actually very hard to be solitary in this world as everything is so connected, and upon trying to connect again i find myself at odds with the wider world, either because my social skills have atrophied, or i have no genuine desire to be a part of the group. Anyone relate?"
I feel depressed for so many reasons yet it seems like I have no reason to be,"I feel lonely, ugly, stupid, and downright useless. It feels like something from me is missing without me missing anything. My only friends are a small group of about 5 people online who I frequently get into arguments with which has lead me or them to completely stop talking to each other for weeks on end. I’m homeschooled so no friends irl, and when I was in school I hated the kids there. None of them done anything I liked and some were just plain rude. I was never good at anything close to talking to girls, or infront of class for presentations. The last time I remember doing a presentation, my teacher had to tell me 2 times to speak up so they could hear me until she just said I can go back to my seat. As far as girls go, I’ve never had a girlfriend, let alone a friend who is a girl. Fuck it I don’t even know what to write anymore. I’ve been trying to accurately say everything that I feel is making me sad or depressed for the last 30 minutes but every word I write makes me feel like I shouldn’t even make this cause no one can help. I’m fucking lonely and stupid. Most of what I post is questions, I ask questions to things I should’ve understood long ago. I’ve never had a girlfriend, homeschooled so that makes the situation worse. I feel ugly with a horrible personality so there’s no appeal for anyone to want to be with me if even fucking possible. I just want to hug someone, my heart feels empty and I just want to help people. I want someone to depend on me and feel like I’ve made my mark in the world by making even one person happy but I just fucking can’t and I feel so terrible."
Nothing makes me happy.,"Gonna go in a sauna soon. This will be pretty boring, but atleast it's something else. I want to buy some candy, not because I want it, but eating is the most satisfying thing to do.

Doing something that makes me happy is hard to imagine."
Just wanted to share some positivity,"I'm having a good day today and want to remind all of you going through this that you're precious, loved individuals. Even though your brain is trying to tell you otherwise, there are people who care about you and want you to be happy and are willing to support you. Sending loads of virtual hugs to everyone around the world having a tough time ❤️"
How do I help my depressed girlfriend?,"So like the title says, my girlfriend has been dealing with some form of depression and anxiety for a while. However, over the past few months it has gotten so much worse, i can see her spiraling down. Because of that she lashes out at her mom and I alot. Overall, I just need some advice with how I can help her. Thank you"
15 mg remeron giving me erectile dysfunction?,I have been on 15 mg of remeron for about 7 days but I just noticed I can’t get it hard anymore. Before I was able to masturbate twice or three times a day but now I can’t even get an erection. I called the doctor and he said that remeron isn’t causing these side effects. Does anyone have experience with this? I plan to stop taking remeron for 4 days to see if the problem will go away. 
Can depression hit without a bad event,"I am having for the first time in my life depression ( this feeling is lasting for more than 1 month) I am 19 years old and I am having weird thoughts and strange emotions.
First of all, I have always been an introvert person but if someone talks with me, I would start a conversation but I will never start it.
For the past week, I had the feeling of being lonely even though, I am surrounded with people at work and during weekend, it's making me feel even more lonely and I am becoming lazy day by day.
I feel like the part of my brain related to memories is working 100% and I can remember things in my childhood and it makes me feel afraid of becoming crazy.
All this sadness, I don't know where it came from, and I am afraid of having it forever.
What's your advice? "
"Depressed heart broken, anyone else keep stuff they should get rid of but just can’t delete it?","12 years of school and no one taught me how to deal with heartbreak. The memories are what keeps me alive. I have my old iPhone 4 and still have all my texts, my pictures, and most importantly all the voice mails she said she loved me in. Ugh, fuck my life."
depression and friends,"i think my depression is ruining my relationship with my bestfriend, lately things haven’t been going well with me and i feel so insecure and my brain just keeps on telling me my bestfriend hates me and i don’t really wanna destroy our friendship. "
"A note for P, one of the people who had the biggest impact of my life (for better or worse) in the past 2 years.","It was odd that anything, much less a friendship, could happen beneath the flat glare of classroom lights. Yet somehow it did. To be clear, I didn't start talking to you with romantic intentions in mind. To think of it, I was actually quite rude; I asked you about your scars, so prominently shown on your arms. And before I met you, I always thought you were a bit odd, but not unlike any other art student or troubled teen. 

But then somehow, we started to talk more and more. I remember you asking me to go down to the mall with you before our English exam. It was 11 am, and barely any restaurants were open. On the ride down, I remember you telling me about your future aspirations, beyond grades. It was an uncertain one. You didn't know what you wanted to be. 

Over the summer, I'd like to think we became even closer. I remember staying up at ungodly hours just to keep talking to you. It was a simpler time then. 

Then one night, you called me with tears in your voice. You were terrified, and so was I. You, at the prospect of being in imminent danger, and me, completely at a loss as to what to do. These drunk calls would only increase over the past months. Sometimes you were happy, but mostly you were melancholy and tearful. You'd always talk about Ethan, but even he would soon fade from our conversations. You would always end the call with ""I'm ok"". A little white lie that we all tell ourselves. 

Our first lunch together was unremarkable, except for one thing. I'll never forget the strawberry whisky you ordered, and the overwhelming nervousness I felt. You already know how I felt about it, and to be honest, it was the first time anyone ordered alcohol in front of me.

I still remember that fateful dinner on Kingston Street, even if you don't. We went to the park bench at night. A cool breeze blew as we sat and just talked, about everything, and nothing. I remember you pulling out that damn juul I hated so much -- death, in a slim white pod --, and me trying to wrestle a twenty dollar bill back into your pocket. Just before that, you'd been carded when trying to buy alcohol at a supermarket. I told myself I was doing the right thing by not letting you. 

On the Wednesday before mocks, I was beyond ecstatic. I woke up of my own accord, eager about the day to come. As I paced back and forth in the station, trying to find your silhouette in the shifting waves of people, time passed by nefariously. I was already on my way home when you told me you were sick. 

So began my selfish grudge. One that would last until the end of mocks, and one I tried to excuse as being busy with mocks. I didn't think you cared about me, not one bit. Yet to this day, you are still the only person to tell me that I mattered to them. 

Spring Ball came and went like shimmers on the waves of oceans. The photo and the small talk made me wish I wasn't so stupid to hold that damn childish grudge. It was one of the moments where I felt genuinely happy. 

Yet in less than 3 days, everything changed. You were distant. Cold. Then came the call on Friday. Your words tore a gash in my heart that is still trying to mend. In the context of the words you said to me, I realise this only makes it worse. I know, and your friends will agree with me, my mannerisms are my fault alone. Nonetheless, I feel compelled to tell you, well, something. Anything.

We've been through thick and thin together, and you know so much about me that I wouldn't feel safe sharing to anyone else. But I wonder if the same is true for you. I began to question if you were just using me like some emotional cushion, always there for you. Whether or not we had a friendship, or was I simply a tool for you to use when you needed validation, all for gratis. All of them lingering shadows of doubt that scuttled across my mind. Perhaps they were just part of my usual delirium-induced paranoia, or perhaps they held a modicum of a truth. I hope it's the former. 

""As a friend"" were words that came to our talks with increasing frequency. A drunk mind speaks a sober heart; I should have known when you called me at one of your parties and you told your friends you ""didn't like [me]"". It would be dishonest for me to continue this friendship with you, especially now that you've found someone else. I admit, I'm far too selfish to stay in a relation where we fundamentally want different things out of each other. Mea culpa. 

Please do not think for a moment that this is any way your fault. It's mine and mine alone. That said, we've troubled each other long enough. Thank you, and goodbye."
Does anyone have some advice on how to study when you're emotionally drained and don't have the strength?,"I have to finish my grades this week and I have a lot of studying to do. However, for the last couple of months I've been struggling with lack of motivation to do anything, really, but I have to finish this. But it's impossible when even brushing my teeth feels like a hard task. Does anyone have any tips on how to, even for a short period of time, gain some motivation just to finish this? I've managed do, for the past two weeks, finish some of my grades and it went well but I feel like I really don't have any energy left."
Rant,"Everyday is the same.
I wake up, with no motivation, don't want to do anything.
Eat, go to work.
Get home, don't want to do anything.
Dinner, sleep.
Repeat.

I think to myself: ' If I could be anywhere I wanted, where would I be?' 

And i don't have answer cause I don't feel shit anymore and don't want to do nothing.


How many of you feel the same cycle?
"
Might be getting fired... I won’t survive this,"I will know by the end of next week if I’ll be getting fired for just cause. I fucked up bad at work but my job is my life. I love my job and I’ve worked so hard to get where I am that if I get fired I know I won’t survive.

The only thing that gets me out of bed is my work. Without it I’m nothing. I don’t know what to do... the reason I’m still here is my work if I don’t have that there’s no reason to go on.

"
Can depression meds make you forget things?," I've been on medication since January, and I've noticed that i forget things like what day it is or where i put my phone a minute after i put it down. I also pace a lot, and can't keep my mind on one thing at times. Does anyone relate to this or is it a separate problem?"
Stuck in a depressing vicious cycle of loneliness,"I’m sad as fuck, I can’t stop eating and I have no motivation.

There was I guy I liked who I was seeing frequently for a while, as like a friendly thing (or maybe more), and it upsets me that it brought my life so much meaning. It infuriates me that someone else can have such a huge impact on my life, and now that they’ve seemingly lost interest because they’re busy or they don’t care or whatever, I’m having a hard time motivating myself and going further with my life. 

I grew so much in that short period of time where I was inspired by being able to see him. This has never happened to me before. I’m afraid it’s never going to happen again because I’m not good enough, and yet, in order to become better, I feel like I need someone like that in my life. Because I feel so lonely, empty and useless."
Getting in trouble for being late or not going at all. Too embarrassed to admit I'm depressed,"I'm almost always late to school or just don't go at all due to depression. I just can't physically pull myself out of bed. Everything in me wants to die. And says there is no point to even wake up. I've been feeling this since grade 5. Grade 10 now and the feeling gets worse each year. I've missed over 3 months of school just this year because I'm severely depressed. Im too scared and embarrassed to admit to the people around me why I'm missing all these days. So I just say I'm sick. I guess it's not a lie, I'm sick mentally. But I hate keeping this all in, but I'm embarrassed because I feel I'm probably too young to be feeling this. Any time I try to talk about just even some of my feelings such as the fear of oncoming death I'm just laughed at by all the adults saying I have a lot of years left. Yes I know. But I'm depressed. I'm not going to just suddenly feel better from that. 
So basically me just saying. 
I'm depressed
Missing a lot of important work from it
Too embarrassed to admit I'm depressed
So I'm getting no help for it
Getting worse every year

I don't know what your meant to post on here but it felt good to get this off my chest. "
Im getting kinda depressed.,"26, male. I guess in a way i was doing soooo many of these fucking posts because of my narcisstic ass attitude, like ""oh look im having a hard time which makes me interesting when i do become successful."" But I'm actually getting kinda depressed for real. I think if i do end up killing myself, from just being too afraid to go outside, and not wanting to accept who i have become, then it would be maybe helium or hanging. Due to depression and a bad dose of general anxiety disorder, I'm so indecisive but i will decide when the time has come for me. After this post i'll draft up a suicide note. All i do is go online and obsess that i don't have a GF, and it's too hard to find friends now. I just don't feel very hopeful about my future. Girls have been giving me more attention since i go to the gym, but I'm getting exhausted from trying to read their minds. My job is fucking easy but stressful which makes me feel dumb, and i do jackshit everyday. There's this girl at work who we both seem like we are liking each other and i feel pretty confident about getting with her, i just want to take it slowly but, you know how people are. It's never a good idea to expect good things really. "
More sensitive when depressed,"I’ve fallen back into (yes, clinically diagnosed) depression about a week ago. I have gotten a lot more sensitive (like my feelings get hurt a lot easier,) which also happened the last time I was depressed. Is it just me?"
Any ideas on how to keep myself motivated?,"I dread everyday and hate everyday because I have nothing in my life besides school and social media. I get really sad that I’m doing nothing with myself, but at the same time I can’t bring myself to do anything because I think I’ll look stupid, won’t be able to do it, or it’s a waste of time (even tho I’m not doing anything with my time rn 😂) any advice from anyone going through something similar :/ thanks"
I failed my suicide attempt,I did the deed and failed. Now my family keeps a close eye on everything I do and prevents me from hanging out with the only friends I can converse my problems with. They all think I lack faith and it would be the only thing that would save me. I really want serious help. I don't want to be alone with myself since it's the greatest enemy I have. I don't wanna live a life forced down on me.
A lot of people nowadays lack basic empathy.,"And it is a fucking pain to deal with them when you're severely depressed. Everyday I encounter so many rude and miserable people, who relish in targeting those they can see as vulnerable and it irritates me so much. I just hate people who are nasty or feel the need to berate someone they can tell is vulnerable. It's particularly annoying when it's someone like a therapist, doctor, somebody you'd trust with your medical needs, that is cold and dismissive. This reaffirms by belief that most people don't care or understand what it's like to have a mental illness, which makes living a lot more difficult."
Unappreciated.,"I don’t know if it’s the right sub to rant but I need it. So I play a band in my school, and it was going great, but the problem is they kept on pushing me to cover songs that is way out of my genre. And being the fucking cunt I am, I just adjust to the situation. But another problem is that, they couldn’t play the songs. And they feel entitled that, me, lead guitarist, teach them how to play the songs. And let me tell you the songs they requested are fucking pop songs and alt rock, like wtf men. I learnt the drums, fucking bass and piano. It’s hard but I can’t complain. So I taught them the songs, not fucking easy but ok, and we are all good now. We played those songs to a crowd of 200-300 people and I thought we’re all good. But the problem is, they always get the praise and shit. No one even said thank you and “You played great” kind of stuff. I’m in anger, but can’t do nothing. I was already bullied in school and I’m going to take all this shit? I wasn’t even in the group picture. I felt unappreciated. I quit the group like 2 weeks or so after the program because fuck them. "
My Thoughts on Depression,"Humans aren't meant to exist in isolation. We are meant to be groups. The very fact that you are focusing on the individual experience, instead of how the individual affects a group, speaks volumes about our mutual atomization in society. We treat people like objects, like toys we play with until we get bored of them. Consequently, everyone is disposable, and turned into a commodity, like an iphone or new car. There is no personal accountability, because the anonymity and transient nature afforded by modern society, means long-standing reputations and character-valuation which are critical in tribal groups, are no longer needed; all that matters is social-image (how you are perceived) and what you can do to further said social image. For the first time in history, a human being can survive while being completely being dependent upon strangers. This is a far cry from traditional family and tribal social structure, where image, which can be easily faked, isn't highly valued, while character and social virtues (selflessness, generosity, bravery, kindness) are. Prior to the modern era, people lived in communities where everyone pretty much knew each other, everyone had a purpose in the community, and everyone was more or less related to each other in some way. I would argue, that the vast majority of depressive cases out there, are due to anomie, isolation, or a lack of meaning that comes to our lives from living as isolated individuals who are disassociated from any true community or group identity. Our lives are pointless in a vacuum, but they are not inherently worthless; we can only find value and meaning in our relationships to other people. Any true hermit can tell you the pain that comes from social isolation. So in this sense, everyone's depression MATTERS, as we are all related to one another, we all live in the same world.

&#x200B;

Let me give an example of the power of community in combating depression by thinking about how therapeutic simply going on this sub is; while we all come from different backgrounds, the sub serves as an in-group because we share a life-experience that we all have in common (depression). This sub is virtual-substitute for a real-world community. While it is a far cry from a real tribe, it amazes me how it still allows people to heal by simply being heard. What we need is a place to share, a place to find companionship, and place to be understood. A tribe does all these things and more. Many of us have no tribe, so we make do with this subreddit.

&#x200B;

P.S. This note really deserves to be an entirely separate post, but I want to say that it is criminal how depression has become stigmatized,and seen as a disease which requires a massive pharmaceutical-industrial complex to ""treat"". I view depression as a natural response to a sick society. Depression is when your mind tells you that something is not right with the way we are living. But instead of listening to these signals, we stigmatize them and blame the individual for being ""sick"", yet no quantitative tests are done to prove said ""sickness"" (no one actually measures your brain chemistry, the doc just uses circular reasoning to determine if you are sick (oh you have depressive symptoms, must be depressed! -great science, doc! cringe...)). So basically, what we have going on in society, is stigmatization of perfectly normal feelings, that puts the responsibility for depression on the individual, instead of the dysfunctional society which caused those feelings in the first place."
Depression sucks,"For the past couple months I have been pretty depressed but it has now reached its worst point. I’m not suicidal because I know what that can do to people and I think I can overcome this but my depression is currently at its worst. I’m questioning everything in life, who I am, who my real friends are, my sexuality. Everything, I can have one bad thought and I’ll dwell over it for days and even weeks. I just want a healthy / happy brain without anti depressants. But that’s life I guess. I go without showering for 5 days. I think I may be gay one day and straight the next even though I’ve been straight all my life. I’m 17 btw. I don’t get much enjoyment out of anything anymore but playing video games with friends help but I can’t get the support from them as I would a therapist which I will be seeing. Okay got that off my chest. Feedback is appreciated :)"
I don't want to make friends anymore,I've pushed most people I know out of my life. I think I'll just settle down here with no soul to talk to.
"I feel so low, I don't know what can actually help me getting over this depression.","I had a heart break recently, I don't know what was my fault even. I loved her for the past 5 years unconditionally, and she just left me. I don't know what to do now. My study life is ruined, can't concentrate on anything. 2 years back, my mom passed away. Now I think there is nothing left to live for. I want to live but it's too hard. I just can't take it anymore."
i slept for more than 24 hours,"i would wake up in between the times, but if i wasn’t going to the bathroom, i was just laying in bed with my eyes closed and cuddling my cat.  i would force myself back to sleep until i woke up again. the dreams are always better than my reality, i hate visiting my life. everything good i was trying for has ended for the hundredth time. i was working out everyday and attempting to eat right, but then i just stopped. i could never reach my calorie intake so i’d never bulk and i got sick of seeing the same results. i feel worse that i quit. i feel especially weak right now because i’ve been in bed for an entire day and night. it’s going on 8 am now. i’m going to attempt taking a shower now because i haven’t in a couple days. i won’t do anything today and i’m dreading going into work tonight. 

i don’t understand how i could feel good about myself for one day and keep up with something positive, but it only lasts a few days.. a week or two if i’m lucky. then all of a sudden i’m back in a hole for a good couple months. over sleeping, not sleeping enough. over eating junk, not eating enough. always out of it and suicidal or even homicidal. i’m too old for this shit. idk what to do anymore. i just needed an outlet because it’s all just racing in my head as i finally get up for another pointless day. i want to get a journal and write to myself, but for now i’m writing to everyone else who can understand what this feels like. 

i hope it will end one day for all of us. if it can’t end then i don’t want to live. i stick around for my cats, i love them more than anything in the world. my chonker stayed in bed cuddled up to me most of the time. she and my other cat are the only ones that reassure me that i am loved. they don’t have to say anything to me to make me feel like i deserve to be here. and as i type this, she knows i’m feeling terrible because she just came up to me and laid on my chest purring with her arm stretched around me. without them, i’ll never know what to do and i get scared everyday for the day my big old girl goes away. "
My Doctor has given up on me,"So I’m on a really high dose of Venlafaxine (150mg) which started as 32.5 and slowly worked up as the effect started to wear off on the lower doses. For the past month I’ve been wanting to sleep, and do nothing. I can’t even bring myself to cook or clean my home. Now the dark thoughts have started again, the ones that say “wouldn’t it be nice if you didn’t have to struggle in this world anymore?” 

So I told my Doctor about my ideations, that they were there but with no plan, and no motivation to put it into effect. He said I need admit myself because he can’t help me. That because I spoke with clarity he won’t call an ambulance, but I need to go.

I can’t self-care, I washed my hair for the first time in 2 weeks only because I had work and couldn’t even get away with keeping my hair up anymore. I washed my clothes because they couldn’t pass for clean anymore. I can’t admit myself because of my responsibilities to my bills and rent, and my animals. They are keeping me here, keeping me alive. They need me. 
I wish my boyfriend of 4 years understood what is going on with my brain, he just thinks that a nice walk outside would fix me. He has no idea what I’m going through, and it only makes me more lonely."
I know the reason I die will be suicide,I am only sixteen but I genuinely feel like in the future I will either rely on drugs and alcohol to numb how I feel or I will just end it myself. No matter what I do I will always spiral back to depression. I don't want attention I just wanted to get it out because I can't talk to anyone I know about it without them telling me not to think like that. I can't control it but if I've ever had a gut feeling about something then this is it. 
A stranger said my life was interesting and that shocked me,"I went to an appointment for what is essentially waterproof makeup to cover my scars (which is cool but mine are still obvious since they're raised) and the person doing the appointment said my life seemed interesting. And that just surprised me i guess. For someone who  rarely leaves the house for anything other than work or school and can count the number of times I've socialised with friends on my hands and feet, it felt nice that someone thought my life was interesting. I guess recently I've been actively trying to do more stuff and that's starting to show results."
"Yeah, okay, alright, why? Are my most used words","I've had depression for a number of years now and over time it's felt like it's numbed my mind, i can't hold conversations in any form anymore i usually just respond in one word replies, but later after i've spoken to someone i'll think ''that's what i really wanted to say, why didn't i say that?'' It's like i don't have access to words at the appropriate time and my mind just goes blank, i feel dumber."
My personal advice to a dear friend. I hope he listens.,"Depression (in my experience) is like a pit. 

You’re standing on the edge and every so often someone  or something comes along and knocks you into the pit. Then you’re down there, it’s dark and cold and lonely and you can’t see a way out. You try scrambling up the walls but you keep slipping back down. You get tired and it’s harder and harder to see a way out. Then you start thinking about all the other things in your life that make you unhappy and you end up giving up.
 
If you could just turn around and look behind you, you’d see that there is a rope hanging down with someone who wants to help you at the other end.
 
I’ve been holding the rope but you either can’t see it or I’m not strong enough to pull you out on my own.
 
But there are other people with ropes who are strong enough and they want to help you out. You just have to grab onto the rope.
 
So I guess that’s your decision. Grab onto the rope or stay in the pit and watch me walk away because I can’t do any more.
 
My go to saying right now is ‘you can’t set yourself on fire to keep someone else warm’. That’s where I am at. I want to be there for you but I can’t be your friend. It hurts too much to watch you ignoring the ropes. 
 
"
Ahhhh,"Life really does suck, on the verge of doing something bad. I'm sick of thinking of what's to come, it's too much. Too much pain."
"What do I do when my self-care for today, messes up my tomorrow.","In a dark place again, after years of depression. Currently studying, with exams coming at me from everywhere. Now I am trying to take care of myself by not applying too much pressure and you know just doing the basics. I shower and get myself ready for the day. I put on my favourite show with my favourite food (left over dinner is so helpful in these moments). And I sink into my bed and comfortably live in my sadness. But I have an exam tomorrow at 9am. I should be revising. I should be doing what I can to make a difference. But it fills me with anxiety and I panic and sink. So to protect myself I take care of myself by doing the above. But now in my exam tomorrow I will have a complete mind blank and not know a thing to write. So that’s tomorrow made horrible, alongside a pending “fail” mark. I feel so conflicted and I don’t know what to do. I know I shouldn’t put my education above my mental health, but then pushing it aside and not doing what I know I am capable of, does indeed affect my mental health .. ugh. Life of being an academic with severe depression. "
"You know you've fallen deep, when the thing you wan't the most is a normal conversation or a hug.","I don't know anybody with whom I could have a normal conversation and I definitely don't know anybody, that would hug me. "
my girlfriend may have depression and i want to know how to best support her,"all early days at this stage and nothing is confirmed but she's questioned it and starting to worry. 

how can i help her? "
Putting up a facade is emotionally draining.,"I hate going to work every day and pretending to be cheerful and energetic. Forcing myself to smile is just so tiring. I never have any energy in the first place so acting like I do completely exhausts me.

I wish I just had a small room to myself so I can lock myself in for the whole day and then leave when I've done my time. But no, the office is open plan so I have to constantly be on alert. It's just so tiring not being able to be myself because I'll ""ruin the atmosphere"" with my existence."
"im just ranting, keep scrolling","my moms a bitch, she’s not a good parent either. she makes me and my sister do everything all fucking day around the house just because we’re here all the time because we both do online school. this cunt complains about not having money and things being too expensive, but refuses to get a job. like what the fuck! gets mad at my fucking dad for not being able to pay child support even though he has medical bills from having FUCKING STAGE 4 CANCER. SHE MAKES EVERYTHING MY SISTERS FAULT AND THAN TREATS HER LIKE SHIT. 

my birthday was on the 15th and me and my dad went down to a Go Cart place near where i live, it was juts supposed to be me and him but my mom just HAD to be there. while i was racing, this kid made me crash into a barrier and i hit my head on the steering wheel, i had i huge bruise across my forehead, i wasn’ mad at the kid because it was obviously his first time racing. i went over to my dad and he made sure i was ok since i was going full speed when i crashed. my mom decided to look at me too but when she did, even though my head was obviously hurting and i had a huge purple line across my forehead, said “you’re fine, stop faking it.”

she also made my sister feel like shit for not coming with us. she has really bad migraines, especially when there are loud sounds (like go carts) she didn’t want to come with us and just make everyone upset for having a migraine, which wouldn’t have been her fault anyway. but my shitty fucking mother decided to go off at her saying that she was just being selfish and that she just wanted to ditch me on my birthday, which my sister would never do, she cares more about me than she does herself. i went into her room and said i was sorry for how my mom was acting. 

my sister is really the only person i can talk to. i know i have my dad but, he’s more like that friend you have that you wouldn’t tell a secret, you know? but my sister i can really talk to. no one even sang the happy birthday song to me except for her. me and her basically lit a pecan pie on fire while she played “Happy Birthday” on her viola. i know that she is the only friend i have that will really last forever 

anyway that was just me being depressed as shit
its 7 am rn so i have to actually sleep

"Zero punctuation style, witty?!, monologue why I think the world is shit","  

TL;DR: Zero punctuation style admonishment of our society trying to distill the anger of the younger generation raised with the idea that performance and education pays off. And depression.

I do hate the world as it is right now because, in essence, its an unfair, cold and cruel place. This stems not necessarily from mental illness but more on the systemic inequality and the lie that is the American dream or social mobility for our European fellows. What creates this abysmal assessment of the world, and thus a bleak outlook on my personal future, is the realization that most what my parents and surroundings told me about gaining a decent life is wrong. 

Raised on the gospel that hard work, education and performance pays off, this believe was shattered on virtually all levels. Firstly, on the personal in that, after spending considerable time and effort to tick the boxes on the social mobility form from the 1980’s---good grades, two B.A.s and two M.A.’s (or whatever silly inconsequential different forms of diplomas there are), studies at three universities in three countries and a focus on statistics, data mining and knobbing--- I have gained the wonderful privilege to be rejected by most companies I apply to. 

That wouldn’t be so bad where it not for my suspicion that most of these rejections are based on, what boffins call statisticial discrimination, meaning assumptions on the whole group of people holding these degrees are applied to the single person in lieu of knowledge or interest in what I am actually capable of. Sadly for me, most of my colleagues from other institutions have little clue of statistics or business whereas I went explicitly to the Dark Souls equivalent university of my field where you are greeted by the assumption that everyone who was accepted can program and knows matrix derivation--- inconveniently nobody in the business world knows that and our elders who teach don’t bother to present their field as a respectable undertaking. 

Secondly, though one can think “though luck, but at least you could go to university and attain a degree so you have one up over others regardless” this is meaningless when people like me---coming from nonacademic not-so-solvent background---see that the kiddies of the rich lords cannot help but fall up the career ladder irrespective of their capabilities, due to their parents resources and contacts. A crushing feeling to see them advance to all sorts of ridiculous positions without even bothering to show “performance”. Truly, the highest positions in the state and business are open to you without any education if your daddy had the right name. 

I would not stray from my efforts to not give a fuck so much if I could at least attain a reasonably middle class life with what I got for my toil, but having no means of advancement the news that rich parents buy their kids way to ivy league with money that safely resides in tax havens our benevolent governments somehow cannot find while we peasants have to pay taxes for every bugger we extract from our noses, makes me lose focus once in a while. 

Top that off with studies that show that in recent times significant advancement in salary with tenure are vanishing paired with findings that indicate that accumulation of wealth is next to impossible with work alone (except being a CEO which necessitates having inherited ungodly sums of money in the first place, thus defeating the point of the argument). Therefore, my outlook on the future is still bleak even under the assumption that I find a decently paid full time position that doesn’t require to live, eat and shit on a plane 24/7 for consulting firms.

All in all, this seems to be the Damocles sword dangling over my poor mental health, and I haven’t even begun to tell you the story how I got fired for being depressed from a job for which I moved countries and spent a fortune to set up a life in a city I hate with someone I love but now cannot be with, due to the loss in income and sanity. 

Hurray! We truly live in a blessed time.

At least now I can follow the advice to do what makes me happy with the only problem that drinking is said happiness inducing past-time."
What are your experiences with therapy? Is it worth it?,"Seems like I can't get my shit together on my own. Was therapy worth it for you? What is it like?

I really hate talking about my personal things with strangers (e.g. a therapist) so I'm not sure if it will help or make me feel even worse.

Also can you mention sucidal thoughts or will they put you in confinement?"
Need some advice,"Hey all,

I need some advice on my wife. 

Last year we had our first child and everything was good then she started going out spend less time with him now for past 2 weeks he hasn’t spend hardly any time with her and now trying to push me away by saying it’s over. I don’t know what to do anymore is it me or is it her not seeing her child and did research and it looks like signs of postpartum depression. 


Any advise would be appreciated

"
The origin of my social anxiety,"Hello I am a 17 years old male who has had depression and social anxiety for about 2-3 years maybe more, recently I found the reason or origin of my social anxiety, it is kind of a big deal, knowing why I have this issue and where it stemmed from is really interesting and enlightening, so when I was a little kid I was a very talkative one even with people I was not familiar with, over the years I became very overly silly/dumb/goofy and basically I was always trying to be funny and attract people's attention, it did not turn out very well and I often go into school fights etc, all the schools I went to I was usually left out and considered weird, I went to many schools during this period(because I moved a lot), so school after school I was basically the outcast, and when I was about 9 I reached a tipping point where basically I began to close myself off all people and became really scared of people in general, ever since I became this shy guy who usually avoids social interaction, the thing is, when I really get to know someone and I feel we are actually friends I become a completely different person, the real me, I go from literally the shy guy to a very talkative and silly person in the blink of an eye depending on who I am talking to, recently I have been improving considerably on this, I am taking medications and going to therapy occasionally and I am really putting myself out there and trying to talk to people and hopefully get a girlfriend, anyways all I wrote is kind of pointless and I just wanted to share my experience and hopefully help someone."
"To anyone who trivialising my depression and anxiety, fuck you you’re an asshole.","You have no idea the daily struggles I have to overcome to just be able to function like a normal human being. I couldn’t bring myself to get a haircut today because the sheer thought of going out was too much for me. 
The constant suicidal thoughts pushed me to the breaking point and developed drinking problem in order to cope. "
Please help me,I don't know what to do!! I just got off a three year long relationship! I have been fucking dead for over a year. And I am so done with complaining about the same thing again and again to the therapist cause she'll just never want me to come back. I just want to keep typing some crap and scream my lungs off cause I have no idea what to do next! I just want to end this life. Just end this damn painfully ass life!!!!!
Please ignore this...,"  I had long thought when I was 7 years old that this world was a nice place, maybe it is because I was still young at that time, everyone treated me like ""Your still too young to have to realize what we adults go through."" I guess somewhere around there I just took that fact and continued to learn small things. As I grew up, I learnt mathematics and sciences that I struggled to keep my grades constant, I wondered if I was the only one struggling. Turns out, literally tons of other kids who was suffering from studies were also here with me, I just do not know where they are. In primary school in my country, I had no idea where life would take me, I thought being a doctor and others were easy, so I chose to be a doctor or at least what I said my aspirations were... When I was 10, I stopped running due to the fact that many people did not seem like they liked it. That was when I first went through puberty, I paid attention to all sorts of small details, grew pimples, self conscious about my height and all. When I first thought I could grow as tall as my friends, I was relieved that I would not be left out, but it did not seem like the case to me anymore. I failed terribly at making friends when I was 12, I seemed like those dorky kids who gets left out easily. I went through these days and when NAPFA test, where you had to complete 6 simple tasks and see where you stand in being averagely healthy. I failed my SBJ (Standing Broad Jump), my 1.6KM run and that dragged me down. I used to run fast but because of going through puberty, I stopped running, became lazy, started snacking on chips and watching youtube videoes. I grew fat, way more than I expected, and I thought that was normal.
  Fast forward to when I was 13, I honestly did not think I was going to make any friends. I was fat, short, anti-social, who wanted to be friends with me, really? But I did, two people came to be friends with me, one was because I seemed the easiest to talk to, the other because I was short. I had complexes on my height (because i'm so short) but I did not voice them out that time. It slowly went to me faking a personality (cheerful trait) amongst my peers and becoming quite okay. When my friend asked me who I liked, I thought that it'll be okay if I just trusted him but he let the word out. I felt demmoralised, the girl I liked (or I think I did) avoided me, I thought that it was just that bad. Heck, she voiced out in the middle of our CCA (School co-curricular activity) that was compulsory to ask me not to look her way. 
  She was not a person to like, and that definitely traumatised me. Word spreaded till it got to one of the bigger kids in my class and he asked me infront of that girl if I liked her. I felt uncomfortable being confronted and they mistook that blush for my love for her. I once again shrunk deeper into depression. Studies at that time was not that hard, it was a good period of time. I had good friends who cheered me on, a good friend who called me a wimp. But as my friends got closer to me, I developed this thing called (Mood swing syndrome) where out of nowhere my mood can turn from really happy to really angry. Not sure if I appreciated it, but they still kept some of the pictures of my face when I held in my anger for my friends. Maybe it is because I finally gotten some friends? That I feel safe to let myself out. But I guess instead of showing my real self, I showed an angry or, UGLY, side of me out. Luckily, this mood swing syndrome softened when I was 14 (Yes, I know I use this as an excuse too much) I lied alot, joked alot, was an asshole. I thought that if I just stayed that way, things would never change.
  Fastforward to when I had an major event, where my CCA was made to play some songs. I was pretty into music at that time so I tried my best but did not seem like I played well anyways. I developed a low self esteem when I was 13 because of how little and how badly I played. YES, I get I have lots of excuses, but I can't really help it, it's like a part of me now, I regret my actions. Apologising won't mean much, the burden hurts.
  I'm currently 15, and I do not like to play anything much, falling in love sounded nice, but due to constant rejections, I prefer otherwise. I confided in lots of people, I managed to voice out to girls, at least those I don't mind. Still have some friends I regret hitting, I had this anger management issue that I just can't seem to stop. I don't get it myself, am I this forceful, or did I used to be? When I was younger, none of this problems actually surfaced, and I thought it was not a problem. What a young and innocent (pfft) mindset I had. I'm severely sad about this and I also do not want anyone to care about this honestly. Saying I want to die would be stupid because here I am alive. I don't wanna make my friends sad that I would die but people will just say I should just die or live for my friends but I still do not get it myself. Just being sad for myself and hiding myself, I do not get it. I dont get what's so good about myself that others still talk to me, but I know that thanks to my choices last time, I will have to suffer for a few more years, possibly a few decades.
  Anyone who read this, you have a lot of free time, and thanks for reading this, hope you have a great day ahead. I know many people had it worse I just thought that if I voiced it out, my life can get better... I'm sorry, seriously sorry. Thanks for all those who kept me close, and sorry for being a burden."
take me already,"hey you

i want you to ruin me

kick me

kill me

shoot me

just close my eyes

stab me

do anything 

i just want to dissappear in this cruel word 

i have no friends no love no self love"
The only person who talk to me for 3 months is my ex who cheated on me for 3 years,"She's very selfish (or hedonist for her) and I hate her so much for having destroyed my life.

But she keeps sending me this SMS every 2 weeks to say ""you have to join a club, do sport, talk to a professional, get out, make friends. I hope you'll get better""

As it's the last person who talk to me, I just thanks her.

But each time I receive this SMS, I'm dying a bit more inside."
I feel like I'm losing my interest in everything I do,"Before I used to enjoy playing and doing other daily activities but now I feel like I'm just doing them to distract me from being alone. I'm still
young so I don't know if this is depression. Because everytime I'm alone there's this weird feeling I feel. Even though there's a lot of people around me I still feel alone.

But loneliness can be solved by having someone to talk right? But everytime I reach out to someone i still feel lonely and a sudden of lost of interest. I always feel empty and longing for something I don't know. I worry more than my usual self. In school I laugh the most of the time but there's always the time I feel this emptiness.
Everything I do is just something to keep me away from this weird feeling. "
Easily attached,"I hate how easily i get attached to people. Like i'm always so alone and lonely that when someone talks to me nicely and treat me right, i fall for them or i want them to be always by my side. I even get jealous when other people can make them laugh and smile..i'm so pathetic. Recently i feel this way towards my supervisor..makes me even more sad because i can't have this person.. why do i have to be like this? I have a nice family but why is it so hard for me to make friends? "
Zolof does it cause sleeping problems?,I’ve recently been put on zolof for the first time for my anxiety. Although it’s only been 3 weeks I’ve noticed I can’t sleep. I’ve tried everything. I was prescribed 100mg trazdone but that doesn’t even do anything to me. Can the zolof be causing insomnia? 
Asking for a friend,"My mom makes me go to church and it’s super boring I don’t wanna go. I told her i didn’t wanna go and she said she’d take my phone. It honestly pisses me off because religion is part of the reason I wanna die. My mom expects me to live by these stupid biblical guidelines and when I do something if it isn’t pleasing Jesus my mom goes off on me. I wanna live my life how I want and do stuff how I want. Help 

I posted it here because people usually give good advice. Advice is appreciated. Keep in mind I’ve already told her how I feel about church. "
Is it even possible?,"Laying here at 6am, honestly trying to wrap my mind around the fact that there are people who have never had bouts of depression before. What's that like? It's such a foreign concept to me since I've been struggling on an off for most of my life. "
The only person you can trust to a hundred percent is you.,I feel like even if people are trustworthy and they‘re nice and kind... at the end of the day you can just trust yourself. So I rather write my stuff down instead of talking to people about my deepest insecurities. 
Everything is overwhelming me,"I  feel like there's always something i have to do. Even though I just want to not do anything, like even the tiniest bit of homework really puts me on edge;  and to have two assessments due in about 1-2 weeks is draining the  fucking life out of me. I feel so childish not wanting to face up to  responsibility, but i've had to put up with this shit since i was 5 my  parents always wanted me to be an A grade student, while i was always a B  or C kinda student. Anyways every task that is in my way always drains  the fuck out of me, especially homework, I always try to avoid or  procrastinate so that I could relax, but in the end I'll always have  this rush in my body like i need to finish it this instant. Why is my  body like this? Like I just want to sit down, relax, and do my fucking  work, but my brain's telling me to go absolutely fucking haywire.

This  happens to me everytime I have to do anything, I had thoughts of  killing myself because i just want to avoid this feeling altogether, but  i know that i'm too fucking pussy to do it. I'm a coward, I'm a fucking  pussy for not wanting to face up to my responsibilities. I ABSOLUTELY  FUCKING HATE IT.

The point is: I really  want to just sit down and be carefree, but there's always something for  me to do. And my brain doesn't like it when that happens, and I get  anxiety and want to die because of how overwhelming everything is to me.

PS: sorry for bad grammar, i'm really fucking sad and just wanted to put this out there asap"
What do I do,
Today I’m going to kill myself,"I’ve been a frequent visitor of this thread because it allows for people to help others at desperate times but also allow people to share their inner most thoughts to a bunch of caring and understanding strangers rather than the ignorance and harshness that come w this topic to friends and family. 

So I’m writing this now because it feels like the correct thing to do. I know that I am a lost cause. I have received far too much damage to be repaired  and I have tried so very hard to just stay normal, to try impersonate myself but I can’t anymore. After my last suicide attempt my family and friends did nothing but shame me for it so I have no comfort in people that would be able to help. 

Although I am not writing this for me, I’m writing this for you. I maybe lost but that doesn’t mean you are too. I hope you all get better and don’t run yourself into the ground as I have. 

Please all of you. Understand that it is okay to be you and be kind to others even if they don’t deserve it, but don’t automatically assume it back, not all people are as wholesome as you. Do that and I can see you forming no regrets. 

I hope you all get better and kick ass

Signing off 

Bonus round: thank you for all the kind responses it’s actually so... alien to experience people caring and understanding but I’m sick of this. I’m sick of no one caring, I’m sick of myself, I’m sick of the abuse. My whole life I’ve tried to help as many people as possible all the time and I’ve realised that that doesn’t get you anywhere n I’ve also realised that people can’t just rely on me because that’s not healthy. I believe it is best this way. But thankyou none the less. It’s nice to see what it’s like to receive advice rather than give it. Although God doesn’t seem to be on my side as the trains are taking extremely long but thankyou none the less"
Im getting worse,"I'm in the state where i hate everyone, even myself that i don't even go out of the house, never ever, except to school which im forced to go to and i fucking hate it. I didn't go out or hang out with anyone since months and I don't know why, i just feel that if i go out i will be damaged mentally even more than I'm already.And im sorry for the title it's just what i thought of im not looking for sympathy"
I feel absolutely terrible,Honestly I'm so over this. I have serious feeling for my best friend but she already has a bf. I just want to be friends without feeling like trash all the time. I can barely sleep anymore and all I want to do is stop. Make all these awful thoughts stop. I just really needed to vent so yeah. 
How do I see myself in a better light?,"It seems to me that a lot of my problems come from my low opinion of myself. I don't think much of myself, so I don't act like I deserve a good life or good relationships.

Then the solution is to think more highly of myself. But how do I do this? Do I list positive things about myself? Even if I do that, I can't get rid of this awful feeling that there's something deeply off-putting about me that I have trouble putting into words.

Actually, if I try to put it into words, the off-putting qualities include: childish, indecisive, no discipline, oversensitive, unexciting, unambitious, dependent, thoughtless, oblivious, awkward, afraid. So, I do know my negative qualities well. Then...how do I accept that I have those qualities? Can I change them or not? How do I love myself despite being the way I am?"
It's like little ol' me knew what was coming.,"Throwback to 3rd grade. Writing in my notebook. Teacher told us to write about a superpower we wanted. I didn't do that. Instead, I vented about my life, and specifically remember writing ""I want good luck, not bad luck."" Teacher looks over my shoulder, sees what is written, and I proceed to get sent to the counselor. I have no idea tf is going on, but I tell the counselor how I feel. Words just come out of my mouth- like I'm on autopilot. I didn't intend to do this. I talk about feeling sad all the time. I talk about my mom contributing.

Perhaps I was already depressed such a long time ago, but didn't grasp it yet. Holy shit I'm a failure. "

Anybody fantasize about being left alone until death?,"I am a 21 year old year guy. I just like being alone all the time. I hate being around people, even around my family. I just go out with my family for eating.( Barely once a month). Otherwise I am isolated. My friends use to call me to go out, but I used to make excuses to avoid them. Now, nobody calls! I like being alone. I just feel like being left alone with videogames and food until I die. I don't want to get married or to make lot of money. I want to live in total isolation with just video games and food for the next 60-70 years of my life ( if I live). I don't want fame or any good thing in future. Just eat junk food and play videogames. Also masturbate to Abella danger and Lisa Ann. Create fantasies and live them inside my head in a isolated room. Thats all I want. Anybody feel this way?"
How to get over being super uncomfortable over getting compliments or just positive feedback?,"Hello,

I am a H/Fentanyl addict currently in recovery and besides that I have been dealing with depression, anxiety and bi-polar issues since I was 14.

Lately while in recovery I have stumbled upon a new problem, for examlpe - my boss at work tells me that I am an exceptional worker and that my IQ is off the charts - this makes me intensely uncomfortable because I don't see myself like this at all. I never know what to say and just mumble something back, these things make me physically cringe when I know I should just thank him and tell something nice in return...

How to get over these feelings? Sometimes I even feel anger when I get good feedback over simple things"
I think im mentally ill,"I(20m) live in a basic family with lots of financial issues and 5 other siblings all alive and well.
However, even though i am the last child, growing up hasnt been as easy as it usually should be for the last kid. 
Only one of my sister(3) is married and have alot of kids but everytime my other sisters(1)(2)(5) has to take care of them including me(6).
My brother(4)(the only person in the world ive met that i think deserves to die a terrible death) is completely useless and doesnt help and i think he has a narcissistic personality disorder because he just has an awful personality and always blames other people all the time.
Ive been always helping around the house and helping not that it is compared to anything my sisters(1)(2) have done.
But its been more than 10 years since ive gotten into many fights with my family or constant verbal abuse that i think im doing it to my nephews too.
Recently ive been lashing out more but i always try to walk away.
I always try to find time to spend outside because i really hate living with my family, it doesnt help that whenever i tell them something they dont really want to listen to me at all or take anything i take to heart.
Since a few years back ive always tried to be a happier person outside overall but always been in debt and needed to spend money on the debts is terrible. Borrowing money($1-2k)from my friends for my parents is worser, since after i have to pay them back myself.
Ive tried getting professional help(due to several times ive self harmed) but they just seem to be completely useless to me.
I replaced it with smoking but i stopped recently and started going back to hitting myself.
Many times ive seeked help from others but i am beginning to think that i do not mean much to them at all.
My mind is also at constant war with my own circumstances and against the religion of my family, which doesnt help my mental state at all.
I may think that sooner or later i may have an outburst once again like i do every few months.
My family is used to me being angry every now and then so mockery would be used against me when they want me to stop.
I know they care for me, but i am too emotional for such tough methods. Outside i seem strong enough but honestly i feel so bad inside that i always end up crying instead.
Ive been speaking to a friend lately and she has been able to give me some emotional support that im grateful for, but sooner or later i wont be able to face her as ive felt too weak to even talk to her.
Now i my only hope is that i get to see her sooner and be able to talk to her again so that she might be able to calm me down once more before my next outburst.

Connection,"I just want to feel connected to something like I belong I feel like I could scream. I am so isolated I feel like I don't exist. I need a job but then I want to waste time going to events trying to connect people rather than working on my employment skills and I waste so much time. I just want a partner and some friends, I want to be invited to be somewhere. I hate myself. I want to feel like I am connected to something I have travelled so much and been to so many events and groups and I am still an outsider to society. I have to take medicine just to numb myself enough to wanting to feel human. I have volunteered and plan to do so again but I'm just the dead inside empty person who helps somewhere and is forgotten.Volunteering is appreciated but it doesn't get me friends or a partner"
How should i cope with being ugly?,"Im a 19 year old shy girl. I never really had any success with guys. Only been approached once. My looks were awlays something that i was really ashamed of. I would always see a picture taken of me, and fall into weeks of depression because of it. Then i always make myself believe that it was just a bad angle, because in mirrors i look better, clothes look more flattering. But on photos i actually look like an idiot. The outfits dont look stylish on me, but rather out of place, because of my ugly face and weird body. I have to focus on final exams, but again, i just saw some pictures taken of me in the summer, and i cant but to fucking cry of the ugliness. I always worked on fixing what i can about myself, but it doesnt work. Im soooo tired of this! I want to be hot too! 


My rant about myself:

 I always starved myself so i am a little underweight now, but still look fat on some pictures. In the past months i started trying to gain weight, so maybe i could gain muscles easier, but i cant gain weight anymore, no matter how much i try to eat. other than that, i would always try to work out when i can. My posture looks awful and sloppy. Working out never works, i dont have time, and i get worn out quicker and quicker every time i workout. I will always have a flat ass, and weirdly wide shoulders. Working out also makes my knees and back hurt and crack. (i do the excersises properly, my borther is a coach, he helped with it). My face is the worst. I have really bad hairline, my face looks tired and worn out. Big undereye bags under my small eyes. I have very prominent wrinkles around my mouths even when i smile just a little bit. My nose is really long, with a bump on the tip. My lips are nonexistent. My face does not look feminine at all, its long, but doesn't have any shape, no jaw, nor cheeks. Even surgery couldnt help. I spend an hour a day on my hair to make that weak and thin tangly mess look more bearable. I also take care of my skin, but it just looks faded and old and wrinkly. Oh and i also have cellulite to top it all of.


If there are any advices and tips i gladly read them. Im. Just so tired of never looking like i imgaine it. And i dont look too hot in mirrors either, but at least normal, and somewhat nice. Im just tired of these depression episodes because of my looks. I wish i was effortlessly beautiful like others..."
Suicide sucks,"Be warned: Depression in text form below.

Some background: it's been about a year and a half since the latest person in my life took their own.

It fucking sucks. And even though his was number three, his was definitely the most impactful. Still, it makes me think about all the people I've lost. 

And let me tell you, for those who might not be familiar: picturing all their exploded heads is just so goddamn much. Like what the fuck guys? And why the fuck? You know I'll never get those mental images out of my head. 

Why does no one mention that shit when they talk about suicide? It's like people think suicide is just someone suddenly vanishing and appearing in a casket all pretty and neat. That's not it, though. That's not how it is at all. You know how they went, and you know those gunshot wounds to the head weren't pretty. It's genuinely disturbing, infuriating, scary, and wholly sad, and you're never ready for all those intense emotions at once. No one is. No one could be.

You want to know a really fucked up bit? They tried to make us feel better about the first friend by telling us he was still alive and breathing when EMS arrived, but at least he wasn't conscious. Talk about fucking nightmares, man. I'd rather it was click, boom, done. Don't tell me he was still *breathing.*

But as for the most recent, I swear this guy was like an anti-depressant in the flesh. He was so fucking kind, sweet, inspiring. But even *he* couldn't make it?

The whole thing really made me question who all can. I don't mean to say that it made me question whether *I could.* I don't know that I've ever had a suicidal thought, to be honest. Rather, it makes me terrified that anyone I know, no matter how well I know them, could be next, and I'd never see it coming. That kind of thing really stresses me out. Severely.

And now here I am. After an argument with my (very, very soon-to-be ex-) girlfriend, she drops a bombshell on me that she wants to kill herself if I leave. 

But man, I'm already so done with her that I'm looking forward to never, ever, ever seeing her again for the rest of my life. So *how dare she* just dump that on me the moment she realizes our shits ending. You don't **ever** fucking guilt someone with a threat of killing yourself when that someone just wants to move on, whether serious or not. Especially when you know damn well that I have a seriously fucked up world-view because of my past experiences. 

So have fun in lock-up, you poor, demented soul. I've seen suicide, and it's not something I take lightly, nor is it something I'm suited to deal with. So fuck you, I'm out, you're getting institutionalized, and most importantly I hope you get better, because it *will not be my fault* if you actually do something so god-fucking-damn stupid and selfish."
Depressing part of life thoughts.,"Just thinking about it, it’s upsetting to know that anything could happen to us at any second. We could die, suffer pain, lose someone. It sucks."
I'm not done,"This will not get the best of me. There has to be something for me out there and if I yield to this stupid conniving cuntbag in my mind, I'll never see it, right? Life's only shown me suffering, depravity and inequality but I don't fucking care. There's more. I'll see it with my own two dead eyes. Even if my legs give out, even if my spine fucking crumbles, I'll crawl. I'll crawl. I'll fucking crawl until I can't. And then when I can't, I'll wriggle my way through like a maggot. And if all life offers me is this, then I can die knowing that and maybe I'll find peace in that knowledge somehow. And if there's happiness, then how naïve I would feel. Fuck depression. Fuck everyone who's ever made me feel worthless. Fuck myself for making me feel worthless. I'm just going to raze it all"
I am starting to have thoughts,"I am starting to have severe thoughts of being alone and wanting to end my life. It’s been coming up every time I try to do something that’s suppose to be fun. 

"
"I wish I could make posts that are completely devoid of text, because I don’t even know what to say or how to say it and there’s so much yet so little to say. Empty post is similar to how I feel.",
"Fuck, man.","I’m new to this. I just want to say that I’m glad I found this sub. 
I’m taking the medication and trying to stay motivated, but it’s hard as a mother fucker sometimes. 
And I’m not going to lie, I don’t know if it’s against the rules here or not, but I’ve been drinking and doing cocaine. 
And that might sound shitty to some people, but after the last couple days, I’m honestly just glad to alive. I didn’t know if I was going to make it. 

Feel free to message me or whatever, I’m a pretty open book. A friend would be cool right now anyway. "
"31, depressed, and hate my F***ing life","I am 31 and I hate my fucking life. 

I guess I will provide a bit of back story. 

My ex of two years broke up with me via text back on Dec. I thought everything was OK as we went on vacation back in November. When I asked why, she said that its because ""she is hard to please, did not see a future together, and we were not going to move out together anytime soon, and get married. Also, that I dont challenge myself"". I never treated her poorly as I've always tried my best whether it be open communication, complements, asking how shes doing. Plan trips when she wants to go. Just the little things. 

Her reason to break up really fucked me up. Yes I am not ready to marry her since I am building my finances. I live in Vancouver and its fucking expensive to buy a place. My goal was to save around 100k by 2020. And have us put money down for a place. Her family is well off and her parents had money ready for her to get a place.

When she broke up with me she basically attacked all my insecurities and its really fucking with me now. 

1. Background: My family is not rich, we come from a humble background. My dad passed away when I was 19 and I had to grow up really quick and be a rock for my brother and mom. I try and I continue to try. I put myself through school. Student debts are paid off.  I pay rent to my mom, and I pay the property tax. I live a minimalist lifestyle so that I can save for what is most important. But apparently its not enough. Its not fast enough. I feel like I'm not good enough. 

2. My career: I spent 3 years as a mechanic before deciding I wanted to go to business school. Graduated in 2016. Figuring out my career has always been a challenge. It took me time to be comfortable with not knowing how exactly my career should play out. I finally found something that I am somewhat happy with. I recently got a position as an analyst at a telecommunications company. I like being an analyst and want see where this will take me. But apparently I dont challenge myself. She said I should be a business owner and start my own business. Now I feel like I'm not good enough because I'm not some high paying manager and at 31 I should have it all figured out already. 

3. Finances: I've always lived a minimalist lifestyle because life forced me to do that. I have some money saved up. However, it doesnt matter because its just not enough nor is it fast enough. Instant gratification. What I learned after this experience is that if I want to date, I better be loaded because no women is gonna be with you if you can afford to get a place and marry them. I'm not enough. 

Its obvious that I am depressed because of the break up. Added the fact I was broken up with over text, PLUS she said I am not good enough. I loved this women so her words obviously have some weight to it. I want to settle down. I don't want to ""play"" anymore. I want to ""win"". I stated to my ex that I am trying everyday to make the goal of marriage a reality. I just feel like no women will want to be with me because of my family background. Because I am not rich. Because I am not enough because I don't have the material things. It fucking feels hopeless. I don't have a growth mindset anymore. I just feel like giving up. My confidence is completely shot. If I didnt know any better she probably started having interest in another guy. 

I have no idea how I'm gonna recover from this. I've always prided myself on being tough. Griding it out. Now it feels like none of that mattered. Part of me feels like I am being a loser who can't get over it.








"
Realising my life is a waste at 28,"I’ve always been anxious since I was a child. Avoided such things as approaching cashier and going out with friends, so I isolated myself using internet addiction for many years (first it was video games, now it’s mindless reddit YouTube chat etc). Now I’m 28 no friends, never had a gf living with parents, socially anxious and awkward, have a degree in IT but keep getting shitty jobs at tiny companies, currently unemployed. 

Obviously I have depression and anxiety. I think I have anhedonia because not much interests me besides YouTube reddit and a sport I regularly play (3 days per week usually) anymore. I literally spend all day in front of a computer/device. I can hardly finish reading a book I started a year ago and haven’t been to the cinema in years or gone travelling..

I’m just realising I need to change my life now and I’ve left it to the last possible few years remaining. But I feel so stuck and have no motivation or interest to do anything outside of my room. What do I do?!?! 
"
"Hey, how are you all feeling today?","I can’t sleep, I can’t do shit, I’m depressed over nothing and I’m still upset that I have to make throwaways for venting now. I have done nothing but try to vent and I still feel like I’m bottling shit up inside. I’m making an appointment with counseling services. I’m a piece of shit, but maybe it’ll help multiple people if I made this thread for those who want to talk. No problem is too stupid, it’s ok. It doesn’t even have to be about depression. This thread can be anything you guys want it to be. The comments section is your oyster, I guess. I wish you all good things."
idk,"I don\`t know whether Im truly that depressed or if ive just come to the realization that life aint worth it. Ive been feeling emotional and mental pain for three years. My grades dropped tremendously, I cant concentrate at all, I lose sleep, and I am scared of being happy because it is always followed up with something that makes me sad and drags me back down to a state of depression. I thought I had all the signs of being depressed, but through these years I've never once self-harmed. I wanted to die a multiple times, but have never once self harmed. I honestly have never considered it a form of expression of my pain. I have come to a point where i feel like this mental unrest and instability is just normal to me. I no longer consider it ""my depression is making me .... "" but rather "" theres no point of anything and therefore.. "".  I came to a little  conclusion a few months ago, that rather than being depressed, I just have no will of living or don\`t find life worthy of living. However the Mental pain and inability to sleep/ crying myself to sleep have come back 2 months ago and made me unsure. Im back to feeling mental pain and an urge to en it all EVERYDAY.  idk what to feel or what to convince myself of anymore "
Are meds truly worth the time and effort for dysthymia?,"My psychologist wants to bring up anti depressants to my psychiatrist due to therapy not helping. I said no because of anecdotal negative experiences of my peers. While I know this isn’t a good reason, I still don’t want to waste any time, money and effort to do something that *might* help but also have adverse negative effects.

I don’t feel THAT bad, besides the apathy and hopelessness. So, yes, is it worth it?"
I'm so confused,"I dont know what my life even is. Being dead is easier than being alive but i cant just drop dead.

What do I do here on this earth? What am I to accomplish?

😟"
Cannot fucking take this anymore,I’m losing my mind. I need company.
Am I an asshole?,"To keep things simple, I recently found out someone I used to go to school with since elementary school killed himself. I was never very friendly with him, with the exception of a year or two early into my education, but I found out a few months ago when I was home from college from an old friend. 

What I’m wondering, is am I an absolute twat? When I heard about it, I wasn’t really sad. I didn’t feel bad about it. I almost laughed. I’ve been pretty close to ending it all myself a few times, and my reaction here just makes me wonder, how many other people would react the same way. How completely insignificant would I seem to them? Am I just an outstanding, terrible asshole, or does it really not matter that much?"
I dont get it,"I feel like I'm lost. I never know how I'm feeling, I just feel like my emotions are either ""existing"" or ""being really pissed about existing"" with nothing in between. I know it sounds edgy or whatever but I don't know what to do about it. I have a councilor but I don't feel like I get anywhere because I can never explain how I feel and I can never tell if her advice is working. I do have dysthymia but I was told it was constant mild depression rather than complete emotional numbness. I still do have a lot of depressive and suicidal thoughts, but it doesn't feel like I feel any different if they are or are not there. "
I'm not sure if I have depression or not,"As a bit of a preface I'm 16 and cannot afford a therapist off of nothing but a suspicion. I'm not totally sure if I'm allowed to ask this there so if not take it down. I'm just curious to what others say. This has been happening over the last two years but has hit hard recently. 

I can't sleep

I've lost interest in a lot of my old hobbies

I find people emotionally exhausting

I find it hard to connect with people

And when I do it feels like something's missing

I randomly get sad about seemingly nothing at all

I've been told I'm getting angrier a lot easier (no idea if that's true)

Even when I'm with my friends I always feel like they would be better off without me

I've heard depression affects appetite so I'll 
include that I'm almost always hungry but I don't really want to eat

And some other things, but those are the main parts. I have not told my parents about this because I don't want to worry them about something that may just be teenage angst. Lemme know your thoughts, it's 3:30 am so I'll probably be asleep for a while so if I don't respond that's probably why"
Do those helplines that you call actually help if you need someone to talk to?,"Basically, I have a whole lot of shit to vent about and I have intense guilt of things I’ve done in the past. I have terrible, fucked up sicko dreams. I don’t sleep at night. I’m depressed as hell. I can’t even get myself motivated to clean the house or do dishes or anything I just sit on the couch all day. 

I have no friends, my only friend is my boyfriend and I feel like our relationship is starting to crumble but he doesn’t see it. 

I really just want someone to talk to with no ties and who won’t judge me instantly etc and who isn’t sensitive since some of the stuff I want to talk about can get kinda rough. 

My only option right now are one of those helplines, I’m almost too shy in a way though and I feel like it won’t do anything. For anyone who’s done it, how is it? "
My life is a mess.,"My grades are dropping and I can’t get any uni done because my mind is so scattered. I’m going through a fucking painful breakup and can’t stop intrusive thoughts of him with other girls. I’m so broke I can’t afford to eat dinner tonight. My evil landlord owes me heaps of money and we have to go to court to sort it out. I can’t relate to my friends anymore and I’m isolating myself. I’m interning for uni and I feel so inadequate, like I’m throwing away this opportunity. I’ve gained so much weight and I’m falling back into my old prescription drug/alcohol habits. I just cant do it anymore. I don’t want to be alive but I don’t want to kill myself. I’ve just stopped caring.  "
Being used,"There’s this girl back in January (This year) that I knew, that I always walk with to my 3rd period at our school, I had a feeling she had a thing for me since she would stick by me every time I get to my class ( both of our classes were in the same building ).

I decided to take a chance and ask her out, to my surprise she said yes and it was confirmed she did have a thing for me, fast forward to next week me and her were basically inseparable.

I opened up to her about my depression and she said that she would love me regardless, and I took that as a sign of trust.

Fast forward to February 11, 2019; she was acting off, she was avoiding me, I knew something was up the moment I held her hand.
At the end of the school day she decided to end it. As you would expect Valentines just became awkward for both of us.

That Friday night of Feb 15, she told me the reason why she broke up with me...

She still had feelings for her friend that she knows she doesn’t have a chance with; and she thought that dating me would get rid of her feelings for him.

That just ripped my heart out of my chest and threw it on the ground.

My mind was boggled and I was in disbelief that someone would ever do such thing, not just to me, but to anyone.

Now it’s been a month since we broke up and just yesterday marked a month since I learned the ugly truth

I’ve been such a wreck and just the thought of what she did to me throws me into a relapse, I’ve taken meds and they make things somewhat bearable for me, I’ve turned to friends and family for advice, but all of them give me the same advice.

I’m just in an endless loop and I don’t think I can trust anyone in a relationship."
Imagine if you could pause time whenever you just needed a moment away from people.,"Feeling a bit down at work? Boom, pause time and calm down. No more having your coworkers think you're weird for being so quiet.

Having a conversation with someone and it's all too much? Pause time. No more having conversations fizzle out all of a sudden because you csnt stop thinking about dying.

Life would be so simple if you could just take a step back from it every once in a while and not have people give up on yoh because of it."
My “want to live” and “don’t want to live” levels are at perfect equilibrium.,"I love life, I love living, I love observing, I love learning, I love experiences.

I love setting high expectations, I love taking admiration of others’, their experiences, and their accomplishments too far and setting bars that are too high, I love feeling awe and wonder and it also comes with sometimes feeling down and low.

I hate being alive, at this in this form. If I had to be alive, and I want to be because I love it, perhaps I’d rather prefer the role of some cosmic observer with ultimate learning potential, irrelevant beyond having that knowledge of amazing beauty and events. And yet I’d probably still feel the same about my own shitty self. I want to make contributions and I can’t.

Outside of life, my life is either a daydream or a session of crying. I both learn much and learn next to nothing from self-reflection. My motivation and disillusionment are disgustingly balanced.

I want to live, and I want to die. I can’t decide."
Exam Depression,"Hey there...

forgive my english

So I was in 9th Grade and I am really obsessed with Aviation. I was tempted to do aviation photography. My parents promised me a SLR camera so that I can take photos of aircrafts if I scored 90% above in my class 10th Board Exams.

And yea, I am just an average student somewhere at the 70-80% and scoring 90% was a big step for me and it was above my range..

And I was really desperate for a camera. Whenever I get some time for myself I would utilize it looking up cameras, reviews, comparisons etc.

So I studied as hard as I could for the Board exams

Now that I am in grade 10th, the exams are going on, 3 exams have passed.

And thanks to CBSE, they had to make the papers hard as fuck.

They were all lengthy and had twisted questions so I messed them up.

Now I am expecting around 80%

I studied as hard as I could

Might seem small for all of you but I am really desperate and obsessed with the camera just so that I could photograph aircrafts...

I spend all day pondering about cameras (even during my study time before exams)

I even dreamt during my sleep of standing at the airport, all day, taking photographs of aircrafts approaching and taking off...

&#x200B;

My question is, do I, a 15 year old guy deserve a $500 camera? Is it too much to ask? I waited 2 years for it and yea I am not that spoiled brat who needs a new smartphone every year, branded clothes, fast food every day, sucking the money, just a simple kid. Thats the only thing I asked my parents which was expensive. Im all depressed about my marks because, my relatives, basically judge children by their marks. I feel like a shithead after the exams. Feels really awful when my cousins in my same grade say that the exams are easy and they are expecting good marks. I feel like a shithead in my family, like a burden. Everyone says that its one of the most important exams of my life and it will be a scar for the entire life if the results were bad."
I need out,"I've contemplated suicide almost daily for the past few weeks.  I can't stand my life anymore.  I feel like just as I was starting to feel better, my life fell apart again, and this time I just don't have the energy to keep the pieces together.  I feel like it's been a while since I was actually able to picture a future where I didn't end my own life in the near future.  Every day it somehow gets worse, and at this point I can't deal with it much longer.  

&#x200B;

I don't know what to do

I need help  "
I’m losing my grip,"I’ve always had a strong hold on my sanity, but lately I’ve been losing my grip and I don’t think there’s anything I can do about it. 

I can’t look in the mirror without seeing someone i’m not. I just feel like I’m piloting a robot of flesh. My memories don’t feel like my own, they feel fake, false, almost like they’re implanted. 

and there’s these people, these people that I go to for comfort, or rather, they come to me. These people.. these people that I can’t talk about. I can’t even say their names, I can’t bring myself to tell anyone their names because I know what would happen. I know that if I told anyone they would send me back to a mental hospital or laugh in my face or lock me up, or.. do something.. I don’t know, but I don’t want to find out. 

These people bring me such a rush of comfort, like lightning shots of adrenaline. It’s sick. It’s disgusting. 

I don’t hear their voices or physically see them but I can feel their presence, feel them watching me. 

I’ve always had such a strong grasp of reality and logic that this experience feels like someone ripping apart my brain strand by strand. 

The worst part is that I can’t even tell anyone. I have no friends, no family willing to listen, no therapist, no psychiatrist, I can’t even bring myself to talk to my teachers because I know they wouldn’t even know where to begin to help me. 

I’m feeling sicker and sicker everyday, I’m weak and exhausted and tired. I think i’m dying and there’s not a damn thing I can do about it "
"Worked hard, giving up","I spent a couple years building a business but can’t find the motivation to keep going.  I feel like every little issue just crushes me and it’s so hard to get up the next day and deal with things.   I don’t know how to drag myself out of this.   I dealt with depression before and was able to find a path out, but now I can’t see any way this time.   Dealt with addiction and cleaned up but now have this, it’s like everything just keeps building up.  Hoping to just talk to someone.   "
Been sad,"Just watched the Christopher Robin movie on Netflix.  Sooo good. I haven't smiled like this in years. Soooo good. To anyone out there who is sad, or needs a lil push. Highly recommend.  I feel good right now. It was well done. Never had that imagination as a kid, but..... i so get it. "
I want my dog back,Going on two years now and I still haven't grieved her death. I just want her back. Living life while losing those you care about isn't fucking worth it.
Anyone else have the constant urge to ruin all your relationships so you can be alone?,I'll go from feeling incredibly alone and lonely to wanting to sever the few relationships I do have because maybe then I won't feel guilty when I neglect them because I can't even get out of bed or take a shower.
Tired of being lied to about my looks,It hurts to get called ugly but god damn it hurts so much more when people try to tiptoe around the subject with false compliments. 
I’ve never been more depressed in my life and I’m only 20,"Backstory: My depression arose when i was 10 years old. Your typical bullies and feeling alone. I finally told my family when i was 12 and it just caused more fighting in my house hold. When i was 15 i was checked into a mental hospital and diagnosed with manic bipolar, depression, and social anxiety. Since then i have pulled myself off of my medication and have been good for 3 years until recently. 

I started feeling myself getting depressed again in October of 2018 and tried to push it off to the side thinking it would go away like it usually does. In November of 2018 i started abusing drugs and alcohol and have kept it hidden until last week. I broke down and admitted that i was depressed to one of my closest friends and tried to get help from him without realizing it was too late.

2 days ago i decided to mix alcohol and too many drugs to count and finally admitted to my friend that i had been abusing and drinking almost nonstop for 5 months now. In the past 5 months i have maybe been sober for 5 ish days. When i told him he immediately tried to help anyway he could. (Looking up information about AA meetings, meetings for substance abuse, shoulder to cry on, etc) I have decided to quit everything cold turkey and I’m now worried i made a mistake. 

I have been sober for almost 48 hours straight and i have never been more depressed in my life. I have let everything build for months and it finally all came out and made things worse. I have thought about suicide 3 times today alone. I started cutting again(haven’t cut myself in almost 5 years) and i dont know how I’m going to make it in my journey to get clean. I dont have many friends to talk to about it and i cant go to family without being put in rehab. 

If anyone has had issues with anything like this please tell me how you made it through. I don’t really have a “safe place” which sucks. I cant afford to go to therapy right now (my insurance sucks when it comes to mental health) and i need alternatives to help keep my mind off of things while i get clean. Any help would be appreciated. "
Help idk what to do,"I think i have anxiety or a panic disorder. In the past 4 days ive had 3 ""attacks"". 2 of these have just been me freezing, but i have been with my family unable to leave so i had to sit there and just freak out on the inside. 

The last one i experienced nausea, hyperventilation, my heart was racing, and i was shaking. 

I dont know what to do, im not comfortable talking to my parents about it for fear that they wont take ot seriously, or will just ask too many questions and make it worse.

I dont know what to do, what my options are for possible treatment, or if i dont need treatment, or if i even have any options. Any help is welcome."
I want money,"so badly (not lots of money, just some money, I need some money)"
Moved to a new city post college and i feel like it's coming back.,"While in college I went through some minor depression, but it was enough to seek help and talk to a professional at the school. After a while I made a new friend and he really helped me get out of my hole. I started dating again and everything was okay for the most part. After college I moved to a new city. I didn't know anyone but my gf was going to move here shortly after so I figured it would be okay and we could explore together.  I've been here six months and I still don't know anyone. A month and a half ago my gf and I broke up, so on top of losing someone that I thought I was going to spend the rest of my life with, i realized just how alone I am in this city.

I try to get out and do things like old hobbies, and try to talk to people, but I feel like I don't know how to be happy anymore. I feel like I'm slipping back and this time I don't have any safety net and it's a thousand times harder to meet people as an early 20s adult (everything I've found is either for college kids or ""late 20s and 30s"")

I feel lost and don't know what to do"
My dog is coming to visit,"I'm finally excited for once in a long time. My dad is bringing my dog over on Wednesday to spend the night with me. I went out to Walmart today and bought him all new bowls and treats and toys for him, even though he'll only be here overnight for one night. I've been cleaning my apartment all up and I'm just honestly excited. Night are usually the worst time for me, because I'm in a one bedroom apt. all by myself. I stay up way too late and just lay around, but tonight I'm cleaning instead of sleeping (baby steps). Once my apartment is all clean after a few months of it being filthy, I'll be able to sleep at a decent time for the next few days. I can't wait to see my baby boy."
I can't even bring myself to do schoolwork...,"It's been an obstacle ever since Freshman year, but it's likely to prevent me from getting into university, or even graduating. I feel like I lied to myself; I had all these dreams of finding my calling in college, and learning, and becoming a better person, but all that is about to crumble under my feet because I don't study or anything. I just can't do it, I want to be better but I just don't do anything. I have a 2.7 GPA, a failed semester of chemistry, and only 48 school days until graduation to un-fuck my shit.  "
Got a biopsy today to check for cancer. I’m alone and don’t have dependable friends or family— scared to die alone.,"I feel lost and more alone than ever.  All I can think of is a quote I heard. somewhere that said everyone comes into this world the same way we leave it: alone.  It’s playing on repeat in my head and it’s torture.
    
I can’t believe my life has literally no one around me who loves me.  Irony is that I’ve been getting therapy for depression and was suicidal up until a month ago or so.  I guess God is taking me before I can do it myself. "
I don’t know why I’m depressed,"I don’t remember why. I’m just never happy. I honestly want to die, and have no other place to vent. "
I think about killing myself every waking moment of my day.,Except when I'm high. But that never lasts either.
I know I'm going to kill myself,I'm not cut out for life. My life sucks and the world sucks and only getting worse. Why couldn't I have been aborted? Then I wouldn't have to hang myself or blow a hole in my skull. 
First time here. Have had on and off depression for quite a long time. Just looking for someone to consolidate me,"I know that sounds weird but even having a random stranger tell me it's going to be alright just helps.

Well anyways I was going through a pretty bad spots cutting for the first time ever. And just yesterday my girlfriend of a few years broke up with me. I wanted to have kids, and get married. I just feel so lost right now, and don't really know how to get through this.

I promised her and myself that I would not hurt myself over this, but I'm struggling really, really bad. I've tried distracting myself but that only works for a few mins before I just want to curl up into a ball and cry. I don't know if I can make it through this, I'm not close with my mum or dad, not many friends either. I'm seriously in a bad place right now, and just need help "
I hope it's horomones,"anon-ish-mouse account because this post is too much edge for me to want others to see.

I don't think anyone else in the room knows what I'm writing. I'm at the cast party for the high school musical. I've been part of theatre for years, but I've never felt like I do know before. I feel like the show was all I had left, and now it's done, so I guess I have to go back to being the preppy doofus who can't even hold an a- in english. god dammit. I'm a social failure. I just want someone to tie me down so I don't hurt myself, or maybe I just want to be tied down for the feeling of contact. I just hope this is all puberty talking and I'll feel better as an adult, but right now, there's a baseball-sized lump in my throat and I guess I have to wait until it's gone."
i'm scared of other's judgement and their thoughts on me,"whenever I did something wrong i can feel eyes are staring at me, especially at school. it scares me but there's nothing to stop it, there's no way to cope it, i start to feel like a burden, the worst human being on earth. and if i made someone sad, i start to feel guilty and it leads to a panic attack, it's not even a temporary feeling, it lingers with me for the rest of my life, right now i can still feel those, i feel like no one's even as worse as me, i'm just a complete asshole."
Compliments Don't Faze Me,"Because I know they're wrong the moment they're said. Other people get called cute or something and they might tear up, regain some lost sense of humanity or whatever but it doesn't affect me whatsoever because on a core mental level I just know it's false (not that I'm gonna call the complimentor out on it because they need to feel good about themselves for being nice)."
Depression at an all time high (low??),"After being stuck in, what I hope to be, rock bottom for about a year now, I’ve come to realize that I have struggled with depression my whole life just to a lesser extent. Really just looking for brutal honesty and advice from people who won’t be try to baby me emotionally due to fear it might cause me to run off and hurt myself or something, and I’m not too big on therapy.

I have never liked talking about myself in general especially my problems as I don’t particularly like myself and I would much prefer helping others through their issues than deal with my own. I consider myself extremely blessed in basically every aspect of life and should have no reason to be like this, which makes me feel even more depressed.

I don’t really want to just shed my whole backstory atm, but please ask questions if you’d like. I’m hoping being open for a change might be helpful to me and anyone else drifting in this sea of shit called depression.

Always feeling Drained,"I'm 28 and I've been working at a bar since I was 18. The money is pretty good. I make anywhere from $800-900 a week, but I have to work 6 days a week (50-65 hrs a week) and I'm always on my feet. I'm constantly tired and my boy can't move like it used to.I want to find something else, but I don't know what. I went to school at the age of 18 and then dropped out at 20. I went back at 23 and then dropped out later on. Then I went back at 26 and then dropped out again. I just ended up not liking what I was studying. I just felt like I'm not smart enough for school.


I feel trapped and I feel like there's no way out."
DDD,"With lips sewn shut I walk my path while those with voices run with falsest. I slowly go past them all, with my eyes towards the ground, I cannot tell them that they are wrong, I cannot say that it is done. There is nothing left that they can do to put a stop to what has happened. These events that have been put in motion will be the factor in what is yet to come. They have all made fun of you so now you must hurt them for what they did to you. All this pain that has been caused you will make them fo through ten times over until they are no more. That is what you will do to exercise your revenge, for nothing in this world will keep you from the beginning again. "
Depressing/sad music recommendations?,"I know this sounds crazy, but I really like listening to sad/depressing music/songs. I can easily relate to many songs, and I feel like music is my only escape. 

I would be more than glad to share some of like as well. I'm really just looking for any topic within the sad genre. I've experienced loss, breakups, separation from family, loneliness, hate, suicidal thoughts, and more. So anything of that subject I would be glad to listen too. "
Is it possible to be depressed and not know it?,I generally feel good when I'm at school of hanging out with friends. But when I get home I feel alone and  getting together with people isn't worth it... It feels really weird because I'm usually a normal guy l. It gets even worse at night. When I'm laying in bed I feel like something is missing and I'll never be able to fill the gap... That's the only time I ever even think about depression. Is it actually depression or is it something else?

idk what to do,"i was diagnosed with depression about 3 years ago, but nothing was ever done about it because my parents don’t believe depression is a real thing. i’ve been trying to deal with it on my own, but sometimes it just gets to be too much for me. i’ve tried to get my parents to understand, but i just get shut down each time. i usually spoke to extended relatives, but due to family drama, i no longer have anyone to talk to. i go to a college i hate and where i have no friends so i spend the majority of my time alone in my door room. i’ve tried seeing a counselor at my school on a weekly basis, but i’ve convinced myself i am just being over dramatic. i really just don’t know what to do with myself"
I come from a place where mental health problems are a taboo.....,"The first time when I had my stint of being depressed, I understood for the first time the reason nobody talks about depression, anxiety in INDIA. I feel sad for those people who are considered idiots to go and seek out for help here. I was very lucky to have a progressive who didn't give a damn about the society and took me to a psychiatrist but i feel sad for those helpless people who are never given advice for fighting depression. There are kids out there who do not even understand what depression is and how it affects us. I hope this changes.

P. S

Been fighting depression for that last 4 years of my life. It gets easier but we still have our days with each other. "
Orgasm tips,"I’m a female (22) and having so much trouble to orgasm since being on the SNRI Prystiq (Desvenlafaxine).

I feel like I’ve lost it all,I recently lost my job which paid for my schooling and my  SO Is giving me the cold shoulder after not finding a job in their town since we’re long distance and I just feel like I’m never good enough for anyone. Nothing felt this way a year ago and I know thing will eventually get better but I don’t know when and it’s killing from the inside. I just want to feel happy outside of being under the influence 
(23m) I'm disposable. Nobody cares about me. My life is worthless,"Sorry for the long post. I hope at least someone reads this and can give me some advice for this situation.

I’m always thinking about how worthless I am and how badly I’ve failed at everything in life. The only friends that I have never want to hang out with me anymore despite the fact that I've done so much for them. My coworkers are rude to me and I constantly get talked down to by customers, boss, and other employees where I work. I’m just treated like a subhuman wage slave. In school, I can’t make a single friend to save my life, and it’s just so lonely to the point where every second feels like torture. Nobody ever wants to work with me in class, I’m always the black sheep in group projects and social gatherings. I’ve always been the black sheep in my own family as well. My siblings don’t talk to me, and whenever family visits nobody ever cares enough to ask me about my life or even what I’m majoring in. Literal strangers have asked me more questions about myself than my own family. All anybody cares about is what my siblings are doing or what my parents are up to these days, nobody gives a fuck about me. The conversation always revolves around somebody else. My mom is extremely melodramatic, only talks about herself and makes no attempt to ask me anything about my life. My dad acts kind of like a high school bully, only words of advice he could give me were along the lines of “be a man”.

I think about how little I make for the type of job that I do, and that I still don’t have nearly enough money to move out or do what I want to do with my life. I don't even like what I’m majoring in, and I feel cheated by everyone around me who convinced me that I was going on a good path for myself. I would want to die every day if I had to work in a field that my major consists of for the rest of my life. It’s also taking me way longer to get through college than it should, because I failed a few classes, got put on academic probation, and also had a ton of non-transferrable credits from the previous school that I went to.

I’ve never had a girlfriend or even been close to any type of relationship someone, and for years my only friends were people that I met online. I lost contact with most of them over the last few months. I didn’t have much in common or see eye-to-eye with most of the people I met online, but I still miss them. Even if the nights were lonely, at least I had someone to talk to.

I also completely lost touch with friends I had in high school, which saddens me. I think high school was probably the high point in my life, but it’s long gone by now. I doubt anybody from high school even remembers me.

Trying to go out to places like bars and clubs has been extremely dissatisfying. People are super aggressive and even the bouncers get up in my face if I look at them weird. I hate the music and I suck at dancing. I’m not one of those people who can play it off like “haha look at how much I suck!” either. I don’t really have a sense of humor, which really repels people.

In general, nobody is ever happy to see me. Family members who I haven’t seen in months or years barely acknowledge me when we see each other again. “Friends” act like I’m asking the world from them if I just text them asking if they want to hang out sometime. Parents make it clear that I’m a pain in the ass and that I shouldn’t live with them anymore, even though I mostly just stay in my room and try to mind my own business. Women aren’t interested in talking to me, the amount of failed and negative interactions I’ve had with women is staggering. Barely anybody in school even knows who I am even though I’m with them nearly every day. Any attempts at socializing are met with confused looks and even more confused responses. The happiest person to see me that I can think of is a cashier at a convenience store I go to who occasionally complements me on my shirt. To most people in my life, I’m boring, uninteresting, and I just don’t matter. I’m disposable, and I feel like shit every day. If I was gone, it wouldn’t matter to anyone.

I always wanted to be someone who was likable, or someone that people actually looked forward to seeing. I guess I just don’t bring much to the table. I have a youtube channel that serves as my main hobby, but even that has gotten boring and unpleasant. I seem to get more dislikes and hate comments than positive ones, nobody in my family even looks at my youtube channel despite me asking them to check it out. I’m just not really good at anything, don’t have many talents or strengths. I can’t even say that I’m good looking or attractive.

&#x200B;

Overall I just feel like I have nothing. My life feels totally empty and pointless. I’m not worth shit to anyone. Nobody ever wants me around, nobody wants to be my friend..and who can blame them, I bring nothing to the table. I’m not good at anything. I have no friends, no money, no relationships. Spent 6 years in college for a bachelor’s degree that will probably be worthless in a field that I hate. Siblings barely know me and don’t care about me. The only reason I’m still surviving is because of my parents who I barely get along with anymore. I just want to die."
I can't keep going i just can't,"I am so tired, i can't go on, everything is becoming more difficult with each day, my sadness is growing deeper and deeper, i can't control it anymore and i feel like i'm running out of time, this is like going through a tunnel filled with tar, i feel stuck and i'm suffocating, i'm having anxiety every single moment of the day and absolutely nobody gives a shit but me, i don't blame them, they have their own problems, but i feel so fucking alone, and i feel like everyone is moving on but me, and everyone else is just catching up to me and eventually surpassing me, everything sucks, and i don't think i can't keep going any more, i don't know what to do, if this keeps going i'll end up killing myself soon"
He broke,"I dont know what happened to me. I dont know when I became so hateful and envious, when did I become such a pos. I use to be so positive and a joy to be around for people, it wasn't real but even if I thought I was worthless shit i could still put a smile on and be positive for other. Alot of times people who say I was the nicest guy they knew and they didnt know how I always stayed positive and smile. They never saw me sad or upset and everyone loved me. I could talk to anyone. Now I'm just do rude and have a short tempter and just dont care most the time for anyone. I dont smile nearly so much around people and I tend to show my depressed side alot now. I turned alot of people away and I just am down right a piece of shit now. I dont know when this happened to me. I'm just ranting cuz I feel so damn sad and alone rn and I cant seem to get out of this rut of constantly being meh to okay for awhile and then feeling like this and separating myself from alot of people cuz I become jelouse or envious of something."
How do I let this girl go?,"I’ve been depressed for years, and the last few years in particular have been terrible for me. I went from borderline homelessness and no job, to a dirt job around the end of 2017. I lost my girlfriend a couple of months before that. But I ended up meeting a girl in September of 2017. From the beginning, I knew she was someone I wanted to be with. I wanted to build a friendship with her, because coincidentally, she had just gotten out of a relationship as well. We started to spend time together and when the winter came, we grew closer. We agreed to start dating which was great at first. But then she moved for school about 4 hours from where I am. Going to two different colleges, along with her own depression seemed to effect her. I could also tell that she still missed her ex. On my end, I guess I was so wrapped up and trying to be the perfect boyfriend, that my depression and anxiety spiraled out of control. Not only was I feeling the negative things I always feel, I was proclaiming these things to her because she was my girlfriend. I had no control over my feelings and I’d often feel hopeless or as if the whole thing was pointless. We broke up in February of 2018 because she said she wasn’t ready for a relationship, but continued talking to each other. We would meet back up in our hometown from time to time. Eventually we started dating again and but we broke up yet again in April, because she didn’t want a long distance relationship. I still believe to this day, that both  break ups were because I could not control my self hatred, which damaged my conversations with her. Coming from someone who deals with depression as well, hearing that I overthink too much was terrible. She insisted that I find what makes me happy that isn’t her.  I was heartbroken honestly and we didn’t speak for maybe 2 months. In July we started talking to each other and even went to a concert together. We went as friends, but as time went along, I began to notice that a friendship just won’t do anymore. It wasn’t the same friendship as it was before. Her responses became short and dry, often leaving me to dig for ways to push the conversation forward. I gave up. I tried meeting new girls but nothing stuck. I tried removing her from social media but I found myself thing of her even more. Here we are after six months of not speaking, I contacted her and apologized for my actions while we were together. We have been communicating as “friends” since then. The conversations are very dry still, and I can see that’s she’s scared to hang out with me. That hurts if I’m being real. I’ve never called her out her name, or laid a hand on her in a violent way. But I let my depression and anxiety make me believe that she was not trying, and now she’s definitely not. She says she doesn’t hold anything against me, but all the nonverbal say that she thinks I’m crazy. I was in her area the other day and suggested we hang out. She said there was traffics between my point and hers and it would take too long but the roads were clear. I ended up there and even with her in her apartment, it felt as though she didn’t even want to see me. I care about her deeply, and I’ve tried to show her since I met her that I do. But now I see that I’m just not good enough for her. How do I let this girl go?"
i am not ok.,anyone know of a good place to vent online i can’t handle these thoughts right now 
I wish I could feel something,So here’s the thing. I relate to depression because I’m never happy. Like never. I got a huge raise at work and I was just meh. At my wedding I was just meh. At school I’m killing it and about to graduate and again just meh. I don’t feel sad and can’t relate to any emotions. I’m never happy or sad or really feel any emotion aside from anger and that’s rare. I just wish I could feel something even sad. There are days where I can’t or don’t want to get out of bed and just give up. I’ve never seen a doctor or gotten diagnosed with anything. All I know is that I’m just never happy. I want to be happy or sad or anything. Everything is logical in my head and I never react based on any type of emotion because I never have any. Other times I can’t thing. Just blocked when me and the wife argue. Idk why I’m posting this. Mainly just to see if anyone can relate or some validation that I’m not the only crazy person feeling this way. I just wanna be normal and enjoy the little things or be able to be happy like normal people. 
People will only care about me when I kill myself.,"All those shitheads who think it’s ok to pick out one person and drive them down into the dirt will only care about that person when they see how they impacted the victim. They don’t care about the person until they see that they are the  reason the person no longer exists, the reason they couldn’t do it anymore. Bullies don’t care until they truly see what they did, which sadly takes serious actions. "
It has gone to the point of taking a heavy amount of caffeine per day.,"I can't stop drinking, I know it's harmful for me as I'm still 16. But I just can't, every day it's about 4 mugs of coffee, morning-afternoon-midnight during my heavy video game sessions. I can't make myself to work, I just keep drinking and playing games to forget school exists. I feel like an embarrassment, selfish little prick, a disappointment to my family. A good-for-nothing kid. "
I’m fucking up relationships and school and lack motivation for anything. I hate myself and I feel like a terrible person,"So I’m a 17yr female and I just can’t deal with this existing shit anymore. I constantly screw up relationships and I’m always angry and tired. I’m so behind in my classes that I’m not even sure if. I can fix them before the end of the year.

I can explain more if anyone wants me too. I just hope someone who understands can offer some advice. I would appreciate that so much."
Wanting to Give Up,"I don’t know what to do with my life anymore.  

I’m failing my classes, which will be official as of next week once I take my finals, also fuck the quarter system.  

I haven’t been truly happy in the better part of a decade and I’m only 20.  

All the small things that used to make me happy like video games and reading and being with friends are no longer interesting.  

I have trouble getting out of bed every day and I would sleep constantly if I could.  Doctors don’t know why I’m like that, they didn’t find any causes for why I’m constantly exhausted.  

I’m lonely and keep missing a girl I never had a chance with (this is a factual statement and not a depressive whine-based feeling) and I can’t go a day without thinking about her even though nearly 4 years have passed.  I crave affection and connection but I’m too socially anxious and comfortable in my solitude to try and change it.  

My friends and family are sad that I’m depressed but I can’t manage to improve and it hurts them to see it.  They can’t be happy since I’m never happy.  

I want to give up and cease to exist but there’s no way out that doesn’t cause myself or others to suffer.  There’s no right answer for what to do with my life, I just have to hope it ends somehow and the world moves on as if I were never here.

If anyone has advice I really need it.  I’ve never been more stressed or sad and I don’t see a reason to go on anymore."
I don’t even know.,"I don’t know why I’m even posting this, I feel really stupid doing it. Maybe typing it all out or knowing even maybe if just one person reads this (hears me? Idk) will help. Whatever. Here we go.

I’ve never wanted to be dead so badly in my whole life. All I do all day long is fantasize about death. Dying, how I’d want to do it, how it would feel, what happens after, etc. I want it so bad I can taste it. But. I can’t do it. I have kids that depend on me (I feel bad for them that they’re only here cause I wanted them to be, they didn’t ask for this. I’m just selfish). If it weren’t for them, I would have been out a long time ago. This life is bullshit and I can’t fathom how anyone could be truly happy. It’s a fairytale. One I wasn’t meant to live. 

Do my kids need me that much? Fuck. They’d probably be better off without me. Everyone would. My husband’s been adamant about me not getting on any medications because it’ll make me a “zombie”. Uh, yeah, sign me the fuck up! I’m going to go get on meds this week. I have to do something. Anything. 

Anyway. That’s that. I’m not looking for any responses at all or anything. I know many have it much worse and this is dumb. Just needed to vent, I guess. If you’ve made it this far, thanks for reading. That’s all I really wanted and I appreciate it more than you know.

I moved from home,"I just turned 18 and I moved to Australia for the next 4 months to live and work. And honestly? As much as I miss my family. I've never been happier, they never kept me down but I never felt free until now. Sometimes being loved is stressful, I had so many responsibilities to keep faking my own life to keep my family happy and now I dont have to. One large step for me kind"
What do u do when the one thing that u look forward to in life disappears?,"I am 15 and am actually living a decent life. Both my parents are alive. They both make a decent living.  Im a staight A student and have quite a few friends. I have practically no reason to be depressed. Yet i find no meaning in anything. Im sick of school. I try so hard to do good and keep my grades up,but whats the point? I am not interested in anything the school offers. Im not even interested in the hobbies ive loved my entire life. Like playing video games or reading. 

 But i struggled through everyday because i looked forward to seeing this girl i liked. Interacting with her was the only part of life i enjoyed. So when she tells me that i come of as desperate and pretty much says im weird, what do u think my life becomes? 

I have no reason to try in anything. Id rather just sleep the day away. I dont really want anyone to think i just want attention because im having girl problems, so i don't mention this to anyone. I just put on a fake smile and show that im happy and that im not worried about anything. But inside i cant help but feel empty.

Srry this is the only place i knew where i could vent my feelings. 

"
Can't shoot myself cause the pistol is locked,Spent about 30 minutes going through all the keys in my house but none of them worked. No idea where my parents are keeping them. 
No point,"Is there a point in living if you can’t have the one thing you want? I’m not selfish or greedy, at least I don’t think so. I feel as if I have been a basically good person despite my flaws. All I’ve ever wanted is to be loved, by someone, anyone. My mom, a friend maybe, family. For someone to care about me, even slightly. But it has become clear that that will never ever happen. So tell me honestly, is there any point at all for my existence? I don’t want to be alive anymore. I’m tired of feeling heartbroken every day. I’m tired of getting my hopes up. I just can’t do this anymore."
I know I’m not alone but I feel alone,"I’ve got people that care about me, and I know I do. I feel as though I’ve lost the ability to connect with anyone. I’ve been kicked down and fucked over by friends and family I trusted so now I think I’ve subconsciously just lost the ability to connect with or trust anyone. I hangout with friends and go on dates which help distract me for the time being, but when I get home I feel lost and alone again. I hate attention and I hate pity so I tell nobody about what goes on in my head. I don’t want people to sympathize with me because it’s never worked and never will, I just want the day that I finally feel whole again to come. "
Why am I so selfish?,"My friend and his friend both have a crush on each other, but they don’t admit it to each other. They know that the other one likes them. I want my friend to be happy, but for so reason I can’t be happy and don’t want the to get together because then I’ll be lonely. Why am I selfish? Why do I want to ruin people’s lives just so that I have someone to talk to. "
My husband is suffering from depression and I don’t know how to help.,"My husband has suffered from low/mild depression ever since we started dating 6 years ago. Recently it has gotten way worse and I have no idea how to help him. He lashes out at me all the time, he has no motivation or self esteem and it’s getting worse. 

I recently convinced him to go to a therapist but so far it’s not doing much good and he hasn’t started taking the medicine they prescribed for him yet. 

He puts himself down all the time and feels like he is going no where in life. He is 26 years old. Does anyone have any tips for helping him? 

I’ve tried just being there for him and he lashes out at me, I’ve also tired being firm with him. I don’t know what to do. Honestly I’m scared for him. I love him so much and I just want to help him but I don’t know how. He tells me that just listening makes him feel better and he is happy that I’m in his life but he is worried that he won’t be able to accomplish and provide for us in the future. "
What's the point,What's the point of having friends. What's the point of life. What's the point of anything. I just feel like an empty void inside. I don't even know why I have social media apps. No one ever messages me. No one cares about me. Nothing I ever do matters. I don't even matter. I don't have a purpose. No one needs me. Life is so dull. There's no point in anything.
things get better,"kinda sitting being sentimental because a few months ago i tried to kill myself by overdosing on cymbalta due to being extremely suicidal and hating myself since i was in a very bad relationship, since then i got therapy and support along with medication changes (effexor) which made me not even want to kill myself anymore, that medication just made my suicidal thoughts poof lol but anyways im way better now and i just want to say even if you feel it will never get better keep trudging through all the bad it never lasts forever"
I survived my suicide attempts,"     I took a lot of pills, like at least a hundred, I thought my liver would fail and I would die but it didn’t. I fell asleep and woke up the next morning very much alive. I started crying, I felt so stupid that I couldn’t even kill myself right. The next few days I felt very sick, I started to think maybe I was dying and it would just take a few days for my liver to fail. But then I started feeling better and within a few more days I was better. 
      I’ve read so many stories about people who’ve attempted suicide and realized right after that they wanted to live, but that wasn’t me. I tried again two weeks later this time with even more pills and the same thing happened. If I had a gun or lived near some cliff or bridge or something that would make it so much easier to end.  I don’t know why I’m still alive, I did my research in the pills, the amount I took should have been lethal. I just don’t know what to do. "
"I’ve decided I need help, but have no idea how to ask for it.","Okay, I’m just going to type this out and not erase anymore. I’ve tried to write this post several times and I keep erasing it. I’m afraid that I’m trying to romanticize the way I’m feeling or justify my actual depression as just a passing phase or me feeling sorry for myself or begging for attention or some other shit.  I just need to put this out here honestly.

I’m 26 and I’ve struggled with depression and anxiety since I was around 12. Idk if it’s environmental or genetic because I have anecdotes that would suggest either cause.  Either way, I’m fucked up and I want to do something about it. I always thought it would go away when I found love or found a good job or became financially stable or something. I’m college educated, married to my absolute dream woman, have two fantastic kids, and we are very satisfied financially, but I still contemplate suicide almost every night. I crawl into bed and I just berate myself internally. I tell myself I’m going to fuck my life up and jeopardize my family’s stability.  I self medicate with alcohol and anything else I can get my hands on. I pretend like I’m fine during the day. I don’t talk to anyone about it because I’m afraid I’ll be viewed as a shitty dad or husband. 

I’ve definitely being diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder, but I always pretend like I’m happy other than that because I don’t want them to tell me I’m depressed because if I have that diagnosis, I’m afraid my wife would think she isn’t enough to make me happy.  I talk to her about my anxiety and I tell her about my suicidal thoughts, but then I play it off.  I want her to know because I know she loves me and wants to help, but I don’t want her to ever blame herself because she’s the best thing that’s ever happened to me. Her and my daughters.

I find it so hard to explain and I really need help, but I’m afraid asking for help will hurt the people I love.  I’m also intimidated about looking for help. I’m scared I’ll find a shitty psychologist or therapist or whatever. I don’t want to go to the wrong person and get prescribed shit I don’t need.  I also don’t want a person who just sucks and doesn’t know what’s best for me and doesn’t care about making people better.

I just want to be better for my family and I’m afraid that eventually I will do something that hurts my family.  I don’t want my wife or kids to find me bleeding out in a bathtub one day because I didn’t know how to get help.

I guess what I’m asking is this— For the people who have found a successful way to deal with depression and anxiety: When you decided you needed help, what was the first step in the right direction?  What kind of professional did you talk to; how did you find them; what kind of meds helped, etc.  I just need someone to talk to me like I’m 5 years old and tell me how to do this.
