Everything is going to be ok,"To anyone out there who struggles with stress, anxiety or just the constant bombardment of life’s obstacles, I’m here to tell you that everything is going to be ok.

As someone who has battled life’s stressors, as well as falling down to rock bottom several times, I can promise you that these hard moments you’re going through are only temporary. Nothing is permanent. Your pain and hardships are merely a fleeting moment through time that presents itself to define your future self. 

Remember that every difficult moment of your life has now become a distant memory that in some minor or major way, has shaped who you are today. Be proud of that. Embrace it. We all wear scars underneath our skin and we’re bound to be wounded again in the future. That’s just how life works.

Some people are lucky enough to just “coast” through life without having to deal with financial stress, heart aches or other bullshit that life throws. But I’ll tell you what. Some of the most interesting people I’ve ever met are those that have faced anxiety and stress. 
You are one of those interesting people. Never forget your worth.

Take each day as a stepping stone toward your goals. Don’t see a mountain as a giant hunk of rock to climb. See it as a bunch of little steps that may take a little while to reach the top. But you will eventually get there. It’s inevitable. And sure, some parts of the mountain will be harder to climb than others. Some days are going to suck. You’re going to want to cry and curl up in a ball because life’s too hard. And that’s 100% ok.

But remember, as long as you keep pushing forward, you will succeed. And baby steps are ok, in fact they are usually better than unpredictable long strides. If you have a bunch of shit you have to do today, or this week or this year try to aim to complete 1 important task per day. Make a list. Cross tasks off your list as you complete them. Make your bed every morning, that’ll automatically give you a headstart for the rest of your day. Get rid of negative, toxic people from your life. You don’t need that shit. All you need is you to get through life. 

Whoever you are, stay strong. You will get through this. Just breathe. And listen to Into the Black by Chromatics. Great music to calm down to. "
If this is any indication of how my life is going rn; tears and chocolate cake crumbs from sstess eating on a physics textbook,
"When you're stressed, you eat ice cream, chocolate and sweets. You know why? Because ""stressed"" spelled backwards is ""desserts.""",
Does anyone else shower more often when they get stressed?,"This is something I've noticed myself doing often the last few years. When I'm stressed \(not always consciously\) I feel this really intense urge to shower more often and if I don't I feel really gross, as if I haven't showered in a week. So when this happens I usually take three \(sometimes four\) showers in a day.  I know it's terrible because I'm wasting so much water but I can't seem to help it. Does anyone else get this?"
Just needing a place to vent,"My 2017 was just a pile of crap. I had multiple family members die, our dog got hit by a car, I got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me, got fired from a second job for no reason, and finally got into sales on strictly commission. Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it’s dead. 

We have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won’t get paid again next week. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can’t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can’t get loans because my partner doesn’t make enough and I haven’t been at this job long enough. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can’t during the day. I’m just at an impass. Our family members don’t have money for us to borrow. We have no credit cards.

I just feel like everything is spiraling down and I can’t control any of it. I was hoping 2018 would be better, but so far it isn’t.

Anyway, if you’ve stuck with me this long, thanks for listening. I hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because I feel guilty. I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I’m still worried because I don’t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It’s just a very helpless feeling.

Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you. "

Being alive is so expensive?,"I am drowning in bills and rent like everyone else. I always make it, but I'm so constantly on edge worrying that I won't. I feel like it's taking a toll on my life. When I'm not working, I float between the two extremes of deep cleaning my entire house or staying in bed all day and hiding from the world. I wish I could find a happy medium. I'm having a hard time devoting time to friendships because I'm so wrapped up in my own head and stress routines. It's hard to reach out because I don't want to be a downer. The space behind my oven sure is clean though, so I guess that's a plus.

I know I'm not the only one, so how do you cope with the stress of being alive?"

A Powerful Way to Diffuse Stress You Probably Haven't Tried,"Gently place the tip of your index finger to the tip of your thumb on both hands with the other fingers gently outstretched. This is called the Gyan Mudra.

Chinese proverb,
How do I relax and not be stressful when I'm in a state of hopelessness?,"Hey guys im so stressed out right now,this past 2 days I've walking around the house aimlessly I have mild headache and feelingness of vomiting and I feel a lot of blood in my head (like think my blood pressure is raised high)

I'm 18 years old and have to talent and skill. I've never been good at anuthing. I suck at school and everything 

Learning, taking notes, memorizing, applying, summarizing

I'm focus on Japanese and piano but I feel so lost. I quit my piano lessons because I've done it for 7 years and none of my teacher never teach my according to my goal. I feel like the way they teach me doesn't really help me. 

I want to be able to compose and improvise but I guess no one can teach me. I guess it's because i lack creavtivity and I'm not good at applying things . I've always had trouble writing things in school because it turns out dull and unimaginative and I'm just not good at it. 

I'm always stuck at the basics. And my learning sucks because before I even internalize it I've already read or go through the the material hundreds of times so I know the material if I see it but i cannot apply it.

My mother tell me to stop pressuring myself and trying to take in too much but I'm saying that I'm stressed is because I cannot achieve this skill not because it's too much. I want to understand and internalize it and move on execpt for being stucked in the basics and it's boring

High School...,"Hi, I searched for many subreddits to let out my feelings and I felt like this was the most appropriate. I am currently a senior in high school and worked through an enormous amount of stress and hardwork for the last 3 years. I took 12 AP and honors classes, was captain of the robotics team, on student council, and much more. There were many many days when i stayed up until 2 or 3 in the morning studying for tests, getting stressed out about grades, teachers overloading us with home work, trying to make my parents proud, and more importantly myself proud. I went into this school year a happy dude, just finished 3 hardworking stressful years of high school and hope to get into at least 1 college that I wanted. 2 weeks ago I learned that i got denied to every college I wanted to go to except 1 and I got waitlisted/deferred. These past two weeks I have felt useless, depressed, and most of all stressed out. I have had this feeling in my head that just makes me feel like im about to pass out. I have felt like there was basically there was no point in doing anything anymore. I have just been going through the motions of life, on the outside looking happy, on the inside just stressed out of my mind. I thought I experienced stress before, but nothing is like this. I've tried so many ways of relaxing but everything just makes me so stressed. I sure as hell don't want pity and I'm not making excuses, I just needed to let it all out, I didn't really know what to do. My parents don't really care that i'm stressed, they just tell me that ""There is no reason to be stressed"". I think thats what makes me stressed more than anything, the fact that I go to my parents and think they tell me that I can just turn it off like it has an off switch. I just needed somewhere to let it out."
As I type this now I am almost paralyzed by Stress over having way too many things I feel the need to get done,"Just about every hour of every day, from the moment I wake up to the moment I fall asleep way ahead of my bedtime, my heart is pounding like crazy as thoughts race through my head over the many, many, many, many, MANY different tasks I ought to complete. Even as I type now I feel like there's hundreds of things I ought to be getting done right this second. Whenever I take a moment to breathe several other things I need to or should have gotten done need to get done. Even if I try knocking out the simpler or more important things first, things develop and I need to follow up. Can ANYONE suggest a way of dealing with this? I might actually spontaneously combust..."
My mom said I might have to be kept back (12),I got a 40 on a unit grade and my parents got mad. My mom said that I may not be mature enough for 7th grade (I came to kindergarten a few months earlier then normal preschool is expensive) and that I may have to go back to six grade. she said I’m to stressed out (which i am) but still this has made me more stressed I don’t know what to do
How much is too much?! Somebody tell me...,"I don't even know how to begin writing but here goes..

My long term partner and I split a few weeks ago, and I pushed him away because my mind is swimming. I've got a really demanding job that recently has been piling up with more and more stress. My department was gutted and I'm basically the last one standing - doing the work that 4 people used to do. On top of that, I'm doing a full time accelerated MBA which, until this point, I've been able to handle.

Here's where it get's stupid.. 

I volunteered for a really exciting extra-curricular project and got accepted (yay!). It's a huge initiative and requires hours and hours of reading. The people in my group are incredibly experienced and well versed on the topic (Think Managing Directors/Corporate Sustainability Directors etc) and I feel way out of my depth amongst them, let alone contributing.

I've been practicing yoga 5 days a week which helps, and developed an obsession with incense but my mind is constantly running. 

On top of all of this - the breakup has left me stressed emotionally and financially and I don't have a car to even to my groceries. To go shopping I have to lug around huge bags on either arm and walk 20 minutes to and from the shops, often in muggy and horrible weather.

I know a lot of it is self-induced. The extra-curricular, the MBA, the demanding job, the break up.. but it's beyond the point of return. I can't drop one or any of these stresses. I can't keep on top of everything and feel like the only thing that relieves me is yoga - but I have to do yoga in my lunch break and then I miss out on eating and am stressed that people at work are gossiping because my lunch breaks often go beyond an hour (Due to getting changed, walking to the studio etc).

I needed to type that out. Thanks guys. "

I just want to save the world but I obviously can't so I just need to accept that and save myself.,
Just burst into tears at work.,"So, I've been with my company for 16 years. Always loved it. Good at my job, if I do say so myself. In January I got a big promotion, to supervisor. Last month I got another to a salaried management position.

I'm quarterbacking a very major project involving integrating our facility with a corporate call center. It's going to change daily life for us forever. We're launching this week.

Guys, we're around ten people short. There's no way we can even do basic daily functionality, much less all the crazy shit this project entails. I'm working 12+ hours a day at least 5 days a week, and usually going in for 5-10 hours over the weekend. I'm working so much just to fill holes because there's literally nobody else to do it. All my people are working overtime and burned the fuck out.

I came in at 4am to do some stuff nobody else was able to do last night, and then I was working on payroll and looking at this absolute abortion of a schedule any I couldn't help but burst into tears in front of my crew. Not like ugly crying, but stoic like silent tears.

I'm exasperated. I'm not an emotional guy but I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. I'm being an asshole to my family on the rare occasion I ever see them. It's causing a lot of problems, but my field is extremely limited. Not many opportunities around here for me. I'm just a schlub with no degree and an easy certification and I feel like I'm drowning.

If I had people it would be easy, but getting people in here takes months with this sloth-like corporate structure. 

I seriously am just sitting in my car on the side of a country road right now, just not knowing what to do. I'm feeling completely spent and empty. Thinking about the place makes me want to cry again.


Ah well, feels a little better to just talk about it."
Serious work anxiety,"I've been having serious anxiety issues at work. I've been at my job for a long time. Moved to a different area of the same job. I am under constant pressure. Feel like I don't know what I'm doing even though I should at this point. I'm always afraid my managers think I'm an idiot. I work really hard but things are constantly blowing up in my face. Sometimes my fault sometimes not. No new training going to happen. I have to learn as I go.

The real problem is im taking the stress home with me. Can't sleep. Can't focus on family things. Mind always racing. I dont want to leave my job. But I don't want to feel like this all the time. I want to not care as much."
"The worst thing about stress is that I don't even remember what I like to do, so I can't relax by doing it.","I have about fifteen different pieces of paper (well, .doc files) that about five people are expecting from me ASAP. I've been trying so hard to sort it out, but yesterday I came to realize that I actually *can't* unless I get my heart rate just a little bit lower.

But anything I try to do to relax myself - talking with friends, my girlfriend, video games, hobbies - is torn up instantly by my brain, telling me I need to do the things I ""need"" to do. What am I supposed to do, when I have to relax but relaxing just stresses me out more."
What is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention?,"Last night I was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard. She had been out there by herself for several minutes while I was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed: a weak hose that kept kinking so water wouldn’t flow through it, the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence (they were within three feet of her, and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit. 
When I finished getting dinner ready, I happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready. Up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and I never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and I was not expecting anything. After I told her dinner was ready I stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy, mowing she might get in my gfs way. She turned around a yelled,”You don’t have to rush me!” And went back to doing what she was working on, clearly angry. 
I had no response and could only stammer that I wasn’t rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened.
This isn’t the first time she has snapped at me when I am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things I had listed and believed I had come out to hurry her along to dinner. 
She is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but I think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she can’t. So I want to know how I can avoid her snapping at me like that again in the future. How do I keep her from getting stressed out by ordinary, as I see them, things?"

Overwhelmed and it’s causing chest pressure.,"Life is stressful. Obviously. I have been to several years of counseling as a child and I feel I have some pretty healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills. Lately though, life has been overwhelming.

"We all know the power of positive thinking; less stress, more focus, less depression, more fun. But we also know that it’s not as easy as it sounds. It requires renewing your outlook on life on a daily basis because positive thinking takes more than just seeing the cup half full.",
"Acknowledge the building stressors in your life. As you age, there will be more and more stress. Learn about this before it's too late...!!","I am in my early 30's. I just had a birthday of a significant number to me. I had a crisis. I'm still recovering from it. 

Life is getting more and more and more stressful. I've had the same job for 6 years, and it's increasing, too, and my workload is starting to get to me. I've lost the ability to relax so it's hard to distract myself in the evenings. We recently moved into a bigger house with roommates, so there's more responsibility there. 

You might notice that your functioning breaks down. It becomes harder to do things that were once mindless and ordinary. Might even be hard to eat. That's ""Burn Out"". It's a terrible place to be, and it just gets worse. 

If you have a mental disorder like me, then stress will hit you harder (""I'm working to collect all of them!"" is what I joke to my friends in a ""maybe-I'm-being-serious"" kind of way...).

If you have a mental disorder like me, it'll be hard to regulate stress. Your mind wants to go at its own pace, and there's a pace forced upon you that your mind doesn't like to follow. But in order to survive you must follow it.

You need to find your own pace, and go at that pace as much as freaking possible. 

I've realized, on that birthday mentioned above, that it's damn hard to re-discover your own pace when you've become so used to existing in overwhelming stress.

... we become zombies on auto-pilot to prevent stress from affecting us at every moment. We lose connection with life, existing merely as creatures of survival. This can change, but it is also very hard.

Therapy helps. Medication can help. Routine helps – create whatever patterns you can that re-instill a passion for life. Patterns and routines make you feel in control – you are in control, but control is hard to work up to. I'm working up to it. I feel weak but I'm so damn strong for making it this far, and so are you. 

&#x200B;

So ... don't let stress win. Find your pace. Instill a peace in routine. Slowly work your way up that mountain (like a mountain climber with no gear) and find resting points where you can release your hold and simply rest. Stop and take deep breaths randomly throughout the day. Break the fourth wall and look around you and realize you're in life in that very moment. The destination is not that thing you're doing this evening or this weekend, but that very moment. Whether it's in a line, at work, in traffic, talking to an annoying old acquaintance on the phone, or whatever. That's the moment. Some moments feel better than others, but your mind is capable of making meaningful moments no matter what you're doing. Embrace that truth. Life can be worth it!"

I Just Want to Run Away for a little While,
How can I relieve stress while still being productive?,"I feel like my question could've been super easy to just Google, but I'm really in the mood to hear some human responses directly to me rather than reading another self\-help article. When I have a stressful day in the office, like lots of people my response is to have fun when I get home\-\- playing video games, binge\-watching Netflix, ordering takeout instead of cooking, skipping household chores for a night, maybe having some beers, doing some retail therapy etc.

The problem is, even if only a little bit, those things set me back. An example relevant to my present situation is skipping chores\-\- I skip one day, and the next day I have to catch up, but now that it's a bigger mountain to climb (more stress), I avoid it. I have people coming over this weekend, so at some point I'll \*have\* to clean (stress again). So on this morning's commute I thought ""What if I have a stressful day at work today?"". Now I can't \*afford\* to skip a day of chores anymore at least for this week (even more stress), which means I don't really have a way to come home and escape my stress. Work and home have both become my stressors instead of one being a stressor and the other providing relief. 

I feel like I'm struggling to find the sweet spot between the minimum level of relaxation needed to sustain living day to day without breaking down, and the point of relaxing too much where my other problems just pile up around me and become bigger problems, because I'm too stressed with other problems to deal with them.

Any advice?"

Right now in my life I am so frustrated,"Right now in my life I am so frustrated with everything around me that it has left me tired. Everyday I search for a moment of happiness to feel good about myself, but there is nothing that makes me feel good. I keep myself busy in my studies(started my masters this August) to take my mind off negative things. but everything around me hits my mind so badly that i cannot control the impact of anything. I no more have control on anything that happens to me, everything just happens and I just respond as I am supposed to. People around me are always demanding, they want something from me every now and then, and its not friendship that they want but just some favors I know they will never return. And right now I don't even have any friends to talk to, to deal with everything with me or even to keep me sane. Everyday has become exhausting and I just feel like to leave everything, do nothing, no studies, no job , no people, leave everything and live somewhere in peace. But I know I cannot just cut off from everything, I have to have masters degree, get a job., but this journey is so stressful, I wish I could have someone just to listen what I have to say about everything going on with me. and I wish I could just get a moment to breathe."
I feel like I'm watching my life crash and I can't stop it,"This all started in October. I lost my mom on the 11th, that alone is still hard to deal with. She was my rock, my person to run to when I was stressed or couldn't figure how to handle certain things as a parent or as an adult. There were understandably missed days of work, which caused lost wages. Only two days were covered for me and my husband was out of vacation days, none were covered for him. This caused us to fall back on a few bills. We live on a tight budget as it is, there was no insurance for mom, so no way to financially put back our wages. It started a slow spiral littered with late fees. And then came early December where we had a choice of keeping our place to live or keeping our car, we lost our car. Luckily my dad was able to step in and was helping us get to and from work until we could get a car. But three days ago they put his dad on the morphine drip. He is watching his dad die in the same slow manner he watched my mom. The hospice nurses (oddly the same ones who saw my mom out) have turned his oxygen up to 5 and understandably my dad doesn't want to leave his side. So here we are I'm about to call my job for the second day and beg for a ride or not to get fired. My husbands parents are sort of helping him but still leaving it up in the air everyday before he is supposed to be at work. but I work the overnight. No one is willing to help me get there and home. We have called taxi services around us. It would cost over 100 for him to get to work and back and close to 50 for me. This is crazy and I'm so nervous. Everything at once, I'm worried about losing my job then losing the roof we fought so hard to keep over our kids head, we gave up our car to keep. No matter how hard we work no matter that both of us have rarely missed days and worked for the same companies for years, both very good workers but one horrible moment in my life has us standing on the edge of losing everything. We make too much to ask the state for help but not enough to miss a few days to grieve the loss of the best person in our family without ruining our lives. I'm just on the edge and I have no idea what I'm supposed to do anymore and the one person who would know, who could help isn't around to help us. Thanks for listening well reading I guess."
I need my life to change but it never will.,"   I wish I could change things and make things better not so much for myself because I dont really deserve good things, but really for my wife. 
My wife is the only thing that keeps me going and even then I dont deserve her. Ive been a terrible husband to her. I had an affair with a coworker at my last job just six months into our marriage. It took me so long to get her to even speak to me again and talk about what happend and if there was ever a chance on us trying again. 

 I dont know why but she gave me a chance and Ive busted my ass to fix my marriage and we just celebrated our 4th year together this past july. We barely survive paycheck to paycheck and ive never been able to give her a honeymoon or anything she really deserves but she says that doesnt matter and she loves me. I wish I could give her at least a vacation at least so she can get out of town and relax a bit.

She works so hard and deserves so much more than what I can give her and it kills me. We have to live in a shitty house with no heat thats falling apart, no car because ours is dead and there's no fixing it so she has to get bitched at everyday so she can borrow her mothers car so she can go to work. I dont know what to do and god....im sorry I know I sound like a whiny fuck but I dont know what else to do."
My favourite quote when I feel stressed/hopeless/unhappy,“It’s not where you start out it’s about where you end up the toughest experiences will give you drive if you don’t let it destroy you” Tony Robins
My problem: I have no faith in myself,"I have been the same since high school. I work really really hard for everything, because I am convinced that I won't be able to achieve anything if I put a normal amount of effort in. Throughout high school and college, school stressed me out like crazy. I would spend 10's of hours studying for tests instead of just 2-3 like my friends. It would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying I would get stressed and not be able to think clearly. My friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and ""being focused"". In reality I was going crazy on the inside. My methods worked, got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now. 

But despite all that I still struggle with believing in myself. I'm convinced I'm stupid and wont be able to solve problems on my own. This past month I really struggled to finish a project. It caused me SO much stress. I lost my appetite, and lost lots of weight because I was always feeling stressed/bad/sad that I wasn't able to finish the project at the pace I wanted and I wasn't able to solve bugs quickly. I know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code, but just like when I was studying, my mind gets clouded with stress and I can't think or do anything properly. I dread going to work and  I am not able to properly enjoy life outside of work either. My bf visited me this past week and I couldn't be happy he was there (even though I hadn't seen him in two months) because of the stress I had in my head.

How do I get myself to not be so emotionally tied to work? I can't keep being like this, I know it'll hinder me from being successful. I am currently trying to exercise in the mornings, and meditate for 5-10 minutes.

Anyone else have this problem? How did you deal with it?"
What else do they want from me? (Vent),"It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll. I've talked to my direct manager, I've talked to the managers above her, I've talked extensively to Human Resources. I've been making it clear that I'm reaching my breaking point since mid-September, but all I get back is the same hemming and hawing about ""we're trying, we're under-staffed, we're really trying, promise it'll get better soon."" I called off today - and I almost never do that - because I spent all night stress crying, and knowing it's only going to get 20x worse because of the holidays.  


The manager I talked to immediately chastised me for not trying to reach out to them before my stress got to this point, and tried to guilt me into coming in anyway. I've talked to everybody that I'm 'supposed' to like a good little employee, I've been so visibly stressed out and near-tears that other managers have been doing the reaching out *for* me, what else could they possibly want???

I can't sleep at night anymore,"So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so. The most I've seem to get at once is about 3 hours of 'solid' sleep without waking. 

Because of this I've been more exhausted and unmotivated to DO anything productive in my life or at work. It really takes a lot for me to be active and a productive member of society anymore. I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks just because I have no energy. > yes I've tried detoxing from my caffeine intake and it didn't help my sleeping any<  I've tried taking sleep aids like Melanin and ZzzQuil and even sleepy tea but nothing really works.

Recent Neurology Study Finds 6Hz Theta Wave Binaural Beats Gets You Deep Into A Stress-Reducing Meditative State Faster Than Meditation Alone...,"From the study:

""The brain responses to the 6-Hz binaural beat revealed in this study showed that theta activity was enhanced similar to that observed in a meditative state within just 10 min of exposure. Therefore, a 6-Hz binaural beat on a 250 Hz carrier tone could be utilized as a stimulus for inducing a meditative state, as meditation has several advantages, such as stress reduction. However, achieving such effects via meditation require a deep meditative state that often takes a long period of time. With this binaural beat, a meditative state can be induced in just 10 min and may be more feasibly implemented in modern lifestyles.""

I just made this pure 6Hz Theta binaural beats track, like the one they used in the study, for myself to use during meditation. And I  decided to share it on YouTube in case others want to use it to reduce their stress, too.

I find this to be perfect for stress reduction, and have included a link to the study in the description of the video.

The Best TED Talks For Dealing With Stress,
"How To Manage The Voice Between Your Ears – Less Stress, Less Anxiety, More Focus, More Happiness","We all have this voice between the ears that either helps us progress or regress. It’s talking to you all day long, from the moment you wake up to the moment you fall asleep. The conversation is nonstop. When you are unaware of this, it will yank you around causing you to spiral out of control. It tells you to eat that cookie. It tells you to get fired up and angry. It tells you to react, react, and react some more. It’s what makes you check your email 53 times a day. It’s what allows you to lose your temper when it might be unwise.

Most of us are never really fully present in what’s going on right now. We subconsciously believe that the next moment must be more important than this one. ‘I’ll be happier when I get a new job. I’ll be happier when I get married. Never mind, I’ll be happier when I have a kid. Well that’s not working, maybe I’ll be happier if I buy a cabin in the mountains. Nope, that’s not working either. Well, it’s definitely the shore house I always dreamed of having. Nope, that’s not it either. Maybe it’s grandkids.’ Before you know it, you have missed your whole life because you couldn’t tolerate the now.

“Your inner narrator, the voice that chases you out of bed in the morning and yammers at you all day long. It has you constantly comparing yourself to other people, engaging in ruthless self-criticism, and casting forward into the future or ruminating about the past, to the detriment of whatever is happening right now.” — Eckhart Tolle

So what do you do? How can you manage the circus inside your head? 

I can’t tell you the definite answer to that question. What I can tell you is that the stories your inner narrator is telling you has no relationship to reality. Of course, there are times where it has great ideas. But you have to have awareness to be able to step out of that traffic to see if it’s a good idea or a terrible one. This awareness is often referred to as mindfulness. It is an innate part of our human capacity. You just need to step out of the noise for just a little bit.

We evolved from threat detection. Constantly being on guard. So when our body thinks we are in danger, it shuts down.

The first step is to understand that we have the ability to hack our minds and get out of this rut.
The next step is to  view mental exercise the same way we view physical exercise.
Every time you get lost in thought and you notice that it’s happening, that’s a rep for your brain.

Meditation Explained For The Skeptical, Practical Person

You may believe that meditation is ‘woo-woo’ stuff and that it’s not for you. That’s okay. There is plenty of research being uncovered by neuroscientists that are showing you how meditation is literally changing the brain. But if you’re skeptical, let me tell you what it is and how you can take a practical approach to trying this out.

Meditation is about learning to RESPOND not REACT.

It’s about feeling your breath coming in. Feeling it coming out. Your breath is the one thing that remains constant 24/7. It’s easy to set your attention on this. Every time you get distracted you just start over. And over. And over again.

I tried to do it for a very long time and had a full-on collision with the voices in my head. It’s easy to dismiss it as something that’s not for you. ‘I just can’t sit still and not think for that long.’ Does that sound familiar?

The other side of the coin is that if you can’t sit still and remove yourself from the noise for just 5 minutes out of the 1,440 minutes in the day…it’s  probably a good idea to address this.

The Secret To Meditation

Here’s the secret. You can’t win at meditation. It’s not a competitive sport. You’re winning as soon as you realize that the clown in your head is just a clown. That’s all it is. We’re telling ourselves a bunch of stories all day long. It’s not a reality until you make it reality.

The first 7-10 days will be absolutely terrible. You’re thinking is it lunch? Do I need a haircut? Is my boss going to ask me to stay late today? Do we have groceries? That’s absolutely normal. After 10 days (more or less), you’ll start to be somewhat conscious of your breathing. Not only during the time you set aside to do so, but when you’re going about your day to day activities. That is the ultimate goal, right? 10 days might be a stretch, it takes some people weeks, months, or even years. The point is that you show up every single day and spend .004% of your day practicing. Don’t put expectations on yourself that are unattainable. It’s all about progressing a little bit at a time.

I’m not saying that you’re never going to get angry or sad again. That’s not the point. Those are necessary emotions to experience from time to time. But you will be 10x better at managing these emotions when they arise and simply moving on.

Easiest way to get started?

Use an app. It’s really not complicated, we make it complicated. It’s just about breathing in and breathing out. The app is just a cool way to stay accountable. I love using one in particular called Headspace. You can see how much total time you’ve spent meditating. You can also see how many days in a row you’ve been practicing. It is a form of guided meditation, which is a nice touch. So when you get lost in thought, every once in a while you have a gentle reminder to focus back on the breath.

I’ve also just set a timer and played around with different breathing methods. That works really well too. Here is one of my favorites called the ‘Wim Hof Method’:

Take 30 deep breaths. In through your nose. Out through your mouth.
Don’t overthink it, just breathe.
On your 31st breath, as you breathe out fully getting rid of all the stale air, hold your breath. Do not let any air come in. Hold it.
The gasp-reflex will happen automatically and you will inhale one of the most fulfilling breaths ever.
Hold it for 15 seconds.
Exhale.
Take a few normal breaths.
That is one cycle. Should take you less than 5 minutes.

The Reward?

Your senses are incredibly sharp. You can hear the birds singing in the trees. Your food tastes amazing. You’re not obsessing about things. You’re just enjoying being right there with everything that’s happening right now."
14 Ways to Cope With It All,"1.	Be resilient.
It’s easier to deal with life if you can adapt to a variety of situations.

2.	Be open minded.
It’s easier to be critical of a situation or a person, especially if those around you are doing so. Don’t let others be a negative influence on you. Keep an open mind and come to your own conclusions and you’ll experience things in a more positive way.

3.	Be yourself.
Other people may have an opinion on how you should handle things, but you have to do what works for you. You know yourself best – have confidence in your ability to handle things in your own way and in your own time.

4.	Keep Laughing.
Keep things from getting too serious by hanging on to your sense of humor. Find ways to have fun, and plan time with uplifting friends -  a good laugh will make you feel a lot better

5.	Meet new people.
One of the best antidotes for feeling down is to go out and meet new people or participate in new activities. You may find that despite your difficulties, there’s still a lot out there to enjoy.

6.	Don’t sweat the small stuff.
A renowned cardiologist’s philosophy for dealing with stress: (1) Don’t sweat the small stuff. (2) It’s all small stuff.

7.	Use the five-year rule.
Ask yourself: “Five years from now, how important will this problem be?” Nine out of 10, the answer is “Not very important.” The five-year rule can keep you from blowing the situation out of proportion.

8.	Talk to someone.
Don’t bottle up your problems. Go to someone you trust and get it off your chest. Sometimes just verbalizing the problem can help you see it in a different light. If things get bad enough, consider setting up an appointment with a counsellor.

9.	Make your escape.
Taking a break can do wonders for your frame of mind. Your escape doesn’t have to be as elaborate as a vacation; a shopping trip, movie, or walk in the park can do the trick.

10.	Let it out.
Release your frustration in a productive way; a hard sporting game, or going for a run, working out, get yourself moving. It can help ease the tension.

11.	Forget about it.
Sometimes you’ve got to say, “This isn’t important enough to give my time to” and move on from whatever has got you down.

12.	Do something nice.
If you find that you are thinking about your own worries too much, focus on someone else who’s dealing with a tough situation. You’ll get a good feeling from doing something nice for him or her, and you’ll forget about your own troubles.

13.	Do one thing at a time.
If your workload seems overwhelming, don’t get discouraged. Take the most important task that’s haunting you, and start on it. Accomplishing even one of your “to do’s” can make you feel like you’re back in control.

14.	Give yourself a break.
Some people create stress by setting standards that are too high to reach. Don’t try to be perfect – sometimes you’ll have to be satisfied with “good enough.”

Managing stress at work.,"Stress makes me ill. They do not pay me enough to make me ill. 

Over the years I have stuck to some basic rules. They may already be on /r/stress. Anyway, it is good to share.   

Negative stress is a term I heard used for things that you have no way of controlling/fixing/moving forward. This type of stress is a killer. If you find yourself dealing with negative stress, tell your boss. You don't work for your boss, your boss works for you. It is their job to make sure you can do yours. The higher up in a company someone works, the more people they work for. Delegate your problems upwards. If you can see a way to de-stress your boss - do it! A stressed boss is hard to delegate to.  

Positive stress is facing the challenge of doing things that you MIGHT be able to achieve (at least it is in my vocabulary). Positive stress is still stress, although some people get such a kick from it they actually create stressful situations. Avoid these people. I do my best to see problems as challenges. When you have things to do, and you find the sheer volume or complexity daunting, break the job down. I am talking ticking things off. Lists. For quantity, tick off every time you have dealt with X amount of doodahs. For complexity, break the job into smaller tasks, and tick them off as you go. Starting can be the hardest thing - so get ticking as soon as you can. Remember, you can only eat an elephant one bite at a time.    

EDIT: And never break down your day into hours to tick off. Tick off jobs/qty, not time.

"College is the best, but mostly the worst, thing that’s ever happened to me","Hi all. I’m a college sophomore about to start my second semester on Monday, and I just can’t handle the stress anymore. I have really good grades, but I just don’t know if it’s worth what’s happened to my body and mind because of stress. I wake up every morning violently sick to my stomach because I have another day of stress ahead, and I can barely eat or sleep anymore. I want so badly to learn and be able to help other people by using what I know, but I just feel like the expectations and standards that I’m being held to are more than anyone who at least slightly cares about grades can bear, especially if that person is anxious by nature. I reached my lowest point last semester and contemplated suicide several times, but never seriously. The workload I’ve been given has taken over my entire life, but I don’t want to quit because I can’t help others the way I would like to without this college degree. The only reason I’m posting on here is because I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just need a reason to keep going and some advice on how to destress and stop feeling overwhelmed. "

I didn't have this feeling for my other job when I first started. I just feel really anxious the night before work and feel like I'm the new person who might make a stupid mistake and annoy everyone. I'm guessing it's because I feel less confident in this area than I do in my other job, but I don't know how to get over it. I just hate being the new person and am having trouble sleeping each night because I can't stop thinking about all the things that might go wrong at work tomorrow.

Losing my house but I’m going to be okay,"Dear kind souls of Reddit, 

I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay. I would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way. 

I bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016. I got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and I got house insurance and title insurance. After I moved in, I began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter.  I have spent around $4,000 in repairs over the past two years and I think I have finally solved the problem. My sewer stopped working properly in March of this year and I have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem.  The plumber and I put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street. I ended up having to dig up my driveway, break the sewer and put the camera through....only to find that the sewer is clean. The sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it. In order to fix the broken pipe, the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there, and in order to do this, I will have to completely remove my house, fix the sewer, and then put my house back on my property. The total bill for this will be around $10,000 and it is at the point where I am ready to just get a new house. I will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house, but I don’t really have many options. 

I would not have bought this house if I had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance won’t cover any of this. I have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing, but I have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for several months, I am under so much stress, and I am furious. I have been living in a hotel since March while I am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that I can’t live in.

"In a stressful, anxious and lonely period. How to cope with it?","Many things have happened in just 7 days.

I broke up with my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship lasted a year.
Even tho it was all toxic I miss him, to distract myself I should hang out with people, but honestly.. I'm not good with people. I don't have lots of friends, and they are not even good..

My third year in high school is ending and it's really stressful with last tests. I have 3 more weeks to go but it feels like eternity.

I decided that I will study more to get a 3.0 GPA so that I can access to college. But to attend college in America.. I will go there and live by my own. So all these thoughts are making me exhausted.

I feel like I want to isolate myself more than I already am. Like, as soon as I finish my school day, I'll head home and try to relax. I don't want to see anyone and talk to anyone. My mother said that it's been too much time since I actually made a real smile, not a fake one.

It's just that I have priorities (like college) and I can't seem to mantain friendships because I'm so emotionally beaten down and stressed.

I see everyone like an enemy now: I started to dislike everyone for their shitty behavior. Everyone is just so annoying and kinda mean these days.

I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?,"I’ve just taken two weeks off work for anxiety related issues. The anxiety is about my health. 

For the last 4 years, I’ve had constant health issues of one kind or another. It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. 
Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. 
Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma.
Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine!

About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS

I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. 

Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. 

I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it. And now I’m worried that my heart will give in due to stress. 

How do I get over it and stop stressing about stuff? "
My mom keeps laughing at me whenever I get upset,"So today I got really upset because my mom called the electric company a long time ago and they came today about our bill, my mom denied it was us who called. He asked the other neighbors and he was asking for the apartment that called them about the bill, he said that they had low income so they were trying to see if they can figure out what to do with the bill or something along those lines. (So my mom tried telling them that after using the heater ONCE in the winter, the bill was $300) After hearing that, I told my Mom about it. We have low income because my mom is the only one working and she doesn’t have her green card yet, our dad also left us so it’s harder for her to clean houses for money. So anyways I told my mom that we could’ve saved money. She said it doesn’t matter, I told her that I know that my mom can’t earn money. That’s why I always try to find ways to save money. I’m only 12 and Im aware  going through puberty so I get mad easily. I was shouting back, asking her why she never tried to save money. She doesn’t respond and starts laughing at me, I’ve been getting stressed out a lot this past week and my mom just doesn’t help. She laughs whenever I get stressed, she tries to communicate to others about useless things with her extremely broken English, and she keeps using her money on useless things. Overall I’m fine with all the other things but I just get way more stressed when my mom keeps laughing at me when I get upset. It is unlikely for me not to start crying when she starts laughing. She then starts laughing at me even more, I’m having second thoughts on her being a nice person. I’m starting to think that she bullied others, all I know is that my mom fought with other kids to be at a “higher level” of a clique, a leader, I remember her telling me about a mark on her back from fighting. I know I went off topic a bit while typing this but I’m just really annoyed that my mom laughs at my stress and calls me insane for shouting. I’ve tried many times, asking her not to laugh at me while I’m stressed out, it never works. I have no idea how to make her stop, I was wondering if anyone could suggest anything to make my mom listen.

Feel like I am burning out (again...) Help: what do I do?,"Hey guys, first time posting on this sub, so I hope you can help me out!

I am so stressed and I feel like I just can't any more. I'm 19F and I burnt out two years ago, I did improve at some point, but now it's even worse. I constantly feel like I'm about to puke and/or cry, it feels like my heart is about to stop and my head is just going to explode. I have so many piled up stress from college, being the main invester in a LDR and just all the extra stuff that happens in life. I just don't have time to relax, but even if I do try to relax my head is just screaming....

I can't focus and miss a lot of classes and that makes me even more stressed. I can't do anything to take away the stressfactors, because I'm allready trying to do (and failing) the bare minimum.

I eat less than I need, because it only makes me feel sick and I can't talk to anyone. People either tell me to stop worrying about it, or in the case of my mother, get mad at me, because stress can't make you that sick, so I'm just being a wuss.

Really what do I do? Is there a miracle mantra, because I feel like I can't hold on much longer..."
2016,Anyone else having the worst year of their life so far? Here's to hoping 2017 is better 🍻
A week from today I have no idea where I will lay my head at night.,"1 week til my apartment's lease is up and my husband and I have to be out.  No idea where we will go. We have been looking at apartments and houses for a month straight and found nothing that fits what we need. I've been so stressed out I've made myself physically sick a couple mornings before work. I cry most evenings, before I fall asleep on the couch at 8pm from pure exhaustion of being stressed, work and packing. 

Just desperately need something positive to happen right now.


Update!  We found a place!  Went just a bit further out of where we were looking (45 minute commute) and found a perfect house to rent, fits our style and needs, and most importantly , our budget. Just needed help with the deposit, and my husbands boss was willing to help us with it. Things do get better. "
Do you ever feel like you can't inhale completely when you're feeling stressed?,What's that caused by? Is it something that should be fixed somehow?
10 Ways to De-Stress in 10 Seconds,
Too stressed. ,"So they say a little stress is good for us. Makes us work well under pressure etc. But I just don't get that kind of stress. For example at work when things get on top of me I tend to just freak out. My job involves a lot of lifting and shifting, so it is also physically demanding. It starts to make me look bad, as when people come to ask me for things I have become very dismissive and this isnt like me.

I have had cognitive behavioural therapy (privately) for anxiety/stress/depression and it did work a little. But when I'm at work I can't really use the techniques I was taught. 

I have started getting headaches. I also used to be on beta blockers for high blood pressure (and im only 21). 

Any suggestions on how to go forward? I don't want to go see the doctor because I don't want to have any psychological problems on my health records. Looks kind of bad. Sometimes I think about meds, but i've had substance abuse issues in the past so i would rather not go back there.

Hope you are all doing well. :) xx"
"Sophomore in high school, I don’t care about it anymore and I’m slipping.","For some background I’ve always been a good student. Always in mostly honors (in 6th grade I got kicked out of honors math but it was for the best) and teachers usually like me. But this quarter has just left me completely empty of giving a shit about school. I have a job, I’m in band and jazz band, and I I still like those but I hate school now. I’ve never had this much resentment towards it in my life and I just fucking hate it. I don’t know why or how this started but it’s causing me to slip. This quarter just ended and my lowest grades were C+, one in chemistry and one in my honors English class. My dad told me I need to figure out why I got F’s in certain assignments but I just don’t have the heart to tell him I barely worked on them. I don’t feel like I’m lazy because I’m constantly working, but I’m also not putting in the work. I feel so fucking inadequate, I have friends in way tougher classes that are upset that they have an A-. My parents never praise me for good grades, they only ever bring it up when I have less than adequate. What should I do? If I’m not already burnt out I think I might be getting there. "
I need some tips on reliving stress,"I don't know why but I'm really stressed out lately. Well maybe I do but being stress is so hard on me because I know damn well I ruined relationships with the people around me. It just started recently and I think the cause of me being stress is how I don't have the usual motivation to do good in my study anymore in result, I got upset with the product which is mainly guilt. I know it's my fault but I want to be on track again. Hope anyone who's reading this can give me some of the tip that helped you to relieve stress. Thank you for your time 💚"
Flu+College=Stress,"I’m in school right now, but I got the flu over the weekend. Decided to tough it out and go to class today, but at the end of the day, I felt so awful. Went to my professor for my 5 hour chemistry lab tomorrow not even asking to skip but just to work with a partner on the lab tomorrow so it would be just a litter easier on me, and he said “no, you’ll have to do it on your own.” I feel really disrespected and stressed by this because I am an A student in his class (and others), and he knew that I am really sick, and I’m trying my best. It’s not like I was asking to just skip the lab and not make it up, all I asked for was a partner to help me through it because I’m going to get tired, and I’m afraid my sick brain will miss something important along the way and mess up the experiment. I just feel so behind in the class after only one weekend of being sick, and I felt like I deserved a little more mercy than that after all the work I’ve put into his class. That’s my rant. If anyone has any advice or comforting words, I’d appreciate it. 


Update:
I ended up having to miss all of my classes today because I was so feverish that I couldn’t see straight. I emailed the lab professor basically begging to let me make up the lab, and eventually he relented, so I do get to make it up. This whole experience was a horrible mess, and it has totally destroyed his likability as a professor for me.

How do I leave work at work?,"I have an hour long train ride home and i am looking for the best way to unplug and disconnect from thoughts of work so that i can come home de-stressed and ready for time w/ my kids.  

I hold a C level position and am continuously thinking of work and the open items looming in the head. My current hour is spent blasting music into the headphones, playing a video game on the phone and generally glancing at the phone every few seconds, none of which brings any relief. "
To begin,"I'm gonna start my story with who ever reads this I'm doing this as a way to get through the pain. So I ask you to keep everything positive and thank you. The 9th of January started off as any other day, the wife and I wake up and our beautiful little girl wakes up too. She gets ready for work and I help I dont work anymore because I am 90% disabled through the V.A., but she works at a daycare and takes the little one with her and before she left she asked "" Can you clean up the apartment."" and I replied with "" Yea I can do that love you."" and she left. So I started cleaning up the toys and I became light headed so I sat down, now this has been happening to me for the last few months more and more. Then I became nauseous when I sat down so I stumbled to the bathroom and puked which then caused an asthma attack which caused an anxiety attack. So I call a veteran's hospital I go to and talk to a nurse she told me to go the an emergency room. I hang up and call my wife to tell her what's happening and she says ""dont go just go sit in the shower."" I replied with "" I'll try but I don't know if I can."" I then call my brother to see if he can come from his job to take me. He is a Lt. in the local volunteer fire Co. and has medical experience. He heard how I sounded and said he was gonna hang up and call for and ambulance for me, he did so and then called me back to tell me it was on its was and that he's was going to call my wife to tell her. After he hangs up with her I get a text from my wife again telling me not to go. At this point a police officer shows up and I ended up going unconscious on him to wake to EMS trying to get me to the ambulance. I am taken to the closes hospital. I have to put this into multiple parts so watch for the next post."
School Stress,"Hello everyone! I’m currently in my last year of high school and I’m having a hard time dealing with it. I live in Eastern Europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge you’ve gained since grade 1. Two exams are mandatory - one in literature and the other one, you can choose the subject yourself.

For my second one I chose physics and I’m pretty confident with that. However, literature has always been a huge burden on mine and I find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam. I am beyond angered constantly that I have to deal with that subject - I do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments, but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and I can’t do anything but hate the guts out of it.

Now, me being the perfect student, raised by perfectionist parents, I can’t even think about having low grades on that exam. I study in a “highly respected” school, where teachers can be pure evil to you. I also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine, which stress me out even more. At the end of the day, I feel so drained out and like I’ve achieved nothing, even though I have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams.

I’ve started feeling physically unwell. I used to work out a lot but now I don’t have the energy to go out of my bed. My blood pressure is very low and I’ve gained weight. I’ve given up to emotional eating one too many times.

I wanna shine for prom. I want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me. But I’m scared that school will drain me out too much.

This is more of a rant post because I know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more. I just can’t let myself rest. My mind is constantly busy with my work. 

Anyways, any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated.

If you made it that far, thank you for taking the time to read about my problems. "
Stress in school,"I need help with coping with stress in school. We get, on average, 1-2 hours of homework. Just to say, i'm in junior high. When I attempt to do homework; I get a raging headache and when I do bad or don't know something; I cry on the spot, or at least  shed a few tears. I don't want to take medications or talk to some people because most of my friends would say it's a joke. Sometimes, I can't get more than 2-3 hours of sleep because of this. Hope you could help me. If you think this is a solution. Nope, I can't switch schools because then I would ""throw away my future."" I do get good grades though and our grading system is a lot more strict. Is there anything I could do to get through this?"
Missed an exam,"Alright cool, one of the most important math exams just happened today, I felt sick to my stomach not wanting to go to school (my school provides a second date if you miss the first one) and now, I realized I'm the only one who didn't do the exam, I feel uncomfortable as shit making my teacher write an entire exam all over again just for me, and the thing is, I don't think I was sick, I think I just felt like crap."

How can I improve my stress threshold?,"I get stressed very easily and very quickly. Loud noises are particular stressors, eg. Someone vacuuming or playing drums. 

I had a particularly stressful event occur today and my Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was at 198bpm. My resting heart rate is around 55bpm and often drops down to the 40s so this really scared me. 

Is there a way I can increase my ‘tolerance’ and threshold so that I am not getting stressed so easily? I run everyday and the exercise certainly helps my overall mood but I don’t feel it helps how easily I get stressed. "
What should I do about chronic stress,"Hi, I'm 20 years old and kind of accepting that I've got chronic stress issues. I'm not sure how to deal with it exactly, and it's been 3 months. I remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stress/breakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress. I didn't really know what that meant at the time, but overall I felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice (exercise, things like that) and wisdom didn't really help me or I knew would not work because I had already tried. I even tried antidepressants because I thought it could have been something I needed, but that did not help. I'd say for the past 2 years of my life I've done a great job at handling acute stress. That was the only type of stress I knew. Chronic stress, however, is something that I don't understand. It's new to me, and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective. It feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress.

It is admittedly frustrating because I feel too young for it; I'm at an age where I should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff. But instead every day is typically a rollercoaster. My ability to concentrate/focus has been incredibly diminished, and I find the idea of getting back in to school stressful. I am an engineering major, but if math stresses me out I'm just not sure if I can keep it in my life. On the flip side, I want to be doing those things because I liked the challenge. The stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing. I doubly worry because I start to think I have mental health issues, and the fact is that stress CAN open up mental health issues. I find that when the stress gets to a breaking point, which has only happened once in my life, I shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am I supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going. There are things which cause me stress that I don't think are supposed to cause me that much stress, but they simply do because it's chronic I guess. I don't know if I""m supposed to push on and work on my problems in ""the storm"" or withdraw and bide my time.

I also seem to suffer from anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. If I isolate myself from anything stressful (school, work, etc.) it is possible to feel some pleasure, albeit a small amount. I've been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure (weightlifting was a big one) and then taking on the more stressful things (school and work), but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects. What really kills me is that my sleep suffers; if I could get 8 hours a night, I would be able to push through without worrying, but for the past 3 nights I've gotten probably 5-6 hours of sleep. I haven't even started school yet, and I don't really work THAT much. So now I'm sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again. I truthfully don't know what to do, or what in particular causes my chronic stress. I want to live life like normally so I can combat depression and things like that, but then the stress keeps me up. I am seeing a counselor, and hopefully a therapist soon, but I am in the early stages of that.

Is this something that can be medicated? Can you ""medicate"" stress away? Or does it boil down to lifestyle changes? I've done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years, which is another frustrating thing. I don't drink, smoke, but admittedly I think about sex too much and I'd say that is my vice at the moment. It was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way. That said, I don't pursue sex in an unhealthy way but I might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that I'm missing. I eat pretty healthily, not a fan of soda or junk food, I see food more as calories and less for pleasure. Other than that, I loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting. Now, however, I feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because I know I don't sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress. I want to bulk up a bit, and get back to more intense/heavier lifting, but I'm not sure if that's even healthy for me in my given state. At the same time, I get stressed out after a week or two if I'm NOT doing that. Lol again with the flipping a token thing.

I don't really like being around my friends or people as much when I'm like this, not because I am in a ""bad mood"" but because I know I can't simply vibe with them. I'll be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it. This is why I think I really like counseling because it's just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone.

My only solace has been learning how to play my guitar, but that's not what I intend to do with the rest of my life, and it doesn't always take the stress away. Sometimes I just get tired of playing it.

What are my options? I'm 20 years old, live at home with my dad, so I don't have much responsibility thankfully. I've done quite a bit with my life that I'm happy about, so I feel like I was doing what I wanted, so it's tough thinking about how to change. All the things I've been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when you're just not doing anything with yourself. But again now when I start doing those things I experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop, thus depression can come back... I kind of yearn for when things didn't feel this stressful; the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago, and man I thought THAT was a challenge because during that time I was just finding myself. Looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came, not battling it every waking hour. I understand things about mindfulness, meditation, making the right choices, etc., but man that doesn't explain why I can't get enough sleep."
Physical reactions to stress,"So I'm dealing with a lot of stress right now from a new job, and I've noticed my body behaving differently after I started working. I've been coughing a lot lately, I feel like I can't breath, some discomfort in my stomach from time to time. I don't know if this is normal? I was perfectly fine before the job, but should I go see a doctor?"
Already screwed up at new job and I feel terrible,"I just started a new job, haven’t even been there a week yet, and I already screwed up. I work in an office, never worked in one before, so I’m still new, but I feel like my job is already in jeopardy. I was let off with a warning, but now I can’t make another mistake. It’s only been three days. I can’t disclose what happened for confidentiality reasons, but needless to say I feel really stressed out right now, and I don’t know what to do."
"I just realized that I believe that if I'm not constantly under a lot of pressure, I won't perform well.","In pretty much every aspect of my life.  It doesn't matter what I'm doing, I always find a way to psyche myself out.  It's pretty exhausting and I want to stop.  I feel like in a way, I have an addiction to it.  "
Work environment stress,"So hi. I’m a new ish mechanic in the field. I know some but not all of my job obviously. I’m the green horn. At my job, we have few employees. It’s actually only about 4-5 mechanics, a shop boss and a couple others. For the most part the job is good. 

Good pay, good training opportunities, good foot in the door. There’s just one problem. One of the most experienced mechanics on the floor, is the grizzled vet type who doesn’t sugar coat things and makes me feel pretty worthless and dumb if I approach them for guidance. 

The stress or anxiety of even thinking about approaching this man is to a level where my  stomach physically churns. (This is not an over exaggeration). Each day I dread more and more, going in to work. I’ve never had to deal with this kind of environment, stress, or person before. The kind of being that can instantly make you your stomach turn to knots. I just don’t get it. I’m miserable. I’m miserable in a job I thought I loved.

I don’t have any debt which is great, and I’d like to get a mortgage soon as well, but I keep worrying about money. My partner has unsteady income which stresses me out on his behalf. I have a steady job, don’t make a fortune but it’s safe and have career prospects. 

I read somewhere that most milenials are worried about money. That doesn’t surprise me. Anyone else out there feel the same? "
I am done,"I have given my all to work. I have given almost my health to it. I have a troubled background that forced me to take responsibility early in my life.

Since that I have been taking responsibility of everything and landed in a high profile job leading a sales company. 

Now I am empty. I can barely function. The company is not doing well. I can’t change that even if I try as hard as I can. I have made a big decision and resigned but my contract keeps me there for January. 

How can I push this month and all the challenges there still are? How can I show example to my team and keep them pushing. I have nothing to give.

Ulcers?,"Hi, Im 17 and I have multiple serious mental illnesses and disorders, and Im in the middle of my senior year. Stress! Everywhere! On top of that, boy problems, I have like no friends, my dog has cancer, my grandpa was just diagnosed with his third brain tumor, and Ive been crying nonstop all week.
 Recently, for the past week or so, Ive been feeling a really sharp upper abdominal thing. I knew from an interview I saw of kurt cobain that ulcers are often caused by stress so I asked my mom and she said that my family is extremely prone to ulcers. I learned my grandma had most of her stomach taken out and btw, shes fucking nuts now (unrelated to the ulcer but mental illness does tend to come more from her lineage). So thats the hand im given and I was hoping someone here might know some good ways of keeping the pain at bay or worsening it? Getting a new body isnt an option unfortunately :/

Waitressing - MY MIND WONT STOP. How to destress and sleep at night?,"I've been serving for 3 years now and it's come to the point where I've noticed work really affects me after I'm home. I get home after 10 hours and am physically so tired I should pass out immediately but my mind is going insane. I can't stop remembering orders or what people asked for and can't fall asleep for hours. My brain simply won't stop firing. I can try and drink a cup of tea wind down but when I lay in bed my brain just won't relax. Does anyone know the science behind it? Neurotransmitters won't sleep or what is going on, even after a few hours laying in bed? 

I love serving and I don't want to stop but I know longterm affects of stress on your body are detrimental.

"""I will never graduate"" (advice please?)","I've been smart and have never had to try that hard in school. I would not do homework and cram the night before exams and pass.

Then I'm stressed about the material I missed, but I'm too anxious to contact the teacher because I think they don't like me because I missed class. 
So I distract myself and drown in Netflix until 4 am and sleep through all my classes, and when I am up for them I don't go because I'm anxious I will be put down by the teacher.

My Ongoing Journey with Stress and How to Cope,"I find stress to be like most things in life good in moderation. I have found myself in many stressful situations at work that have forced me to focus on what's important and to get it done. 

With too little stress I find I have no motivation to move forward. 

Too much stress (or the wrong kind of stress) can be debilitating and possibly detrimental to your health. There have been many times where I have stressed myself out over what ifs that I end up saying fuck it or I end up in a ball on the floor sick to my stomach (whether it's going out by myself to see a friend's band, talking to a girl, or reaching out to others when I need help) and my mom has stressed herself out to the point where she's had panic attacks in the past.

It wasn't until the past few months that I've come to understand stress (or at least come to an understanding that helps me). For me stress boils down to a conflict between the way things are and the way I want them to be. For example, right now I am trying to launch a side business, maintain my 9-5, help my wife with our 9 month old son, and train for several up coming endurance events. I want things to go smoothly and find time for everything but life has other plans. 

A couple of months ago my team was working on a big release for our product and I had a pivotal role. There were some nights where there was never a break. I would put in a quick workout after work, cook dinner for my family, try to make some progress with my side business, and after my son went to bed I had to do some work for my 9-5. I felt overwhelmed. I felt guilty that I wasn't doing more. And most of all I felt like I wasn't good enough. I wasn't a good enough employee, I wasn't a good enough entrepreneur, I wasn't a good enough husband, and I wasn't a good enough father.

There was one night where I skipped dinner and just cried in bed....I had two options. 
1) Let the stress get the better of me and drop some of the things I am trying to do or 2) figure out a way to cope.

For me the first step in coping was mindful meditation, where I learned that I am NOT my thought and I am NOT my emotions. I learned to quiet my mind and focus. I learned how to separate myself from emotions. (I'm not saying that emotions are bad. I still feel everything but I don't allow them to control me or send me into a tail spin anymore).

My second step was realizing that the mental, physical, and emotional selves are interconnected and can go into a feedback loop.

Example: I had a call recently about my side business that I was nervous about. As the time for the call drew closer I got more nervous. Then I started to think ""Who do you think you are to even try doing this"" which fed into my nervousness to the point where I felt queazy. If I had allowed it to keep going I probably would've made myself sick. I stopped myself when I realized what was happening used some exercises I learned in my meditations. Once I was able to calm emotions I focused my mind to preparing for the call giving it no room to explore what ifs. It wasn't until later that I realized that once I was calm and focused my stomach settled as well.

My third step was to learn how to start gaining control of my mind, body, and emotions.

One of the techniques I use regularly is nasal breathing.

Did you know that breathing though your nose and into your stomach engages the parasympathetic nervous system. (The sympathetic nervous system is responsible for the fight or flight response while the parasympathetic nervous system is more related to restoration and digestion)

So what does that mean? When you engage the parasympethic nervous system you short circuit the sympathetic nervous system effectively halting the fight or flight response.

As an added bonus focusing on your breath takes your mind off of the situation for the moment helping to calm down and focus once you return your attention to the situation at hand.

I still have times where I get stressed and depressed but I know have steps to cope with it. Sometimes it's a matter of lightening my load and other times it's changing my focus from what if to something tangible to move myself forward.

I know how debilitating stress can be and I hope my experiences/ongoing journey can help."
"Lost My Job, Feeling Stressed out and Worthless","f24
I lost my Job recently due to performance, not wanting to damage relationships I had built in my career I decided to quit instead of be fired and drag it all out. I was a great worker and my colleagues loved me, I just couldn't reach the targets they had set for me. 
I am currently searching for a new career but I am scared and stressed. I feel like everyone is judging me, I feel like I am not contributing. I don't want to change my personality just because I am jobless. But it seems that people expect me to act a different way (namely more housewife focused things like cooking and cleaning). I want to work on my artwork, but every time I do I feel crushing guilt and stress. I am applying for many jobs a day.

Overwhelmed by College,"I have a Computer Science class for 6 hours once a week on Saturdays. I feel like everyone is understanding everything and I feel like I'm the dumbest guy in the class. I had one of the lowest scores on my test, a 48/100. I can't get my program assignment to work, while every one else has theirs working like it was no problem, and whenever I ask for help, I feel like the professor is upset at me because it was something we learned about earlier in the semester. I do pay attention in class, but I have to get up at 5:00 AM to be able to make it to class at 7:00 AM for my PreCal class, and I have English 1A. And I'm always scheduled to work from 6:30 PM - 10:30 PM at my job, giving me almost no time to sleep. I understand there are people who are in an even more stressed out situation, but fuck man.."

7 Stress Tips,
Should I tell my boss?,"I work on a team of 4, and we are extremely behind.  Our workload has tripled in the last year without adding additional headcount.  My coworker spends most of her day socializing and I am struggling to get my much heavier work load done.  She pretends she’s too busy to finish her work so others will help her and stays late so it appears she’s working hard.  My boss is in a different area so he doesn’t see it.  The stress of the workload is causing problems with my health.

My question is, is it reasonable to tell my boss what’s going on or does that make me seem like a troublemaker?"
Can stress affect memory and focus?,"This is probably a dumb question, but I feel so dumb recently. I was the best in my grade at science, maths and extension science last year but now I'm in year 11. I make so many dumb mistakes. 

I did a formative, missing 5 of 27 marks on the dumbest of things. Most of the time about half of my work is wrong because of dumb mistakes. 

My memory is also worse, from the point that I could remember most things without studying them, now I forget how to do it within days without study.

This leads to more stress because I think I'm getting dumber and there might be something wrong with my brain (thanks health anxiety). I've been more stressed recently and was also more than usual stressed last year when it began. 

Is it common for these sorts of things to happen with stress?

My boyfriend is suicidal and I don't know what to do.,"My boyfriend has been dealing with anxiety and depression for the last few months, it began with him scraping his arm and it has now escalated to him wanting to cut and kill himself. I've been off of work for 15 days and Ill be going back in 4 days and I'm terrified to leave him home alone. He quit his job (we used to work together) because they were abusing him and causing him so much mental distress so I'm the only one working ATM and I of course need to be making money to pay bills. My dilemma is that we've gone to the hospital and he's now in with crisis (mental health center) but his appointment is only after I start work, and he's told me to please never leave him alone because he knows if he is alone is going to end it. So please if you've been in a similar situation I'd love to hear what you did. I live in Ontario and I know that EI is a thing but I've been told not to go on it because it's a huge hassle. So I'm really not sure what to do. "

Seeking Couples (19 years or older) for Research on Stress at Work," 

We are conducting research to help couples manage stress from work and we are looking for participants.

**Participants**: One member of the couple must be a full-time worker that starts work and ends work at approximately the same time (i.e., +/- two hours) each day. For example, if you arrive at work at 8:00am on one day and 2:00pm another day, it would be hard for you to participate in this study. The couple must live together for this research project.

**What the study entails**: The full-time worker will receive two daily surveys at the beginning and end of the workday that will take approximately 5 minutes to fill out. The other member of the couple will receive a daily survey during the day and in the evening (to be completed right before bed).

**Benefits**: As a thank you for participating in our research study, you can earn $1/completed survey for up to $30 per participant and up to a total of **$60 per couple** (you and your significant other).

**Timeline**: The study will begin on **Wednesday, February 6th** in the afternoon and end on **Wednesday, February 27th** in the morning.

My life so far (this is a long one),"So even though I'm only 13, I have a lot to share. Now please don't leave just because you think I'm immature because I'm 13. I've had to grow up fast. My life hasn't been as bad as other people's, but then again it's a lot worse than a lot of others as well. Anyways I'll just start.

So I was born in North Carolina, but lives in South Carolina (lived right by the border and the closest hospital was in NC). I had a good life there from what I could remember. We had a nice house nice neighbors, an awesome dog (important later), and two loving parents. Everything was amazing. But then dad got a job offer up in Wisconsin. Now me back then didn't really understand that we would never see the place again so I didn't really care. I was four when we left.

Now my dad went to Wisconsin to get an apartment and everything, but me, my mom, and my siblings went to Minnesota to live with my grandparents who lived in a small trailer on a farm. I loved it. It was amazing. They had 2 dogs (Tuesday and Tom), that Molly got to play with. (Molly is our dog.) There was never any shortage of things we could do. Many of my fondest memories came from there. I never had to use any electronics or anything. We stayed there for about 150 days, when we heard from Dad that he got everything ready. I was sad that we had to leave, but excited that we got to see dad and the apartment. I was 5 when we left.

Unfortunately the apartment couldn't have dogs, so we had to leave Molly with my grandparents for awhile. Once again, because I was a kid I only saw the upsides, and didn't understand why my parents were yelling all the time. I looked forward to every summer, where we would go back and visit the farm. I got to see Molly, and Tuesday. Unfortunately one of the neighbors mistook Tom as the dog who killed their chickens, and took him away. I was sad, but once again, I just didn't understand why, or what happened to him.

Occasionally through the year me my siblings, and my dad would go see his side of the family. There was my aunt let's call her R who had two kids, I'll call them L and W, and there was my uncle, let's call him T who also had 2 kids, let's call them C, and I. After awhile, when we were at our apartment out parents called us in. We all came in and they told us that T had been murdered. It was the first time I delete with death, besides when my brother's Guinea pig died in SC. I cried a lot knowing that I would never see him again. I was 6.

I went to school right when I turned 7. I liked it. I made some friends, one of which was named Adam. He was my best friend for the next few years. Kindergarten was kind of a blur. After which we switched schools. And guess what. So did Adam. We were pals again. We went to this tiny school (I believe it was Catholic) I was the oldest one there aside from my brothers who were in 4th, and 5th. It was all one room. I also have some fun memories of that place. Halfway through the year, Adam moved to a different school for reasons I don't know. But a couple days later, we were going to leave as well. I never was able to figure out why, besides the fact that the pastor had done something. I can't help thinking that they were connected. So we went to this bigger school (still Catholic) and guess what. Adam was there again! But, he seemed different. He was hanging out with this other kid named Nick. Nick the dick. He always chose him over me and I hated it. I felt horrible. But then summer came. I was 8.

That's when I heard that we were moving again. But not with our dad. I didn't understand it at that time, when we picked my older sister up from school, she kept on yelling asking if it was a divorce. Divorce. I had never heard that word, and I wish that I could go back and tell young me that that word would change my life. But I can't. So I was just in the back seat of the van, wondering what that word meant. My mom said no, and that they were just separating for now. I went to a new school and had to make new friends again. Adam was gone. I had a new teacher that I absolutely despised,but I'll spare you the details. after 2nd grade, I was 9.

That summer we weren't able to go to our grandparents house because they were buying a new house. I was sad, because I loved that house. But in also hearing this, we got Molly back in our new apartment. My other even older sister let's call her H, took Tuesday as well. In the process of them buying the house, my grandma got sick. She was in the hospital for awhile, and right when my grandpa purchased the house (more of a duplex) my grandma fell, and unfortunately died. It hit me like a tank. But it especially hurt my mom. Her mom had died. But what was even worse was that my grandpa had only bought the house was for my grandma. So he had sold the the trailer for nothing. All of my memories of that place we're gone, and turned into a field of corn. The only time I ever got to see the new house was when we went to my grandmother's funeral, and then, he sold it to go live at IHOP (international house of prayer) 

3rd grade was different. I had a new teacher (one teacher per 2 grade levels) and I was excited. Not much happened in 3rd grade. Everything was good. We lived at this neighborhood which had a bunch of 4 apartment house buildings. (Not complexes, they were more modern-ish, and looked more like huge houses. We had ok neighbors, but one came out in particular. You may remember him as Nick the dick. He still went to the old school, but he was our neighbor. I tried to be friends with him but I couldn't. He was just ugghh. He was horrible. luckily he moved out about a year later. My dad still lived in let's call the town, Mville. Every weekend he would take us to Mville, and we'd sleep over. I liked it, but then again, I was only 9. After 4th grade, I heard that we were moving. Again. Only this time it was to minnesota.i was sad. After Nick had moved out, a woman named Nicki moved in. She had a dog she called teddy. Teddy was amazing. The summers there were amazing. I couldn't have asked for anything more than a summer in that town. I once again had a lot of good memories of that place. But once again, dad wasn't coming with us. right before we were about to leave, dad issued my mom divorce papers. That word again. We stayed 2 more days  then left. We left when I was 10.

When I was eleven, I started 5th grade I had to make friends all over again. It was my first time in public school. I made some friends, but not much happened that year, except for when Robert kneed my in the gut, because Alex over heard me joking around with Corbin and jokingly saying he looked like santa (Don't ask). Anyways after that year, things started to get interesting. My dad got an apartment in our town because he wanted to be closer to us. Every weekend I would go to his place and stay the night, that is if he wasn't back I. Wisconsin working at his other job. It sucked. I loved staying with my mom. I was happy that I got to stay with him more, but sad that I got to stay with Mom less. I was torn. While all of this was happening my sister's relationship with my dad was rolling down hill. I don't know why but my dad would always take stuff out on her. He never abused anyone, but he yells. A lot. I just think that he's changed from the past 10 years. 

Near the end of summer, my mom called me down. She told me that dad and her were going to try and reconcile. I didn't know what to feel. My other siblings didn't know either. My siblings that were moved out didn't like the idea. (I have a lot of siblings.) My dad then moved in. But before all of that, my grandmother's cancer came back. She was stuck in a hospital for a long time. She died later. A few months later, my grandpa suddenly died in his sleep. It was determined that he had cancer as well. Both of them were on my dad's side. I didn't cry for either. I was sad, but I just couldn't. I thought I was weird. 

Half way into 6th grade, my dad moved in. Right away, he began trying to make changes. He would constantly get mad if something wasn't the way he liked. He needed everything to be organized. I hated it. It only lasted a few weeks, until my mom gave him divorce papers. He still lives in our apartment in my sister's room on the bottom bunk. He's still making changes. In the beginning of 6th grade I made a decision that I was going to grow out my hair and donate it to kids wigs, which makes wigs for kids with cancer. My dad didn't like the idea. He used to buzz cut our hair. When it got long enough he was constantly telling me to tie it back, but whenever I did, I would get bullied at school, plus I didn't like it in a ponytail. Throughout 6th grade I was bullied. Mostly for my long hair. I hated 6th grade, for that reason, and other reasons which I will spare you the details for.

Towards the end of 6th grade, Molly began hacking up this white stuff. We thought it was just a cough, but it wouldn't go away. My mom took her to the vet. In the last day of 6th grade, we went home early, which I was glad for because I hated everyone, that day, including my ""friends"", but was sad because my mom said it was to spend time with Molly. We had begun needing to put pads underneath her, because she couldn't go outside to pee. She was constantly throwing up as well. We thought she had another year, but she didn't. She had a tumor pushing up against her lung. We put her down the next day. This time, I cried. I had known her my whole life, and she was always around. I cried for her, but I also cried for my grandmas, grandpa, and Tim, because I knew that I probably wouldn't get another chance to cry for them. I was twelve.

Throughout the summer things weren't very great. My dad decided to run for a public office position, and of course, lost, but he was gone quite a bit, trying to campaign in Wisconsin. I didn't like that I liked that he was gone. I was sad and all, but I was finally able to do my own thing. He did that for most of the summer. This year, I'm still bullied for long hair, (nearly long enough to cut) and my dad is still in our apartment. He still bugs me about my hair, and still yells. We are struggling with money, and my parents still argue a lot. They still try to hide our problems from me, and the family, but we know. And to the very few who read this, and may be able to relate, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that there are others who have to go through this kind of stuff. Just know that your not alone.

Well that was long. I'm sorry for making it that long, but yeah. There are many other things that have happened, and are happening, but I just got down the basics. Thank you."

Tips for dealing with Existential Depression?,"I have OCD, and for the past four months I’ve really been struggling with pervasive existential thoughts, especially when trying to fall asleep. This has made these past couple months thoroughly stressful, and I don’t really know what to do to alleviate it. It just feels like I’ll be having good days, and then I’ll get home and try to sleep and my brain will tell me everything is meaningless, because we’re all gonna die someday and everything we do will eventually disappear.
Sorry for the text block, I just felt I needed to explain myself.
If anyone has tips on how to alleviate some of this, they would be much appreciated."

I've fucked up,I'm almost 30 and I've nothing to show for myself.

I cant even get us out of a couch surfing type living situation. I'm waiting on call backs for apartments I know will decline us anyway. I'm stressed because I have exhausted any ideas I had of getting us our own place. I know i could work a second job but then my kid would be alone. Wtf am I going to do?

Stress in university because I’m struggling to create meaningful friendships,"I feel like a failure.
I feel like secretly no one likes me.

People are organising who they are going to live with next year and now I’m stuck because I have no one. I’m still trying to talk to more people and deepen my existing friendships but my mind tells me things like “you look needy” “they don’t like you”.

I’m starting to feel genuinely unhappy 😪

The only thing that keeps me going is just remembering that everything will work out okay, and I have a song I listen to when I’m stressed.

I’m in my first year btw 

Also I hate when I’m interacting with people I seem happy and confident but deep down I’m sad"
Stress because of my face,"(Sorry for my English) I have a really bad self esteem because I have no confidence around people. I have a port wine stain birthmark on my face and I think I also have repulsive/annoying/serious looking face.
Whenever I meet people they always treat me seriously and give me the stare. I feel insecure and awkward to be around people because I always feel self conscious about my face. I have no idea what did I do to deserve those treatments. When I talk to people they see me as an asshole and they treat me like that. They are either cold or serious all the time when talking to me. It pisses me off so much. 
I am a quiet person and I only talk when people are initiating the talking and most of the time I am silent. I don’t smile often tho, is this why people becomes cold to me? I have no fucking idea. I have little brother and sister and they both have nice friends and their friends treat them normal. Why can’t I be like my siblings? Why do they always treat me like I am a bad bad person when I did nothing wrong?
I have this face since I was born and I have no idea how having friends feel like because I had no friends since I was 7 years old, now I am 22.  
Because of people stares and their treatments, I became a shut in recluse and I didn’t go out because home is the only place where I can feel safe and secure. I also got bullied a lot at grade school all the way to high school. 
I just want to feel normal. Is this something to much to ask for? Do I really have a bitchy Face??
This is my face photos: http://lonelinessfighter.wordpress.com/this-is-anadite-from-reddit/

I lost my hope to live as a normal human being. I am tired living as a recluse loser for more than 15 years (from 1st grade to high school and in college too)
Help me please everyone. You can judge my photo and please be honest. Give me your comments and help because I have no fucking idea how can I live like normal person without feeling insecure and being treated like a mean person.
TL;DR: do I have a bitch face? What should I do? I want friends so bad because I’ve never had one. I am jealous to other people who have friends.

No energy on weekends and it's getting pretty bad. What can I do or change?,"// I originally put this in another sub but I wasn't getting any responses so I decided to give this one a shot.

I've been at school now for a little under a month for this school year, but every weekend thus far has consisted of me having no energy, ignoring my responsibilities, lying in bed face down all day, and then doing everything last minute. It's like I shut off and pretend I don't exist. I am aware of my responsibilities, but I have absolutely no energy or spirit to tend to them. Old thoughts also leak into my head and make things all that worse. Although I procrastinate during the week, things are nowhere nearly this serious.

Since I'm towards the end of my high school education, I understand how extremely important this year is for my future, but I just don't know how to change my mindset. The past year has been draining emotionally (rejected by who I was into), socially (sometimes I don't feel comfortable in my group), academically (no energy/drive and thus poor marks) and so I'm not sure if I conditioned myself with some type of behavioral response.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to explain or deal with my situation, but I thought that a good first step would be to try to reach out and get some advice on here. I am currently not at a place where I can discuss this with my parents in depth, and my friends know that I occasionally get really affected by something but they have no idea that it's this bad."
Post disaster stress help request,"My wife and I live in New Bern NC a town impacted heavily by hurricane Florence. We live in a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath home with our 2 dogs, a cat and a rabbit. We are in our late 50's and lived a quiet life prior to the storm. 2 weeks ago 11 of my wife's family members and 6 dogs came to ride out the storm at our home. Unfortunately 8 of them now have no home to go back to, nor do their 5 dogs.

They range in age from a 75 year old in very poor health to a 5 year old who is autistic. Some of the family members are very considerate of others while a few are high energy manic personalities that make the situation worse.  My wife came from a large family and handles this better than I do.

I am thankful that our home was unscathed and that our jobs allowed us to return to work this week. But I am stressing out so bad my stomach is a wreck and I have head aches everyday. We make enough to pay our bills with little left over but the storm has wiped out our grocery budget. I know my power bill will sour with 13 showers and 3 loads of laundry being done daily.

I’m freakin out man,"Hey Reddit, I just searched for this sub so that I could vent a little. I’m pretty stressed right now about my finances and I’d just like to type mindlessly for a few minutes. I have a very steady and regular income with no fear of losing my job any time soon. I love what I do, and it pays... better than anything I’ve ever done before it. Due to the nature of things, I have to schedule vacations a year out, and being relatively young and naive, I decided it would be a good idea to schedule time off in July for my birthday and to visit my family in Kansas City area, and then again August to see my family in Alaska. Each trip was a week long. Some of you may already see the error of my ways. 

I was semi-prepared for the vacation in July, but it wasn’t until after the trip that I realized the flight for my wife and I to Alaska was going to be about double what I was expecting. Needless to say, I was financially unprepared for the trip but already committed, tickets in hand. The trip itself was a dream, and I loved every minute of it. Near the end of my trip, I realized just how unprepared I was, when I woke up and had $45 in my bank account. I still needed to drive home after my flight(in order to save about $300, I drove 6 hours to the cheapest airport around me. Cost of gas was about $70 round trip, for a total savings of about $225... it was worth it to me). Due to this and the fact I still had some bills to pay, I headed over to /r/Borrow and took out a loan(which I have since paid back). That covered me until I got paid.... until yesterday when I realized I was yet again behind, causing me to take another loan out(less than before so I guess I am technically ahead?). 

I sent out a check for my mortgage and it bounced, I’m a month behind on bills, and I’m practically living at biolife(plasma donation) right now trying to make ends meet. I transferred $35 into my bank account from my biolife cards so my mortgage check would go through. I’m at my wits end and don’t see a solution in sight. I’m stressed beyond belief. 

Please don’t comment on here telling me I’m a shithead for not managing my finances well... I know that and next month after I get paid, I’m doing absolutely nothing extra. Shit I might live on ramen this month if I have to. I need help dealing with this stress and really could use some help. Anything."

I have thoughts of making a complete career change and sometimes all I want to do is walk into traffic so I don’t have to deal with the stress anymore. 

I also became attached to the idea of becoming a scientist and am experiencing a bit of an identity crisis because it hasn’t lived up to my expectations. 

Basically I want to know what I can do and if anybody else has gone through this kind of experience? I want to finish the program and go back home, but I’m scared that I simply can’t do it. Are there any coping strategies? How do you work when you’re feeling burned out? Did you come out better on the other side of this stress? "
Released my first (free) book on how to stop worrying and kill stress,"Hi, I hope you're all having a good day so far! I just wanted to let you know, that I've put together an ebook where I talk about my journey of ending anxiety and stress, and which ""methods"" I personally use...It's free on amazon right now, and I would really appreciate it, if you give it a review after downloading.

Didn't sleep last night. I emailed my manager asking for a Monday meeting to put a stop to me needing to do other staff's work.,"I've reached capacity (and beyond) there's no time in the day to get these things done, and then I'm blamed for when things aren't completed. I keep covering for others' refusal to do their own work and I can't continue to do that. "
Will You Let Me Know If This Helps?,"I had a 'near death' experience with excess stress a while ago and since then I've been building a whole set of tactics to turn things round for myself. I'm pleased to say that I'm now happier and healthier than ever — although I still have to work hard each day to keep my stress levels contained.

I'm going to be sharing the tactics I use in the form of a gentle challenge \(with a bit of a low\-down on the tactic\) each day for a month starting on the 11th June.

I'd be really grateful for any feedback please. The idea behind these articles is that they should be helpful!

Has anyone ever been too tired to sleep?,"I'm not sure if it's stress exactly, but for months I've been so tired (not exactly physically) that sleeping just doesn't feel sufficient. It's kinda like I'm tired and restless at the same time, but not energized enough to get up and do anything. Maybe it's just that every day is the same, and I honestly have nothing to look forward to. I have no friends and a family that I feel no connection to and gives no support. School is killing me and I'm worried that I may not graduate. Many personal problems also wear me down. I'm currently drinking coffee because I hate this weird feeling of being tired yet not really. Throughout the day, I constantly feel the need to sleep, and even when I do, it doesn't help my energy. Maybe I'm just not consistent, but I've slept a lot and no longer feel the need to. Sleeping is now just an annoyance that I use simply to transition into the next day easily. I roll around my bed uncomfortably for long periods of time and the rising temperatures aren't helping. I eventually fall asleep and wake up feeling like garbage no matter when I fell asleep or how long I've slept. I guess I'm just tired of life and the same old BS, but this feeling is so strange that I just wanna see if anyone else has felt this too. I also just wanted to vent a little.... "
When you are stressed out do you tend to snap easier?,Sometimes when I interact with people they seem to get upset at the smallest things. I haven't done anything except ask a question or tried to engage in a friendly conversation and I get a negative response. It feels like I've done something wrong or but I feel like I'm dealing with sour apples who are under a lot of stress.
[Help] Stress/Anxiety is making me sick,"Hey r/Stress,

I am not too sure if this is the correct place to post this, but give me a read and if its not I will find the correct place to go. A little background before I explain, I am a senior Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering student in the US getting ready to finish up the semester and get married, all within the next month.

Here is the problem: I am failing a class right now that would seriously hinder my future success if I do not pass \(my perspective, anyway\) and it is seriously hurting my productivity. I am sick to my stomach \~70&#37; of the time , cannot sleep on a beneficial schedule, and am finding myself with no discipline/motivation for anything. The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health.

I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants."
How to cope with stress in the natural gas industry?,"I'm a gas locator in Utah. It's getting into construction season and I'm completely overwhelmed with my work load. I struggled with suicidal thoughts before this job and now my anxiety is through the roof to where I can't sleep at night and I'm already working 50+ hours a week. I think about ending it at least twice a day, except nobody would be around to take care of my parents so I'm trapped. I'm afraid of making a mistake on a locate and killing somebody. "
Working three jobs and slowly losing my mind,"At the moment, I am working three jobs and slowly but surely it is getting to be too much for me.

I am a Salesforce Administrator at a university by day, then work as an actor in the evenings at a professional theatre, and also work as the Business Manager at a different theatre company. I love each of these jobs in their own ways and consider all of them to be great opportunities for my professional development. The SFDC admin job is a great career opportunity and pays the bills. Acting is my passion and what I really want to be doing in life, but work is sporadic and sometimes doesn't pay well. I am getting my MBA right now too (but on a break because I'm working on a show) so that  is why I am passionate about being a Business Manager. Unfortunately, the Business Manager gig doesn't pay but it is great experience.

On top of the stress I feel because of the amount of work I'm doing, I also have a commute that is at least 30-45 minutes one way in heavy traffic. Furthermore, I hate the company I work for full-time but by working there I get my MBA for free. 

Needless to say there is a lot going on in my life right now and I don't really want to quit any of it. However, I am realizing that this is not sustainable and something has to give. I calculated it the other day and I am working around 80 hours a week at least.

I would greatly appreciate advice on how to release stress and also advice on how to do everything I want to and still maintain my sanity.

TL;DR: I have too many jobs but am passionate about all of them. How do I deal with the large amount of stress and/or figure out how to manage all of this."
Hopefully this helps a few people! I've been very stressed out/anxious over the past 2-3 months and I tried something that worked.,"I read somewhere about eating a few balls of black peppercorn to fight stress and tried it out yesterday for the first time. Within about 20 minutes I started feeling pretty calm, then 2 hours I was like damn I feel pretty good and relaxed this is great, and by the end of the night I felt like I could accomplish anything. I was motivated, working on a ton of things I had to do around the house, playing with dog, and staying busy. Felt the best I had in a long time. I ate a few more today and I'm on top of the world again. I hope it helps at least a few of ya'll! Cheers"
Can stress cause sickness?,"I have a lot of stress on me. Sometimes it feels like more than I can handle. Money is very limited, which has negatively affected my marriage. I'm a teacher, but I'm the only one brining in money while my spouse tries to get a business up and running. Sometimes the stress is so much I get sick to my stomach and I always have headaches. Has this happened to anyone else? I can't afford to go to counseling to help cope with it or help my marriage. It's just so overwhelming sometimes.

Anyone else sick from stress? What did you do when counseling wasn't an option and the thing that will fix it is out of your control?"
"Working on a production line, being the last guy, fucking up, and having to deal with ALL the other worker’s anger","I work at an auto body shop. I’m the polisher/detailer, so my job is to polish the paint, right after it comes out of the booth, and get rid of any imperfections. Paint jobs will always have dirt in them, unless the booth is a total-vacuum, so you have to use a sander to lightly sand the surface (WITHOUT going thru the clear-coat) and cut that dirt out, then buff out the scratches after. 

It’s very difficult. I accidentally fucked up on a truck last week, and burnt through. The painter was upset, cause he had to redo that panel, but I was forgiven. Then today, I fucked up not once, but TWICE, on the same car. I’m very new, and still learning, so it’s understandable, but I still have to deal with the rest of the Shop getting pissed off at me. 

I am so stressed right now, I’m about to throw up. It’s not totally my fault. They are giving me inadequate tools, and the paint job could have been better, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s MY responsibility to make shit happen, regardless of circumstance, and the Shop doesn’t really take the tools/bad paint into consideration. 

So yeah, this car is gonna have to be repainted. And the painter works on commission, so he’s going to lose money because of me. Im crying and shit in my car on my lunch break. Having such a hard time dealing with this. 

And on top of that, I have a lot of severe health issues that are affecting my performance and making concentration difficult. I have chronic daily headaches, and fibro-myalgia, so I’m always in severe pain. And it’s really hard on my body. 

Gah. So not wanting to deal. "
I recently started college,"I just started Uni about two weeks ago and I feel like everything is just overwhelming. I'm struggling to understand some of the curriculum, but i plan to go to after class help for it with a friend. There's just so much work and the year just started. I feel like the pace will pick up and I will be even more behind than I already am. I was wondering if anybody else has been in a similar situation and what could possibly help keep stress down?"
"Is Social Media Ruining Your Life | How it Can Increase Odds of Loneliness, Anorexia and Depression",
I don't have any methods for stress relief.,"All of my old techniques for managing stress either are bad for me, or they don't work anymore. Every time I get anxious, stressed or angry I can't resolve that feeling in any way other than waiting it out, this is really putting a lot of strain on my relationship, work and hobbies. 

I feel as if I'm not in control of my life anymore and it's all just spiralling away, does anybody have any suggestions on new ways to resolve stress, or ways to manage it?

The only healthy management techniques that worked for me was creative outlets, but as I get older, I feel more obliged to use these in a more formal way and I can't put as much emotion into any of the work I do. Everything I had is slipping away and I can't maintain hold of anything I enjoy in life.

Does anybody have any ideas?"
Too much,Ok. I'm in highschool. I'm under so much stress lately. trying to get perfect grades or else my parents will kill me (A's & B's only) my family yells at me for everything and everything I say is wrong and rude and they won't tell me why. And it's all the time. I'm so stressed I keep crying I haven't told anybody and I'm just feeling really isolated and sad lately. I don't know what to do but wait till the school year is over i feel terrible. 
No time for myself,"I've realized at this point that I've never spent any time trying to help myself, only other people, and now the stress and anxiety almost to much. My family puts this pressure on me like I'm supposed to be some sort of genius who's supposed to have all A's and 100s on tests. It's just to fucking much."
I am not doing ok.,"I recently moved into my sister's place. It's my first time moving out of home and every one said you'll love the freedom and such. However, I'm hating it. I'm far away from work with no licence or car - what was a car trip that takes 20 minutes is now a bus and train trip an hour and a half long. Thankfully, my dad is still agreeing to drive me home when I finish late.

My sister is a shift worker - works around the clock at ridiculous times. I asked her (before I moved in) if she could sometimes pick me up from work if I worked late and if she could help me with my driving - she said yes. I've now asked a her a few times if we could drive somewhere she has said: ""no"", ""just because"", and ""I'm sick and tired"". She's lazy and selfish. I've asked her once if she could pick me up from work (as my dad was unavailable) knowing for a fact she's not working and I get a response saying ""I'll pick you up at the bus stop down the road"" - which doesn't help me at all. I'd still have to travel an hour and a half, come back at 11pm to shower, eat dinner, and then get my things ready to leave for work at 7 in the morning (waking up at 6), and I'd be travelling alone at a late hour in the night. My job requires me to be on call and if I get called in at 9am to start at 11am, I would only have 30 minutes to get ready vs the hour I would have at dad's.

I can't deal with it anymore. I'm sad, frustrated, always tearing up. Haven't eaten a proper meal in over a week. I have constant headaches. I'm back at dad's house during the day just so I don't ""interrupt"" her sleeping as there nothing for me to do here except watch tv and browse the internet. Her personality is not the nicest either. She screws her face up every time I talk to her as if I'm annoying her, talks down to me as if I'm a child. I can't stand up to her because I'm afraid of her. Puts me down whenever I feel the slightest of emotions (any, angry, sad, happy). I've given her so much money over the years and not asked for a cent back (and she has s full time job), the least she could do is help me out once in a while. 

I thought moving in here would be a good idea, but it's only made my situation worse. I'm further away from work, my sister only wants me here for rent money, the commute is very taxing and tiring, I'm not comfortable living with a lazy and selfish person.

Moving back home would be beneficial work-wise as it's closer to dad's house, but then I would be letting myself and everyone around me down. I was told that my sister didn't think I could move in, that I wouldn't go through with it, even though she WANTED me here. 

I just don't know what to do. Going back home would be a step backwards in terms of independence, but then again, I'm still not fully independent, but moving back home would so much better for getting to work and back.

TL;DR I am not coping with my living situation. I'm too far away from work and my sister is lazy and selfish."
Feel like I'm at breaking point sometimes,"My whole life is a mess.

I am abused by my narcissist parents (who I am also full-time carer for, which makes it all worse). No, I can't leave or get other carers in please just accept that you don't know the whole situation, thank you.

My sister (married, 2 kids) never even offers to go grocery shopping (she drives, I don't) for them and when I say to my parents they should ask for her help, they don't want to 'bother' her. Yet they fawn over how amazing and hard working she is. I get called lazy cos I 'quit my job to scrounge government money, using their disability as an excuse'.

They don't refer to me as their daughter, they call me their carer. They treat me like a maid, like staff.

Yet when my sister does help, it's with things my parents have refused to let me do. So then they come round on Sunday, do the thing, and I feel like it makes me look so lazy. Then when I make a point 'you said no when I offered to do that', I feel petty.

Some bg on my sister:

- Never got beaten by mom, I did
- Never left me alone with her kids
- I got to change one diaper when they were babies
- Refused to teach me how to drive
- Never calls me or invites me to her house
- Gives me the general impression she doesn't want me around

My mental health has never been great but lately... I am just crumbling into a state of nonexistence.

- I have no desire to shower, brush my hair, even change my clothes.

- Because of my mental health, I forget all birthdays and events and never have the money to give them unless I go without food to do so. They say it's fine but I get that *look*. You know the look. That 'oh, here's the family fuck up again' kind of look.

- I drink daily (not loads, just every evening I drink low alcohol wine), this brings on the binge eating which makes me feel sick, sometimes I am sick

- Due to care work I can't take days off, or breaks. Due to lack of support this is even less possible. 

I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just don't know what to do. I hate my life. I hate myself, and who I have become. This isn't me. I used to be so happy, life of the party, I used to dress up and feel pretty.

I look so fat, stressed and tired I loathe catching my reflection these days. I just hate myself. Been to doctor's TWICE (different ones) they don't give a shit. One laughed at me the other said I don't ahve time for your life story, and just shoved tablets under my nose, offering me free counselling which doesn't work. I need a therapist, not someone to nod at me and ask how I feel about that."

Mini-burnouts,"Hi,

I'm dealing with a hard-to-grasp psychological problem. The pattern is somewhat like this: I'm always highly stimulated. Sometimes I'm tempted to work too hard, and end up in some sort of mini-burnout. This happens about once a week, and leaves me foggy and unmotivated (dopamine-depleted?) for about 2 days.

I have a lot of atypical adaptations built in that are related to this. When I'm overly excited, it inhibits me (probably the same way that anxious people are inhibited), but I don't feel any anxiety. I'm often hardly aware of how stimulated I am. Sometimes, I am somehow compelled to go into super sayan mode, work my ass off, try to complete my whole to-do list in one day.This pretty much instantly triggers a mini-burnout. This also happens when I drink just one cup of coffee. Except when I'm socially active: then I can take all the stimulants I want and be fine. Weird.

This state has gone on for about 2 years, and I still haven't been able to make sense of it. Maybe there's a blindspot somewhere.

Anyway, other than perhaps someone being able to label this thing for me, I have a question about a specific solution I have in mind. My defense mechanism for high stress is usually to tone it down, through reframing my situation as easy, meditating, ignoring my to-do list, etc. Now I have a suspicion that this mini-burnout is emotional or motivational in nature. That I'm not actually chemically depleted, but that there's a ton of emotional baggage that needs to be cleared each time that I go down. Or alternatively: that I'm just fed up with how little progress I'm making given the effort I put in. If this is true, it requires a whole different approach. It would involve not changing the arousal but the valence of my emotions. Reframing my high stress as excitement, instead of anxiety.

Maybe that will make the stress less chronic.

But I'm afraid that this will just put me further in the wrong place, because it will involve kicking down habits that reduce arousal, thereby increasing it.
And that would be extremely high-cost, for I've been in a very very bad place as a result of burnout.

Could anyone shine their light on this? Any progress on this problem would be major for me. Thank you."
"I need help, I don't know what to do","This is a throwaway account. I'm utterly embarrassed with myself. I'm young and have so much I feel like I can accomplish. I'm sitting here at work, writing this, and currently having on of the worst days of my life. I feel alone. I feel unable to connect. I am isolated. I feel like nobody understands. I don't blame anyone for not understand. Maybe I'm wrong. I just want to feel better, to feel connected. I want to care about something other than myself. 

I don't even know where to begin. I am in a position where I believe there is so much negativity in my life, it effects my internal optimism. the real me is so much different than me. I don't know how to explain that. I don't know if others feel that way too. Theres the 'you' who tries to be compassionate, and caring. But then deep down, there's a different you. 

I have such a hard time expressing myself because I feel like nobody cares how others feel. You know why I feel like this. I don't care how others feel, well I Kinda do. Let me put it like this.

Let's say there is a guy I know called bob. He tells me about his problems, and how hard is life is. I tell him that really sucks, and I understand what I'm going through. And suddenly he feels better, now that he's had someone to vent to. But the reason I'm trying to comfort him is not because I care about his issues, I don't understand the pain he is going through. The reason I comfort him is because I understand that connecting to someone in that way can be relieving. It makes you feel like your not the only one going through that. But what if that's just what everyone does. That's how i feel about venting. Even though I'm sitting here typing to you, you probably don't care. And even though you may write something that is supposed to be comforting, it's not. I don't believe you, I can't honestly believe that, the person you're talking to, that you actually care for that person. I don't know if that's true or not, but my deep down me say's it is true.

I've contemplated several reasonings to why I feel so.... I don't know how to describe it. I don't trust anyone but myself. I cannot express enough how hard it is for me to put these feelings into words.

When I was growing up, I had terrible parents. No they didn't hit me, or physically abuse me. They didn't play with my mind or do some of the terrible things you hear about. So why do I say there were terrible parents. They weren't there. They were, but they weren't. All I ever remember is my mother coming home after we went to bed. I remember my dad sitting in his room watching T.V. We never went out. We never vacationed. I don't feel like I know those people. I feel isolated.

Once I reached high school things changed a bit. My parent's split to no surprise from anyone. My dad and I lived together and got somewhat closer. I wanted to live with my mom, but my sister did too. And I didn't want my dad to have to live alone. My dad was going through a deep depression at the time. We would both stay home at night. We didn't do anything. I got the new COD black ops. I start skipping school. Nothing feels good, nothing feels right. I just want to play video games, it's the only thing that takes me away. it's the only thing I look forward too. I start skipping more. I never make it to class after lunch anymore. Principal calls my dad to setup a meeting. I've missed over 80 days of school. I'm not going to be a freshman next year. I used to be a straight A student in middle school. I still think I could be. I go through half of sophomore year with the same exact issues. Still skipping school. I know it's not the right thing to do, but I hurt. I don't care, I want to escape.

We move across the country for a new start. My dad and I move in with his mother. My grandpa recently passed, so she was quite lonely. Also, my dad is a mama's boy for sure, so this helped him out too. I went to a new school, had a new start. I meet somebody the first of day. she came up to me and started talking. this is the first time anyone has ever reached out to me like that. I feel different. I feel confident. Maybe people do like me. Turns out we go to the same church, we're in the same ward, the same classes. She is amazing. I meet another guy, he's so cool. He's extremely outgoing and we also go the same church, the same school, have some of the same classes. Both of them start dating. I am absolutely crushed. I feel alone, I thought i found some people I could connect with, but then puppy love takes over and once again I'm ignored. I meet her best friend. She's kind of cute, and she really likes me. Ok what the hell let's give it a shot.

We start dating, i think i like her. Let's makeout, and hangout. We should have sex, sex is so cool. Oh you don't want to? that's okay we can just start slow. Everytime she comes over it's the same thing, puppy love. She starts to take notice that the relationship is very one-sided. I'm oblivious. I want sex, I want attention, I want to feel normal. But I can't take this stress she is causing me. We're over, I'm done with you. I don't feel bad about it.

Then my two new friend that were together break up. I don't want to step on my friends toes so I don't make any moves. But she's amazing, I actually care for her. We start hanging out everday when they breakup. I want to be with her. I feel like at times she feels the same, but at other times there's nothing. She starts smoking cigarettes and this destroys me. She is relieving stress and I don't care, i just want to be there with her. Things escalate, we get very close, i feel like i can tell her anything. Things heat up sexually, we constantly tease each other. Then she got a job and everything changed. She met a guy. We weren't official or anything but i thought we were close. I just don't know how to express how I feel to her, and i feel like i'm a backup to her. Maybe i was, maybe i wasn't. She start's dating this new guy. He's a bad influence, he smokes and drinks, and he's been to jail. But the thing is care for her, and I don't want to stand in the way of them being together. So we revert back to friends. There's no issue between us three, they let me hang out with them whenever. The guy likes me, we smoke together.

One night they were at a park drinking. They wanted to go home, and he got in his truck. He hit someone, they were instantly killed. He's running from police, She gets out of the car. He crashes into a park. I can't believe it. She's pregnant. I can't deal with this.


A girl I work with tells me about a stoner friend she has. She thinks we would like each other. The three of us decided to hang out that night. Everything goes real smoothly, I genuinely enjoy this girls company. The three of us go to my house and watch some movies, I get her friends number. I invite her to hangout that night again. She sneaks out and comes over to my house at late at night. We're hanging out and she makes a move. Things escalate and next thing I know my virginity is gone. It is clear she had already lost hers. Our relationship quickly turns sexual, she want's to fuck all the time. I'm not looking for sexual relationship deep down, but the cool me (that I want everyone to know and like) does want to fuck. It's cool, it's what happy people do. This is a normal relationship. We get walked in on doing oral by her moms boyfriend. He hates me, I'm a bad influence on her.

We keep seeing each other, I start to really like the nonsexual part of our relationship. Her parent's aren't home and I go to see her. She has to meet up with them in a few hours, and they won't be coming home until after that meetup. Uh oh, someone just came home, quick hide next to my bed. I have to leave right now, don't worry whoever just came home is probably leaving soon too, just leave after they leave. So there I lay, waiting for them to leave. Suddenly the door opens, it's the boyfriend. He checks the room and finds me. He doesn't let me leave, he say's I'm trespassing. I tell him I was invited in and told to hide there. He doesn't believe me, he doesn't let me pass. I try to push my way through and he threatens to call the cops. This is bullshit. I push through him and run downstairs to leave. Fuck her, I can't believe she put me through that. She should've taken the heat. I start developing anxiety from that experience. I've never had anxiety. I didn't know anxiety existed until that point. I never want to hear from her again, but i really liked her.

I need to get out of here. Fuck this place, fuck this town. I'm tired of it. I want to move back to where I came from, at least I know area. And hey, weed is legal there so at least I got something that will help me. So I tell everyone that I'm leaving, nobody tries to stop me. I have $300 in savings and plane ticket. I have no where to stay. I just know I want to leave.

I'm saving goodbye to some friends and my brother comes down. We're half brothers, and his dad was black so he drives down to hang out with me. I didn't know this at the time, but he's running from the cops. He was a warrant out in our home state. He waits outside my house at the park next door till I wakeup to tell me that he's here. Someone calls the cop to complain someone is trying to take a bath in the community pool. He was sitting a couple 100 feet away from the pool doing nothing. The cops show up and he tells the officer that he is waiting for me. I learn that someone called the cops on him for sitting in the park. Those fucking racist neighbors, just because he's black doesn't mean he's homeless. I talk to the cop but deny him being my brother at first, because I didn't want to identify myself, I was scared. The cop harasses both us, one of us is lying, but we committed no real crime so he let's us go. 

I say hey let's go smoke some weed with my friend. So I drive his car over to my friends house and we light up. Then we decided to go to my other friends house. So we leave my friends neighborhood. We're being followed, but i didn't realize this at the time. We get to a three way intersection, I take a right and pull into the second lane because I have to take an immediate left after. I pull over to next to the side walk and park. I start unbuckling and next thing I know there is a cop next to my window. He yells at me to roll down the window. The window doesn't work. I try to yell this through the door, he tells me to open the door. I comply, I am literally shaking. We have dabs in the car and a little bit of bud. I'm scared. He says he smells marijauna as soon as I open the door. Bullshit, he's lying. The bud is in a mason jar, and the dabs have no smell unless your nose is right up to it. He takes everyone out of his vehicle and starts by harassing me. I know you have weed in there, so just let me know where it is and this will all be over. We don't mind calling the K-9 unites to search your car, and we probably won't stop them if they try to bite you in the ass. I tell them where everything is, I was scared. They start harassing my brother. ""We don't want your kind in this city. Leave and do not come back"". He is black, is that the kind your talking about? are you fucking kidding me right now? do you fucking hear yourself?

We're taken into custody and driven to the police station, they take our pictures tell us how wrong we were. No we weren't doing anything wrong, you guys profiled us and followed us out of one of the poorest neighborhoods in a very wealthy city. You harassed us and assumed we had weed on us, despite any evidence other than coming out of a poor neighborhood. Doesn't matter, I have a plane ticket and I'm already leaving.

I arrive in this new city and hit up a craiglist contact I reached out to earlier. We're in similar positions, he's a year older just moved to Chicago. He's very forward about the fact that he is homosexual.we'll call him bradley. Okay no problem. I figure he realizes I'm not interested. He offers me a place to stay with im for $300. Perfect, that's all I have. 

I get a job at a local pizza place, it's perfect cause I can make tips to help me until next paycheck.

Now I have no money. Turns out it's not his house, but we're sharing his room in a house which other people from chicago. the other people are great, but they hate bradley. bradley is a douche. bradley suggest I might be a closet homosexual. He will have sex with me if I want, but he let's me know he would be the top. He tells other people that I'm actually a 32 year old pretending to be 19. He tells other people I'm hiding my homosexuality. He constantly describes homo sex to me. I don't want to hear about it. I tell him I don't care who he likes, what gender he is, I don't want to hear about his sex life. He continues to harass me sexually. I ask the other roommates if I can take the extra room upstairs, I'll pay for a fair share of the rent. They all hate bradley and they agree. It's a shitty house, and I want to move out. I want to move closer to work. I isolate myself further, all these new people, this is a new life. I'm on my own now. Nobody is going to help me.

I find a roommate and we get a small apt to share. I quit the pizza place after some bullshit that I'm over with. Bad management that blames the staff for everything. Just one example there was a busy Wednesday night where I was the only server. The ice cream machine breaks and I'm usually the one to fix it. I don't have time as I am serving everyone. I'm supposed to clean it every night. We usually have two servers on a busy night like this. I finally finish serving and cleaning up and at that point it's midnight. I have to back at 1pm the next day for lunch rush. I'm exhausted from covering another server's shift. I put a note on the ice cream machine not to turn it on, as it is broken. Skip forward to 8 am when the owner blows up my phone because the ice cream machine wasn't cleaned properly last night, and once he turned it on ice cream starting spilling everywhere. ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? CAN YOU FUCKING READ???? I come in to see the damage and I see the note still on the ice cream machine. He say's he saw the note, but doesn't tell me anything more than that. He didn't tell me why he decided to turn it on regardless of the note. He yells at me for not staying later than I did even though I already worked an hour and a half past my get off time, while working two fucking shifts. Long story short, his wife told me she didn't have time to fix my paycheck with 10 overtime hours fucking missing off my paycheck. fuck you bitch, you don't deserve me as an employee and I walk out.

I then find the job opportunity of my life, a web design firm is hiring. Okay awesome, let me just apply and show them all my awesome skills. I walk in to the interview, everything is brand new, everyone is dressed super nice, everyone is super young. I start and 3 days after being hired, my supervisor is fired for nodding out. I should've seen this sign and left right then and there. The owner starts talking to me more and more. He gives me special jobs, and has talks with me all the time. It's clear he is doing some sort of drugs. Over the next few months, and many raises later things start going really downhill. This guy starts playing mind games with everyone. Someone is stealing is leads. Someone is always out to get him. He want's to know who is stabbing him in the back. He set's up elaborate traps to catch people in the act. He ends up accusing me of stealing leads. That's impossible, I would never do that. He set's it up so that I end up blaming another one of his top guys. But if you look at all the evidence HE PLANTED, he made it look like it was that guy who was stealing the leads. So then he accuses me because of the accusations I made about his TOP guy. This is some bullshit. He calls me that night because he want's me to admit to it. I go off him, I've never felt so betrayed in my life, I told him how bullshit it is that he is accusing me of lying to him. He just lyed to me about all the evidence that made me accuse the other guy. He say's it's gonna be ok, and he forgives me. He just want's me to tell him that it was me and it will all be over. NO FUCK YOU, it wasn't me. go fuck yourself.

He contacts me the next day when I don't show up for work. He says come hangout with me, I just want to talk. We go to the bank with another guy and spend a couple hours there opening up a new business account. Everything is going fine, I'm explaining to him how betrayed i felt. He apologizes and says it won't happen again. Then he decides he will take me home. He pulls over the side of the road on the way home, and crushes what appears to be 2 30mg percs, and 2 lines of cocoa. Snorts that shit right up. on the side of the fucking road. I feel unsafe, I want to leave this company, never see this guy again.


And I do leave, fuck this industry. I want to make my own company. And what do you know, I isolate myself deeper. I can't trust anybody, they will just end up fucking you.

I get 3 other friends together as business partners. The only way I can describe the next 6 months, is us 'pretending' to be a company. It's like when you were five and playing company with your little five year old friends. We had meetings, and sale pitches, and presentations to potential clients, but we never actually did any 'real' nitty gritty work. We played company for six months, took in over $40k and spent all of it. Every customer charged back on us for not doing anything, and that company went bankrupt very quickly.


At this point I had wasted a significant portion of savings trying to survive. So now I was slightly in debt, with no job. Only thing to do is to start my own company. MY OWN. I'm the boss. I take everything i learned from my previous experiences. I rely on already established relationships for work. I get enough freelance work to support myself and the company. I'm working over 50 hours a week just to keep my company afloat. It's worth it to me. I don't want anyone taking advantage of me. I'm done with the bullshit. I'm done with people fucking me. I'm done.


So how does this all affect me now? Why do I feel more lost than I ever have been?

You know how someone is knowledgeable in a subject. It's when they realize that no matter how much they study, and learn. They'll never learn everything about the subject. That realization in a person shows wisdom in that subject.

Maybe that's how I feel about life at this point. I'll never truly get the point I want to be at, and the reason I know that is from all the past experiences I've had.

I'm scared. I'm anxious. I'm stressed. I'm alone.

I don't know how to connect with anyone. I don't trust anyone. I'm alone. I'm isolated. I'm scared and I don't know what to do. Nobody in my life at the moment is my age. There is nobody I can come home to. No friends or girlfriends. Nothing. I'm Alone. I work more hours than I want to. I'm dying.

I didn't take care of my teeth as an adolescent. My teeth are practically falling out. I have three molars that have practically decayed, but i don't have enough money to do anything about it. I'm still recovering from the debt I have accrued. My car literally broke down two days ago after just fixing it. I literally haven't even paid off my last car bill.cost me $700, which put me into debt again. Now I need to pay around another $1000 just get it drive-able again. There is nobody to tell this too. Nobody is willing to help me. I'm going to lose my clients not being able to transport myself to their places of business. I'm fucked. I got fucked. I'm absolutely alone.

If you have read this far, I want you to know I'm not asking for money here. Please don't offer. I'm not here for monetary gain. I don't know what I'm here for. I'm sitting at my home office right now and my teeth hurt so fucking bad right now. I wish I could just hug someone right now. anybody. I wish I could feel some level of comfort when all I want to do is to lay down and cry. And as I write what I determine to be the last few thoughts of my ventilation, tears are slowly rolling down my eyes. I don't think I can press submit, but it feels good to have these feelings come out of me.

I don't feel like there is anybody I could tell all of this too, which is why I'm writing this right now. I don't want anybody to try and help, I don't know if I can press submit now. It makes me feel like a burden. I don't want to be a burden. I'm just going to do it. Maybe somebody out there can shed some light for me.

The Most Important Things You Need To Know About Stress,
23 Simple Things You Can Do to Wipe Out Stress,
Hi,"Hello, I have recently (2 years ago) had a panic attack during a certain recreational activity and i have never been able to recover from it.

I am 22 years old studying/living abroad and i am very new to stress, im not even sure it is stress.

 If i could describe my symptoms then someone would confirm for me... that would be great.

It usually starts with thoughts contemplating life and then spirals out of control, even typing it on to this subreddit makes me shudder. Thoughts of imminent doom and uncertainty. I would then go into panic attack mode and wait for the nightmare to be over.

Is this stress or psychosis? i sometimes feel im going made. recently i started having night terrors, extremely vivd ones which i can still remember several months after, I've had 3 bad ones so far and sometimes im afraid to go to sleep because of them.

I don't wan't to take any medication, i know my family has a history of depression and ive heard about the zombi-fying effect some drugs have. 

My usual stress reliever has been going to the gym but recently ive been having panic attacks there too. 

Typing this post has eased my mind somewhat and any comments would probably do the same

10 Things I Wish I Knew,"Hi everyone,

I'm part of an organization called **Wish I Knew,** which is focused on helping to reduce the levels of anxiety, depression and drop-out rates that plague first year students.

First year of university is always full of questions and anxiety for students. This article (link below) lists some of the things that I, too, wish that I had known in my first year!

We will be posting more similar content weekly on our Facebook Pages to help give you more realistic advice on university life and how to deal with all the overwhelming stress and emotions. We will share articles, videos, and our own original content as well! If you are attending a university in Fall 2019 and are interested in content like this, please follow our pages on Facebook by searching ""Accepted - ""university name"", Class of 2023"".

there’s too much on my plate,i have so much school work to make up from missing school for two weeks due to sickness and my grades fell off because of it and im also falling off physically... idk how long i can take the stress man it’s so much worse than i can convey through text... please tell me it’ll get better
Can't afford university,"University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed). I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby).

This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. 

The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). 

I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account.

Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system.

I know things could be worse but I am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined. I would assume there are other ways to confirm how long I've held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date.

Thanks to anyone reading this far."

Headaches and bodily pain from constant stress,"I’m a full time student and have been working part time jobs since I began last fall. I’m 26, no family or safety nets. I have another freelance job but it’s inconsistent and  money is incredibly tight.

Boss at my day job has been using me as a scapegoat and asking me to do a number of tasks outside my job description. I’m a cook, I wash dishes, I run food, and sometimes have to help the cashiers. Food quality is obviously suffering for this and I am scolded in front of my coworkers throughout the day. She will stand next to me and tell me how to stir a pot, told me I need to ask permission before putting anything in the oven— and I am a trained cook. Then she asks when I’m going to smile for her. I am looking for other jobs, but am not financially secure enough to quit before I do.

I try to see my boyfriend on the weekends, but work usually interrupts our time together. This week I was scolded so badly that I have felt ill since I got home— and this was days ago. Headache, anxiety, dread, and exhaustion. I was told I am on the road to being fired, and I have only worked here a month. I’ve been a cook before and have never been in a place with this kind of culture.

I’m just wondering how I can survive the stress while I look for another job. My life should be quite good right now, and this job should be very simple! Money and my boss are what drives my stress."
"One week ago when I was walking with my dog, a helicopter exploded over our heads. I feel like I'm drowning because I don't want to be a burden and can't speak about this.","[Here is the video of the crash](https://www.cnnturk.com/video/turkiye/iste-helikopterin-dusme-ani)

Here is the story, I was walking with my dog and she got frightened by a helicopter passing by. I told her it was alright and we were about to go home. Two minutes later, she started to run towards our building and I couldn't understand the reason since I was listening to music, and I stopped her, looked behind and I saw the same helicopter over another building. There was some sort of gas coming out from it and it exploded while leaning to it's right side. 

I froze for two seconds until I saw some part of the tail coming through towards my face.

Thankfully I escaped with only an ankle twist (I ran half a block in three steps), but the helicopter crasher next to the childrens play ground. I made a guy call the ambulance and tried to tell people not to go near the crash. They didn't listen to me since I am a girl and I live in a third world country. 

We got back home eventually and I called the ambulance just to make sure they were on the way but I just couldn't speak conscious enough and apologised for takimg their time.

I learned that all of the soldiers died there. I can't sleep for a week now. I get a really small amount of sleep and it's full of nightmares and weird dreams. My boyfriend tells me I am calmer these days and I can't tell him that all I feel is pain and stress I can't be a burden to him. Everybody is acting normal but I just can't do that. My dog sees nightmares too, I feel like nobody is giving a shit about me.

I got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment?,"Last week I received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment. It was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard, each student is signed in with their student number. That at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it  because I came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when I did not plagiarise. The email required me to have an interview with three people, tutor, unit coordinator and an observer (but I am not obliged to go, but I did anyways). The email notified me to bring the person I plagiarised off from.. but the thing is I actually don't know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone?  I did call them up and said I did have a friend to GUIDE me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all, basically does a different course completely, same uni but different campus. So fast forward to the date of the interview I was pretty confident of clearing my innocent, I brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name?  I blurted out who's that by accident. So during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons, only one question consisting ABC were exactly the same!!! HOW UNCANNY?? The thing is, that was only like 10% of the assignment. I do understand their point of view, out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers. So some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how I got the working out for these questions, my dumbass really did guess it but I was able to explain how I got it, the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong AND plagiarised it. But my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PLAGIARISE? I did say I got them off the lecture notes but I really have no idea how I have the same answers as the other person. 

 Anyways, during the interview, they were trying to throw my friend and I under the bus to admit to at least cheating, which we did not. All assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only. They were trying to imply I was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions. They were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions, thank god he kept saying I only GUIDED her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him (which he actually did only guided me because I am trash at maths). (They said if you did get a tutor for this assignment, that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work). But seriously what the hell, I actually don't know anyone in this subject because it is all online (lol I barely attended the online lectures, it is summer break after all). After the interview they're just telling me to think about who I plagiarised off from, so this is just implying I'm already screwed because I have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter. There are two guidelines I have to follow which is regardless brutal, if I did plagiarise (record, fines, etc)  and if I did not. If I did not I'm still not off the hook. Basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason, I can't prove my innocence. When I walked outside the room,  I think the person who I apparently plagiarised was there, I have never seen them before in my life. I'm just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like, what if the person said I did but I didn't? They school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear??? I can't prove my innocence, how can they prove my plagiarism? The unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he can't clear it, the dean has to?????? I just have to  wait for a dreading email what to do and more interview(s). I have two final exams left for summer and I just can't clear my head for this unnecessary problem (one of the the exams is this subject). I NEED TO STUDY."
[rant] Working more than 140 hours per cut off (15 days)," Goddam.

Some of you might think I'm some entitled millenial.

Some of you might even say I'm lucky I'm working somewhere that pays Overtime.

And partly, all of those are the reason why I'm still working here. The pay is great. I'm getting minimum of 30,000 PHP ($500) per month, OT included. $500 is a lot in my country.

But a little background;

I'm a Millenial. Less than one year in, I'm already stressed out.

I'm working on a well-known company in the Philippines

And they have added a new department, and we'll call this department Project Z.

My job is in finance, and as some of you might know, finance is one of those jobs that are never-ending. There is and always be a transaction.

When I started my job, I had a partner in doing everything.

Let's call this person Bitch.

Less than 2 months in, Bitch was upgraded; one of us left the job because this smart person didn't want to be a part of a job that has this kind of nature.

When Bitch was alone in the department doing this stuff, there were no transactions that were islands away.

By the time I was alone, it was ok. I could finish it in one day. Delays might happen but it only last 2 days.

3 months of me working there, they added one of the said transaction that are overseas. I was overwhelmed.

4 months, all the supposedly overseas transactions to be added are in our dept.

E-mails here and there; suddenly, the overtime that should've been optional became mandatory.

\[I'm not only doing E-mails. I communicate and is occupied with people in the first 6 hours of every morning.\]

I told one of the supervisor that I cannot do it alone. Supervisor said to just ""hold on"".

By the time December came, there was a reliever; for those who are literate on finance dept., December is the worst. Everything must be on the system or whateverthefuck they do.

So I was with someone by that time, but another one of us left the job. The said reliever was upgraded.

February and I'm alone doing 2 person's job.

80 non-OT hours, and per cut off, there are times I could reach 100+ hours of OT.

Reached 120 hours as well.

And as much as I say I can't do it alone, they are not adding manning.

I'm literally killing myself over this job.

I'm not working on weekends anymore so that they could be somehow alarmed.

Had a meeting, said that I must meet these impossible deadlines.

Deadline = to be finished daily, but the transaction of everyday: 100% sure that even if I have someone working with me, it's still not possible.

The said Bitch is always bitching about how I can't finish it in a span of a day. I just want to choke her to death.

I'm stressed. Daily.

My head is literally in heat at least once a day.

I hate my fucking job.

Everyone does, but seriously, I just think this is too much.

I need help.

I want to quit but I have no next job security.

I want to quit but I pity this project that it'll definitely fall apart without me (not that I'm great, but I'm necessary;)

I want to quit but the job pays well.

I want to quit bc of the toxic environment.

Alone,"I dont know why but sometimes (like today) I feel like I dont want to have contact with other people.  I just feel bad when I say bad things to other people. And i feel like the more I am with people  the more bad things i might say to them. And the more guitly i will feel. I just want to be alone sometimes, for long periods. Sometimes i wish i was just a bird or anything simple. I just dont want to be human sometimes, because there are so many things that come just by being a human. I dont think you might understand me at all. But i just wanted to share my situation. Since i dont lime to share my feelings with the people i know.

Hobby Stress,"New to reddit soneone on r/tooafraidtoask reccomended this subreddit. 
SoI overthink a lot as it is but have kind've overcame it when it comes to anything actually important. I'm stuck now with stressing myself out over ny hobbies. For example I'm learning an instrument I like playing it its fun but I'll either set an unrealistic goal like learning something super complicated or convincing myself my playing is pointless unless I end up writing music and putting it out. Another would be reading. I feel like I waist my time if I'm not being productive in some way and that if I'm just chilling it's a waste of time so I end up turning hobbies like reading or excercise into work. It poisens relaxation time. Does anyone else have this, how did they deal with it?"
Whyyyyy,"I feel like financial stress will never end. I would just like to feel comfortable again. I'm not even asking to be rich.

So exhausting. Yeah I'm just venting. 😞"

Overcoming housefire trauma,"There was a neighborhood housefire a few months ago in my area and our house was a few feet away from getting burned down. Ever since, I get hyper alert whenever someone shouts or raises his/her voice because I get reminded of that day. I also palpitate whenever I hear an ambulance or a firetruck.


My main problem is, even if months have already passed, I’m still greatly stressed out by it. I always have thoughts that maybe a fire will happen again, especially at night, which will be worse. To add, after that neighborhood fire, there were two more minor fire incidents that happened nearby.


Last night, I went to bed early. There was no trigger but all of a sudden, my thoughts were racing, “There might be a fire!!” kept on repeating in my head. A neighbor started coughing (the house is close to each other), and I began to palpitate and get scared as if I’m waiting for something, I really don’t know.


How do I get over this? Or where do I start on addressing it? I hate feeling like this, even more so that I feel I’m the only one who got affected this much. I really hope someone will reply here, I really need the help. Thank you!"

"Is this anxiety, depression, am I bipolar or is it all three? Could it just be stress?","(22F) Sometimes like today I get in this mood to where I don’t want to do anything. Like everything is getting to me at once so I’ll just lay in bed and cry about what I feel is nothing.. I feel like I’m just stressed but when it comes to planned events I end up canceling them just because I fear the interaction I’ll have to have during the event. The reason I say I believe it’s stress is because there’s too much and too little going on with me right now that I think it’s affecting not only my mental health but also my physical health. By that I mean my period hasn’t came but I keep getting negative pt’s and my last period was like 3 months ago so there’s that stressing me out but also I’m thinking it’s pcos because I have most of the symptoms just haven’t seen my doc to be diagnosed. It sucks because my husband and I have had baby fever for like a year now.  Also the house my husband and I are currently staying in is bound to burn down any second bc it’s a very very old metal trailer. I sold my vehicle so we could move or just to get this trailer out and put a new one here but nothings seems to be going our way right now and we’ve been struggling with this trailer for the past 3 years. We can’t rent anywhere bc we have a 45 lb pit bull in our family and he not the nicest pup and we don’t have any previous rent experience. I quit my job in September and I’ve only ever known housekeeping so I don’t have any other experience but I also don’t want to go back into housekeeping.

I just want to know if I’m just stressed and how I can relieve it.. I also think I’m bipolar bc sometimes I just change moods so quickly but I’m a quiet person so people don’t understand I don’t want to keep on rambling but I feel like I’m starting to not make any sense... this is why I don’t reach out for help bc I don’t know how to explain how I feel and why... there’s so much more to know about my current situation.

Help with Skin Problems from Stress/Anxiety,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this community so apologies if this has been discussed before.

For the past year or so, I've had what is either eczema or psoriasis on my scalp, finger, eyelid, and lip. I'm vegan and gluten free, and eat quite well usually. I went to a naturopath today and she said that my high levels of stress are causing me to be unable to properly digest food, resulting in leaky gut and my skin problems. I also have pretty bad anxiety, especially after being sexually assaulted a few years ago.

At work, I overthink and set high standards for myself. I also feel pressure from my family, who expect me to be more successful than they are (even though they are quite well off).

I'm seeing a counsellor soon to address the sexual assault trauma, but is there anything else I can do to relieve stress or cope better? I want to be able to not get so anxious at work and become less self-critical. Has anyone had any success and are able to share their techniques?"

\- What do you like and dislike about those apps?

\- Are they paid of free?"

Signs Your Teen Is Stressed Out Of Their Freaking Mind,"It’s the 21st century and the planet earth is a crazy place to live in especially for a teenager.

Why should teens have any reason to be stressed?

Adolescence is a very stressful time for a lot of kids. A study by the John Hopkins University School of Medicine, helps to better understand why mental illness is predominant among young adults.

They worked with young mice who exhibited the genes of mental illness. When they exposed the young mice to stress, they were able to trigger the signs and symptoms associated with mental illness.

Akira Sawa, MD, Phd, a psychiatry professor at John Hopkins Medical Center says, “Having the genes for mental illness puts the mice at risk, but it is not enough to cause mental illness. When you add stress to the equation, at an age when the mouse brain is most similar to the human adolescent brain, the mental illness is triggered.”

This mental illness that is shown in the mice is now seen predominantly in the teens of this century.

In this article you see some of the signs to help you know when your child is stressed out.

I can feel that I need to eat, but I am not hungry, and most food disgusts me so much right now I can't bring myself to force it down.

Work stress,"I have worked part time retail for 20 years. The past year has been more stressful than usual.  My area of work is actually 2 departments. There was 18  of us 6 weeks ago and now there is 12 due to some transferring departments and others quit.
  2 coworkers only have to work 1 deoartment the rest of us work both  , 1  or 2  days a week I work both departments by myself for 4 or 5 hours of my shift. I have had only 3 weekends off this year while 1 coworker has every weekend off.

Job leads to occasional near-debilitating stress,"Hi all. So this is my first time posting here. I am a Project Manager in the petrochemical industry and needless to say there is a lot of accountability. In addition, I have in the last 2.5 years probably had 4 weeks without overtime, 1 of these when I took a week's break to go to the coast and the other when I got sick on my return. Working so much overtime combined with a fast paced, high demand work setup often leads to times of near-events, such as near-anxiety attacks or near-debilitating stress events.

Today I had the latter and I'm concerned that I may reach my breaking point soon and ""snap"". This will obviously not be good for me if I do, so I was wondering if there are people out there that have similar experiences, and what you do to cope?

Lastly, I think it adds to an existing begrudgement that my work relocated my family and I to a small ""oil refinery"" town just as our firstborn was about to arrive. This also took us away from our support structure right when we needed them most. Now we are planning our second but my stress is also detrimentally impacting my personal and family life in this and other areas. Although the remuneration may be lucrative, I feel that regardless of this I am not in a good place at this point, and need to instil a series of coping mechanisms to get through the multiple layers of stress. I am also the sole breadwinner as my wife is a stay at home Mom with the family planning phase of our lives. This probably adds some sub- or unconsciouss stresses.

My wife doesn't handle stress well and won't seek help.,"Hey guys,

Been married for about a little over a year. I had an inkling before we got married that the wife was an anxious person but it was only after we got married I realised it was much more.

She has weekly breakdowns over minor occurrences at work and comes home cursing and screaming about what goes on. (Not at me, but that repeated venting does have its toll on me as well mentally.

The most recent example; she had a very early interview via Skype for a job she didn't necessarily want, mainly because she had already secured another job she preferred. Morning of the interview I'm violently shaken awake because the company's HR department couldn't get her on Skype and she was panicking. We sort it out but she continues shaking and crying moments before the interview for this job she doesn't want. She apologises for waking me, so i reply (in a calm and gentle tone) that it's fine, just next time be a bit more gentle because its not the nicest feeling to be woken like that and she breaks down again.

I've approached her multiple times about seeking counselling and maybe CBT, definitely not anxiolytics, meds would be a last last last resort. However she shuts down everytime I bring up the topic and don't know what else I can do. I only want her to learn how to handle these things better and also so that it doesn't affect our relationship negatively.

Any advice?

Today was a big day for me,"So, I have been very stressed because of work for the last 2 years. I have always been a person who strives for perfection. I also was raised in a troubled family and was forced to take responsibility of my younger siblings and later even parents at young age. This has made me very responsible and by nature I take care of others better than myself.

In work this kind of combo has made me a perfect employee for company. It has it perks for me as well as within few years I have been promoted into a country manager. Outside everything looked great. Great position, great salary etc. But inside, my stress grew, I got very anxious and it started to be hard to even get out of bed. I couldn’t sleep, eat etc.

So today, I resigned. I left a great position, without any idea about the future. It’s been a big day. I know I made the right decision. Still I have felt very sad and felt that I let down many people, including myself. I know that is not the case, but it was a very hard decision for me. I wanted all to work out, but you can’t force something that isn’t there. Mixed feelings, but I feel a little bit less anxious at the moment than before. Still need to work some time before it ends. 

But phew.. life.."
Fighting Downhill,"My fight has gone down hill. It's like a muddy slope that I keep digging into, but end up sliding a step back instead of forward. I am so stressed... the core of this is mental illness - from it has stemmed the financial, work, relationship stress. Stress dictates my life. I am now fighting downhill because the weight of stress is pulling me back, making the slope steeper. I don't know how to handle it..."
"Wife under extreme stress from current job, feels stuck, not sure how best to help.","My wife has been an insurance adjuster for about three years. She's extremely good at her job, but she's also very introverted. She deals with claimants over the phone and these folks can get pretty nasty. There's been times before where she's had periods of heavy stress, and it's tough on her, but she comes out on top.

This week however seems different. Yesterday she called me very upset from her office after a call that seemed to really get to her. This morning she was on the verge of tears. I told her she should stay home and try to take the day off. I said ""it's just a job"" (which really just made the situation worse). She said there are commitments she set for today and legal action that could be taken against the company if she fails to meet deadlines. 

We've discussed finding a new job, but she feels stuck at her current work place. Our health, car and renters policies are all through her company (I can get health insurance through mine and we can shop around for the other two). She also feels stuck because we have a sizable (~25k) in debt that we are paying. We're going on vacation in two weeks, but I'm afraid it won't get here soon enough, or she won't be able to relax and enjoy it (either because she still feels stuck having to go back to her current job or the stress of finding a new job).

I think logically she gets that it's not the end, and that she can find a new job. However, emotionally this whole situation is really taking a toll. I'm not sure how else I can help, esp, when like this morning my supportiveness comes off as trite. 

Tldr: wife has been stressed at work before, this week has been worse than normal. How can I help?

Thanks~!"
Changing Stress,"Everyone has stress in life, but still what I don't understand is how people cope with stress better than others. 

A college student has alot of stress...
A business owner who works <60 hours a week has stress..., yet the business owner is very successful, while the college student is struggling. 

I'm assuming when Bill Gates was starting Microsoft he was full of stress, and Elon Musk owner of Tessla has to have stress he freaking reads 8 hours a day. 

Is there any resources where I can learn more about stress? There has to be a way where I can teach myself to not respond to stress. There has to be a way where no matter what happens I will feel minimum stress. So how does one accomplish this?"

Understand your emotions & never suffer again!,"My passion is to make you happy, to give you a kind of happiness that doesn’t come and go but an happiness that stays with you forever.

So in order to do that, I want you to understand what does your emotions mean, why do you feel them and how to use them in the most simple and intelligent way for you to feel amazing and to have an extraordinary life living what you want to live.

Emotions are meant to be a compass, a guiding system to help you know when you are going in the “right direction” or when you are getting “off track”. We can experience an infinite amount of emotions in many degrees, within a range going from Unconditional Love to suicidal depression and n between we may feel, happiness, fun, peace, confidence, relaxation, courage, anger, hate, sadness, jealousy, and so on.

Emotions have just one simple meaning: If it feels good it is true, if it feels bad it is not true! 

When I have a thought and that thought makes me feel good, it is because that thought is true, that thought is in alignment with my true nature, according to my higher self\infinite intelligence that thought is correct, it is the right way for me “define” myself and to go in life.

When someone says to you “You are beautiful”, “I love you”, “I enjoy being around you”, … That makes you feel good, because those thoughts are TRUE, those thoughts are showing you who you are, you are loved, you are beautiful, you are and incredible person to be around with.
(In my case, I feel in heaven when someone says to me “You make me feel amazing” 🙂 )

The same goes with your on thoughts and perspectives (that’s what you attract every time btw), when you define yourself/think of yourself in a way that makes you feel good, like “I feel worthy”, “I love myself”, “I love being me”, “I truly like my new shirt”, “I’m having so much fun”, “I’m at peace and relaxed”, you are going in the right way, the right direction,  forward and aligned with your dreams and passions.

From feeling fine to feeling ecstasy and Infinite Love, it is true for you, those thoughts and perspectives are the ones that will serve you in amazing ways and that will bring you the tremendous benefits for you and for your life, keep choosing them, believe in them, bathe yourself in them. 😉

On the other side of the scale we have everything that makes us feel bad. Get this printed on your mind forever, when something feels bad, no matter what it might be, IT IS NOT TRUE.

You you think a thought that is out of alignment with your true nature, with you truly are and does not benefit you and serve you feel bad! That is your Higher Self/Infinite Intelligence letting you know “Hey that is not true!”, “Don’t believe it in”, “Don’t go that way, it won’t bring you any good”.

From a slightly discomfort  to overwhelming depression, it is NOT TRUE, you are not meant to think, believe, act and behave in that way. “I’m bored”, “I’m tired”, “This is so sad”, “My life is falling apart”, “Nobody likes me”, “I don’t like me”, “Nobody will ever love me”, “I’m not worthy”, “I just wanna die”,… no matter it might be, it is bad, so it is NOT TRUE.

It goes the same way for other people reactions upon you (that are just reflections of what you are believing deep inside), “I hate you”, “You know..you will never be good enough”, “You are not capable”,  “You are fat”, “You are ugly”, “He/she is doing much better then you”… These kinds of things that most of us grew up listening from people that are close to us and believing in it because we didn’t knew any better… ARE NOT TRUE.

You don’t need to believe in anything that doesn’t feel good to you! Even if comes from your mom, your dad, your boyfriend/girlfriend, dog, cat,…if it doesn’t feel good than it is NOT TRUE.

Other people don’t know Shit! ;P They don’t know a thing! Their intentions can be good, they might even love you, don’t judge them and always feel love for them, but don’t let anyone define your life and how you should feel about yourself.

If someone says anything that you don’t like, don’t believe it, ignore it,  feel the opposite. That’s how powerful you are 😉

So from now on, every time you feel bad, automatically you will know what is going on! “Wow, this feels bad, so it is not who I am, it is not true for me”,  then you can choose to investigate that thought and let it go and don’t believe in it anymore or to simply turn your attention 180º in the opposite direction and feel good anyway. 😉

Understand that the core reason for you to feel bad is that because you are in fact so Good!
You are so perfect than you think/experience something else you automatically feel the contrast.  Imagine yourself being used to heat, imagining always living in high temperatures, the second you step into something that is cold, you immediately feel it, you immediately feel the contrast of it! “God this is so cold..this is nothing like myself!”.

So whenever something feels bad to you, just relax and remember that you are feeling it because you are indeed the opposite of that, you are perfection itself. Doesn’t it feel liberating to know so ? 🙂

Your emotional guidance system (name given by Bentinho Massaro), are always working on your behalf, listening to it all the times.

When it come to decisions, choices, ways to go in life, the same way goes, what makes you happy, vibrant, excited, loved it is true, it is the way to go! What feels contracted, not so good, mediocre, sad, horrible, it is not for you to choose.

You are the one responsible for your thoughts and  what you choose to believe in! Your Higher Self/Infinite Intelligence is there guiding you all the time, but you will always have the free will to believe and choose the definitions and thoughts that you want to choose.

Don’t be confused anymore, always pick what makes you feel good, define yourself, define your life, define your reality in a way that makes you happy, there is the way to go all the time.

That’s the way to make your dreams come true, that’s the way that life is supposed to be lived.

You are perfect and you have the power to believe in nothing less than that.

Any kind of athletes here? Did stress fuck your stomach/gut up and therefore affected your performance?,"Sorry if I kinda missed the point and I know you guys are going through worse stuff than me, but I am desperate to get this problem fixed.

tldr, I play soccer amateur level since I was a child, but take it pretty seriosly.


Alright, so very often, >50% of the cases, my stomach would completely block my true performance levels, my reaction times are slower, I can run significantly more slow than usually etc etc. Now, I kinda do stress myself before the game but I have never expressed any kind of stress I had through life (and I had lots of stressful situations, life, finances of parents etc) and was kinda proud of myself for it never affecting me. **So could it be that I am not showing stress mentally, but that stress then goes to my gut/stomach?**Anyways, I think so much about the game a few days before it, get hyped, want to prove myself, and then the game comes and this weird feeling, very hard to describe. Like something is blocking or blocked inside my stomach, maybe something related to nervous system?


Interestingly enough, I have gone a few times totally hungover, 2 hours of sleep, smoking the night before (I only smoke when drinking), to a game and then turn out to be among the best players on the pitch.. no fucking sense.

So I think that, because I was having fun partying and drinking the night before, I didn't stress myself over a pointless amateur level soccer match.

Did or does anyone experience the same stuff as me? I tried taking some stomach, acid reflux pills but the problem stayed at the same rate. I am aiming for this subreddit because I am now suspicious that this feeling in my stomach is a direct result of myself stressing over the game."
What is the opposite of a panic attack called?,"My response to emotional stress is to shut down, my body gets very lethargic, I feel a slow molassess like energy flow through my body and I just get incredibly sleepy. My body feels so heavy. Is this a thing? Does it have a name ?"
Behavioral Strategies for Coping with Stress,
Guidelines to help work be less stressful and more fulfilling,"1. Realize that the beginning challenge, be it a new job or process, is the best time to define your workflow for yourself and for those that depend on your work.

2. **Don't be apologetic!** If you're working hard and it's stressing you out (this includes setting a limit on the amount of overtime you're willing to work per day/week), let your higher-ups know that you have reached your current, maximum utilization. They will appreciate you letting them know instead of, after the fact, expecting a result that never had the chance to come to fruition.

3. Always act with integrity and genuineness. Nobody, and I mean **NOBODY**, likes passive-aggressive and/or dramatic co-workers. If you practice *not being* these things then people will always take you seriously and accept your advice as constructive.

4. Spend 75% of your effort on the task at-hand and the remaining 25% managing  your stress/anxiety and being mindful of the next step. <-- This may seem difficult at first but once utilized regularly you will soon find yourself leaving work on-time and with your daily, achievable goals more accomplished.

5. Be the creator and manager of *your* emotions. Never let your difficult co-workers or customers dictate how you feel about the task at-hand (eliminates the desire to negatively alter the relationship based on a one-time, in-the-moment transaction). The prior 4 steps will never leave you with loose ends that can be used against you (as it turns out, nobody is immune to interoffice politics).

6. Near the end of your workday, become very mindful of what you would like to do with the remaining hours in the day. Having an after-work plan will allow you to avoid the cycle of: Wake up => go to work => go to bed => and so on. The weekend plan is critically important.

7. Continuously build your résumé. This practice will allow you to realize the progress you've made in a particular field and where you want it to go."
Can you get tonsillitis due to stress or period?,"Been to the doctor several times, I get tonsilitis every month, sometimes if I am really stressed I get it twice that month. I have asked to have them removed but it such a long process in the UK. I just would like to know if this is a common thing and if more people suffer from tonsillitis at an adult age and get it as often as me."
I don't even have the basic skills required to deal with stress,"I'm a drug addict so I've always used drugs to deal with stress.

Today and as part of my recovery I need to better handle stress.

I already strive to live a healthy lifestyle which will reduce the amount of stress I feel (sports, healthy diet..).

I'm looking for ways to handle stress when it arises. How to deal with an acute bout of stress? Where should I begin? Books or website recommandations?"
how would you handle a customer like this?,"Ok so today I was at work at my local gym. It's in a relatively mixed area of town and theres a wide variety of people use it. Anyway there's a guy Ive not seen before comes in. He's mid 70's, a solicitor and apparently he's an ex-member whose jumped up and arrogant as all fuck and known for being aggressive.

Anyway he asks me about what the timetable is and we currently dont have a paper copy or anything because it's being renewed tomorrow and we'll have them monday morning. I told him this and he begins to swear and 'bloody hell, this is nonsense, you're useless etc' at me. Rude.

Anyway, I he goes away for a while and finds the old one on the wall (months out of date btw) and comes back yelling at me and telling me I need to 'engage my brain' and 'listen when his lips are flapping.' I continue to explain it's not only out of date but being replaced TOMORROW and we dont have copies of the new one just yet, but he is welcome to use our facilities and gym for today.

ANYWAY, he then leans right over the desk and gets really close to me with a big scowl and demands my name so he can make a formal complaint because i dont listen or help. I tell him my first name and tell him that communication works both ways and his agression isn't needed. He leaves and I find my anxiety rises up really high and felt very sick.

I felt threatened and that he was deliberately being abusive. He did this in line with a camera that caught all of it. I still feel a bit shaky though. I was trying to help and he took an attitude. 

Apparently he's known for trying to pick fights but this was ridiculous."
"If you could tell 1 person to fuck right off to their face, at length, and there would be no negative consequences, who would it be and why?",
Stress,I'm honestly stressed about my stress so I'm stressing about the stress I'm not even stressing about and it's stressful
Stress by too much thinking,I don't have much bigger problems but I take stress into small small problems also. I think way too much about even small problems. I can't even handle big problems. I see people wouldn't worry even about larger than larger problems and here I have an anxiety even on small problems. I also have a lack of confidence in myself and for even a small step I would think of what will people will think about me. This has severly taken a toll on my mental health. If anyone have any ideas regarding how I can improve in this I would highly appreciate it.
The Relationship Between Hormones and Stress,"Hormones and Stress 

The holiday season is upon us! Although this can a wonderful time filled with love and laughter, it can also significantly increase the day-to-day stresses experienced by many people; this can easily turn into chronic stress. Did you know that chronic stress can have a significant impact on your normal hormonal responses? Read on to learn more about the effects stress can have on your body and what you can do about it.

Hormones and Stress Panic Attack From Stress And Worry
The Normal Stress Response

The Hormones and Stress feeling that we all know so well is part of the body’s normal response to a real or perceived threat. However, your body does not differentiate between serious physical threats and “normal” pressures, and so a heavy workload or demands from your family can build up over time and have a detrimental effect on your health.

The stress response is commonly known as the “fight or flight” response, and it begins in the brain. When a stress is perceived, the amygdala sends a signal to the hypothalamus, which activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream. Adrenaline then accelerates the heartbeat to pump more blood to the muscles in preparation for “flight.” In addition, the pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rate all increase to enhance the amount of oxygen inhaled. Other senses, such as sight and hearing, become sharper.

During the second phase of the stress response, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands, which ensures that the body remains on “high alert.” Cortisol levels remain elevated until the threat passes; the stress response is then shut down once the brain perceives that the threat is no longer there (http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response).

Hormones and Stress

The Effects of Stress

Prolonged periods of stress prevent the shut-down of the normal stress response because the body remains on high-alert and producing cortisol. The long-term exposure to cortisol and other Hormones and Stress has a number of negative effects throughout the body, including:

In the respiratory system, the accelerated breathing rate could lead to asthma or panic attacks (http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-body.aspx).
In the cardiovascular system, prolonged periods of an elevated heart rate and increased blood pressure can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke.
In the liver, the increased levels of cortisol stimulate the production of glucose in anticipation of increased energy demands. Such prolonged exposure to elevated blood glucose levels might increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.
Some animal studies have suggested that chronic stress can reduce testosterone levels and sperm production and maturation in men; it can even lead to erectile dysfunction and impotence.
In women, chronic stress can lead to an irregular menstrual cycle, worsened premenstrual syndrome symptoms, and reduced libido.
Stress can also dampen the immune system.
Emotionally, stress can affect your sleep, increase irritability, anxiety, and depression, and reduce concentration.
How to Reduce the Effects of Stress

There is no need to worry: there is a lot you can do to counteract the natural stress responses that occur at this time of year. It is important to understand what makes you stressed, as well as what makes you relax. For example, there are several lifestyle changes that can help reduce stress  (http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-management-relieving-stress):

Take time out to do something you enjoy Express your feelings
Use relaxation techniques such as meditation Exercise regularly; exercise is one of the best ways of reducing stress Because many of the symptoms of chronic stress are also associated with low hormones, such as sleep loss, fatigue, and low testosterone levels, we recommend getting your Hormones and Stress levels checked if you experience any prolonged, unusual or unexplained stress. At AAI Clinic, we can measure your Hormones and Stress and make recommendations regarding any hormone replacement therapy or supplements that could alleviate your stress-related symptoms.

What better way to flush out the stress?,"Laughter loudly could be the best way to flush out the stress.!! So,

Too Stressed To Go Back To Work,"First time poster.  I've been working seasonally at an understaffed retail store.  I'm only okay at the job, not great, and it's the first job I've had in a good while.  I've been wanted to change jobs anyway b/c it's so far away and I don't like it, but I got turned down for so many jobs before I got this one, I don't know where to look.

So far I've been sucking it up, but today?  Today took every ounce of willpower I had to go there.  I was dreading going to work so much, and when I got there I couldn't relax.  I was on the basement floor of an anxiety attack, I knew that if I stayed the whole shift, something would happen.  I couldn't see a scenario where I didn't just quit and walk out in a huff, which I did not want to do.

I was able to give my shift manager an explanation (that omitted the severity) and got to go home, but I have to work again in two days and I don't think I'll be able to.  I've just postponed the problem.

I would love to be able to quit, and my family would understand (though I still think I would get hell about it), but if I did I think I would be risking a reference that I would need to get a replacement gig, quitting without notice?

And I don't even know where I would look, I can't do normal.  I'm a deaf aspie, you get me in the right situation and let me do my thing, and I'm gold, but I can't do what everyone else does, I can't learn the way they do and when I try, it's always pain.  Same thing happened with school.  I literally don't know what to do.

All I need is just a job where I can keep my head down for a couple hours so I can write in my off-time (and even that's been suffering b/c of my work stress).  I'm miserable when I'm NOT at work because of work, and I just need a better option.  I hate job searching, I HATE interviewing (as if I would be a good interview in this current headspace), I hate being judged on a metric that I don't measure up to, and there HAVE to be options available to me that I don't know about, but I have no idea where to look.

There's just nothing right now that isn't causing me a mountain of stress, even relaxing because it's putting off the inevitable... I just don't know what to do."
Anyone else experience shortness of breath or air hunger?,"I went through a big bout of stress and soon developed air hunger or shortness of breath. I just could not get a satisfying breath no matter how hard I tried. This feeling would sometimes come and go but it would often last all day. I was sure I had some disease so I went to the doctors but after numerous tests my lungs were just fine. 

I dealt with this for almost a year before my constant research paid off and was able to take steps to fix this. I learned that when you experience higher levels of stress your body starts to breathe in more deeply to get ready for the fight or flight response. If this keeps up then the increased breathing rate becomes the new normal and so your body starts to crave bigger gulps of air. 

So I needed to relearn how to breathe in a sense. I did my best to fight the urge to take deep breaths and reduce the amount I was breathing. I found that meditation really  helped me achieve this. It took a couple weeks but I had such a big improvement and was feeling much better.  I am no doctor but i just wanted to share what helped me so that it may help you.

This guide is a good first step.

"Constantly going non-stop, afraid of crashing big time.","Engineering major, like the title says, I've not had a day off since June.  Took summer semester while working, had two weeks off before fall but was working during them because I needed the money.  Fall semester is coming to an end, and I only have 12 days off, during which I will be flying 12,000 miles round trip and also getting my wisdom teeth removed.  Then I start winter semester for 6 weeks of Physics hell, and right into spring semester.  I havent worked out for the past couple of weeks, been hardly eating, sleep has been alright, no time to date or have sex/intimacy.  Financially I'm stretched paper thin, and I'm dealing with on and off depression and loneliness. 

Of course, these things aren't all bearing down on me simultaneously, it only seems that way when I write it down, but its always a combo of multiple things, mental juggling, putting things on the back burner, prioritizing.  I am driven to work towards my goals, but I find myself fearing that somewhere along the line I will slip and stop giving a fuck.

How do you guys manage stress?  What are some things I can do to help with my mental state?  I'm usually pretty good with my diet and exercise, as well as productivity, not procrastinating, its just been these past few weeks that I've started slipping up.  My sleep, however, has been really screwed up for a long long time.  Usually sleeping at 3am and waking up at 7 or 8 completely brain dead.  My brain usually just wont shut off, as soon as my head hits the pillow and there are no external distractions, the anxiety gears start churning.  Makes me feel insane sometimes.  Really feeling burnt out.  Any help would be really appreciated, thanks."

"45 Year Old. Burned out, stressed beyond belief. Need advice","I'm 45 years old and I am completely burned out.  I have been working for over 22 years in highly stressful roles that continue to wreck havoc on me and my family.  I am unhealthy and overweight.   I continually take my stress home.  I am overly grumpy to my wife and kids or completely quiet/distance from everyone. 


I understand that I need to take a less stressful job. I get this now.  Unfortunately, in the past 5 years, I have jumped around trying to find a job where my stress levels are reduced.   My resume reads like this (reverse order):

* Current job - Going on 15 months
* Previous - 2 years, 3 months
* Previous  - 18 months
* Previous - 2 years, 10 months
* Previous - 6 years, 9 months
* Previous - Just under 7 years  

Before I try and find another job, I think I need to take a mental health break.   An extended break.   I am financially in a position where I can quit my job and live without taking a ton of debt for a year, maybe 18 months.   I'm thinking of a break of about 6 months.  During this time, I want to focus on my family, my health, and my future career direction.   

My biggest fear about quitting my current job and taking 6 months off, will put in a position of not being able to find work again.  At 45, there is a slight chance that I will face ageism...  

I need some advice here.   If I were to take a break, what on earth would I tell a future employer for the reason why I left the work force in the first place (sure, I can lie and say it was kids related, but I really don't want to do this).   Has anyone does this before around my age?  Am I stupid for even considering this?

What's the hardest thing about stress management?,"Hi everyone. My name is Katie Hester, I'm a Licensed Clinical Social Worker and psychotherapist. 

I’m looking to interview a couple of people for an upcoming new program I'm developing. Specifically I'm curious about what the hardest part of stress management is for YOU. I will not be selling you anything, this is purely for research.

It seems people fall into two categories: 

1. Some people have no idea where to start with managing their stress (after all, these aren't skills we are usually taught as children)

2. Others know some stress management skills but have a hard time with consistency/accountability in terms of actually doing the things they know will help

If you are ages 21-45 and fall into either of those categories above, I would love to talk with you for about 15 minutes to better understand how I can help people like you in the future with my program. Again, I will not be trying to sell you anything, this is purely market research.

In exchange, I am happy to offer you a FREE 30 minute (no sales pitch) private session with me to begin to create a viable personalized stress management plan. We can do this over the phone or Skype, so you can be anywhere in the world.

Please just send me a PM or email to katiehesterlcsw@gmail.com
Many thanks! I look forward to talking with you soon."
Using systems to help manage the stress at work when many tasks come up,"I hope it is okay to post this here? When I started working in a manager position, my amount of daily tasks quadrupled. I stressed a lot about forgetting them. [This blog post](http://blog.houen.net/the-day-you-became-less-stressed-at-work/) is about the system I came up with to help me stress down."
Am I stressed or do I just need to get it together?,"Hey. Does anyone else out here ever wonder if they deserve to feel stressed or not? How do you cope with it and how can you tell the difference between genuinely being stressed vs just being pathetic? I'm having difficulties at work, my health has been poor and I find myself constantly worrying and increasingly becoming more and more anxious again. Then I worry more because I don't want to be put back on tablets again after I worked so hard to come off them.
I just wonder if maybe I'm a weak character and don't deserve to feel as stressed over the things I am. Colleagues at work have made me feel like because my stress isn't theirs its somehow lesser, and I know they're probably right. I'm in another country away from friends who might listen, my family don't really care and have their own stuff going on and I'm working in a country with next to no help for things like this. If this IS stress, I don't know how to relieve it either. Yoga and meditation don't work, I'm always too exhausted after work to then go and work out. I don't have anyone to talk to and because of where I live, going out to get a break is too restrictive."
can you answer my survey please?,"its a questionnaire for my research project around the subject of stress, it will only take 1 minute of your time to fill out and i would appreciate it very much, thank you.

My employer is an asshole,"Excuse me for ranting here about my problems. I just needed to get it out. I don't expect any responses.

So I've been working on this job for four months but yesterday it made me incredibly angry. First of all, it's a habit in our office to overwork from 15min to 1/2/3 hours every day. Overworking is not paid. This week my idiotic manager and employer asked me to come on saturday to list/check everything that remains in our warehouse. They said ""Choose between saturday and sunday"". Again no talk about money it's f@cking ""expected"". I didn't like the idea yet I agreed. I thought it would be 3-4 hours because there should've been 3 of us, not me alone. Well there were 3 of us: me, my employer and assistant manager. My ""boss"" even brought his son to make things faster but they did nothing except stupid shit that wasn't speeding the process in any way. In the end I left at 8:30pm (came there at 9am). My friend invited me to a party and I missed it, too, because of that.

Long story short I worked for 11 hours on my day off and I feel like I've been used like a tool and nobody gives a fuck. Moreover, I feel like I let myself down by being there and not creating a conflict with my employer. I just obeyed like a typical worker. I am so pissed off and angry. Today I have hard time enjoying what is left of my weekend.

P.S. Sorry, guys, for all that negativity. Needed to vent it out."
Being an Adult shouldn't be this stressful...,"I admit because of my depression, I am less motivated and could careless about a lot of stuff. However even if I wasn't depressed there's still a lot of shit to deal with! How am I gonna make it pass 21?  Filing for health insurance has got me so stressed out. They're asking for so much information. I get why, but damn. Don't even get me started on students loans. I haven't looked at my email for months now. I'm too stressed and scared to look! Like I know as soon as I see those numbers I'll cry. Knowing I'm in debt for doing something good like getting and education makes me so angry. And then next year I'll have to do taxes for the first time. I'm already stressed about that because I don't know the first thing about them. I feel like everyone else has their shit under control, but me. I feel quite stupid that I don't know a lot of adult things. I feel so...behind. It's even effecting my health now. Geez. 

Thank you for reading my venting"

Phone Call of Doom (that I keep putting off),"Anyone get stressed about phone conversations? I generally do. 

Today I am trying to psych myself up to call an old friend/neighbor whose wife, I'm pretty sure, hates me. I'm too outspoken and non-partisan and she's too blue blood conservative. Anyway, they're kind of like family to us. We haven't seen them in at least five years so it's time to end the dry spell. Only issue I have with this whole thing is my partner wants me to call and discuss the travel schedule... with an old lady who freaks me out.

This is day 4 of putting the call off, btw. I hate that I stress over the smallest things."
"Hi, I'm stressed","My finals for my masters degree are in the coming week. I'm stressing. I've worked solid for 6 months. Everyday long hours. Can't eat, can't sleep, smoking. I realise this is all very unhealthy and it's taking it's toll on my mind and body. TMJ constantly, paranoid I'm going to fail everything and waste everything. Then on top of that is the anxiety that I've made a lot of poor decisions, that have made things hard for myself. I live with an depressive character, sucking anything good out of a situation. I feel everything around me is bearing down on me and I'm not strong enough. I set my goals too high and I'm always disappointed. But I just don't know how to change. If I could not worry, I would. I realise that a change relaxed mind is a productive one. I need help."
Work related stress;,"Hi guys,

I need to let some steam off and literally have no where to go to do it!

I started a new Job in October as a Sales Support Admin for a security company after doing previous admin work and this job's work load is a lot more than what was said or expected!

For anyone who has done Admin work it's usually a pretty straight forward job that doesn't have massive responsibility which in turn can create massive repercussions for a company.. well mine does!

My company is about 35-40 people large and I work in the export department with 3 guys who do the actual ""sales"" my job is meant to be supporting them but I actually run my entire department and if I make a mistake it has huge financial repercussions for the company.

I have around 120-200 emails per day that I have to respond to which include Orders, Queries and Complaints. I have to manually process orders, do stock adjustments, custom invoice the orders, arrange deliveries (with a number of different companies) and check the pricing on about £500,000 (300 orders) per month. It's my job to send work to our warehouse team everyday, chase payments and create accounts.

Bearing in mind these orders can be up to 50lines long!

Mean while I get questions thrown at me from around the office and it is really getting me down, I'm getting a tight feeling around my chest and can not stop thinking about work. Everyone is picking out mistakes I am making and as soon as people say my name I am just waiting on the criticism, I havn't had a lunch break in about 3months and spend an extra 2hours a day in work (come in early leave late) and still am chasing backlogged work, if my dispatches arnt done fast enough we can loose customers. Whilst my team sit on the internet giving me shit about customers orders that have not arrived on time and how serious the consequences will be if x y z workload isn't completed by a certain date.

All this coupled into one I am getting snappy with my family at home, dreading going into work, not sleeping at night but can't leave because I need the money, I have spoke to my boss and he compared me to the previous employee (who bearing in mind worked with a different team in our department all who would do the ""admin"" work too..)

Do you guys have any advise in how I can sort of overcome the emotions I am feeling and leave my work at work...

Thanks guys, have a nice evening.

My parents have been stressing me out for over 2 months.,"Ok so I was supposed to graduate a year early in high school but because I had to take more classes the regular students I started to fall behind and preform badly in school pace wise(though I never get bad grades, A's & B's baby) I was threatened to be pulled out of school by my mom on several occasions with no hope to ever graduate and then the school was threatening to kick me out so I would have to enroll in a physical school(I'm online only) my mom and dad are so against me ever going to a real high school that they would actually prevent me from graduating. When the school actually expelled me, my mom was belligerent and furious that she made me clean everything in the entire house and told me she will never enroll me in a physical school which is very hypocritical because she and my dad were in real high school. So then she started freaking out because my failure would embarrass her so she kept calling all the school supervisors to basically say that kicking a student out of the school because they are struggling is wrong. So I was accepted back in and given an extended deadline. It's now only 10 days before ny deadline and I have three classes to complete not only am I stressed out supremely by this deadline but also by my parents putting pressure on me and constantly being mean and cruel to me. Now we have been having more problems because they ""don't know what to do with me"" im a 17 year old women and my dad treats me with no respect and expects me to treat him like a god damned king. He actually hits me pretty hard in the head when he's mad and says I'm being disrespectful but honestly I don't respect him at all I only pretend to. My mom us constantly saying there's something wrong with me and that if - in this time of utter stress - I don't change how I act she will take me to a psychologist. She is so fucking blind she doesn't see that my mood swings and irritability are from her and dad coming up to me when im happy and peaceful and literally picking a fight with and from the immense stress, expectations, and pressure I'm under. 

Any advice on how to relieve my stress and to stop them from treating me so badly? 


TL;DR my parents are saying there's something wrong with me and that I need mental help. All because of my recent poor performance in school and the stress that it is causing me. And on top of it all they are constantly on top of me, waiting for me to mess up and when I do they call me names say im a failure and shout things angrily at me when if they just asked nicely I will do it nicely."
I'm so done!,"I don't want this anymore. I go to work- stress to the max, go home- stress to the max. It's ridiculous. I need relief sometime, but I can't find it anywhere."
I don't know what to do any more.,"My family has always called me names like mental and psycho. They call me those names because I was like those typical teenagers who would yell and scream during a fight. It wasn't just my mom, but my aunts, grandma and even my aunt husband. My aunt husband brother suffered from real mental issues, and her husband would say how if i didn't stop getting mad I would become mental just like his brother. And that I was becoming close to being a mental person. Than my aunt and everyone else started saying the same. My sister and cousins get mad to, but they are not subjected to this type of wording from them,only me.  I have always bottled it up for many years, and it seems that now I'm 20 years old. It's all just coming out in anger towards them. Other things in my life, and including this has made me really stressed out in life. I can't afford any sort of help so thats out of the question. "
Physical symptoms of stress?,"Hi All- 

I have been working straight through the last 10 days. I am a commission based only job with my next paycheck not in sight. Also, I am facing some recent IRS stress. Oh, the joys of self employment. 


I am curious as to whether these may be responses to stress? Or whether something else is wrong with me: 

I have developed some sort of skin condition on my face that is best described as eczema. It started two weeks ago. Also, it doesn't appear to be getting better. 


I came home from work today for a mental health day and i look in the mirror? My face just looks...blah...puffy....Like I need 2 days off or something. 


Is it common for your body to react physically to stress? "
I'm making mistakes at work. My anxiety is getting worse. Can't sleep or eat.,"Hi r/stress,


I've only just come across this sub now and sorry if I am posting completely the wrong kind of post but I just need to get this off my chest as I can't really talk to anyone about it. Here goes. 

I started a job in my ideal sector at the end of April, and was so thrilled when I landed the job and received a lot of praise from my manager about how amazingly qualified I was and how my application/interview was amazing. I really felt I got off to a great start. After working in dead end jobs since college I was finally happy and proud of my position. 

The field is very creative. I spend most of my days writing and creating concepts for my clients. I am left to my own devices and have to reach a target by months end for each of my clients. Here's where my anxiety is coming from... I am really struggling with my organisation and its really having a negative impact on my work. 

My team is based in one location and I work in tandem with a team in another location. I deal directly with the clients and it is on me to inform my colleagues of updates. I am forgetful when I get stuck into a project and an error I had made by not informing my colleage that a client had approved some work set the whole team back by over two weeks, increased my client's workload by 10 hours and ultimately cost the company money as those extra 10 hours of work aren't being paid for by the client. My manager was really exasperated with me today, and couldn't believe I had made such a simple mistake. I can't either. I spent the day in extreme bouts of anxiety or sitting in the break room solo trying to regulate my breathing. The team expanded four weeks after I started and the new girl is coping so well. I am terrified there is a huge X on my back. 

As part of a company quality review one of my clients was looked at. It had been handed over to me by a colleague who left and had not been properly handed over so there were elements that were not resolved e.g. a note said something was unfinished, which I presumed was unfinished by my colleague in another location, but instead was intended for me to pick up but I didn't realise. The review was given publically in front of the team and I felt so humiliated for not having a good system in place. It was the first company review and in hindsight I feel like one of the more experienced staff should have been targeted first so I could learn from their review, but all the same I feel like this was mistake number 1 in my manager's head. With this second mistake today she even said that I shouldn't have missed up 'again' and I'm so sick even thinking of our conversation that I want to throw up. She told me my work is very good, but things are getting lost and I just died inside. 

I spent the day reviewing every client, every email I had sent them or the colleague to see if other mistakes had been made and I found two incredibly similar mistakes on two other clients. I have since tried to resolve both of them by emailing my overseas colleague but not I'm terrified it will come up with management and I'll be in even hotter water. I have created checklists and I even work in the evenings at home to try to get the best for my clients, but my best work is being wasted due to my inability to organise myself. 

It is after midnight here and my heart feels like it will pound through my chest. I can't really speak to my SO about it (definitely not about the additional mistakes I found) as I'm so afraid that they'll be cross at me for not being as excellent at this job as I originally thought I was. To be honest, I've been close to tears all day but can't contain it. 

I work really, really hard but still feel like the biggest fuck up in the history of my company and that I'll be let go after my six month probation. I spoke to my colleagues today about my feelings and the general consensus was that everyone makes mistakes and that we shouldn't have to babysit our colleagues overseas as they should be aware of work in the pipeline as should ask/remind me but that goes both ways and I really shouldn't have issues with organisation. There are a number of checklists in work and policy changes almost every second day so I'm really struggling. 

I'm so sorry for the wall of text. I just had to offload that. I know that I'm a total fuck up at work and its making me sick to my stomach when I know I'm not as good as they want. All I can picture is them thinking of the other candidates at my interview who they should have hired. "
Using Your Brain to Beat Burnout: Five Anti-Stress Tips,
My family causes me unbearable stress. I can't even enjoy being with them anymore,"I have a very strange family. A mother who divorced my father for another man and that man died. My parents have since moved back in together while maintaining their divorced status. My father is a stubborn old mess who just turned 60 but has the body of a 80 yr old. He works every day and he's rich (millionaire), but lives such a mundane life. He works (capital investments), comes home, watches TV, eats poorly (although much better now), smokes and thankfully just quit drinking (after i broke down telling him he has to pull his life together, if not for himself, at least so his children don't follow in his path). He has way more money than he'll ever need and I've told him multiple times he should quit his job and do something that he enjoys. He is the crutch of my family. I have a 26 year old brother who barely graduated highschool and is FULLY supported by my father. Dude just plays video games all day and eats toaster strudels or whatever else my dad stocks up in his freezer. I have a 22 yr old brother that has never held a job. They both live in a house that my dad pays for and the fact my younger brother will graduate college is a miracle.

my parents moved back together because my dad still loves her even though she doesn't give half a shit about him other than the fact he's loaded. I think she was just lonely and since her love affair died, she agreed to move back into a new beach house they bought. I wasn't sure i'd ever be able to forgive my mother for divorcing him but as I get older, I see things much differently. Meditation has helped me a lot to gain perspective in life. At one point I even admired her for living her life happily, but all of that has changed. She hasn't worked a day in her life since we were born. I give her all the credit she deserves for raising us well, but she's greedy as hell. Her greatest concern is that she has the money to do what she wants. Not only does she receive alimony from the divorce, she also CHARGES my father for almost everything she buys. She just fucking gives him a total and has him write her a check (not to mention she adds on more or as she jokingly says ""adds interest"" and doesn't even bother to hide it from him)

I'm full of so much rage just typing this out. My family has this facade that everything is chipper and no one tries to fix these issues that are so unbelievably corrupt. My father is lazy, has become narrow minded, self-destructive (smoking, eating, being stagnant, subservient), my mother does everything out of her own desires, not giving a shit about anyone else even her children and my siblings are just happy that they have money to do whatever they want. Everything revolves around what she wants, and my dad goes head over heels to provide it for her. Every now and then he'll have the balls to tell her she spends too much and she just throws out some bullshit rationalization or turns it around on him somehow in a way that he just concedes.

I don't know how I have become so different from my family, but I have had the unbelievable joy of the small pleasures in life. Traveling, learning, being active, just having a functional body that I can take care of. I want so much for my family to experience these joys instead of the materialistic lives they have spiraled into. It has snowballed such that EVERY little thing my parents do reminds me now of everything I have come to hate about their lives, and the fact that they let these suppressed issues fester. I try so hard to be nice and just accept them for who they are but I just can't bear to witness it.

I feel like it's pointless to even attack them for minor things they do that annoy me because it's only the tip of the iceberg. There's so much shit at the root of the cause that I'd have to dig up and trying to convey reason to my mother is like talking to a rock. She literally just filters out what she doesn't care to hear.

I'm moving halfway across the country because I literally feel like i'm going to crumble apart subjecting myself to this stress every day. I want them to be happy but I just can't take this anymore, for the sake of my own happiness. 

I have a month before I move and I just want to enjoy it. After I move I plan to travel all around, experience life to the fullest and I just hate the thought of my last month being filled with hatred toward my family. At dinner I'll literally just sit quiet because the alternative would be me losing my shit, but that doesn't mean it's a good solution.

If anyone has actually read this, you're a saint. Writing it out has helped me a lot in itself. Any comments or suggestions are appreciated.

Constant teary breakdowns,"Hi
I’m F47 with 3 kids, working full time in a stressful job which should really be a two person role
At Christmas time I had a major meltdown, a colleague sent me to the doc who said I needed two weeks off ASAP. 
I didn’t take them as no one would do my job and I knew my stress would be worse worrying about my clients
I pushed through and Im currently on annual leave
Just thinking about going back to work makes my stomach churn
I’ve been with this company nearly ten years but I feel broken
I’ve given them my all and often put my family second to the job
I know I need a new job but it’s not an option right now
Does anyone have coping mechanisms that are tried and true?
I need to not think about work 24/7

I can't handle all this alone,"I'm seriously considering just running away from all of this, just packing my bags and leaving, but I have nowhere to go...

My mom died suddenly, leaving me and my brother as orphans struggling to get by, yes we are both adults, yes we're trying to get work, my brother was rejected for the most recent job he applied for and my anxiety and depression is making it really hard for me to leave the house... I try to find work online but everything is scams, or lies, or survey sites that pay less than a pittance. There are legitimate things, but no matter what I do or how hard I try nothing works for me, and I can't take it anymore.

I have been STRUGGLING to make money, we have rent to pay at the end of the month, we have to cancel our utilities and get new ones under a new account but we can't afford the service start fee, everyone keeps telling me to do this and to do that but NOTHING is actually helping me. ""Get a job"" is the prime example of advice I've heard which makes me want to scream, if it was that easy to get a job just by saying it, we'd both have a job already.

I'm an artist and a writer and I can't find work online in any of my fields, people won't commission me and I can't even sell some of my old things to make a little bit of money. I can't stop crying, I'm literally sitting here crying because if we become homeless, it's over, we have nowhere else to go... We have an aunt and grandma, but they aren't any better off than we are financially... I just, I'm so angry at my mother for leaving us, I'm so mad that she knew she was dying and she LIED to me and my brother.

I'm so furious that she died, left nothing, and left us to suffer in her wake. And I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm losing all hope that we're going to be okay, I can't even make enough money for food most of the time, how am I ever going to do this?

Survey,"Hi everyone. I am a Final year college student and for the purpose of my Design project, I've prepared this survey.

So I'm currently a senior in high school (which is stressful because I need a certain amount of credits to graduate) and of course I'm still living with my parents. And our landlord hasn't fixed anything in the house, even though my parents told him 3 times (2 verbal and 1 written - to which he signed it and was given a copy of it) about the things that need to be fixed. We even pulled the weeds in the front yard, put weed mats over the dirt, and then put rocks to make it look nice. And he didn't even take anything off of rent for that, when on the lease it didn't say that we had to do any of that. He even made us go get the rocks from the store and also buy some plants to make it look nice...We used our own money to make the yard look good....But going back to what the landlord hasn't fixed, here's a list of what hasn't been fixed along with what was wrong:

&#x200B;

\~the heater - if you want turn it off, you actually have to unplug the damn thing. And the next time you wanted to turn the heater back on, you have to plug it back in. Plus when you first turn the heater on, it'll make a smell. I'm not sure how to explain what it smells like, I guess it kind of smells like something burning or something like that. Like I said, I'm not sure.

\~the air conditioner - this broke about a year ago and actually did get fixed (after about a week of no AC). But in California, it's basically warm or hot, rarely is it freezing cold all day long. So, when the AC went out, it was freakin hot as hell. We ended up buying an AC unit to stick in the window. I think it costed about $200 or $300...I'm not sure. 

\~the plumbing - yes, the plumbing in this house is a joke. When I'm doing dishes, the left side of the sink will start backing up with water. So I turn on the garbage disposal to try to make the water go down. And it does go down, but then the right side if the sink (that doesn't have the garbage disposal) starts filling up with water that has black stuff floating in it, and it has a nasty smell (think of rotten eggs or spoiled milk)

\~the garage door - the big door that opens that allows you put your car into the garage. That's the one that broke. It has broken before, but the landlord didn't do anything about it. So my dad fixed it himself. BUT now it's broken again and my dad can't fix it this time. Whenever you press the button to open it, it starts to open, but then it dips in and makes a loud noise then closes itself. Basically the garage door, in a way, snapped/bent in a certain spot to where it doesn't want to open.

\~the ceiling - recently California has experienced a major rain storm (maybe heavy rainfall would be a better way to put it instead of rain storm..IDK) and we received a lot of rain. Which during the heavy rain, my mom noticed that there was a bubble in the ceiling...and of course it's a leak. We put a bucket there to catch the drops. And the landlord hasn't done anything to fix this. Luckily it's just one spot that leaks.

&#x200B;

That's the list of the things he hasn't fixed. But that's not where it ends. Lately, he's been harassing my dad for rent, even though my dad stated that he'll call when he has something. And yet he keeps calling and coming by. On top of that, he told my dad that we can't afford to be living in this house, or anywhere else, yadadada (I forgot what else he told my dad). Recently, one night, I was watching T.V. with my family and all of a sudden we heard loud banging on the door along with someone yelling ""I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! WHERE IS MY MONEY!! STOP AVOIDING ME!!"" And some other stuff..Guess who it was. Yep. Our landlord. As our landlord was banging on the door, he actually tried to open the door to come inside. Luckily the door was locked, but he still tried opening the damn door! As this was happening, my dog was growling at the door, and I've never heard her growl like that....

To be honest, I've always thought if someone did end up breaking into my house, my dog would just be like 'ooooo new person!!! I'm gonna jump on them and give them kisses!!!!\~\~\~' I don't know why I believed she would act this way, but I did. Until that night, that's when I knew I was wrong about her. Well duh, obviously she would protect her family, but I couldn't help but think that...ANYWAYS MOVING ON!

The landlord recently gave us a 3 day notice to move out, and at the bottom of the notice it said that we have to pay for any damages....AKA all of the things I listed above. He can't charge us for the damages, considering we have a document stating that things need to be fixed but hasn't been fixed and he even signed it. We kept the original and gave him a copy. He's saying that we haven't mentioned anything about the things that need to be fixed. But we have proof that we have, so he can't charge us for those damages..right? 

Our landlord is also saying that he needs the rent money because he doesn't have enough money to pay the mortgage on the house. Which is a load of baloney considering my dad works with someone who knows our landlord personally. Apparently our landlord actually has a crap load of money. So then why is he so persistent in getting the rent money?

Because of all this, I have seen a side of my dad I thought I would never see. He's not the kind to break down crying, it's just not him. If he's stressed, he'll drink. That's it. End of story. So it's extremely rare that I do see him cry. But one night, my mom asked me what was wrong and when I didn't answer because I started crying (due to everything that's going on and I had been holding the tears back for a while now) that's when my dad broke down crying. He kept going on about how he's failed as a provider and he doesn't know what to do....This douche of a landlord caused my dad to break down crying AND caused my dad to start drinking more and more often

&#x200B;

On the bright side, me and my dad actually had a bonding moment that night. Me and him were a crying mess and hugging each other along with my older brother (who somehow hasn't been affected at all by what's going on...or that we know of..) We were in a group hug, and the only ones crying was me and my dad. I remember what my dad told me because..well because he rarely says things like this. My dad pushed my hair out of my face and looked me in the eyes and said: ""I never had a sister...so having a daughter is difficult cuz I don't know what to do most of the time...It was weird at first....but now I don't ever want to let you go...even when I'm dead..."" My dad rarely says these kind of things, he's the kind who shows love a certain way instead of the typical/normal way. For example, normally people would get mad if you gave them the middle finger. Well, in my house it's actually welcomed to do it to one another. It's our weird way of saying 'I love you'....My dad is actually waiting for the day I say to him ""F you dad"". But he wants me to say the actual F word. My brother has already done it, now I have to do it. So yeah my family is weird...ANYWAYS ONCE AGAIN MOVING ON!!!

&#x200B;

I'm afraid something is going to happen to my dad. Specifically, I'm afraid of him dying....And my dad has even said that the stress is gonna be reason why he dies...or because of drinking....Due to what's been going on with our landlord, my dad has started drinking again, but this time he's drinking more.....My mom is smoking more then usual also. I understand why though, it's because of the stress. As for me...well....

I haven't really been eating anything the past 3 to 4 weeks. I basically eat a little snack here and there. Then when it comes to dinner, I'll either eat half of what my mom made or not have her make me anything and just find something else to eat. I can't eat a lot of meat or else my stomach will start hurting really bad, and it seems like my body won't let me eat a lot of food at all. When I do try to eat, I can only eat so much, before I get nauseated really bad. After I eat, I still feel hungry, almost like starving. It's hard to explain exactly what that feels like, but I guess it feels like your stomach is empty and when you do eat, it didn't help at all.... I ended up going to the doctor yesterday, and they're going to be doing a lot of tests on me, to figure out what's going on....AANNNDDD I've been thinking about doing a certain thing...but I don't want to let my family down and have them worried about me; which, would cause them to have more stress....but no one knows that I have this feeling...

You're probably asking what is this 'certain thing' I'm talking about...Cutting. I'm talking about cutting. I used to be a cutter, and it got bad....I have scars to prove it, but I was able to stop. Little fun fact about me cutting: my dad said I was a smart cutter, because I actually cleaned the pencil sharpener blade with rubbing alcohol before I made new cuts and I even cleaned those cuts with rubbing alcohol as well...so yeah...and before I get yelled at for using rubbing alcohol on cuts, the label says it can be used on wounds I made sure of it before using it on the cuts......

Anyway, I've been thinking about cutting again, but I haven't cut myself (on purpose) in about 1 to 2 years....The urge to do just one small cut is so tempting...….

Last little thing before I finish this post....Our landlord has told us that he's a responsible landlord and takes care of things, who fixes things when needed. Yeah, he actually said this. AANNNNDDDD he wants us out, so his daughters can move into this house. Little do they know things are crap in this house, but since they're his daughters, he'll probably fix everything in the house just for them. And he probably won't charge them rent at all, or charge them little to no rent.

Well, that's all I've wanted to say. To those who actually read this entire thing, thank you for taking your time to read my post. I know there's more interesting things to be reading, but you chose to read mine. I want to thank you for that. This probably sounds sappy and whatnot, but I legit mean it....

Also sorry for any mistakes. Normally, when typing on my laptop I make little or no mistakes but I noticed while typing this post, I kept making some mistakes....So yeah, once again thank you for reading!"

Feeling overwhelmed,"I’m feeling the stress of being a senior in high school. Stressed because lots of school work and decisions to be made. So exhausted emotionally, mentally and physically. I’m blind and I’m depressed, anxious, angry, scared and just overwhelmed. I got a lot of things on my plate. I’m not graduating this year because of my blindness and mental disorders. I am gonna be placed in a behavioral emotional school/or/residential. Anyone know of any blind people with mental disorders that go to a behavioral/emotional school/or/residential in the United States? Thanks I appreciate it. "
I'm feeling very overwhelmed by my college classes.,"Before the semester started and I was registering classes/planning my schedule, I realized that I could have a schedule where I could have only one class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The catch was five classes on Monday and four on Wednesday. I thought this would be fine at the time, but it has completely blown up in my face. 

Along with the fact that I have a very full schedule two days of the week, I belong to a club, am training for a new job, and my classes are very homework heavy. I was fine for the first few weeks, but something happened last Wednesday (week 5) where I just broke and shut down for the rest of the week. I didn't do any homework that I didn't absolutely have to do, and Sunday night as I was doing all the homework I should've done throughout the week, I felt like I was going to break down crying. I know I should've managed my work better, and I'm usually pretty good at that, but I just feel so exhausted now. I skipped all of my classes today (Monday) except one, because we were doing group work. I woke up for my nine am class and then immediately shut off my alarm and sunk back into bed, I just couldn't find it in myself to wake up. My boyfriend was worried because I had already missed two days of classes because I got my wisdom teeth out, and he knew that my professors are very strict about attendance and I shouldn't be skipping anymore, but luckily he didn't push it because there was no way I was getting out of bed this morning. I slept until noon. 

I have no motivation to go to my one class tomorrow. I have a doctor's appointment before-hand, and going to both just sounds dreadful. I have a mountain of homework I have to do tonight, but I can't handle the thought of doing it. 

I'm so tired and overwhelmed. I don't know how to get back into the groove I was before last Wednesday. I'm behind in a lot of work and am dreading the fact that I have to do stuff tomorrow and have my full day Wednesday.

How do regain my motivation to do things? "
Stress response and reaction,"Hello, people. Recently I've observed my interesting stress responses and how I behave (or don't) in regards to that.
I've been dealing with that lately, maybe you know what's up with that and how to overcome it?
Lately I intended to do certain things or plainly start developing new habits. But whenever time comes to act on that intention, I notice that I get stuck in the mode of ""ughhh, I know I have to do that but I really really want to do something else"" and that urge is strong. Also, during that, stress and tension is present in my body.
I don't understand why, whenever I'm under such stressful reaction, I don't always continue on doing what I intended to but rather change my course of actions and do something instead that's easier or invokes no stress.

How can I overcome it? I don't want to always be steered by my stress responses and being ""paralyzed"" by that. What's up with that and what to do? "
My Mom,"This is like my 2nd post on Reddit. Not too familiar with everything. Have mercy.

I'm 17 in highschool and a friend of mines birthday is coming up. Recently she told me how she felt about me and wanted to a pursue a deeper relationship with me. We've been friends for about 3 years now. I never really saw her as a romantic interest or anything like that, but more of like ""one of the guys"". For this reason, I respectfully declined her and we're both cool about it and still friends. I bought her a hoodie and some makeup, things she's often mentioned that she likes. Thought nothing of it when the packages came, but my mom expressed that she wasn't really of fan of what I did. She said I'm giving my friend the wrong kind of message and that a guy has never done that sort of thing for her. I've tried explaining that it's a birthday gift, not a ""sorry that I shot you down, here's some trinkets to ease the emotional burden"" gift. My mom doesn't understand this though and she makes me feel guilty for what I did. I rarely speak to my mom and see her in general because she's always at work and usually gets home when I am already asleep. I see her on weekends, but when she is home I dread staying with her because she is always ordering me around or picking a fight with me or criticizing how I do things. Ever since middle school I've been developing a toxic relationship with my mother.

TL;DR My mom is super judgemental on everything I do and every decision I make and I can almost never agree with her on anything I dread being around her.

I understand I have a lot going on in this post. 

Regarding my female friend, is what I did wrong and insulting? Am I mocking her somehow by doing this? I'm not a people person so I'm not really sure if this is a dumb question or not. How do I begin mending my relationship with my mother, that is, if there is anything to mend at all? Maybe it's just teenage angst on my part."
Stress relief and general healthy ways of going about your day.,"Over the last few weeks and somewhat months, I have been trapped within a vicious cycle or emotions, stress, anxiety and constant contemplation on life. 
I generally struggle with basic daily functions without being interrupted with life thoughts and panicking about my future. These things are causing my overall health to deteriorate. The following things are being affected by the current situation:
- Lack of appetite.
- Low libido.
- Lack of self-confidence.
- Lack of enthusiasm and energy.
- No longer enjoying the things I love doing.
- Insomnia.
- Constant tiredness.
- General health and bodily functions (e.g. IBS)

The daily struggle has caused me to look into methods of combating and hopefully conquering this. I have thought about going to the gym and improving my health from a fitness standpoint however this is proving troubling due to lack of motivation no matter how much I force myself to go. 

Any suggestions that this community has for relaxation and stress-relief would be great. And if anyone who is having a similar problem currently would like to chat so a communal conclusion can be possible, I'm open for this also.

Corporate world stress,"I (25F) have been working in my current job for about a year and a half. Feels like a lifetime already. Its in the field I’ve studied and worked in for almost 11 years but it’s my first real corporate job and sometimes I feel like it sucks the life out of me. I’m on an accelerated track in management and I’ve been promoted 3 times in my time here. Sounds great, and sometimes it is, but mostly I feel insecure and frazzled bc I find myself in constant states of transition into new roles and new teams. The lack of stability has worn on me overtime. 

The pressure is so high and I feel like I’m under a microscope living up to high expectations from many different people. The money is great and I live very comfortably at this time in my life. Sometimes it is also feels very fulfilling bc I feel important but I really dislike that my self-worth is tied into my success at work and I feel stuck in it because of the money. 

If I left, I don’t know what I’d do with myself or where I’d go. My professional experience is suited for this world. So how would I start over? And with bills and student loans, the thought of leaving and struggling financially gives me so much anxiety. I feel like I’d let a lot of people down and myself for succumbing to the pressure and failing..

Idk if this is the right place to post or what I’m looking for.. I just wake up every morning dreading going to work and am laying in bed restless for what tomorrow brings. I’m so tired, mentally and physically, that on my days off I just lay around trying to stay distracted from it all. Just needed to get this off my chest. I don’t think I’m cut out for this world but I have no idea what I’d do instead. I feel like a pressure cooker of stress just bubbling to the surface over and over. "
Just needed to vent,"So these last few months have been sort of tough for me.  I basically just wanted to vent to get all of this off of my chest before I go insane. 

My little sister was paralyzed in a car accident this summer so we have had to deal with that change. But luckily she has been staying positive so I have been trying too.  She is learning to live with it and so are we.  This was an initial source of depression and anxiety because she is a teenager but I have found that I can’t change things and I can only offer love and support. But it did add stress upon the family mostly from the driver that caused her and her friends to veer from the road and hit a ditch. 

So it basically began when I found out that someone did my taxes wrong so I owe the IRS $300 which isn’t much but it is still annoying when you barely make above minimum wage. My ex roommate infested my old house with roaches before he left. When My fiancé and I moved (it was his friend so that was the only reason he was allowed to stay in the old house) we found out that our desk had been infested since it was next to the roach infested PlayStation he had that began the whole infestation so now the new house is infested. And now I have to pay an exterminator to get rid of them. My mom let us rent this new house from her but didn’t tell us about the numerous problems with the wiring and plumbing so we have found why our washing machine had died and our tub is constantly backed up. And this is after we had to fix the air conditioner that was leaking into our back closet and had been for years until it finally died during the summer right as my husky was giving birth to puppies. I had to pay to get that fixed even though I thought that was something a landlord would fix. My fiancé accidentally ran over my pet cat before Christmas and that was a thing.... I have depression and now I have found out that I have asthma after having an asthma attack for two days that I thought was just a panic attack.  And finally my car has died and I am not sure how to fix it.  

Sorry. It’s just been a rough past year so I am hoping 2019 will start looking better. Any stress relief tips or help or advice in general would be appreciated. "
The Fear of Failing.,"I'm currently studying at the Univerisity of Texas at Dallas for Computer Science and my first semester there, I royally fucked up. I got caught up in drug abuse trying to alleviate my depression; as a result, towards the end of the semester, I dropped from a 3.5ish+ GPA to a 2.4ish+ GPA. I'm hoping to reach out to other students/alumni from any other university who have faced similar obstacles and to hear their story as to how they overcame the adversity.

I don't know what to do to be happy.,"I'm stressed beyond my means and I don't know where to even start trying to find some relief. 

We'll start with my job. I don't dislike the work, really. But, I feel constantly at odds with those around me. I work in an small office of 4-9 people, depending on the time of day. This office is in northern Florida where the good-old-boy mentality and conservative values are the norm. I don't relate to, understand or subscribe to any of this. They generally operate on the standard of one-upping everyone around them, I guess, as a way of being accepted by everyone else. I HATE this. I don't feel the need to compete constantly on a personal level with everyone else. When I do, I feel like I receive even more resistance because I'm somehow a new challenge or something. When I don't, I'm treated like I'm unimportant and inconsequential. Now, I'd be happy to avoid all of this altogether, but there's litterally nowhere to go to get away from it. It's a family business (the boss being my brother, but I won't get into the stress that that creates) so, I feel some responsibility to the company and I make better money than I would working anywhere else as my experience outside of this company is limited to restaurant work. I dread work everyday and constantly think of what I could do to make it more enjoyable or of a way our, but nothing seems realistic. 

Continuing on the theme of my environment, I don't have any friends. My wife is the only person that I can connect with and the only person that seems to want me around. Lately though, I'm constantly depressed and it's taking a toll on her and our relationship. I do a lot of the decision making and re-focusing of our energies away from the negatives onto more productive things and lately I have been having a really hard time doing these things.

I genuinely don't know how to make new friends. I don't drink or enjoy spending time out in loud or crowded places. I'm beyond bored by sports and detest hunting/fishing (these comprise 99% of the popular past-times of the south). I enjoy books and movies, but i rarely find that I like the same books or movies as others and it's almost never for the same reasons. 

Basically, my friendly relationships are with my wifes sisters and their S.O.'s and the only time we get together is when we make a point to go to them. No one wants to come to me. 

I feel extremely alone and overspent. I just want someone to WANT to TALK to me. Someone excited to invite me over. Someone interested in the things that I have to say....

I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm about to snap."
[Academic] Instrumental and Background Music Versus No Music On Stressed And Non-Stressed Participants (Ages 18-60),"Hey guys, if some people can take this survey about stress and music, that would be greatly appreciated!

This research came from my interest in studying while listening to meditation music. It decreases my stress levels and so I am curious if others are affected the same way. Instrumental and Background music has been chosen as what participants in the music condition will be listening to. Stress levels will be tested to see if performance scores are increased when listening to the instrumental and background music. This will enable me to have a clearer understanding of how certain types of music affect mental states allowing us to perform better.

*Please participate in my psychology study for my Advanced Research Methods class as soon as you can as I am looking for 100 participants. It is a quick 10-15 minute survey.*

**Take the survey on a computer if possible with headphones or earphones please.**

But for the stress i have is this....i got really bad credit like under 500 from things i shake my head to like a voluntary repo to things i couldn't pay cause of having no money from switching temp jobs. good thing the debt is under 3000 dollars. my cars i had transmission problems and engine knocks but i been saving but ill have a 2500 down payment like in 3 weeks but i stress no one will take my down payment on a truck since my credit is bombed. also another thing that i stress is my relationship....i recently moved back to KY with my mom from GA and i had i girlfriend there and i miss her a lot and i had to leave her cause i been forced to move to this super small town in KY. i had some much opportunities (bodybuilding and football etc)  in Georgia but i couldn't stay cause i couldn't find a stable job to get a place on my own and stay. i had interviews in GA but i never got a call back and i been with bad temp agencys where they promised me the job but let me go in the end. Im a great worker i never had problems at all. pretty much i need patience but its starting to hurt me every day. what should i do to relax and stay focused?? any feedback i get i will appreciate it a lot.
First interview ever in 8 hours,"I haven't been sleeping much at all and still need to sleep (it is 1 am and the interview is at 9). The interview is to be an hour, all behavioral. I have no experience, nor do I have any prep for this cause they offered me this interview this morning. I still need to think of answers but I am dead tired. The horror of what is to come is eating me alive. Alive but dead. TBD, S. To be dead, soon."

Stress,"In times of stress, I feel like I go in tunnel vision mode and focus on what the stress is (ie. school). It becomes really problematic because I tend to ignore other things and unintentionally affect people in my life and even my well-being.

Help Me,"Hey everyone. So I’m 18 years old and I’m an EMT in Denver, Colorado. I have usually been good at managing my stress (my mom passed away when I was 16), but lately a lot of things have been getting to me. I start college on August 20th, and the fact that my mom isn’t here to see me go to college and see me working as an EMT is really tearing me up. On top of that, the girl I’m with is going to college in Hawaii and I’m absolutely terrified that our potential long distance relationship will collapse. I try to work through it but recently all of this has been weighing heavily on me and I can’t take trying to work through it myself. Would anyone be able to tell me anything about managing stress with long distance relationships, and not having a mom to see you moving forward in life?"
Brain damage related to stress?,"So without going into much detail, about 2 years ago I wound up in a high stress situation I really couldn't get away from. It followed me everywhere. I'm still in it.

At first the stress didn't affect me too much. It was just there in the background. Then one night I thought, ""I can't keep living like this. It's going to start screwing with me."" Sure enough, about 8 months ago I started having memory issues. I also felt like my problem solving/thinking abilities were starting to decline. I really started losing my edge. Now I'm at a point were I wonder if I'll ever be able to get back to normal. I feel completely out of control of my mind. Emotions run wild. Thoughts are scattered and I can't control them. I struggle with any form of discipline. My life is falling apart.

I read that chronic stress can cause brain damage, but I haven't found much on whether or not that's permanent. Does anyone know? And has anyone gotten to this point and been able to return to normal function?

Thanks in advance."
"Stressed, overwhelmed, unmotivated, depressed, you name it","I am struggling through my current semester of school. This is semester 4, and up to this point I had a 3.76. That is sure to drop. One class has been brutally difficult and the teacher doesn't seem to care. So I guess I've stopped caring. But then I get stressed over it more when it's time to do the tests. And my not caring has caused a lack of motivation in my other classes too. I am feeling ill over the stress. I feel like I have so many things to do between school and life that I end up thinking how best to accomplish everything and then end up doing nothing. I'm getting lethargic. I'm single and live alone, so it's hard to force motivation for myself (yes, I'm one who needs to be pushed). The more overwhelmed I become, the more unmotivated, then more stressed. I cannot fix the overwhelming level of school work or inability to get the grades I know I can get in other classes, so how the heck am I supposed to fix the steps that come after?

I'm at a point now where all I do is cry over how bad things have gotten. I'm nearing a breaking point, and I'm not sure what will happen then."

My girlfriend wants to wait..?,"We are both 18 and we have been dating for a year now.  We don't really see each other that much alot , because we live 40 mins away and we didn't not have cars. And our parents dislike each other. But we still make it work and when we do see each other were happy. ( I never go to her house because my mom doesn't allow me). But the main thing is, she's been saying for a while she wants to wait years to have sex, which is perfectly fine. But then just today she says she and her mom talked and she wants to now wait to do anything sexual until she's done with school... I know I can't force her to do things. But it's just alittle stressful keeping that in my head. I do love her.. please don't say "" if you love her then wait!"" Because I feel like it's alittle not fair for me"
Ways to reduce stress from noise?,"I've always been, what I can only describe as, sensitive to noise. The overflow of sound from people's crappy headphones, people watching videos on their phone with the speaker on, whistling, any repetitive speaker sound, tapping of feet, eating with mouth open etc. 

I've had a lot of additional pressure at work lately and it seems to be manifesting itself through an increase sensitive to sound.

My wife watches a lot of videos on her phone, but doesn't like to use headphones, so what are my options? I want to sit with her even if we're not doing the same thing, but it's driving me crazy inside. It's not just home though, I need to deal with it better internally. I find myself clenching my teeth as even the slightest noise starts to grate on me.

Do noise cancelling headphones work? Are there self-help books for this sort of problem?

Just to end on a lighter note, the irony of this is that I love music by the likes of Aphex Twin, Venetian Snares, Animal Collective - which many would describe as noise. And I used to be a kids teacher and that sort of noise doesn't bother me at all.

Well it was therapeutic to write this out, but if anyone has any advice it'd be much appreciated. "

Best ways to manage stress?,"I've become a huge stress monkey.  This is new to me, and to the point where it's negatively impacting my health, intellect, and family life.  It's all work related.  I'm late career and have never been in a work situation this bad.

I know I need to get out (working on it).  Realistically, because of geographic lockdown, (needed) pay grade, etc, it's going to take a good year for me to switch.  I need a way to maintain until I can get out.  A couple of years ago, when it started getting bad, I coped by drinking a lot more and being a couch potato.  But that's bad for me and my family, not working, so I've stopped.

I went on a two week business trip.  I didn't realize how stressed i was from it until I threw up after getting off the plane, and then sleeping 24 hrs straight.  I know this is negatively impacting my performance. Even now when I think about the office tomorrow, my shoulders seize up and I get nauseous.

Completely lacking time to destress,"I'll quickly list some stressors that have created this situation although I can't quite express what I'm asking everyone here. 

1. For the past four years I've usually worked well into the night and worked weekends, and my work hours are so extreme because I have to do other people's work. In my organisation there are many, many people who do not do their job, knock off early, and pass their work to others. 

2. I have completely given up hobbies and interests outside work. I do not have time to engage in them. Things that I could normally do to relax, like exercise or yoga, are absolutely out of the question because I work 16 hours a day. 

3. I am frequently sleep deprived due to my work hours. 

4. I have given up two relationships which broke down largely due to my work hours. 

5. I frequently, like at least weekly, lie awake thinking about how much of my twenties I have given up so that other people can knock off early. 

6. Every time I have tried to directly address this issue I get told this is just the way it is. If you are good at your job you get huge, unreasonable amounts of work. 

I am likely to leave this job in the next 12 months but for now, I need help to just destress and get some sleep without actually having time to do anything relaxing. Thoughts? "
I’m actually not okay with it...,"So I’ve just finished my first year of uni. I stayed in Halls and luckily I’m good friends with 3 of them and we are moving in together. We found a flat and have paid the deposit which is great but the only problem is the room situation.

There’s 4 rooms. A really big one (1), a not so big but quite big one (2), an okay sized one (3) and basically the smallest room (4) which you can fit a double bed in but its more long than wide. There is quite a big cupboard across from it but no one wants the small room. 

We decided to draw fair and square out of hat. I feel it’s important to mention what my flat mates study. I’m a fine art painter, there’s a graphic designer, the other two study forensic science and business. I for one always have the worst luck when it comes to drawing names out of a hat, so for me I had lost all hope of getting a bigger room. 

Right enough I get the smallest room.... it was inevitable. 

The order went (1) - Graphic Designer, (2) - Businessman, (3) - Forensic Scientist And then me (4) - Painter. 

I thought I’d be okay with whatever I got... but I’m honestly not. I dunno if I’m just being plain selfish or if I’m worried about how much room I’ll have to do my work. I’m not gonna lie I felt like either me or the graphic designer actually need the space. The other two need a desk to study but that’s about it, but I also understand that it’s nice to have a big room. As me and the graphic designer are art students we often have more hands on work that sometimes requires more floor space, but the wall can sometimes be used instead. I would have liked to get my easel in my room so I can do some commissions in my spare time but that doesn’t seem likely anymore and I’m a bit disappointed by that. Ill have to work in the kitchen or living room....

Am I just being selfish? But why do I actually feel so bad about getting this room? The flat itself is quite expensive and I think I am the only one who’s parents aren’t paying anything for them. Maybe I just feel like I’m not getting what I’m paying for? Like it’s so much money but I’m stuck in this tiny box room while the rest are freely moving around in theirs? When my name was last I felt my stomach twist and I could have cried. My mind isn’t in a great place right now either so that could just be it. The room might not be as small as I remember it but it still just feel so upset by it...

I’m disappointed in myself for being disappointed in my room. It was all done fairly but yet deep down I feel like it’s unfair to me. Why am I being like this? I’m upset with myself because I’m being so selfish. Why can’t I just be grateful I’ve got somewhere to live for the next year....

Sorry for this long post, I just needed to write out my thoughts and try relieve some stress. "
Poor Stress Response...,"Hello everyone --

I'll try and keep this post short just to get to the main points!

Up until 2001, I was very healthy with no issues at the time, and nothing very stressful going on. I woke up one summer morning feeling totally out of sorts...  It was hot and I couldn't cool down and stop sweating, I felt dizzy, etc...loud noises were easily stimulating.. strong smells were suddenly stimulating.. basically any kind of stressor, even mild, wasn't being handled well by my body.

This has now gone on up until this point. I've done my due diligence and been to multiple doctors and specialists who've done pretty much every test you can think of... psychotherapists to see if it was anything psychological going on....etc.   Nothing has come back abnormal.

Yet, my body overreacts to any kind of stressor or stimulation very erratically. By the time the day is over i'm physically and mentally exhausted!  

I've exercise regularly (which I have to keep moderate as too much is too stressful... ), i eat healthy (tried a multitude of different diets over the years), I meditate.   I've tried every supplement known to man which has zero effect, I've even been open and tried SSRI's when my Dr's had no other answers, but even these seemed to do nothing, only side effects. My mood has always been good surprisingly throughout all of this...

I'm kind of at a loss and wondered if anyone else has experienced anything like this and if you'd had success in treating this?

Thanks in advance!

"stress, expectations & social comparison","I watched today ""Brad’s Status"", a 2017 movie with Ben Stiller, man going through his midlife crisis, troubled by ideas and ruminations related to social status and how he thought he failed in life when he compared with the lives of his old friends from college.

Without trying to spoil you the pleasure of watching this movie, I'd like to stress out how much comparing oneself to others can ruin one's wellness. We seldom if ever compare ourselves with people that fare far worse than us, but usually with people who seem like they succeeded in life: having money, status, fame or a beautiful wife. I do that quite often and that is stressful and it turns away my attention from things that are in my power to change, like small things that better the everyday life.

They say that in this very moment we don't have problems. And there is this Zen saying : *“If the problem has a solution, worrying is pointless, in the end the problem will be solved. If the problem has no solution, there is no reason to worry, because it can’t be solved.”*

I don't wanna be a failure,"A couple years ago in college I failed 2 classes and started taking less classes. I decided my major would be marketing and I'm taking 3 classes, microeconomics and accounting and an online math class. My grades so far are 64, 68, and 75. I can't fail anymore classes, I'm working to the best of my abilities and feel like if I can't handle this how can I manage real life?  All I do is work at a grocery store and have class, other than that I have nothing in my life. There's a part of me that just keeps saying ""run away"" but what the hell would I even do. I barely know how to cook for myself. The only thing keeping me from killing myself now is that I learned in Catholic school that if you kill yourself you end up in hell. I have no dreams, I just don't wanna let my mom down again. She's the only person I actually care about."

Only problem is that I feel extremely guility whenever I have to miss school. Since I was planning to keep my mom's diagnosis private, I haven't spoken to any of my teachers about my recent absences. But I can't shake off the feeling that they see me as lazy/unresponsible for missing class. "
Stress Boiling Over to Family,"I have dealt with a great deal over the last few years, including PTSD and survivors guilt that went undiagnosed and was mistaken for bipolar disorder. It negatively affected my life and family for some time, but after conquering it and getting on track, stress took over. I can't seem to find a coping mechanism, and this morning I broke down, screamed at my wife to leave me alone, and created a horrible situation for everyone. It spooked me. I'm not sure what to do or how to keep myself sane and keep my family happy and content."
Super stress finals week. I just want to go home.,"I have finals week. Finished 1 on Saturday, three more. One today, one tomorrow, one Wednesday. I'm so stressed. My parents just called and they said my dog fainted while running. He's a very hyper 12 year old pug and I love him so much. He fainted for his first time while eating. 
I'm going home Wednesday after my last exam. I'm really worried about him and I just don't want to deal with these exams. 
I also applied for transfer. I only have one more chance of getting into mechanical engineering at my school and so I applied to threw colleges as a plan b. I just received an email saying the the city college (best chance) just withdrawn my application because I didn't complete one course. I don't know if I can get into the other two since they are top ranked UC and I don't know if I can get into mechanical at the college I'm currently in.

A Stressed Student Rant,"So, lately in school (I'm home schooled btw) Things have been really hard. I've been getting hit with projects and essays left and right and my school system I'm taking has set dates and I'm just getting so behind... I act cool around my mom because she has enough to deal with, with my brother but i'm really starting to struggle and I'm starting to sacrifice quality for quantity. I can do each assignment 2 times, but on tests and quizzes i only have one attempt and they are really big portions of my grade. I'm a straight A student with really high A - A+ usual grades when i'm in a good place which makes it even harder for me to do things quickly because I want to do well and if I tell my mom I got a bad grade she'll want me to redo it which would suck up even more time! She's an only parent, my dad left a long time ago, and I have an older brother who goofs off in his studies half the time. I have been caught up in 4 of my easy classes, but the other 2 are my hardest classes which are Language Arts (Large Essay) and Life Science (A Graph Project) I'm getting really stressed and soon i'll have to go to my grandma for her 80th birthday the first to second week of March and I won't be able to do school work over there and It is almost manditory that I get a week or two ahead in my school work for that period of time. I'm really stressed and I don't want my mother to not trust me with my school because I lied saying I was only 2 days behind when I'm now 10 days behind in bother things, bring my daily workload to 33 - 42 assighnments in about 8:30 to 6:50 time wise... 

I'm really lost... I'm 13 and I know that I should consult someone but because I'm home schooled I have no friends. I have no one that would help me, and because my mom always tells everyone in my family how good of a student I am and because of how high my grades are I can't look to them, they all think I'm the smart little cracker that has no cares in the world. I play piano to try to calm myself and it helps me to forget it, but only for about 20-30 minutes...

Help me understand how stress works???,"I just cried a few minutes ago....just laid in the shower and cried. You'll have to forgive me if this post is a little random, but I'm just trying to figure out whats happening....

I don't quite understand how stress works. I've had anxiety for about 8 years now...since I was in highschool...and I've gotten MUCH MUCH better with it, developing and practicing coping mechanisms which have helped me go from barely being able to leave the house to complete everyday tasks, to basically being able to have a full on ""attack"" and sit down, breathe deep for a few minutes and go right back to whatever I was doing just fine.

But lately it feels like I've been very stressed over almost nothing but my anxiety. Personally it feels like on a stress scale of 1-10 where 1 is perfect zen and 10 is heart attack, ""Laying on the shower floor and crying due to stress"" is like a solid 7

Does this mean I'm only a couple steps away from my stress actually causing me serious issues???

The first thing that confuses me is that I don't feel SUPER STRESSED, honestly I was fine all day long today until a couple hours ago, sitting on the couch I got an overwhelming sense of sadness. It came from nowhere and doesn't seem to be attached to anything specific, just, ""congratulations your chest suddenly feels sad now"" (now side note: this feeling has been coming over me for the past couple months almost every day, it feels like I have to cry, but I haven't allowed my body to cry because it feels like I legitimately have NOTHING to cry about, so this time I decided I might as well just give my body what it seems to be asking for?? It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....)

I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works?

Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5? or down to 3? and will it stay that way for a day? or do I not have to worry about these feelings again for another month????

Stressful Semester,"I am currently a high school senior and am dealing with a semester that includes a Gifted University Prep Functions and Relations, University Prep Physics and University Prep Chemistry. The Functions and Physics are what's giving me problems. I had a 95 in my Functions course last year and this year it's down to a 75-ish despite me being much more attentive and engaged in class, and doing hours more homework. Physics is at a 73-ish but the teacher is very tough and I get the impression that this may actually be above the median. Still, most of the university programs I am considering require an average in the mid-80's or higher. I have already deleted all my main social media for productivity's sake and am attending extra help and average of about once a week. Any help would be greatly appreciated, especially if you've been in a similar situation."
Work stress...need relief,"Hey I'm a working adult in the midst of a mental breakdown. I have been working in my current company for almost 2 years. I'm prepared to work ot from the start since the position I'm in usually required to ot in month end. 

But the workload is too overwhelming. When I first joined, they was migrating from myob to sage, mid way migrate from sage to crm and then from crm to some self created system by an outsource co. 

My boss keep stressing that this will make our workload lesser and easier as time goes by. But this 2year have been physically and mentally exhausting, beside changing system 3 times, there are colleague who came and left mid way 3 times. I have to endure workload of 4 to 3 person 3 times for a few month each. 

Furthermore, boss said that industry is changing and they add in new biz function, but you know what, Our current of 4 is reducing to 3 as one of them is going on maternity leave. And our boss dont intend to hire more to assist.

I'm like is it even worth it to continue staying in this company.

To be honest, my current workload is like 2 times worse than previous. And the emails keep piling, I dont even read them anymore unless the person call me. 

This is the sign to leave right ? Ah........................

Malevolent Stress,"Greetings,

This is going to be excessively long, and I understand if no one reads it. My presumption is that I will be looked down upon for these unfortunate truths so I've created a new user ID to tell my story and explain why I'm stressed. I do hope anyone who does sit at home in their most comfortable of places, forgives my selfishness. This action is more for me personally as I feel the need for an outlet of this kind. Again, I'm sorry.

As all unfortunate things begin, it is with devastation of some kind. In 2005 hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and myself and my mother were unable to return home for a few months. Prior to that event I had a job, and my life had promise. Coming back home I was optimistic, but a few days being in the place I grew up quickly turned into a nightmare. Initially I was unable to work because that area was still flooded. Even after returning to work weeks later many of my co-workers did not. Initially I found myself doing the total work of three or four people for pay that wasn't even anywhere close to what I deserved. Surprisingly I kept at it for almost a year, and right I was becoming far too exhausted to continue my work place closed its doors due to less demand for their service. The ever-growing presence of the internet and easy to use phone apps had more or less made them obsolete.

If we fast forward to October 2007 we see that i, your writer, was at that time unemployed. I decided to take a break from it all for just a small amount of time, and towards the middle of that month I started having pains. In my lower back I would have the most excruciating pain, and it felt like it would travel up my spine. For about one to two hours I was immobile. After that the pain would pass. This happened every two weeks with the eventual result being a trip to the emergency room. When I went to the hospital I was told it was due to being obese then shipped off home. Yes I am what you would call a fat guy but that pain just didn't measure up to a fat person's problem. What could I do? At least that is how I felt. Yet again a short time passed and I was in pain once again. This time was different, this time it was horrifying, it felt like all the oxygen in the air around me was somehow gone. Truly I felt like I was suffocating but for whatever reason I tried to get through it. Maybe the doctor was right. I'm not a medical professional by any means. Slowly I learned to breathe regardless of how difficult it felt too. The pain however did not leave as it had before. After one hour I was moving into every position my body could possibly handle in small hope one of them would make me feel better. After a few minutes of that prior action I unexpectedly had to relieve myself. Quickly I move to the appropriate room and I apologize for the imagery, but this liquid is not supposed to be the brown almost black color that it was. Still I was either being arrogant or ignorant or both because I had not left yet for the hospital. Shortly after I had an unquenchable thirst, which was nearly immediately followed by excessive vomiting. Nothing too gross here as it was literally all water. Again the pain got worse. Finally I went to the hospital with my mother. On the way there I vomited more water, and in the waiting area twice more. After being placed in a room it was only after a few minutes that a doctor came in. Less than two minutes from his arrival he left, and less than two minutes later a few people were rushing in with medicinal bags and all other sorts of medical equipment.

It just so happens that I had pancreatitis. Apparently I was more than less close to death. Obviously it was painful, there are no words I can actually use to describe it, but I didn't feel like I was dying. Maybe like someone was dragging nails across my back, slowly tapping one in, and then forcing it down in one stroke with a giant hammer. Again that doesn't do it justice. At any rate I was officially hospitalized. For three weeks I lay immobile in a hospital bed. Every four hours I was allowed dilaudid, at times I was allowed the pain medication every two hours or so. I honestly can't tell you all that what happened while I was in the hospital because I was so heavily medicated that I was usually busy doing just a few things which were mainly being asleep, talking to people who weren't there and not really remembering it, or feeling like I was moving and being someplace I wasn't. Therefore we can skip to the part where I was discharged, met a few doctors a week later, was told I could or could not ever have pancreatitis again, that I should have surgery, and that after that ordeal I just felt like I couldn't and declined.

The night I was discharged I thought i would be fine. I was sent home with a prescription for percocet. When we almost reached our house I started feeling unbearable pain but as it was late we had find a 24 hour Walgreen. My point being that for a few months I was still stuck on pain meds. I became excessively lazy and depressingly had gained more weight. Unfortunately I hit an all-time low. More than a few bills were depleting me, my clothes didn't fit, and I hadn't seen my friends in a long time. Suddenly I became a recluse. Depression, was setting in. A few months of me being physically healthy passed by. I found a little inspiration to get off my butt and start looking for a job. No one was calling back.

In November of 2008 I once again had pancreatitis. So much for that possibility of it never happening again. This time I went to the hospital after less than one hour of suffering with it. To my surprise it was somehow worse than before. At least thats what the doctors told me. During this stay at the hospital I spent exactly one month and two weeks there. I was told I was required to have surgery during that time. The day I had surgery I was brought to a very large room with wide open space, on each side against the wall were beds with some having closed curtains but many left open, the floor was simply concrete, and medical equipment and metal sinks of some kind were at its center. To be perfectly honest I never imagined a room like this would exist in a hospital. It felt like the room was pulled out of my worst nightmare. To this day it still gives me the creeps. After being pushed through this room on a bed I was brought to a much smaller adjoining one. In the middle of this room was a plank of some kind I was expected to lay on and around that were surgeons and nurses. I was promptly explained to what was going to happen, given some type of medicine, and a large breathing mask was attached to my face. I was told to count down from one hundred and at some point I fell unconscious. All that build up is for this. While I was unconscious I was screaming in my own head. The kind of scream that doesn't end, presumably because it didn't require oxygen. I don't know how much time exactly past but I didn't stop until I woke up in that very same room prior with sweat pouring off me. Moving ahead I spent my remaining time in the hospital with a tube inside my abdomen and on the end of that tube was a neat little bag which retained a black liquid we call bile. On the day I was sent home I had a six inch scar where my gallbladder used to reside, but the tube and bag stayed at the hospital. I was discharged on December 23. On December 25 I awoke on Christmas morning with a need to urinate. Before even getting halfway to the bathroom a half gallon of thick clear yellow liquid spilled out on to the floor from below my navel. I forgot to mention I was also cut open vertically from my navel down a few inches. Right back to the hospital I went. Of course I did use the bathroom first though before leaving. Promptly I had to have some type of scan by a radiologist, an anesthesia expert came in and gave me morphine, the radiologist proceeded to remove a few stables from my six inch monster of a scar and then he stuck a tube inside me which sucked out almost three gallons of bile. Now that I think on it I did have a lot of abdominal pain at home. I also had far too much pain then as I wasn't given much morphine. Maybe it also had to do with the fact I am allergic to morphine, which I found out that day. In the hospital I stayed yet again until near the end of January 2009. Up until July of 2009 I had regular doctor visits, regular refills of pain medication, and I almost forgot regular checkups on me and my new friend or old friend if you prefer the bag and tube I had to carry everywhere with me. It's so much worse than I'm writing now but I'm trying to shorten this novel.

Once again I was on the mend. Yes I was still on meds for another two months but my staples were removed and that horrible tube and bag were gone. Unfortunately I gained a bit more weight, an all time low of depression hit, and it was followed by chest tightening stress. After this point I actually became a hermit. I shut myself off from the world because one day in it as per usual was just one fucking day too much. I had been through too much in just a few years, and I literally couldn't take it anymore. So I used alternative means to escape reality. They didn't involve drugs I can promise.

At a point I became poor. I had nothing except a roof over my head. Everything I own was breaking from age. This tablet in fact is my cousin's. In 2012 my mother became sick. I took care of her every day when she came home until she got better. I don't want to explain what happened to her as that was more painful for me than what I went through myself. When my mother got better I shut down again. At that point the stress was so much more prominent than any other feeling. A few times I had awful panic attacks. 

In 2014 after that whole ordeal I woke up one day and decided enough was enough. How much time had just slipped by? Was I really going to live like this? Was I going to let this series of unfortunate events ruin me? I decided to move forward, but no one would hire me. As it so happens I'm very good with technology. Basically I can spend a day with any new tech and have a solid idea of how it works, how to maintain it, use all features, troubleshoot problems, and even repair it. It isn't that big of a deal but apparently many people don't adept to it very quickly. On top of that I'm good at building computers, repairing desktops, and laptops. I had a somewhat marketable skill where I could fix things for people and through word of mouth I was out and about mainly repairing desktops and laptops for money. It wasn't a real job per say, the money was hardly adequate, and I have a strong dislike for strange environments but I was able to pick myself up a little. Still though I had responsibilities to my family, I was all over the place every other day, and I just couldn't get a job. I was stressed no matter what. 

Then my mother got sick again... To this day she still is. My full time job became taking care of her. In the past few weeks she's really made strides. After an infection around her heart, in her blood, and two strokes that woman can walk now. Mind you she can't walk far but it's none the less impressive to me. Unfortunately I'm without a job again, but i don't blame her. Technically I haven't had a real one in almost a decade, but I absolutely need one. I'm in the worst way where I can't even dress for an interview. My old clothes don't fit me, my funds don't exist. I don't know what to do. I don't even remember how to properly find a job. And getting a job I'm happy with? Forget about it. I have to accept a job that doesn't match my intelligence. Yes my mother will get well physically, but mentally she has been recently diagnosed as bipolar. I don't know that it is a life long condition, and if it is why it had not really shown much until recently. Every so often though, she degrades me, excessively. It just adds on to my stress. Today is one of those days. Contrary to my story I've been really active for a while now with daily exercise. I've also changed my diet. I've been trying so hard, but I'm still fat and I have no job. A part of me wants to embrace solitude again. I can't allow it to ever happen again. So everyday now is just a trial. Yet I want release from all the responsibility still. Paying all those damn bills, running errands everyday, being yelled at, trying to find money for clothes so I can show up for an interview, not even knowing ill get a call as I'm apparently radioactive to work places, cooking three meals a day, taking care of my mother... I do it, I don't complain, but it stresses me out. It's just all too much. It's all as listed above and then some. As I've typed on I just found myself unwilling to be thorough and precise in regards to the intricate details because they all pain me so much and make me stressed. At first it felt therapeutic and now it's just painful. So this is where I will leave my word.

How to cope with stress when you are supporting others,"hey all, really need advice here.
I am a forces veteran that is now working for the health service, my career ended after I had a car crash and did damage to my spine. My wife was a victim of child rape/incest and as a result has not of justifiable issues that I try to help with. My only child has autism. My father has a terminal illness and I try to support my mother with this whenever I can.
that's the basics over and done with, I have always had to be there for so many people and I think ive managed it relatively well, but some things are now happening that are little things that I am really having difficulty with. really simple things, like people in work parking in disabled spaces who shouldn't, or people not washing up cups. These are things that I have normally let go, but over the past few weeks they almost fill me with rage.
is there any handy tips to be able to cope with the sheer amount going on? I used to relax by playing video games or painting, but ive recently developed tendonitis in my dominant hand so using a thumbstick/holding a paint brush now hurts.
I was considering yoga maybe"

As of late I feel like I keep making mistakes. I forget to map drives, forget to install certain things that are needed, name a PC wrong you name it I've probably done it. What doesn't help is a few weeks ago we laid off about 15 people in sales and one person in tech so now we're all extra paranoid about getting fired. What makes it even worse is I was told that the one person that was fired from tech; my boss wanted to fire him since April but was ""waiting for the right time""

Im constantly paranoid that I'm next. I've been trying so hard to not screw up which of course makes me screw up more. I feel like I can't do anything right and I'm just getting on my boss's nerves. I don't play on my phone, I take as many support cases as I can, and I'm on the phone all day. In my logical mind, there is no reason to get rid of me but if I continue messing up like I am who knows. I honestly don't know what to do.

maybe god will help,"I have been nonstop hearing about the bills, money, my living situation, food and our cars for the past forever but these last years it just gets worse.

It's been seriously making me want to blow my brains out.
Not to mention, every time I earn money from selling shit I barely have or art I have to use that money for 'the finer things' like clothes or food, stuff that I need to have to survive. I'm never doing anything nice for myself because of it and getting a job is a lot harder with my schooling situation and not to mention it's hard to get a job regardless.

I also am going to be doing the tech (lighting and audio) for our schools improv team every Friday on my own beginning next school year as the girl who usually does it is graduating. There aren't many improv gigs left this year, and I'm starting to realize that there's no way in hell I can do it. I have no idea what I'm doing as in our tech team I do projection and spotlight. I've never done audio or traditional lights. 

Due to my involvement with the improv team, I also help out with tech for my schools Drama Council.

Stress over a dispute few days ago; fear of dealing with a false accusation,"On Monday, on the monday morning rush hour peak train, where it is always extremely packed, i was accused of hitting my backpack against a guy, whom spoke very aggressively against me.

 It was so horrible that I had to ""gently suggest"" that we both approach the station staff.

Within 2 months of being here, I got into a really bad accident and my car was deemed a total loss. I still haven't received the money from my insurance company from the accident for a new car, I've been relying on others for rides. I just found out i owe over $1000 to my school as well as having no car, and no insurance money. My glasses broke during the accident luckily my mom sent me backup. Today those just broke.

He wants to start up a restaurant. You're shitting me.,"Hello anyone, if at all.

First a bit about me, i am 17 year old (soon to be 18) and a senior in high school. Dont know if i'm going to college or army.

Now i currently have some stress and fear of an upcoming restaurant, the one where my father wants to start one. This is going to cost a lot of money, of which we dont have a lot of. And we barely set the basic taste of our own food. Guess what. The only one cooking is me and sometimes my mother who is not into the restaurant idea either.

And the thing is, my father is dead serious about starting this thing and already call for investors, my step sister and aunt who are coming next week.

The reason that my father wants to do this, is so me and my mother will have some sort of income when he is gone (He is old and has a heart disease, short temper too) or jailed or something. Oh and we dont have a definite location to start at. They are looking into getting some leasing area near malls or cities.

As of right now, i dont know how to deal with this issue and the stress and uncertainty is driving me up the wall.

It's too soon and too late to just start a restaurant when he aren't the one cooking. 
And he is telling me how to do this? 
I have college to deal with, he thinks just starting a god damn noodle shop right now is going to help? I might as well go to the army and never have to deal with this shit anymore. God damn that old fool.

Position as manager,"I have posted here once before about my apprehensions about being a manager. The whole situation stresses me out. I am realizing that maybe my personality is not suited to be management. I am more of a low key person who keeps to myself. Not very outspoken when it comes to other people. I am having a very hard time keeping people accountable or reprimanding employees. I get paralyzed with fear essentially. I was great as a normal worker and that is why I was promoted but now that I'm in the role of manager I don't think it is working out. Furthermore, management is trying get me to get into a role with even more responsibility.

Even the thought of stepping down stresses me out even more. The anxiety of what everyone would think gets me down. The thought that I would be a failure for stepping down compounds even more stress. Then there is the fact that I need to make a living to support myself and my fiance.

This is mostly aimed towards work related stress.

I'm the furthest thing from a kiss ass, so I tend to drop emails to supervisors to explain my view and my opinion, which they quickly blow off and pretend they didn't read.  What can I do to stop caring about other workers that don't work as hard as me, yet get paid the same?  What can I do to deal with a temp that just got hired into a position that took me 14 years to reach?  How do I stop caring about how ridiculously moronic the supervisors decisions are, the decisions that I have absolutely no control over?  How can I not dwell on things and people that I have no control over?  It's destroying me, it all gets bottled up... I'm just waiting for the explosion...

Stressed because not stressed,"Stressed = makes me not want to be stressed = me not being stressed = apathy = not getting things done = stressed

A self fulfilling cycle basically."
March 9th is National Panic Day so we made a podcast about it.,"I've dealt with and overcome a lot of stress and panic attacks over the years. One coping skill that's kept me going is being creative. I played music and wrote songs, did portrait paintings of my pets, and now I'm making a podcast with my wife. Each week we choose an obscure holiday to chat about. Of the choices we had this week for a topic, I saw Panic Day, and I knew I wanted to talk about it. I wanted to use the platform of our goofy show to talk about stress management. 
My favorite panic attack tip is to go to your freezer and pull out a piece of ice. Hold it in your hand as long as you can stand it. This grounds you back in the current moment...helps you focus your attention back in the here and now. I learned over many years of panic attacks that mine are triggered by worrying about the future and how to anticipate every possible outcome. Because I can't actually predict the future and prepare for every possible solution, I would just completely shut down and panic. 
At that time in my life, I couldn't work a regular job, hold relationships, etc. I was ashamed and embarrassed by it all. Through counseling, group therapy, and meds, I got my shit together and am on the path to a healthy life. I work a job that doesn't trigger my social anxiety (work nights, cleaning buildings by myself), I married a woman who helped me see myself for who I really am and to not be ashamed, and overcame my agoraphobia and moved across the country with her. The journey is not over but damn it's progress not perfection that counts :)

So, like I said, my creativity has been a friend through thick n thin. If you're interested in our Panic Day topic or if you just wanna kick it with two goofy lesbos, check out the episode:

I Used to Love My Job,"I used to love my job because it was my first entry level position but the last year I keep making mistakes missing small to sometimes serious things. I took a difficult shift initially working 9am-7:30pm on the weekends and 9pm to 7:30am on Monday Tuesday. As time has gone on I keep making stupid mistakes like missing stuff that I shouldn't miss and as I stress more about my job the more mistakes I make. Recently I changed to full graveyard and the new schedule came out, but after talking to my lead about working slightly earlier on the weekends another schedule came out. I assumed like a dumb ass that our previous conversation was good and ignored what was on the schedule just to receive a very pissed off text from him this afternoon asking why I didn't work the new schedule and that my manager doesn't think I'm a team player and that he(my lead) is tired of me. I feel like the only person who is willing to help me out lately is one of my coworkers who has been my mentor since I started. I try and act helpful there, always telling my coworkers I'll do what I can to help them. Working any overtime that is offered to me. I just need to stay here another 6 months to a year to get the experience I need to move onto a new job and finally get out of my entry level position. I don't think I'm going to get fired, but now I'm on my managers radar which means until someone else screws up, I'll be his primary person he watches. I'm taking L-theanine for the anxiety which seems to help, and I want to start hitting the gym but for now I feel exhausted from the stress."
When does it end?,"Ever since the new year it seems that bad things are happening one after the other. They are just piling up and at this point I don't know what to do. Let me put it into perspective. I am in my second to last year of high school and am also in an IB program (point of clarification.) This whole thing started back in November when I got my wisdom teeth removed. The doctors found a small hole in the bone of my lower right mandible. They recommended a doctors visit to get a diagnosis in the new year. 

Shortly after Christmas break ended it was exam week and since these were some of the more important ones for college. My life basically became school and I got no sleep for the few days that we got off to study. Then it was exam week and I was already feeling very stressed. 

In the middle of the week was when things started to go wrong. I had finished my exam and went home to change before going to the doctors, when I saw a letter for me. It was from a camp that I had been attending since I was a little kid. This was my second year applying to become a counselor. I had been rejected the year before but this year was my final chance so I spent my entire last year of camp making myself look like the best leader I could be as well as spending countless hours perfecting my letter of application. They ended up rejecting me by saying that my leadership skills didn't appear strong enough. That really hit hard considering the amount of effort I had put in to become a great leader. I couldn't even be sad about it because I needed to go to my doctors appointment for the hole.  The doctors took a look and they informed me that they thought the hole was a result of cancer that had been growing in my mouth for some time. Thankfully after a reassessment they realised that it wasn't cancer, although I still needed to get surgery just to diagnose what the problem was as well as surgery to fix the problem and finally a root canal to fix the nerves that would be damaged after the procedure. Because of these surgeries my parents had to cancel a school trip to HollyWood that I was going on the week before we were scheduled to leave because of the overlapping dates. 

After the surgeries I started getting really depressed about what had been happening. As a result I had increased difficulty working and my grades dropped from over 85 percent to barely 80 percent, which may not seem bad but for the programs I need it's bad. My parents decided to send me to a school therapist to help me through the situation. I ended up getting diagnosed with extreme ADHD. Because of this I have had to go in for several more session to find my best learning style. As a result I have missed several days of school and fallen farther and farther behind. At this point the school play I coming up which I am doing the lights and audio for and am missing even more school for as well as missing my entire weekend. I feel like I am lifting weights and every time I get close to lifting the bar up somebody comes along and puts more weight on it.

Does anybody have any coping mechanism they would like to share? Anything that you think would help my current situation would be really appreciated."
"School, money, the future","I'm so stressed about all of this. I lie awake at night sometimes, knowing I've got to wake up to worry. I owe my college an incredible amount of money. I don't want anything to happen to my family.
I want to grow up and be a responsible adult. Anxiety and a learning disability kick my ass on a regular basis and I hate it. I want financial security for me and my family; I want to do good in the world. Sometimes I entertain the idea of suicide, but that would leave no one in good shape. I think about packing up and driving off, giving up music and my dreams and my girlfriend. But I can't leave everyone with my baggage. I have impossible dreams of a Baroque standard, and I don't even know if my future is bright. If I leave it all, where will I go? I want to work past my issues but I don't know how to.


I need help."

And my classes are on Monday to Friday. 3 classes on Tuesday and Thursday, 2 classes on Monday, and a 9:00am - 10:00am class on Wednesday and Friday. I work anytime a day between when my last class ends till 11pm, pretty much whenever they tell me to work.

Moving away to college in 4 days,"I move into my dorm Friday and its only 2 hours away from where I live but for the life of me I cant get my mind off the fact that I am no longer a high school student and no longer considered a ""kid"" I used to like the feeling knowing I was gonna leave home and start my life the way I wanted it but now that the day gets closer and closer I really would like nothing more than to sit here in my bedroom that I've been in all my life and play video games with my buddies and not have a worry in the world. Its tough coming to grips with the fact that I am moving into the next chapter of my life and its really making my head hurt. "
A million things going on right now....I'm breaking down.,"I just started a new job about a month ago. The job is extremely stressful and I can't tell if it's this specific job or working itself that freaks me out so much. My dad is unemployed. He's looking for a job. We're 90% sure we will be moving to another location. He got one job offer and it's likely he will take it, but we will have to downsize a lot. I will have to work AND go to school which scares me, considering I can hardly handle one of those on its own. The idea of change really scares me. I feel a bit lost at the moment...I feel like no one really ever wants to talk to me. I feel left out. I've been sick for the past few weeks and nothing seems to be helping. I have all these things going on (and there are others. This isn't even everything). I feel trapped. I'm breaking down, and I have no idea what to do. Someone please help me."
"Stressed, depressed or just life?","Hi 

I'm not really sure if I'm stressed, depressed or if it's just life.

I work at a job I'm not really enjoying, this means I don't do my best work and procrastinate alot leading to working late or at home to catch up. I have trouble stying focussed and small things that goes ""wrong"" in my life seems like giant things in my head. I can't really relax, even when I'm home with my kid and wife.

Any advice on how to get a grip on my life again?

I talk to my wife about it, but I feel like it's getting harder to her to listen to my complains."
I'm upset,"I dont know if this is the place to put this, but whatever

Some background info: I was out of school for two days due to band events. When I got back, I found out we had a book project, quiz, Of Mice and Men analysis papers due, and we learned new material in math. So, I'm sort of trying to pull my shit together. 

I got into an arguement with my parents over letting me skip a day at school due to too much stress and anxiety. They told me no and said some things that hurt in the process. They laughed at me and called me hormonal and then compared me to a good friend of mine that's obsessed with grades and asked me why I wasnmt more like her. 

The icing on the cake was when they pulled the ""you're gifted so you can deal with anything"" card.

I went into my room and cried for about an hour and a half.

Now I'm more stressed out and I feel more inadequate than before I asked and I dont really know what to do from this point in terms of my relationship with my parents and the stress from school."
I'm on the verge of a meltdown.,"Alright, so where to begin?


Okay, we will start with work. I am 20 years old living in scotland and I am currently doig an apprenticeship as a laboratory technician, I was placed in an underemployed lab area where everyone has to do 5 things at the one time including myself which is a complete ball buster as I am learning on the go. My assessor is getting on my back constantly, the college I go to once a week has useless lecturers that know fuck all about teaching people. I have a shit ton of paperwork (that I barely onow how to do) that I have to do or I will get fired. So that is problem 1.


Home. My dad is trying to start up his own business after being let go a year ago and to be fair he is getting places with it and money is still coming into the house. My sister has medical problems with her back that is stressing my mum out and (which is coming back at me)  doctors over here are scared to do anything about due to how young she is.


Life in general. Holy shit I don't have the money or time to sit down and relax and if, god forbid, I do get some time it is immediately interrupted by some other meaningless shite. My car is falling to bits and i owe my dad 3/4 of my next wage due to him buying all the parts and getting it fixed so i practically have no money to do shit all with for example, live without stressing over money.


I am not the kind of guy to burden people with ny problems and have only ever done so once or twice but I am at my lunch break right now and (dumb girl quote incoming) I literally can't even.
I'm just so fucking done. I constantly help all my other friends with their problems and secrets and other drama but right now I just need to vent to people I don't know over the internet and hope to god someone else understands what I mean and can give advice because as the title says, I'm going to meltdown worse than Chernobyl did.


EDIT- TL;DR Please just persevere and read it, I really need the help

Tired of financial stress in America,"This is just a vent post, as I have nobody to talk to that would understand how I feel.  I work full time, pay for my car, and school aswell. Thankful for everything I have, but I am living check to check and still not making enough. I have no money in a savings, or an IRA, and it is because I get paid and have to spend it on my bills, and/or something comes up where I need to spend. I.e my mother needs help with her bills, or my phone breaks and it is a necessity for my everyday life.  I am getting to the point where I dont even think it is worth living anymore. (not suicidal) Im running out of optimism and beginning to think living in America is too expensive and cant afford to go anywhere else on a whim of new hope.
This isnt a post where I want you to feel bad for me, but as I said earlier I dont have anyone to talk to about how I feel that can relate.

What To Do When It All Gets Too Much,
Would you play a mobile game that you win by lowering your heart-rate?,"We are researching whether you would be interested in a stress relief game that challenges you to lower your heart-rate. 

We have developed an algorithm that allows you to measure your heart-rate using your iphone only. 

We combined this with a game wheter you are able to see you actual heart-rate and work to lower it.

Six Strange Ways to Instantly Stop Stress,
"Very very stressed, can't cope","I'm 42, male, and have got VERY stressed lately.
First of all, due to work, the boss setting demands that are unrealistic, my son's behaviour and missing college, and worrying over money.

It's short, I know, but I'm just so stressed out, been this way for almost 3 weeks now."
Overwhelmed By School Finance Stress,"I just found out that I don't have enough financial aid to pay for my first year of college. I have limited time before the end of the first semester and I owe around $9000 (or $14000 if they keep telling me that my dad didn't fill out a Parent Plus Loan, which he did). I don't even know where to start with this issue so what to do afterwards since I obviously won't be able to continue college. I don't know if I can handle it."
Stress everywhere i look and i don't how to relax.,"Normally i try to be a positive person but murphy's law is kicking my butt.

I can break down the biggest stress issues. 

Work- Given most jobs are stressful. But Sometimes i have night shifts and sometimes day shifts. So this really screws with my schedule making it extremely hard to get a goodnight's rest. On top of it my particular job is setting up things before the store opens. I feel if i don't finish in time i will fail (then also customers will badger me for help). Where i used to like to help customers, but now i run at the site of them because they stress me out with there needs for whatever electronic they need. 

Home life: 

This is the big one. Right now i live at home with my boyfriend of 5 years. Everything was going well till he was let go from his job. (basically because they didn't want to train him properly) This put massive stress on both of us. Now we don't have a living income coming in and helping with student loans/bills. He does have another interview with a different agency coming up in the middle of the month but i feel i can't breath easy till he has a job again. 

On top of that tomorrow morning my boyfriend is going in for a surgery for melanoma found on his ear.Which now don't have insurance for since he lost his job.(1 day before the health insurance was in place!) I can only hope that everything will be okay and fear the worst. I don't even want to think of how bad it can get.

But it literally feels like i can't breath sometimes. If i happen to run across something from his previous job it just makes me feel like the floor is taken out from under me. I can't believe how bad i feel. Lately i have even been having a hard time eating which is dangerous i'm only 105lbs and i worry about losing weight (not anorexia just a small female). I am basically force feeding myself till a gag. Even when i sleep i have repeated nightmares of things just going wrong.

God this sounds terrible and i am certainly not lying but i feel like i am going insane. I try keep my mind busy so it doesn't wander to things i shouldn't be worrying about. I have talked to my boyfriend about this and he is very supportive but we are not sure how to fix this nor at this time does he have the time. 

Every time i try to do things that usually help me relax i just get frustrated. Constantly frustrated. I read that getting exercise is good for stress but its extremely hot outside and i don't want to over do it with the heat/lack of eating. 

So i am at a lost of what to do. I don't really even know how to relax anymore since i am always running around to keep our lives afloat.

I do also apologize for the lack of grammar, spelling and overall structure of this wall of text. 

Dear reddit give me some advice."
Secondhand Anxiety and Stress,"I'm not dealing with the brunt of the mental and emotional abuse, but my mom is and has been for years.  She is married to a man who is mentally unstable and could possibly be depressed or bipolar, we're not too sure at this point and we'll never get a real diagnosis because he refuses to accept that anything is possibly wrong with him.

In any case, ever since my younger brother moved out of the house earlier this month (he was really the last thing helping her hold it together, his wife lived there too with her son, and my mom would babysit him and have a distraction with him), my mom has been a mess.  She is now having to deal with her husband on her own, and ends up coming over to my apartment instead.  This whole relationship has gotten worse and worse as the years pass, and he is constantly threatening divorce from my mother, telling her that she's the reason he's unhappy and that everything is her fault.  He's told her that he's going to take the checkbook away, and that he's going to kill her dogs, that he's going to leave her and get an apartment so he can ""finally be happy"".  

I'm very close to my mom and I love her dearly, which is why I am having such a hard time hearing all of this.  I'm sure it's worse as I no longer live there, and I'm sure I don't hear everything that is said to her, but I do know that she is a saint for putting up with it and that what she's asking from him is not much at all.  However, she is not entirely perfect and she knows it.  We've had this discussion before, that maybe she can do things better and she's tried to change.  Nothing works.  We are at the point where we know nothing will ever work because he is a very angry person who will never be pleased.

Problem is that she doesn't have a job and hasn't worked for the last few years, doesn't have much family other than me and my other brother in town, doesn't have ""friends"", doesn't have much money to her name.  He's basically trapped her into this shell of a person she is now and I'm afraid of what could possibly happen if things do take to the next step.  

Does anyone have any advice for me as an adult child dealing with the secondhand stress?  Is there anything she can do to get out of the situation with minimal repercussion?  She feels like she doesn't need to stir the pot or make any sudden, stupid moves, so she's not going to do anything about it right now, which makes it even more frustrating.  "
Any techniques for switching off?,"I'm not sure if it's really 'stress' by definition but I just can't stop thinking at a mile-a-minute. It's like my brain is constantly cycling through a myriad of problems and activities; a task at work, another task at work, my overall career plan, personal development goals, my boxing class, my relationship, what I want to read/watch/do, video games....

It feels like everything in my life is something I'm constantly analyzing and it's really taking it's toll on me. I can't relax anymore and I can't think things through properly because my brain is just so fatigued.

Is this stress? Or a particular type of issue? And how do I just switch off and forget about everything? The only technique that seems effective at the moment is playing Dota (a pretty complex video game). It stops me thinking about anything else, although it's hardly relaxing."

"I'm getting very stressed out about my neighbour, any ideas on how to cope?","I live in an apartment and my neighbour keeps playing music and/or watching tv very loudly with a strong bass speaker system. I've gone and told them about it and asked them to turn it down many times, I've been nice about it, but they don't stop. Now I try to drown out their noise with my own noise, but that doesn't completely block it out. I've tried earplugs and stuff like that, and they don't work, but even if it did, it's not my duty to do that, they shouldn't be making noise like they do.

Early on when I was being polite about it, I explained how it's the bass that goes through the walls, and they let me turn the bass part down to the minimum level on their speakers. Either they changed it back or it automatically reset though because I still hear their noise.

From the hallway you can regularly hear their music and/or tv playing, loudly, but you rarely ever hear from anyone else on the floor.

New Way To Think About Stress That Changes Everything We've Been Taught,
Any one ever feel this?,I know I've been really stressed out the past couple months with anxiety problems and quitting smoke. But i just wanted to know if anyone has ever felt the front of their neck tense. Right under my jaw line and above my adam's apple mostly on the right side but even on the left. it just feels like the whole area is wicked tight. I even get a little feeling near the edges of my mouth. i'm almost 100% is stress because i swear i felt it amplify when i was angry the other night. Still kinda freaky and weird feeling.
My family seems stressed all the time and it makes me stressed and I basically don't want to see or talk to them.,"If there's ever any minor disagreement between us it seems like they use [step 3 of this comic](http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&id=1445#comic).

They visibly show stress, like, if we're doing something and it's not going exactly how they like, they'll breathe loudly or sigh. That happens for very minor things. For example, my dad will be speeding and getting ready to pass a car up ahead, and then that car will turn on its turn signal to turn and then he'll breathe loudly at it because he's slightly inconvenienced and maybe has to change lanes or pass the car later. Or he'll be in the right lane on a red light wanting to turn right, and he'll get mad at the fact that the car in front of him is going straight instead of turning right, so he has to wait like 30 seconds for the light to change.

They show stress at things I do too, I sort of take my time to do some things that don't affect them. I'll plan on buying something, and they'll ask me why I haven't bought it yet, and get mad that I haven't done it yet even though it barely affects them (or me). Alternatively I'll have some task at hand that would make life a little easier, and they'll get mad and stressed over the fact that that task isn't done yet, or they'll get mad or stressed over my approach of accomplishing that task, and it seems like the stress they get out of it outweighs the benefit of the task, which kind of defeats the purpose.

They are very productive and hardworking and have a lot of money and freedom, and me and my sister are pretty successful, I'm not sure why they seem so stressed all the time. I strongly disagree with it but it's not really my issue, it's their choice as far as I know.

I don't think there's really a way forward here, but if you people have any input then I'd like to hear it.

My Stress... Is a Family of Five.,"Hi. I am looking for help, and to be honest, I just want to rant a little. I wonder if there are more out there like me.

I am a 19 year old girl living with my family. I'm getting married next year, and I work part time.

I have been diagnosed with multiple disorders, and physically, I'm dealing with chronic pain and fibromyalgia.

I live with my Mother, Father, Sister, Brother, my sister's service dog, and my baby girl, a kitty named cliff.

Usually my parents work full time. Usually its not this bad. 

But when they're all home, its all I can do not to scream and run off away from the chaos. Its not a new thing, Ive grown up with this stress. But my mom is loud and anxious a lot, the dog gets too excited, and well I'm Sooo excited to move out. 

When everyone is at home I feel like I should be a part of the family and have fun. But I feel overstimulated and so I feel like I end up hiding from my own family.

Its so chaotic, and yet when the house is empty I feel like I need the TV on so I dont feel weird.

Does anyone else have this problem? I know my family is disorganized and messy and I'm usually the house maid. So when I take a day to rest I end up failing in my duties. 

My back hurts like heck. Its all tightened up again due to the stress. Any tips?

Burnt out.,"I've been looking into the psychological phenomena ""burnout"", and have found a lot of definitions and distinctions, as well as preventions and ""warning signs"", but not much in the way of retro-active coping and management.

HAE experienced moderate to severe burnout, and how did you deal with it?  

If interested;
Three years ago this November, I quit drinking after about a 10 year relationship with the bottle.  My son was just born, I decided to go back to school, etc.

A year later, I'm doing great in school and feel I have a tight grasp on the world, so I decide to take more on and help start a living cooperative.  The building we got is huge, so rent/utilities are high and we need to supplement our costs.  Three of my housemates own/operate a coffee shop (which had existed prior to our move) which moved to the main floor of the building, and I renovated the basement for art studios (which I also manage), and curate the art on the walls of the coffee shop.  Keep in mind I'm still in school and raising a now 3 year old boy.

It's great, and I'm still excited and grateful to be in the position I am in, but I have had little help in setting up much of this, and no help setting up enough.  I've written the bylaws, made the studios a non-profit, handle the money/books, supplement the rent for the studios when we don't have enough renters, design/print/distribute fliers for the art shows, etc.

Burnout peaked a couple of weeks ago and I just left town for a week, back to my parents' house and grandparents' farm to get my head together, which mostly worked although now I'm just blase' about everything.  There's a part of me that loves it and wants to do it, but while part of the mind is willing, the rest of the mind along with the body are not.  I just want to sleep and not think about it.  And school starts again on Monday.

How do I reign it all back in and take on bit by bit without throwing it all in the fire?  I'm at a point where I don't know how, and when I try to think about it proactively my mind recoils and kind of freezes up.

Thanks for any input.

Stress reactions,"I wanna tell my struggle and maybe get some advices. When i know i dont understand for example maths i cant tell anyone because i immediately feel stressed af and being stressed connects with crying and enormous headache for me. Everyone says um too sensitive but that is my reaction for stress i cant stop it. When someone says that they are disappointed in me or smh i wanna say something that would shut their mouth but it never happens because i get angry and stressed and cry. No one takes me serious anymore. People sometimes scream at others, curse more and i have to cry and I cant control it. Any advices how not to cry?"

How do I manage to keep up with my tight schedule and not break down?,"I´ve already had problems with stress before this, but I feel like I´m about to completely break down.  
So, my schedule for the next month is this:  


I´m working on a documentation for a project this week that I have to give in on monday  
Next week´s wednesday: I have my driving test reparations (I´ve failed the first time)  
Next week in school: I have to do three tests from maths, I have to do an oral exam from economics, and I´m having a programming test  
In two weeks, I have language part of my finals (I´m in electrical engineering high school)  


I feel like I can´t finish all of this in one go. I have 20 hours of school work, 4 hours for sleep and 1 for a pause during the day. I feel like my head is going to explode, I´m late on everything and honestly I wouldn´t care if a car hit me and put me in coma. I also have ADHD so that makes me work even slower since my focus is basically non-existent.

  
What do I do to not completely destroy myself?"
Stressing over the future,"Today I found out my best friend got into college! I am so excited and happy for her but for some reason her acceptance dropped a huge weight on me. I have not always been the best student and I struggle financially so getting my college applications in was hard for me but I managed to do it! Although still nervous and awaiting an acceptance or decline I had always thought that if I didn’t get in I would go to community college and my best friend was in this boat with me (as she was nervous as well). Now that she has heard back I am in this boat alone. And living in a state where university is the norm after high school and if you don’t go you are looked down on has brought me to question everything. Specifically my future. I always think about my future and I’ve always seen myself doing amazing things but now being the only one of my friends who seems to be left with the road to CC I feel like I am not enough anymore and my successful future is dwindling in my college applications. I’m not exactly sure what I’m trying to say on this but I feel my overarching point is that I have never felt more down on myself about going to a CC because I’ve always thought of it as a viable path. However, now with my friends all taking the road more traveled I feel alone and I feel like I have ruined my future for good and I’m slipping."
There is just too much on my plate to handle :”(,"I’m sorry if this is long and not typed very well, I’m on mobile and just need to get these thoughts out of my head.
The last few months have absolutely killed me (23F) and I see no end in sight. 2 months ago my boyfriend (25M) was in a really bad car accident. He broke the femoral neck of his femur in 2 places, his pelvis in 2 places, his collar bone, and messed up his knee pretty bad. He’s had surgeries to put plates and screws into them but he’s been out of work since and we have no clue when he will go back to work. The timing was absolutely great because we have to move by this Friday, I’ve been working my ass off to save money to move and i only work for dominos. I have all the money to find a place but I’ve been looking the last 2 months and haven’t found anything. I’ve spent $80 so far on application fees that I keep getting denied for. We are now 3 days away from having to move with no place to go to. I’ve exhausted all online, newspaper, and in person places and nothing has worked out. On top of this I’m dealing with a shoplifting charge from 4 years ago that I never took care of. They put me on probation and the amount I have to pay each month is ridiculous, just having to deal with the court and probation appointments have been really stressful and anxiety inducing, it also does not help with my depression. I have a 2 year old and I’m also going to school full time but with everything going on my grades are horrible and I’ve missed way too much school. I’m on financial probation so if I don’t finish out this semester i will lose my financial aid all together and will only be able to return to school if I pay out of pocket. I also have not been able to see my therapist in 5 months because my insurance was randomly cut off, I’ve been trying for months now to get it on, the last time I talked to them they said it should be on and they don’t know why it’s not and to just keep checking back in. I need the insurance to get my son checked out to put him in school because he currently stays with my grandpa who is the only person that can watch him but he’s really old and horribly mean, he constantly yells at him to shut up, calls him an asshole and other names, just for playing with his toys or being a normal 2 year old. This grandpa is the one that physically abused me and my siblings when we were little with constant verbal abuse. I don’t really know why I’m posting, I guess just looking for some support. I’m falling apart and there is just too much on my plate :”( "

I dont even know...,"So. I'ma just hop right into it. Me and my sister have these stupid little arguments a lot. We are constantly nagging at each other for stupid things like for bot saying excuse me to ask them to move or something like that. But then there are other times when it's just a battle to make the other one lose there shit. I'm a pretty emotional kid, but I try to keep my stress and thoughts to myself, but sometimes I just boil over and have a flipping mental breakdown. I'm not very good with analogies, but I'm going to try. So there's one container that is filling up with stress. When that's full there's another container that all of that stuff goes into called an argument. When there's too many arguments, then some of that stuff goes into  a breakdown where I want to... Say things that I shouldn't. Right now I'm full of things I want to say, but I hate that I want to say them, I would hate it if I did say them, but I also hate that I don't say them, so I don't know how I'm supposed to vent on those things. It's just a viscous cycle. Any ideas?

 Our stress and tiredness make us unhappy, impatient and frustrated. Meditation can help us to understand our own mind.  We can learn how to transform our mind from negative to positive, from disturbed to peaceful, from unhappy to happy. As we breathe out we imagine that we are breathing away all disturbing thoughts and distractions in the form of black smokethat vanishes in space. As we breathe in we imagine that we are breathing in all the blessings and inspiration of the holy beings in the form of white light that enters our body and absorbs into our heart.  By training in meditation, we create an inner space and clarity that enables us to control our mind.

Why can i never shut up [vent],"Bit of background: me and my partner have just moved, landlord of old house is being unhelpful and frankly rude with us.

A tad bit stressed/vent,I’ve been working at this fast food restaurant for 3 years now and I’m fed up finally. My family has been telling me for years I need to move on from this place but I didn’t because of the family I made there. Now I feel stuck. Trying to get into school but I’m not sure how without knowing where I’ll be working and how to still make better money than now. I’ve been told I need to treat myself as well but I feel extremely guilty when I do and I’m not sure why. I’m gaining a little bit more weight and I’ve already lost 60 pounds so I’m paranoid I’m going to gain it back. My mind is running a marathon to say the least 
Lost my job denied uneployment. Stressed with trying to find something ASAP,"Sorry for the long post I really need to get this stuff out.

Last month after the holidays I was informed I had been laid off do to budget cuts. I applied to unemployment but only found out yesterday, after a full month of waiting, that I had been denied. 

I'm trying to appeal the case because I have reason to believe that the decision was unjust. The reason they gave for denying me was that I quit a job without getting another job, which ment I didn't have enough required hours. But the job I quit was so I could work at the job I got laid off from. Also prior to this in the same year I worked a third contract job that I have reason to believe the rep did not even look at or account for when processing my case.

Even if I try to appeal, and get approved (honestly I'm not very hopeful after how convoluted the first attempt was) it can take up to another month to go through. 

At this time I have nothing. My rent is paid for this month but I have no idea how I'll pay my bills or get through next month. Even if I get job soon it'll take some time for money to start coming in. 

I just graduated last summer for design. Since being laid off I've been trying to remake my portfolio and begin applying for jobs. I went into shock for 2 weeks and was so depressed I could barley move out of bed. The last 2 weeks I've slowly been working on my portfolio and I'm almost done. Finding out yesterday that I wasnt receiving unemployment was such a shock I made myself sick from crying and again couldn't leave my bed. 

I'm so terrified of all this that I can't think much of anything else. I know I have a few people who care about me and are willing to help as best they can. That I could live with my boyfriends family if needed (there are a few reasons I don't want to live there but most of it boils down to losing my independence and own space). But even then I feel so bad that I can't manage on my own. That so soon after graduating I'm in a finacial mess like this.

I'm trying my best to get my portfolio done but I'm finding it hard to focus with all this weighing on me. Even then I've been keeping an eye open for jobs and I haven't seen very many in my field. Which is concerning as Feburary is usually a major hiring month in my field."
AHHHH Im so frustrated!,"I hate my brain so much.! Why, god. Why did you give me adhd AND autistim. I hate that i cant learn as fast as everyone else. It sucks being the only one who cant improve. I feel stupid and embarrassed. I try so hard and in every class im behind. No , im not going to go back a grade, no i wont receive extra help because im not different. I dont want different treatment. To be coddled. I should be like everyone else. Its unfair! I hate being stupid. I want to succeed and make people proud.  Instead i the failure. It is so easy for everyone. Every time I get asked if i need help i have this mental break down. It makes me sick to need others when its a breeze for others. Ots like they're mocking me. Making fun of me, even thoigh i know they aren't.  Why was i born a mistake?

Mental Health Day,I've been running on fumes for about 2 weeks. Haven't taken any of my medication for 3 weeks. Too busy to even think about taking them. Woke up this morning too weak to go to work. 
this is wrong,"i have multiple medical disorders, like hemaplegic migraine disorder, connective tissue disorder and POTS (please look them up if you dont know what they are) so im very sick a lot of times and i miss school, my school treats m horribly because of it, and its illegal to fail a student when they medically miss school because of their problems, but my school doesnt care, i have 504 setup as well, and they arent following it, in one my classes mainly, she doesnt give me extra time when it says im supposed to have it, and she hardly helps me when i miss a day like my teachers are supposed to, my migraine count has gone up from 1 a week to almost every day and its because of them, its not my fault im missing days when im physically not able to even get out of bed when i feel so bad, they dont understand that and they dont care to do research on why im missing so many days, and please dont comment things like ""they are just doing their job"" because they really arent, they arent failing me EVERYTIME im missing a damn day because they have to do it because its their job, its wrongto do it when have so much going on, and im sure im prolly not the only person in my schothat feels this way"
I'm tired of all this. Someone just tell me what my problem is.," I'm writing to say that I'm tired of all this. I'm tired of being stuck in this mental condition for 4 months, worsening every day. I'm tired of people telling me, ""Go see a therapist"" or ""Just have patience."" I've decided I'm just going to write to show you just how chaotic my mind feels and then you can decide whether you'll be like the rest and tell me generic advice or if you'll actually help me and tell me what in the world my problem is.

I can't think straight. I feel like everything is fog. I kind of feel like my brain is really heavy. Everything feels so disorganised. I feel like I'll never get out of this state; ever. I have so many goals that I need to accomplish. Everything is so irritating. When people say stuff like, ""Remember to do this."" or ""Remember that whenever you do this you need to do this"" It just overwhelms me and makes my brain feel heavy and disorganised. I've tried implementing organisational systems like GTD (A system by David Allen) but it makes it even worse. It's really tough to explain. I have so many thoughts (I think) and I don't even know how to say them or what they actually are. I've been researching for months to find out what's wrong with me. The more I research the more overwhelmed and strange I feel. The way I feel is like any kind of small thing or stress I feel like screaming really loudly or like hitting something really hard. I am not able to see a therapist, so don't mention it it is out of the question.

Last year I really stressed myself out for a 13 year old. I used to wake at 5, clean until around 7, go to school, come back and continue cleaning and working until around 8pm at which I would stop and do my homework other self improvement until 11pm. I would then go to sleep and just repeat every weekday. On weekends I would just keep cleaning and working outside. I never have friends come over or anything like that. I also go to sleep too late and find it hard to go to sleep early.

I feel so depressed all the time and because I feel my brain feels so heavy and disorganised and stuff I can't process what the problem is. I feel like everybody is just like a skeleton and everybody is just going to die and how pointless everything is. I wish I could just view the world the way I used to when I was like 6 or 7 or 8. I used to love everyone and always have a warm feeling and I was always happy.

The closest thing I've found to describing what's happening to me is chronic stress which includes symptoms like feeling overwhelmed, feeling depressed, difficulty concentrating or an inability to do so, rapid disorganized thoughts, feeling helpless, irritability and headaches. I talked to one of my parents about it and they believe it is sleep deprivation/accumulated stress.

Somebody just please help me. I live so sadly, I can't explain it. Somebody please just tell me how to stop this."

i don't eat because of school stress,"I'm currently a sophomore in high school right now, and last semester I got so stressed from my schoolwork that it created an eating problem for me. In freshman year, I was totally fine but last semester it got really hard. I haven't eaten breakfast on a REGULAR basis since fourth grade, so not eating breakfast doesn't affect me. But then the schoolwork hit, and I started skipping lunch to study or finish stuff. Eventually, I got to the point where I wouldn't eat lunch for four out of the five weekdays. Most of my friends think I am anorexic now, but I'm not {im pretty dang happy with my body}, it's just school stress. I also have an unfortunate habit of not eating when I get stressed, so I started eating less and less dinner. Now my friends AND my parents think I'm anorexic which is fcking awful because everyone's treating me really weirdly. You're probably thinking, well that's not possible you can't go without eating. Basically my meals have been reduced to either a snack in the morning or a snack in the afternoon {snack basically equals sliced fruit} or sometimes neither. Instead, it comes out at like eleven at night when i finish my homework. I once ate fourteen oranges at eleven thirty at night while watching netflix after i finished my homework for reference. My new years resolution is to eat at normal times, but because all the above became a habit, i never really feel hungry until it hits late night. This is probably too long and boring for anyone to care, cause we're all just stressed here, but at least i get to vent and put all the shit in words u know. Any advice is great no advice is great too skrt skrt it's time to die"
Work causing me anxiety and hindering sleep?,"So I'm a line cook at a pretty popular, moderately classy restaurant. It's my first job in a kitchen after culinary school and I'm well aware that, having only done it for 6 months, this will probably fade. I don't pretend to know everything, because frankly I'm 100% a novice and an amateur. But I do have a level of confidence in my skills. Anyway, onto the point. This industry is notoriously stressful and hard on the people who make a living from it, especially the ones who do it as a career and not just a job. It puts an enormous amount of strain on you physically, and tenfold emotionally. It's actually quite hard to adequately describe just how much of a beating you take daily. Don't mistake this as me complaining because I love what I do. But the stress has been taking its toll on me of late. I'll get home from work completely exhausted but unable to get comfortable. I'll not be able to sit still as I'll be so incredibly anxious. And when I finally start to drift off, my mind will wander and I'll think of work, of being on the line, getting tickets, and I'll jump in a startle, thinking I'm behind or that I have orders to make. It'll happen continuously, over and over until I finally fall asleep. Have any of you experienced something similar, or know of any ways to deal with it? "

"Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Medical condition? Help!","Just wondering how much of this is in my head, common, etc. I have probably been battling anxiety since I was 15 or so, with flares every few years. As I got older, the gaps got broader, but the effects and power of the lows got worse as well. I've been sitting in a low for a while now and wondering how much of what I am experiencing has been experienced by someone else. 
Here's where I am at:

* Chest Pain, typically left side, sometimes under or in the armpit, sometimes a stab straight middle

* Stomach pain, digestive pain and discomfort. Like I swallowed glass, yet poops themselves are fine

* Headaches, primarily tension - like a belt being tightened nonstop

* Dizziness, but very light, almost like being a bit off-balanced
forgetfulness, sometimes simple things like ""where did I put my glasses"", sometimes more scary things like ""are there marbles in my mouth? Why can't I get words out?!?!"" 

* Muscle pain, all over the place. Primarily my arms and chest, sometimes my thighs as well

* Feeling of weakness

* Tingling in legs

* Almost a shortness of breath, like I am out of breath just sitting on the couch, let alone running up the stairs

* Bounding heartbeat - I can see my pulse sometimes in my arms, in my chest, or in my hands while holding something. When I exert myself, my heart feels like it is going to explode

* Anger, sadness, frustration, helplessness - I classify these as side-effects, because they are happening because of the above
Things like the headaches, stomach pain, ringing in the ears are old - they come and go all the time - but the racing and heavy heartbeats, the breathlessness are all new - and scaring the shit out of me.

Stress Wakes Me Up In The Middle of The Night,"I’m a first year mature college student, with a 1.5 year old son, whose father is the most manipulative, least contributory co-parent I’ve met. My student loans are going to be astronomical (I’m living in Ontario but have to be funded through Alberta because I lived there within twelve months, thanks bureaucracy) so I’m going to be paying back double what I could have. My credit card is in a scary amount of red, although I’m “managing” the payments (read: putting enough on there every month to be considered a payment). My ex owes me not only for child support, but for the thousands of dollars of furniture and home necessities purchased on my credit card when we moved back to Ontario, that he is using in his apartment. My car just decided that braking is a no-go, and now I have to get my son to and from daycare using the terribly outdated transit system (it’s located in the weirdest area that’s a 15 minute drive from my house, but about 45-60 mins bus ride and three transfers, and the only way to make these transfers successfully is through the grace of God). My engine light is on, and my starter works maybe 73% of the time. I have a project and two papers due, which is fine except I’m so busy stressing about money, and my car, and having to take my ex to court that when I sit down to work on them, I stare blankly at the screen trying to do my breathing exercises. I cannot sleep. I cannot get to sleep, and when I finally do, my son wakes up so I tend to him, and then I JUST LAY THERE. Trying to figure it out. How can I manage this, how can I afford that, what is the solution, will I be alright?

I am a senior in undergrad and applying to graduate schools and feel that I’m not good enough to get in. On top of that I have my classes and various stuff for those. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend and parents but no one gets it and I don’t know where to turn next. These feelings have been messing with my relationships and health and if anyone could offer some advice I’d greatly appreciate anything. 
Extremely stressed,"I have never been so stressed. I was on scholarship to play college basketball at a junior college and I blew out my knee before the season started. Rehabbed with optimism for a whole year, only to injure it again. Now my dreams are crushed, i have zero ability to focus on school work (dropped out), and face the fear of injuring my knees again.  I’m so stressed out about my fucking knees that I can’t even live my life.  I never thought an injury would throw me off like this. Now I’m back at home being taken care of by my parents (god bless them) as I prepare for my third knee surgery.  I know my life will get back on track eventually but I am going to have to go through another full year of rehabilitation.  Not to mention I have no job or career ideas. "
I hate my life,"I remember I only had two more months of high school left  and my psycho  special ed teacher  had  bias against me  she called her super attended on me because I did a follow Direction When I stay in my bedroom and I look out at the window and it's past afternoon and it's sunny and beautiful outside, I feel terrible and think shit I gotta do something, it's such a beautiful and perfect day and I'm wasting it, I won't have this gold opportunity forever. Then because I'm feeling guilty I try to go out and do something, but then I'm all alone, start to feel like shit, low self-esteem, nothing really happens or change, and then I think, ""oh well, now I just wanna go home"", and so I go back home, repeat over and over, day after day, and each day hoping that I'll figure out how to break this cycle.Hello I graduate high school a year ago and I was in special education all I can say is a teacher that I had was very very rude and very racist to they have no respect for any white students disabled students and I live in a small neighborhood and they didn't give me support or any advice to help me to continue my education my special ed teacher was an asshole I'm sorry to say this but he was the biggest fuckface ever ever since I graduate in my life has been shit I'm 22 years old and, staying home with my dad and mom and I was in special education for a long time since I was a kid and 6 years being in high school the teachers are very rude and they have no respect at all the very nasty to non-white students I was treated like a fucking animal when I was in special education all we ever did and I'm going to be honest with you all we ever did was second grade reading level and they refused to help me to catch up my grades by the time I graduate high school I was still doing second grade reading books the school that the only care about the athlete I gets so mad when I start to talk about.

Meditation/Relaxation/Focus techniques or apps ?,"Hi everyone, I used to be great at managing stress and cope with work and University duties. But now that I'm in the last phase for my undergrad thesis and working  part time internship (which increased the workload a few weeks ago) now I'm unable to manage with the same ease all my stress and I feel in constant migraine and anxious, which keeps me from working and studying properly which then turns into more stress. It has developed into a gastric ulcer along with some vision problems and sleeping disorders.

If you have some advice or techniques, apps, for relaxing/focusing/meditation I would appreciate the help

Constantly Sick,"So I'm a college student with a part time job at a high end restaurant. College is stressful enough, on top of working in fine dining. I've been throwing up constantly, at least once a day. I can't afford to keep seeing doctor after doctor but the anti nausea meds aren't working. I'm taking 3 a day. I also can't afford to stop working and I'm already done to 4 shifts a week.

I'm so tired of being sick and it's to the detriment of my school work. How does one begin to even handle this? I see a psychiatrist in a few days but what can I do in the meantime?"

I’m stress losing my hair. Help!,"I used to have so much hair that my ponytails would frequently snap and now I’m losing it. It falls out when I wash it, brush it, etc. it’s a sad limpy lifeless bit of hair now.

I’ve been under quite a large amount of stress for the past 2 or 3 years. Would this affect my memory?,"Since about three years ago, a lot of family trouble started. It was stressful to start giving me nightmares and make me quite paranoid. Things have calmed down a little bit, but it’s still quite stressful.

How to avoid stress? My life is crazy,"So here's what's going on:

1) I'm a full-time graduate student teaching a full college course by myself. (45ish work/study hours per week)

2) Because the stipend from the teaching is not enough to pay for really anything, I work in foodservice (35 hours a week)

3) Because I am trying to get into a certain PhD program, I need experience in a particular field, so I have another job (9 hours per week)

4) My bread and butter job, the foodservice job, just became unstable. If it falls through, my goose is cooked, I'm screwed. I don't know what to do. 

&#x200B;

I have time to sleep 5-6 hours per night on a good night. I haven't slept more than 4-5 hours for more than a fortnight because I'm so busy. I really...I don't know what to do. The stress of the sudden job instability is just getting to me in a bad way.

I also have a toxic home life that I'm stuck in while I'm in grad school which also does not help with this. 

Does anyone have any tips for calming TF down and not being so prone to panic-stressing?

I've tried Xanax--it messes with my ability to grad student. I'm also afraid to take other medication because I've heard from other grad students that it makes them foggy, less coherent. 

I don't have time to for a counselor--literally. I need a way to manage this myself. "
How to manage the physical affects of stress?,"Hey r/Stress. So I've come to the conclusion that the symptoms (eye twitching, intense migraines, and dizziness) I'm experiencing are a result of stress, which is a result of me starting school this week without financial aid, and a starting a new job at the same time. Okay, nbd. But how do I get rid of said symptoms? Is there anything I can do? Or do I just ride it out an ""try to not be so stressed""? "
Don't tell me I can.,"This is single-handedly the most stressful time I've been in my whole life. I wasn't planning on writing this, I just randomly got the idea. I guess my mind is so desperately looking for ways not to actually do what it has to do and think about what it really should be thinking about that it got so excited over signing up to reddit, on a random Sunday night, sitting in my best friend's kitchen, listening to Jadal's leader singer blurting about how he is scared of commitment - on replay for the past 4 hours - and reading the notifications I keep getting from a group chat that my friends made to plan an international video call tonight. I was supposed to part of that video, I said yes when they asked me if I can do it. That was last Wednesday, though. I guess you can know your plans and meetings ahead, but you can never anticipate your rendez-vous with a stress or a depression episode. Even if you anticipate it, I don't think it's possible to correctly estimate the intensity, to estimate exactly how you will be feeling. I feel like crap. That's what I have been saying since I woke up today. I feel like crap, inside out, I look even 7 levels worse. * sighs * There is a metaphor about how you'd feel like an audience at your own play, sitting in the front row passively watching your life pass by? But you are not completely passive, you get to actually get affected, deliver emotional reactions such as anger, pain, etc... Yet, it's like you are invisible, or maybe you are trapped inside Sandy's bubble of glass, you try to shout but no voice is coming out. All you can do is cry. Tears have been my answer to "" How are you? "" today, because damn it that is how I am! It hurts. And I don't want to talk about it but I need to talk about but it hurts to talk about it and it hurts even more not to. I tried everything, to distract myself, to change my mood.. I mean, everything that I can. In a better world, I would probably go for a swim. Nothing helps like the sea. They say swimming actually makes you feel better because once you get into the water you get to feel how impossibly broad and boundless the sea is and how small and insignificant your problems are, a drop in the ocean. I've never swum in the ocean though. I live by the Mediterranean, which is good for me because oceans scare me. Sharks scare me. Drowning scares me. Not finishing my thesis scares me. I think that's not what scaring me though, not the thought of not finishing but being stuck. I am stuck and I can't unstuck myself. In a better world, I would have gone for a run. But I don't run, except from my responsibilities. In a better world, I would have gone to the gym, sweated it out, took a cold shower, had a healthy meal and resored my brain chemicals to be at my most productive state and wrote the whole damn thing. In a better world, I would have met my thesis-fellows and went to a fancy library that offers free WiFi, sat in a quiet corner and started working, sipping on our Frappuccinos. In this world, I tried everything in my reach, I moved across the country for this, I moved away from all the stress-promoting things/ people in my life and surrounded myself by the best support system anyone can ask for. There is even a dog in the house who keeps giving me serotonin and oxytocin. But it's not working now is it? Look at me! I am just here sitting, writing lyrics all over my body, ignoring the dozens messages of people checking on me, worrying about me, supporting me, encouraging me.. and I am just like 'nah'. I mean, you can't tell me something I haven't heard before. You can't tell me something I haven't already told myself. And don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for all my friends, and some of my family but it's not working. I feel like that is not what I need to hear. I don't know. But don't tell someone who's drowning "" you are strong, I know you can swim "". I don't know what you should tell them, I don't know what you should tell me but don't tell me I can. Tell me you understand, tell me you get me, tell me you feel my pain or something. Just don't tell me what you learned in the movies and the t.v. shows that should be said in situations like these because that's bullshit. * sighs * On another note, just look at me! I wouldn't write a word for hours, my hand was freezing, my mind was blocked.. but when I decided to write about something else, I couldn't stop :D That's how insane it is. That's how crazy my mind is driving me. You know what is it that I can do? I can write a 5 page academic essay on why I shouldn't finish this damn thesis but I can't write one more sentence on what the findings of the study revealed. So don't tell me I can. Because right now just thinking about it makes me feel sick to my stomach. And I don't know what to do. So, here I am.. just watching, as the song starts again.. "

Uncontrollable Stress Levels,"So I have been working the same sale's job for roughly five years now. I became the general manager last year, but I still sell, only now with roughly 10x the responsibilities added on top of that. 

Roughly every day I get 4-10 texts/E-mails from corporate, can't take a vacation without getting my phone blown up, I have to deal with so many everyday issues, employees leaving and having to hire new workers and then start the entire training process over again. Honestly, it just seems like everyday there is something that goes wrong, but because of my anxiety and stress I have the store in the best place it has been at in years because I have the need to get things done and accomplished or else it will be even worse. 

&#x200B;

The constant stress and anxiety I have is overwhelming. However, a big problem lately that I never had before has been the customers. Unless a regular I enjoy comes in, I dread EVERYONE. Every single new person I talk to when I hear the little bell ring that someone has walked in, I absolutely hate it and don't even want to talk to them. This is probably due to my new added responsibilities that must be done on top of this, but also because I have seen the absolute worst of people over the past 5 years. I have been yelled at, have parent's kids rampage through the store making it look like a mess, very rude people, I have just had it with these people and I can't stand working with most of them. 

&#x200B;

To anyone wondering I work in the fitness industry and run a roughly $800,000 a year store all myself, and I think overall just everything is getting to me. 

&#x200B;

On top of that, the money I make is enough to keep me here. I am only 23 and I am making roughly $60,000 working about 40-50 hours a week. I know I am fortunate for this, I just don't know if I should see a doctor as I see my signs of this getting worse and worse as time progresses. 

&#x200B;

Do I see a Dr.? Do I see out a new job? I am just so unsure what to do because I am so young but my mental health has not been here. I have never really used reddit before, nor have I been here so sorry if this post may go against the norm here or whatever I just really need someone's advice. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR

\>Working in sales 5 years, became general manager a year ago.

\>The new workload is overwhelming on its own, on top of having to deal with customers.

\>Even with the store doing better than ever because of me I cannot stand the stress/anxiety I deal with.

\>I have seen the worst of people possible of my years here. Rude, entitled, arrogant, mean, hurtful.

\>I make roughly 60k working 40-50 hours a week. I am fortunate for this, but it doesn't take away the fact of my mental health failing. The money has kept me here for sure.

\>Do i see a dr.? Do I quit? I would honestly just like some feedback from individuals with similar experiences or whatever you may offer. "
Does anyone clean to feel less stressed?,"I dont belive I can be the only one.

If I feel super stressed Ill clean my house. Sometimes do some crazy ass deep cleaning. I now have a routine everyday I do and if I dont do all the chores I feel stressed. I make my bed, clean the floors, water plants ect. I honestly feel so much better in a clean house then one that is not kept clean. If my beds not made or dishes in the sink, I feel so overwhelmed???

Changing jobs.,"I'm very complicated. 
Have started to plan to change company.

I've been in this company for a year and a half, firstly I used to make (reasonably still do) big bucks and have had a chance to spoil myself many many times. But now my pace of life has drastically changed (married and expecting a baby).

My current position is customer relationship agent (salesman) and for the past 7 months it has brought me nothing but stress, however the company where I am right now is trustworthy and has proved many times that it can be dominating the industry.

The other day, friends from my previous job had an offer at their startup company which has potential to go crazy, but I cant get out of my comfort zone to leave this job, just because the company is not yet fully functional.

Critical me is telling me to wait (for something I dont know) and the other gullible me is just putting me in a lots and lots of stress.

Please give me something, i dont want to discuss it with friends, because well friends are friends outside business."

Stressed about a mistake I made at my job that no one noticed yet.,"I've been at this job for a year now, I'm still not used to all the corporate processes so most of the time I ask for guidance from my boss. Last February, my boss assigned me the task of processing the payments for a publication my team was in charge for since the person in charge of it just resigned.

Last month, we received the billing from agencies we hired for that publication. My boss told me to fill-up a form that should be submitted to Accounting, I attached the billing invoice that was fully signed by the execs and had the form signed by my boss...and just only my boss.

I submitted it to accounting and they processed the payment in behalf of me. The following week, I got another invoice and I did the same thing. My boss then told me that she shouldn't sign it, the COO should sign it, ""All payments should be signed by the COO"" . I was like (O\_O).

Now, I haven't told anybody about it since the payment was already done and processed by Accounting but I'm really stressed that this might come snowballing at me (and my team) after a few months. My only assurance is that the payment was processed and can be backed up because the original invoice was signed by the COO.

Can anyone help?,"I've known friend X for about 15 years, we used to be really close and have many memories up until 5 or so years ago, which is around the time Y got involved. He was doing extremely well in his day job and is pursuing a DJ career also, but his performance is suffering in both arrears due to greif from Y. X has a hearing at work in a few weeks and I've told him that he needs to step up and tell them everything that is going on with Y.

I also get a lot of hassle from Y and I really want him out of life, as does X. Y is controlling, manipulative and aggressive when things don't play out to his own agenda. Example: constant contact on a daily basis; if X doesn't answer his phone Y won't hesitate to spam him with phone calls, text messages or any other form of social media medium. Then the abuse starts, the threats, driving to the bottom of X's street or mine, or driving around looking for us both. Y makes fake accounts on social media to try and get in contact with X. Y has even gone to phone boxes and started calling X's phone. X has tried to block Y several times and even has gone to the extent of paying £600 to cancel his phone contract so that Y cannot phone him. Y insists that he picks X up from work every night without X's consent, and HAS to be there at every one of his DJ gigs, further causing hassle for him at work. If I spend time with X we have to be secretive about it, otherwise Y will become aggressive and once more, start making threats towards us both. X has lost a 2 year relationship because of Y's interference, and struggles to maintain relationships with girls because Y cannot stand him having a relationship with anybody bar himself. Y has begun to dress like X, pressures X into teaching him how to DJ (But when X gets Y a gig he turns it down), and regularly buys X unwanted gifts etc... Then when things go south Y has already saved a list of everything that X owes him back, causing more grief. 

Obviously me and X can't have a friendship that we once had because of Y's influence, we both don't know how to approach anyone because of this as we don't really have the confidence. We both know that the grief has to stop because it is making us both very depressed, and at 22 years old, it's pathetic. Y's backwards approach thinks that voilence will solve everything, hence the verbal abuse and physical threats but both me and X are better than going down that route. 

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? With someone who is obsessed with them? How did you get around it? Can anything be done?

Virtual worry stone,"I developed a virtual worry stone app for Android. I can understand it's maybe trivial to most, but maybe it'll help someone.

When I was a child, I worried and worried. My worrying would build stress and often prevent me from sleeping, hooked on revolving thoughts of ""what if"". My parents assured me, but the worrying would continue. My parents would then give me a small oval-shaped stone. They told me to rub the stone and my worry would disappear. 

I was resilient at first and didn't quite understand. Yet, while rubbing the stone, my mind would drift away from the negative thought toward a mix of more neutral thoughts. Nowadays, fidget cubes and spinners serve similar purposes.

Anyways, I am inspired by my experience as a child and created a virtual worry stone. I thought I would share with r/stress

Secondly, I think it is amazing that you are posting in here to get advice on how you can help your girlfriend- that really shows that you care. I'm not sure whether she knows that you did or not but if she did I'm sure that she would be grateful.

I am mainly using Reddit to add value/provide advice for people experiencing high stress (I am a life coach in training- specialising in stress management) and to help people develop tools to reduce overwhelm so they can have the time and energy to do the things that are important to them! At the moment I am looking to do some short market research interviews to help me with an upcoming programme I am creating on stress management.

Disappointing friends,"I've just realise that some of my friends, they would come to me when they were in bad situations, but never care about my troubles.

Good way to relieve stress?,"I'm currently under a lot of pressure at school. I am in my final year and have applied for a high rankinf unuversity which has been my dream university since I decided to go and study there. The thing is that I've got an conditional offer and that I need a certain mark to get in. At the moment I am 1 point under it and have been studying my ass off. Consequently, I have trouble dealing with eveything and I am at the verge of not getting the mark, so I'm really stressed out which has been leaving its mark on me. Anyone have a few tipps that help lessen it or make it feel as if its lessend?"
Stressed lol,"My mom's got Alzheimer's, my dad's working his was off to support my family, and my sister's in school. I quit my job to become a fulltime caretaker but cannot afford to really survive. As a result I have neglected my health and now have intestinal issues that haven't gotten better in over a month. I went to doctors but even with Medicaid can't afford the tests or prescriptions. My family is in the midst of losing my uncle and I can't expect anyone in my family to help us. Everything costs money. Our physical and mental health is declining and Im getting worried I'm about to be the next loss in the family.  I'm also 21. On top of this my friends mom had knee surgery so I'm also driving their family around having to wake up early and keep up with their schedules. Dont know where to turn - suicide is not even an option lol.  But.  Hopefully I'm not bumming anyone out I just don't have friends that I can talk to and I'm tired of having mental breakdowns in my room by myself so I'm trying to vent here a little bit. Have a good day if you read this,  please. If you can be happy then do it for me. Do it for you. Peace."
How to get my bod to calm down - tips?,"Hey everyone! First post here. I've got a bod that seems semi-permanently caught in fight-or-flight mode and I'm trying to find ways to fix it. Any tips would be welcome. Here, let me give you guys a quick overview of the situation.

It used to be just the breathing, as in feeling like you can't breathe in enough. Hands get sweaty, getting the jitters, you probably know the feeling. That was about six months however, and it's not really improved at all. In fact, it's gotten worse recently. A lot of muscle groups in my upper body (shoulders, chest, right below the rib cage,) are tight or sore, and rubbing them doesn't seem to do much. These past two nights have been a bitch.

I've got some over-the-counter sleeping pills to help relax, but they don't seem to do all that much. I'm trying to do meditation, but that only appears to work on the short term.

To give you an idea of where this stress comes from: I moved countries last year in June and have started my own business. Initially, that meant a lot of new stuff, like getting registered here, sorting out a bank account, squaring everything over with PayPal so I can have a business account and transfer funds to my new account. Then there was getting clients, doing work, trying to find a balance between work and free time. Of course, those things can cause, and in my case have caused, stress. However, I have set limits already and don't bite off more than I can chew anymore. I keep regular office hours, don't work full or even partial weekends or evenings anymore. It's been that way for close to a month now, but the stress symptoms have only escalated.

How can I make it clear to this fuckwad of a body that shit is actually fine? It can calm down now? Oxygen is nice? I'm beginning to forget what it's like to not be stressed and I don't want that. So yeah, any advice is welcome.

Btw, I did get in touch with my doctor's office to get an appointment to get his opinion, but their system has yet to get back to me. In the meantime, I'd love to hear what you guys think.

EDIT: I wanted to thank everyone for their replies! They've been very helpful and I'll be looking into all of the things you've mentioned to some degree or other. The breathing tips are a more immediate help, but exercise is definitely also something I want to get back into."
19 and dying,"I am only 19 year old. I used to be an excellent student who received praise and awards. I have been spending my day and night attending tuition classes, music classes and stuffs and I am really thankful for having supportive parents who financially supported me all the way.However, recently I feel I cannot take it anymore. My hair sheds like leaves, my face turns pale and yellowish and I have terrible acne.My head aches.My muscles aches and I have terrible craving but I don't feel hungry after all.Last night, I felt that my heart was pumping so weak and I WAS DYING.I am so damn tired every day.I am just 19 and I dont mind to let go to be healthy,please give me mental support and thank you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!God bless you<3"
How can I help someone to de-stress,"In the last two weeks my mother has come to my house stressed by work issues (pressure from the boss) and says that sometimes not being able to do something they ask makes her feel stupid and stressed, from personal experience my mom is a bit more suseptible than the average of people with respect to what others think of her, so I think she try too hard to do everything perfect and fast, also she says that in the office people care about the visual aspect and always try to be arranged as best as possible because of that too.

So far I have tried to listen to her problems so that she feel released, but what advice can you give me to help her more?

Sorry if my english is not perfect."
Stress Management journey: reflecting,"It is hard to believe how stress and anxiety can affect your life.

Really stressful day tomorrow and can’t calm down,"I have a really stressful day tomorrow that I know (from past experience) is going to be absolutely terrible. It is an intense, awful day and throughout my instructor will be pretty much telling me how awful everything I’m doing is all day.

Losing net neutrality is driving me up a wall with anger and paranoia.,"You all know the story. Ajit Pai and his corporate masters hated Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality was repealed because there were more Corporate whores than actual Americans in the FCC.

The idea of what ISPs can do once the lack rules are truly active have made me feel sick to my stomach. I can't sleep and it is affecting my school life. I can't afford to pay ransom to the Corporate Fascist Thugs who wish to cableize the internet and I can't stand the idea of the internet becoming like that of China and North Korea. 

We are still fighting, but I'm still paranoid and every day that gets closer to April 23rd makes me feel more infuriated and panicky.  

I feel under attack and very life about to be destroyed. "
I did something stupid...Again.,I forgot read the bill. The bill is now a week late. I don't know how much I'm going to have to pay now and I can't stop thinking about it. I wished that I wasn't such a damn airhead when it comes to the real important things. I feel like I'm on the verge of a mental break down with everything that's been going on in the past 5 months. 
"Good coping mechanisms that don't cost too much time, money or energy?","I used to get heavy on the binge watching and I seriously miss having that option to escape, but I didn't really have any time for that in the last few years and didn't have my pet with me either since I'm studying and moving around. I need to know how to deal with large amounts of work, the occassional health issues and money problems that are seriously holding me back without wasting too much time."
Stress hunger?,"I have stress in my life. Called my job, which i am fed up with. I work for 7 years already and the only reason i am there is because they pay Very Well. Due to this i think i want to eat all the time. Always want some snacks. How do i control my eating? I always crave for salt and sugar. "
"I'm constantly sleep deprived and my doctor just diagnosed me as obese, what step should I take to start losing weight?",
Social Media is stressing me out.,"I'm trying to find a way to use social media and not lose my mind. And it's going pretty well, I just want to type out my ways of media here on this post to relieve some stress. 

So I have this motive that Facebook can be used as the Headquarters for all platforms. And what I do is I just keep it as simple as possible. I will only use one platform a day. (Today is reddit) and I only use that platform to clear my head with thoughts. It turns out to be really beneficial to relieve stress.. I guess just talking to someone in general is a great way to feel good. And also to hear or see your own words for some reason helps me to relax about that thought. 

So I just go throughout my day using one app to talk / type to the camera. It's like truly sharing what's on your mind for once. I don't have to force content on the platforms. 

But what has me stressed now is where I should put all this content or if I should just keep it as simple as possible and just keep the Headquarters and keep alternating. You also have to keep track of all these passwords and just need to become familiar with so many different applications. Even though they are pretty similar, they just all have their different uses and advantages. 

I've tried to quit social media before and I loved it. I hate social media man. I don't want a smart phone. I wish I didn't need to do any of this. But it's hard to ignore the opportunities to grow on these platforms and use them as a tool for success. If you can be truly successful with social media/ marketing/ branding yourself, the sky is the limit and that's something I can't ignore. 

So i'm going to just try and keep it simple, alternate and just have a presence on each platform and just stay consistent with it. Give it a few weeks and we will see. 

But I've come to find things I like about social media as well. I enjoy making the videos. It really does help, especially when I haven't said much to anyone all day. It's like you always have someone to talk to with a smart phone. "
Worst Month. (longish),"I'd like to submit this March as my personal Worst Month Ever. I barely remember what the first half of the month was (thinking back now, I don't recall anything except my birthday. And having to work that day.) 

Later this month I went out of state (borrowing money from my mother) for a business competition. I want to start an animal rescue. I didn't get any of the templates or tabletop info until an hour until I had to get on a plane. I lost to a group that is selling potted plants. 

I have been struggling with finances recently, but was getting back on track. From this Wednesday until Saturday, someone had gotten ahold of my debit card info and started with small purchases. It escalated Saturday/Sunday to wipe out my whole paycheck. My bank didn't notify me at all, though a lot of the transactions happened outside the country. I currently have about $8 to my name from my savings, which has since been overdrawn. 

I have been looking for a new job, staying at this one because I have a good boss and because it pays above minimum wage. People effortlessly walk all over her, and though she gets mad about it, company policy as well as her personal precedence, has really tied her hands. I'm one of about three reliable people, and get saddled with the shifts no one bothers to show up to. A coworker gets three weeks off for a class, without asking. He just told her he'll be out those weeks, and it happened. What. 

As a side note, I am trying to move out. Been postponing it due to school. Had to talk to landlady because I won't be able to pay rent on time due to my money being in Germany. My hands and feet are dry. My legs are scratchy because I've forgotten to shave.

I feel myself heading towards the edge of..something. I had a breakdown/major depressive episode when I was 17, spending a whole summer watching x files, going to the doctor every week. I lost 20 pounds. One of the worst times of my life. I know a lot of my issues aren't immediately rectifiable, but that knowledge isn't stopping the stress. 
Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for the vent."
Finding the source of my stress,"In the last few days or maybe even weeks I have been very stressed.

I always have been a nail-biter but at the moment my nails are so far gone my fingers started to bleed and I even started biting the skin above my nails a little. I also seem to have developed some eczema on my hands.

The thing is I don't know exactly where my stress is coming from. Nothing really changed in the past few weeks. My wife and I had some things that caused stress, like a remodeling project in our home and when her grandmother died.

But those things are in the past now and I expected to feel better and less stressed, but somehow it seems worse now.

I haven't meditated in a long time, so I'm thinking about giving that a try. But I don't really know what else I should do. Is there an effective way to find out where the stress is coming from?

I even feel bad for being stressed, because from the outside it seems everything should be great. Good job, nice house, wife, cat and dog etc. On paper my life is pretty great.."

Stressed and depressed.(long),"Hello everyone,
I would like to thank you in advance if you make it through this whole post and give me advice.


Let me start by saying I know I am incredibly blessed and fortunate with everything I have, but I am completely miserable. Let me explain my situation.


I am a 28 year old male living in the eastern United States. I am married, I have an 8 year old son from a previous relationship and my wife and I have a son due in July. I work as a merchandising manager for a well know and very successful retailer that has locations world wide. I make just a hair over $70k (salary) a year with no college degree. My wife works in the same industry, but she is an hourly employee and makes about $40k per year. We own a home, but the house is in her name only (We bought it before we got married) due to past financial difficulties for me that resulted in bankruptcy and losing my first home with my ex.


I make good money for never going to college and I have outstanding benefits, but I hate my job with a burning passion. I hate everything about retail... The hours, working with the general public and the fact that I feel unaccomplished because I basically work in a grocery store and I’m almost 30. Although I am a Manager and a leader I feel like in the grand scheme of life I’m not contributing to the world like I would like to. I hate having to throw away thousands of dollars worth of expired food every day. I hate dealing with employees who work a 4 hour shift stocking shelves or working a cash register and act like they have the hardest job in the world. I hate how retailers grossly under hire and expect their salaried employees to work 12+ hours a day 6 or 7 days a week to make up for it.


My work life balance is absolute zero. Here is an example of my typical day and week.
I am a merchandising Manager which means I work early in the morning to reset the store, restock the store and work in new merchandise. I am personally responsible for a staff of 4 in my department, but being a manager I have to authority to delegate to any employee below me in the building. My secondary responsibilities every day after the floor is set and the store is open are scheduling, making maps or planograms for new items expected to come in, making reports on shrink and destroys, employee reviews, employee discipline as necessary, talking with upset or angry customers, answering general phone calls, scheduling service or repair for anything in my department that is not working, ordering supplies, inventory of my department, planing and executing a weekly cleaning schedule for the department, building displays for new items, reading and answering company emails, walk the store with the GM and make notes for things to accomplish the next day, making benchmark reports, following up with employees not meeting benchmarks and generally helping to run the store (Cashier if the Front is busy, help customers load heavy items.. etc..). Due to budget cuts and staff reduction all managers usually work 6 days a week, however during a holiday week or if something else is going on (expecting executives to visit) we work 7 days a week. I wake up at 2am and I need to be at work by 3am. I will arrive with at least one other manager and we will look at what we are going to receive that particular day and come up with a plan for the store. Hourly employees start arriving at 4am and then myself and the other managers will delegate the days plan to the employees. We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items, recover the floor and excute the GM’s planned item moves for the day, so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I don’t mind physical labor and hard work, it’s actually my favorite part of my job, but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks, but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so it’s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours, or helping out in the deli and/or bakery. Some days I’m lucky enough to get a lot of time in the office to complete my daily tasks, but most days I do not. This is exhausting and draining because while I’m getting literally screamed at about an email not being answered immediately, I am also getting screamed at about why the bakery is low on product even though I'm not the bakery manager and I’m just trying to help us run smoothly. The expectations of my boss and my company as a whole are ridiculous. I am one person and I can only accomplish one task at a time. I can’t write a schedule while I’m expected to be baking cakes for hours after we open. I also need to mention the fact that as a salaried employee we do not get breaks. If you want to eat something you better do it while you’re working and pray you don’t get called to help somewhere because you need to respond immediately. Working over 12 hours without getting 15 minutes guaranteed to eat something really sucks.


I leave work most days at 2:45pm (salary) because I pick up my son from school at 3:15. Usually when I am checking out with my GM for the day it turns into an argument about how I’m not allowed to leave because I haven’t gotten a single administrative task done that day or I have answered all my emails ( yeah because I’ve been on a cash register for the last 5 hours straight.), but I need to get my kid so I leave. If my wife has off and can get my son from school I usually don’t get out of work until 5pm give or take an hour depending on how much I need to get done that particular day. On the days when I get my son I leave work and usually need to speed to get to the school on time because the 5 minute arguement about me leaving has made me late. I pick him up and take him home. My wife actually closes on the days that she works so on days when I get my son I have zero help. When we get home I’ll grab him a quick snack and then we take the dog for a walk. After we get back from walking the dog I will start making dinner ( I absolutely love cooking and I enjoy making a real homemade meal, even though I’m exhausted at this point and it’s draining). While I’m cooking my son will usually start homework. After we eat dinner I will check his homework and I will have him help me clean. Time to take the dog for another walk and then my son will get a shower or bath depending on his mood that day. After his shower we usually have about 45 minutes to finally relax and we will watch a show or draw together or play. His mother comes to pick him up when she is done work.
It is now about 7:30pm and I have been up since 2am and I need to be back up for work in 6.5 hours. Remember how I argued with my boss earlier about leaving before everything was done, well it still needs to get done. I will work from home making reports, doing schedules, sending emails and making maps. Usually getting everything done takes me until about the time my wife gets home (a little before 10pm). When she come she comes home I usually say hello, give her a kiss and pass out because now I need to be up to do this all over again in 4 hours. Twice a week when my wife is off this routine is a little easier. She picks up my son, so I stay at work until about 5pm getting everything done. She will make dinner on her days off so on these days I get to come home, eat, help my son with homework and then go right to bed when his mother picks him up.


Since I work retail weekends are an absolute must to work. I have my son every other weekend so on the weekends I have him I barely actually have him. Since my wife and I both work I will leave him with his mother and pick him up when I get home usually on the weekend around 4-5pm. My wife gets home around 7pm on the weekends and I’m usually asleep on the couch by 8. My wife drops him back off to his mom the next morning on her way to work and repeat. On my weekends without him I usually come home and pass out trying to make up for getting 4 hours of sleep a night since my last weekend without him. I feel terrible because we never do anything fun. We never go to the zoo or go to the movies because it’s usually too late and I’m too drained by the time I pick him up.
Needless to say this lifestyle is absolutely killing me. I am miserable. I have zero friends, I see my wife a few hours a week because of our opposite schedules and I’m drained. Getting 4 hours of sleep a night is becoming ridiculous. I have zero life. I have no hobbies because I have no time. I have gone stretches of 30 days+ without a day off and if you look at what I make compared to the hours I put in then I’m barely making minimum wage. I feel like I lost who I am and I can’t sustain this lifestyle. The turnover for managers is huge because of the work life balance and it’s not like the company is trying to hide it. They are very upfront about the fact that when you accept a management position your job becomes your life. I have been a manager for 7 years and I just can’t take it anymore.


My dream is to get a job outside of retail, but I have no idea how to achieve this dream for several reasons.

I don’t have a degree and I have absolutely zero time to persue one. Even if I took classes for something online I am only getting 4 hours a night of sleep to begin with.

Child support. I pay my ex a little over $900 a month in support and that’s after my lawyer got it lowered from $1100 a month. The way my state works I can’t take a job with a lower salary to start fresh somewhere else because I would still be required to pay the same amount. In my states eyes if you can make that much before than you can make it after. I’ve talked to a few lawyer and there’s is no way around this without my ex agreeing to take less (Haha yeah right.).

The house. Unfortunately (and fortunately) our town has kind of turned into the place to be. Lots of new restaurants and shops has made the area desirable. Our property taxes have nearly doubled since we bought the house 3 years ago and we are barely getting by.

The new baby. Although we are both very excited we have no idea what we are going to do when the baby is born. We are already struggling financially as it is and now we need to pay for infant daycare which costs $830 a month and that’s the cheapest we have found. We have nowhere near that. Not to mention the fact that we both work weekends and daycares are not open on weekends. We have no family within 50 miles that can help us out with the baby on the weekend and my ex definitely wouldn’t help us even if we paid her. We honestly have no clue what to do about this.


So what would you do if you were in my shoes. The obvious answer is suck it up, but ive been sucking it up for years. I quite literally hate my life right now.  I’ve been on depression medication for a year now and the stress is killing me. How can I get through this."
"Feeling emotionally fine, but my throat hurts the same way it does when I get upset or angery.","Seems to get better after doing relaxing things like cleaning or showering. Any advice on how to be more relaxed while working though? (preferably things that dont take alot of time)


Or is there any chance that this is from starting to take a liquid iron supplement recently? I'm also sitting a lot at my desk while working on my computer, writing or drawing, so maybe posture playes a role...? "
"Just Plain Out, Stressed Out!","So, here I am. I feel like I am on the verge of cracking up. My family and I are under a great amount of stress. It first started out with my wife's relationship with her parents. You see, we live just back through the woods, behind her parents' home. When we bought the house six years ago, I never thought of that as being a problem. In fact, it really hasn't been much of a problem for me, but it has been more of an issue for my wife. 

The biggest issue I've had is that if something breaks or needs attention to on the house, instead of allowing me, the man of the house, to find some time to get things done, my wife calls her dad. Now, I don't mind whatsoever if her dad helps me out with the house. In fact, I do often call upon his help for things that I either don't know how to do, or don't have the tools to do them. But, often, I'm kind of an afterthought when it comes to being the master of my domain. 

Anyway, that's not the point of this post. The point is, my wife is often going toe to toe with her mom, because of our son. He was born three years ago, premature. He was born with heart failure and needed open heart surgery to survive - which he did of course. But during the four months that our son was in the hospital, and even afterward, my mother-in-law got so attached to taking care of our son, that in her mind, she felt like she was raising him along with us. So, my wife and her mom tends to butt heads often when it comes to parenting techniques. Because of this, my wife and her parents have all had to go to counseling. 

So, part of my stress has come from the relationship my wife has had with her mother. I often come home to hear them going at it with each other on the phone. Last Father's Day - the day that should be ""MY"" day, they started arguing about something that I had no idea what they were arguing about, and then my wife snapped at me and we didn't talk for the rest of the day. Pretty much ruined my Father's Day. Now, it's not all bad with her mom. They do get along as well, but just the way they communicate, especially in front of our son, often stresses me out and gives me a great deal of anxiety.

The biggest point of my stress has come from our finances. Ever since we've gotten married, we have struggled. Money issues is a huge thing to me. Some people are OK as long as they are left with $10 in the account at the end of the month. That stresses me out. We're often living without a net under us, and every year for the past three or four years, my wife has been in the hospital or emergency room. Either because she got really sick, kidney stones, gallbladder, or something. Not blaming any of that stuff on her, but we never, ever seem to get ourselves to a point where we can start putting money back for emergencies, and that stresses me out a lot!

So this year, part of the ""healing"" between my wife and her family is for us to move away from each other. Not too far away, just to get out of the same neighborhood. We need our space, her parents need theirs. I'm not against that, and in fact, selling our home (since we have built up a good amount of equity), would help us to wipe out all of our debt and re-start with a clean slate. And that would really help my stress out!

But, right now, I'm stressing over finding money to get our house up to show ready and in the meantime, our dog has gotten sick and we've had to take her to the vet, yesterday. She's in a lot pain (yeast infection in box ears, an infection on her foot), and that has stressed me out. We've had issues trying to train our son to sleep in his own bed by himself at night - another stressor. And back to finances, we have a lot of medical bills and credit card bills, and my wife keeps talking about wanting to send our son to private school when he's ready to go to school.

All of it seems to be crashing down on me, and I feel like I need to unplug and take a time out. I always equate this to some sports analogy. The flow of the game is not the flow I'm wanting us to have, so I feel like we need to take a time out and regroup. Also doesn't help that our weather has been nasty the last few weeks. Cold, raining, dreary. I don't do well in weather like that. I have been in such a bad mood lately that I can't even stand myself. I don't sleep well. Our doggy hasn't slept well in the last week. My wife doesn't sleep well. My son doesn't sleep well! I need a vacation but can't afford it! LOL!

I think this was, if anything, a rant thread. So, I apology for taking up anybody's time, I just needed an outlet!

"
Stress from full work weeks; how to manage properly,"Hey there, this is partially a rant but mostly I would want to know how to deal with this stress with my full work week.

So I basically have a lot of things going on for me right now. I have to take care of my family and my chronically sick sister. They are pretty much counting on me. My boyfriend just recently moved in with me and is trying to figure out how to pay rent in expensive San Francisco (currently unemployed but doing small side jobs on the side while looking for a job). 

In order to take care of these issues, I have to get up around 6AM everyday to get to a government job that last about 8AM-4PM every weekday. Then afterwards I have a self employed job in order to make the extra needed to help my family get out of their debts and make ends meet. So usually this means 5:30-9PM I am at my other office doing work. Approx 10PM-11PM I get home and sleep within the hour. 

I literally take 1hr to drive to my government work, 1hr to get to my after-work work office, and at least another 25-30min to get back home (in a triangular fashion in this traffic laden place). I get home and barely get to see my boyfriend before I pass out.

Weekends I tend to have to go 40 minutes away to my father's house to take care of him, and I try to do my socializing and studying (to get ahead in life) during this time. 

This obviously makes it very hectic and difficult to have to do everyday. Sometimes I get overwhelmed despite as much energy and enthusiasm I am trying to put into this. I do get headaches and fatigue a lot going through the weeks like this, and I notice some white hair too. I think it might be affecting my health =/

So my question is, whats the best way to handle stress during the day? Whats the best way to make use of the limited time I have before sleep so I can have the best sleep possible? Also waking up is a huge issue for me because I am not looking forward to another day like the others being so exhaustive, whats a good method to keep it up?

**TLDR:** 
Schedule has 2.5hrs of driving time everyday
6AM get up
8AM-4PM Work
5:30/6-9PM Self Employed work
10/11PM - Sleep
Weekends: Help family and study.

Orientation day at University and already feeling like shit,"I had to take this English test at orientation day which was 30 minutes and tested you on basic English skills. I guess I did poorly in it since I'm being called back for a 2 hour test. I know I'm not that proficient at English but I feel horrible that I might be really weak at it now. I am an immigrant but I moved here when I was 5 and I've been fine with English ever since. I hate that if I do poorly in this test and am required to do a special course, I'll feel super stupid. There's no way you can revise for the test either. I just want to cry."
Stressed about job,"Im new here to this subreddit. Currently working as an engineer. 1st 3 months was pretty enjoying as I am learning stuff and working at my own pace and I could see my own growth. But as when the 4th month starts, I am directly involved in a project where I am in charge of a significant part. Dealing with my team leader is super stressful as I am slow in learning things and I tend to take more time to understand and pick up stuff because he is impatient.  I lost alot of weight last month and was really exhausted mentally and physically. As of now, I am still stressed when he comes around as if more troubles is coming to me. I am also stressed on myself due to not being competent enough to fit in the team as my team consists of excellent engineers and I am the only newbie there .How should I relieve myself from all these stress?"
"I'm new here, and I admit that this is a vent.","I have a long list of chronic stressors, and there are days I get discouraged to the point where I don't think things will ever get better.  I keep a running list called ""the plate"" (as in, too much on my . . .) and it's a page and a half long.  

I have a number of chronic health issues (before you ask, yes, I have been to doctors):  back pain, possible adrenal fatigue, a skin rash that doctors can't figure out, a chronically painful bladder, TMJ, sleep apnea (for which I use a CPAP), and I'm sure I'm leaving out something.  Mentally, I deal with depression and OCD (and I take my meds faithfully and am in therapy for it.)  

My mother died of dementia in early November.  (My dad died back in 1993 of ALS.)

My husband and I have one child who just turned 19.  He has high-functioning autism.  Although he can take care of himself pretty well, he'll never be able to live without some sort of supervision.  Dealing with his issues day in, day out can be very frustrating at times.  

Past events, such as bullying and being part of an unhealthy church in college, affect me as well (part of the reason I'm in counseling).  

We are also dealing with financial problems.  I went back to school several years ago hoping to get training for a job that would earn enough money to keep my son from having to rely on a safety net that may or may not be there for him when he needs it.  That backfired and I was not able to finish school.  I'm paying back student loans now by at-home proofreading.  It's going to take a number of years to do it.  We're also paying down credit card debt as well, and in the last two months, we've been hit with two unexpected expenses (repairs on our crawlspace and a new washer).  My husband's working a bunch of overtime to earn the money to pay for it.  

There's also the day-to-day stuff of running the house that gets to me.  We have a mess at the moment in my house.

Sudden change in grade...,"I remember checking my AP Physics grade a few weeks back after my teacher entered in our test and seeing my grade (which was a 82.8%--the class is extremely difficult for me and I'm barely hanging on a thread with this class). A few weeks later, I decide to check my grade again and and for some reason, my grade has dropped to a C. Except he hasn't entered any new assignments. The percentage on the screen still reads 82.8% except it's a C instead of a B. 
It might just be a mistake, but I'm afraid that I might've angered/offended my teacher in some way shape or form. The only thing that comes to mind is the fact that I missed two classes last time and both were for a family emergency. He's usually an extremely understanding teacher, and I've never seen him angry before which worries me even more. Any thoughts on how to approach this situation? Thanks for reading this and I'm sorry for the brick wall of text! "

How do I deal with stress in a healthy way while in the stressful situation?,"Most advice I find is for when you are out of the stressful situation, like exercise. I have a stressful job and I don't think about it when I'm home, but when I'm at work (I'm an RN in a hospital, 12 hour shifts) I binge eat fatty/sugary foods on my lunch break, and I even sneak into the break room to breathe for a minute and usually scarf whatever donuts/cake/whatever is available in there.

Gonna need some serious help on this one,"Okay, so I'm a 16 yr old guy and am having some stress lately. I usually assume that it is my teenage mind blowing thing out of proportion but now I have noticed some stuff. To start, I cannot remove myself from any of the situations that are causing me stress because they are either important (school) or I have no power over them (dying grandfather, great uncle just died) so what I am looking for is a way to really fix it by changing my view. At first I tried to relieve it by going over the situation I am in but there is a lot so I find myself pacing for HOURS around trying to come up with a plan to organize but thing just kept coming so then I started to crumble. School started so I'm locked in to a lot of stuff too. I started to eat less and stay up until 3 AM worrying about life. Then when that started to effect my grades and other schedule stuff (lack of sleep and energy) I just felt worse. I had a lot of other emotions like guilt and regret. I felt like there wasn't a good end to where I was. I have a twin brother who is in everything like this but never worries about thing so he is doing great. I started to crumble more until I was on the verge of tears. I then chose that even being emotionally numb and calm was better than the stress and a wanted a way to block everything out. That's when I cut myself. I cut myself again the next day, and the day following that. I felt EXTREMLY calm after doing so. It was more calm then I had felt in months. But then I remembered, scars. That has stopped me since those three days of calm. I only have few scratches and cuts and one glass cut but I easily hide them with a few wristbands and a watch. Thing is, everything scars and if I keep going, its going to affect me later in life. It always starts with a few scratches but then that's not enough. Even after a few days I went from just pain to not feel my problems to needing the sight of blood. The only thing stopping me now is, well, more stress. I'm now hoping that the cuts don't scar too badly and am stressing about hiding the scabs on my wrist. My family (luckily) is very loving and close to me. That means little privacy so I can't continue without them noticing. I wish that left me at square one but even square one is better than this. Now I have tried everything I have thought of to deal with stress and none of it will work without hurting me in the long run so now I just need a change in the mind. I need a new mindset to view life in general."
Easy Stress Management Ways!!!,"**Indulge in Exercise or Movement**

Exercise means endorphin and endorphin mean happiness therefore it’s about time you got on the treadmill. However, the treadmill may not be everyone’s piece of cake but movement is the best way to battle stress. A walk in the park or a punching bag may be the best stress reliever of all time.  If at work then walk away from your cubicle to change your surroundings and allow the anxiety to subside.  Staying in one position may be equivalent to drowning in your sorrows and letting the stress balloon into a extremity.

**Call a Friend**

Never ever underestimate the power of a strong support network as it can work miracles for the stressed individual.  A different perspective is all one needs to understand a source of stress, an intimate connection or their own experience may provide the much needed perspective. The simple therapy of talking may provide the much needed relief and laughter never hurt anyone. If one doesn’t feel comfortable with talking to the near and dear then joining a support group is always a good option as it allows the comfort of familiarity with a tinge of anonymity.

**Crave Some Time**

Stress is bound to be experienced when we are working two jobs; balancing social work and personal life it all may seem too much and rightly so. Stress from everyday activities may build up and create leave you with a sense of missing identity. This can avoided or tackled with the help of some designated “me” time which will help you reclaim your life and give a sense of belonging. Rubbing with shoulders with people and socializing too frequently may also be source of stress as the soul and body needs to re-energize it frequently. This is similar to the phoenix rising from the ashes to become a stronger self- a dramatic example which, yet all too relevant.

**Leave your Comfort Zone**

The familiar can also be a cause of stress ass the more used to you is to familiarity the more stress any unknown element will give you. It’s best to change ones surroundings and indulge in new activities to push yourself to your limit. Sign up for a new course, or a class, make yourself do things which you’ve always been afraid of to allow mental growth and better composure in the face of unknown elements.

**Avoid the Junk**

Getting that bottle of wine out to drown your sorrows may seem the best way to cope with stress but reality its only making the problem worse. The same way that tub of ice-cream, binging on comfort food or the balcony smoke will not solve the problem only aggravate it. As much as it may attract you, it’s best to stick to the healthier options to allow the body to support your aggrieved soul. Snack on fruit and cut up vegetables to avoid adjoining problems such as weight gain and health issues.

Anybody uses sport as a stress reliever ?,"Hi,

I grew up as a sportshead, stopped in college, got extremely sick and lost my future life, capacity to run or even jog. My life is still shit but my body is back and now that I can jog I often feel the need to just rush out and run. And even though it feels a little neurotic and a non solution to other problems, done just enough I find it very very (very very very very) effective to lower stress.

Even a bit of workout (slow pushups) will calm me down.

Felt overwork this week,"I am writing to describe all the stresses i had this week. 

I am a full time college student majoring in business and this semester i am taking 4 upper division classes along with an online course. Thankfully these classes are lecture classes and the year has just started but the readings are slowly piling up as well as presentations that are creeping after every week.

My second and biggest stress this week is a business club organization that im involved in for my extracurriculars. I am the secretary for the club and my duties include a lot of clerical stuff like registering for the organization, booking stuff, and sending emails to people. It is taking a huge chunk of my time and work and i am heavily invested in it. 

So this week happens to be recruitment week and we have to present in different classrooms as well as in our orientation meetings which we had twice this week. I presented a total of three times on wednesday which had me really anxious before that and again the next day. Our orientations made us interact with prospective members and socialize a lot with others. I am not introverted but the stress is taking its toll on me and i already felt too drained even before the social interaction. Thankfully I did not have to present on friday which I was brain dead by that time. 

Not to mention at work at a campus job in the fiscal/accounting department my supervisor is being a complete asshole to me by picking on me and disrespecting me. For some reason it felt like this week was the worst of his behavior and it really felt like he was purposely grinding my gears without knowledge that i was struggling the entire week mentally and emotionally. 

Physically I lost sleep and i grew dark circles around my eyes, and my eyes have been red from the overwork and tiredness. My face has visibily thinned and i can barely muster a smile when i see people. Ive also lost weight as I checked the scale this weekend. My eating habits have been normal however ive got barely any exercise the entire week because of my exhaustion. Ive also experienced headaches and fatigue from the stress and anxiety.

My only ways of coping with the stress have been managing my errands as the secretary and sacrificing work hours/cancelling a group meeting with my other class. Ive been receiving emotional support from my mom and a friend whom i trust and understands my situation fully. 

Emotionally I feel down because Ive been feeling unappreciated and lacking positive attention from my fellow executive board members of my club. They dont give me the credit i deserve because my work as a secretary involves a lot of ""behind the scenes"" work and its been a hard load Ive been carrying on my shoulders. 

Tldr; this week was heavily invested in extracurriculars as a club executive secretary, supervisor picking on me at work, and falling behind in classes already. Had trouble coping and my physical features started looking worse by the day "

Everything falling apart.,"I was doing so good until about a year ago. Then I lost my job and started falling behind on rent. Landlord was really flexible.. but then job after job something always happened that put me in the same situation. I was never able to catch up on rent, and now that I'm about to get a decent job and right before the interview I got a text.. ""I'm sorry man.. but this is your 30-Day Eviction Notice."" I fell almost 1500 behind on rent. I've had a huge migraine ever since then, so many thoughts have gone through my head. I'm trying to cope but I can't seem to do it. I thought everything was going to start getting better, but I have a feeling finding a new place is going to be the same as the job thing. How do I cope to this? I need an option because I can't come up with a healthy coping technique."
Life is hard.,"I have a good life, I just finished my first year of college and I have a great family. I guess I just feel like I have to disclaim that so people know I am complaining for no reason. But I'm so incredibly depressed... I have declared a major in computer science, and am taking a summer C++ class, and I just cannot understand the logic. This class is incredibly hard for me because it's only 6 weeks long (less than half the length of a normal college course semester), and I feel like I am jamming all this information into my mind. I'm also working 30+ hours a week and babysit a few times a week, and I feel like I barely have time to myself to self care. This subject is really frustrating me because I feel like I have no time to figure out the logic, and studying takes a long time. I have been missing work days and have slipped into an extended depressive state (sleeping but always tired, loss of appetite, no motivation to work out or see friends). Part of it is a boyfriend issue, but this class on top of that and my busy schedule just makes it the fucking cherry on top. I know I don't have it the worst out there, but honestly I'm so incredibly stressed and I feel like I'm not good enough. My dad tells me that I ""don't have the right brain for a computer scientist"" and that's just so degrading to me. Granted, I have been an artist my entire life, but I'm also incredibly skilled at math (mostly Calculus), so I hoped that Comp Sci would be easy for me to pick up - I thought wrong. Honestly my first comp sci class was so easy; we learned HTML and that was a blast. I like C++ too, but I think what's hard for me is the fast pace and lack of time to study as much as I want. I just feel like a failure because my parents are spending so much money on my education and I hate to feel like I let them down. I want to be good at coding, but I can't be good enough for the pace of this class. I know that if I take this class again during the fall, I will understand it more thoroughly, but my mom pulled the money card on me and it just made me feel incredibly guilty. I don't know what to do. If I fail this class, I'll just break down and I will feel so bad. I only have 1 week left of it and my grade is a 35%, I have to finish 2 more projects and 8 mini exercises, plus study for the final exam, as well as get enough hours in at work so I can get a decent paycheck. My life's a wreck, I've accepted it.

The Cost of Moving,"Welcome to Los Angeles County in California. We are known for some of the worst rent and rentals in the United States. Go us?

It's supposed to be a move to a better apartment. A place with less roaches, ants, and termites. The place is technically bigger. My husband got a raise and the higher rent is supposed to be affordable. We can park off the street for less even.

It sounds good but it has already cost me over $3000! It's $1300 for the rent and the security deposit each. The moving supplies, if I added it all up, I would estimate was around $300 so far. We need to rent a truck and pay someone for help with furniture which will be another $300 - $400. 

Oh my gods! We have not even moved yet and I feel like I am being buried. I've barely slept the last 2 weeks. I have found it impossible to rest at night. I toss and turn then get up because my husband still has to be rested to work. I have to try my best to be awake and attentive to my 8 year old too. 

The thing I think I fear the most is if my son realizes he is getting the short end of the stick in this new place. He will have a room only 2/3rds of what he has now. I want to make more room for him by getting a loft bed with a desk and dresser built in from Ikea that he fell in love with but it's nearly $500! I feel guilty I cannot get it even though it's perfect for him.

When we are not outside or about we are big on hanging together in our living room. That is where this new place excels in space. The living room is huge! We will have great space for our books, music, computers. We don't have cable but we can watch movies much more comfortably from the net. 

Still, stress and guilt.

Unrequited love or naivety?,"I will try to explain this as clearly as possible but I'd like to share my story to hear what people have to say. My friends and mom have gone through this with me so I already know their opinions and it's still a popular topic we talk about today, even after almost two years ago. 

Keep in mind I've always been the weird, loser with only a few friends, Im far from special or popular. 

It started two years ago, towards the beginning of the school year my mental illness was plummeting and it's around that time I had opened up about the mess that was about to be unleashed. I had told one of my pe teachers that I couldn't take it, I needed to open up to someone and they brought me to the school counselor. 
No one ever used our counselors we had unless it was for school, graduation stuff or things along the line but I had never heard of a personal connection with ether counselor. 

Also, keep in mind that I had liked teachers plenty of times before but nothing like this.

For a short description of the counselor I got, he was a light I had never seen before. He was something I had never been introduced to before; every time I think about him I think of what happiness would look like. Seriously, it was like some god had answered my prayers from when I was younger to meet a guy that was going to fix all the shitty problems that I had been dealing with. 
He had the sweetest voice and only the kindest heart. 

I had started talking to him for a month or so, by then we had gotten to know one another well. He had told me a little about his past as I slowly opened up about mine, sometimes I wouldn't even talk but I'd still sit in his office and he'd make every gesture. Sometimes we wouldn't even talk about my problems but other things in life and what we were into. It was hardly ever about school, it was like I had a friend that developed into a crush real quick. 
I noticed that towards the end of my stay at the school he had grown protective, maybe flirty. We were constantly talking, he would pull me out of classes ,I hardly attended, to talk. He would cut someone's counseling session short to see me sooner. If any other authority figure tried to talk to me he was quickly my shadow. 
He had set me up with several services to do with therapy (I had already seen a lot but he made room for more.) even when we weren't talking, we had emailed simple stuff. 
Once, I remember that he had even said I reminded him of his wife. 

So, I end up moving schools. This school is okay, great at first but in the end doesn't work out. 
I invite him to this talent appreciation thing we're having to show him my art and he shows up. Between the short months of being there I had realized how much I missed talked to him.
Anyways, he shows up dressed really nice and we hug for awhile, I show him my art and my mom talks to him awkwardly for a bit. Him and I go around the corner, out of where the thing was happening and where there's no people and he's kinda bumping into me. We hug again and take awhile to let go, we talk a little bit about how things are going and then the day ends. 
I don't hear from him for the next six months? 
My mom emails him, I email him tons of times. 
Not to mention, not only was this guy the best person I could ask for but he was amazing at helping me mentally. 
My mental health plummets again and here I am. Went through more shit, getting help currently but missing him terribly. I had talked to him a few times within the last two months and he replied really late and bluntly.

I forgot to mention another thing; my friends have spotted him everywhere with his family and they all seem to say they always seem like their fighting. He looks guilty or weird every time he sees my friends because he knows their my friends.

Been getting ill a lot lately because of stress,"For the last two years I been very stressed and this in turn have reduced my immune system. I had a lot of headaches, sore throats and ear aches. I have now finally made changes to my life which have reduced stress by quite a lot. I have been dealing with things that I always worried about and I started a new hobby. 

Now I am wondering, will my immune system ever get back to what it used to be before the stress?"
Suffocation,"I feel like I'm suffocating from all of the stress that I'm dealing with. I'm broke, no money for gas, food, or bills & asking my husband for help always ends up in an argument. He helps with most things, but I personally pay most of the bills - It's stressful and I'm trying to file for bankruptcy to help get out of the constant debt and drowning each month. I now work two jobs to help pay for everything and I have no time to see my kids when I get home.  

I just need a damn break - I do not know how much more I can personally take & now I'm getting pains in my chest when I think about all that needs to be done. To much to worry about - too much stress & I'm missing my kids more and more and they miss me... Today life sucks. "
How do you manage your stress?,"Everybody deals with stress in one way to another, but how they handle it is a different story.

Stress from work advice,"Hello everyone,

since last October, I've been overstressed with work. I'm not even sure if I actually love my job anymore or if I am just grateful for the opportunity.

Last Tuesday, my coworker took 2 weeks for stress leave. Since he left, my workload has doubled...I've since gotten snappy with customers, friends, and family. TBH, I still have another week with this workload...And a second job requesting my weekend....I honestly feel like I'm going to fucking snap at any minute....Between calls, I'm screaming and smashing my desk...At what point, do you realize enough is enough?

Ive never even thought about stress leave from work but I'm at the point of no return. If I didn't have a car payment, I'd quit right this second. Can anyone provide me some advice? I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. "

Stress-related acne,"Hi /r/stress. I've noticed that in times of heavy stress (something I'm currently experiencing), my skin has a direct and noticeable response.

Caught in a rut,"Hello Everyone,

First time Im posting here (this is also a throwaway). Where do I begin? I am genuinely concerned about the way I have been thinking and much of it has to do with stress. For background information, I am a senior at a university who is almost done his degree (BS in Computer science w/ Certificate Computer Security) so I already know that im in a stressful program. Ive never really had a problem with my education until this semester, I feel mislead in my classes i.e (I do great on the homework and then I end up failing the tests). This has lead to me failing or doing not up to my standards in my other classes and its beginning to effect my own self worth. Instead of being confident in myself im resorting to internal hatred and just overall sadness. I am in a relationship with a very loving girlfriend but I feel that if I bring my problems into it, it could go sideways and I dont want that. Because of all of this my sleep schedule has not been exactly ideal, I usually go to bed at midnight and wake up early for class and the quality of my sleep is not what I would call good (tossing and turning and frequently waking up). I just feel like I have been in this high tension environment and one false move could literally ruin everything for me. I really have no idea what to do or how to cope with this, I literally go to every class on the verge of tears because I guess I have so much pent up inside of me. What do you think?

TLDR: Extremely stressed out college student on the verge of graduation, problems with internalizing emotions and staying positive (typically im a very positive person)"
I keep failing my classes,"I keep failing my classes, i try really hard and I have a lot of tutoring too. Im so fucking done, i cant pass anything. "
Constant miserable stress and anxiety..,"Hello, (id like to start by saying i know how dramatic this post will sound and I'm fully aware that it's unhealthy the way I think daily.) my biggest issue is the constant state of stress I am in and how overwhelmed I feel everyday. I wake up in the mornings with a burning ache nauseous feeling and a throbbing chest. The nausea dies down normally once I've been awake for a little bit but the chest throbbing and feeling of emptiness doesn't. I am at the verge of tears all day everyday and the smallest of things can set me the wrong way. I have panic attack after panic attack and I truly just don't know what to do anymore. No matter how I explain the severity of my situation to people, they STILL somehow seem to not understand just how miserable my mind makes me everyday. I get intrusive thoughts like about how something terrible could happen to my family, or a lot of ""what ifs"". My mind is running 24/7 and it's driving me insane. I have a terrible fear of dying along with an even more crippling fear of something happening to my family (my parents, brothers..) all day long my mind plays thoughts and scenarios that leave me sad, scared, constantly wired with fear, and over all exhausted. I have talked to my therapist about this issue but medicine isn't helping and the thoughts won't go away. Not to mention my issues with school. I do online school due to health issues and mental issues (I was bullied a lot) but even that doesn't take away the stress of school. I open up my schoolwork, take a long look at it and immediately feel overwhelmed and anxious. I procrastinate and can never seem to be at ease with school. Doing just everyday things have gotten to be way too much. I also get chest pains all through the day from regular daily activities. I'm miserable and I can't keep living like this. Does anyone know what I can do to not feel like this? I've tried everything I can think of. I've taken up yoga, meditation,breathing exercises, and many coping exercises to try and help that my therapist has written down and given me but they don't work either(just temporarily as in 5 to 10 minutes then I'm back to how I was before.) I'm sorry for the length of this post but I figured this was my best shot of finding someone who has this issue and can at least take away the edge I feel. Please no one leave any negative feedback, I understand you may not feel this way or even see how someone can, but I'm just looking for answers. Thank you so much"
Help With Exploding,"I have always been a fairly stressed out person. This has been true of me since second grade and I have real problems with handling it.

For years I had some good primary methods. I had a consistent group of friends who played games with me and that helped. I actually had a fairly active social life that allowed me to escape it all.

However, in the past year, a lot of that has changed. Many of my current friends are complete introverts, things with school have hit the fan and there is no sign of slowing, and I'm dealing with some personal issues at the moment that present themselves stressfully.

My method through this has been to rant. I talk to my mother, I talk to my girlfriend, and I talk to my friends and teachers about how stressed I am. It became apparent a few months ago that this would not be sustainable when I almost lost my girlfriend due to this.

I had another one of those moments today.

I'm essentially looking for outlets. Something easy that does not take a ton of time that can help me mitigate this stress. Meditation has somewhat stopped working for me so I'm kind of at a loss."
18 Sr in Highschool also dual enrolled in college classes pursuing associates degree in business,"Junior year in High School I was excepted into a program in which I would start taking college classes for the first half of the day, then after take some high school classes. The idea is that the college courses also count for my high school courses. Also the program is fully paid for and is 3 years long. So I will graduate high school this year in 2017, but get my associates for free by 2018, by continuing to remain in the program and finish classes. 

Recently during my 5th total semester I have a Quantitative Reasoning class which consists of applied math skills w/ some excel work. I was excited because applied math is something that can be very useful in the business world of which I aim to pursue. But everything went downhill very quickly. My professor gives no lectures, which I have never encountered, but to my understanding, this isn't uncommon. But from reading, usually it is weird for professors to do this is basic 100 classes at the collegiate level. She doesn't lecture, all the work is online, all the text is online, and is unreliable when responding to messages/emails. I have discovered that online work is harder for me to learn from and efficiently complete, for me personally. My brain just doesn't work the same. But the class isn't ""online,"" it is a sit-in on Mondays and Wednesdays. 

Last week a girl in my class asked a couple of questions on some examples in our workbook, and my prof responded with, ""you are asking to many questions."" It felt like she was getting extremely impatient for no apparent reason. The professor is not teaching us anything, everyone in class is struggling, and she is not helping. Also it is a 4 credit class so about 8 hours is expected to be done out of class (study, homework, etc.) but we have been doing around 13-15 hours a week on this one class. I know some of this is just college but I am nervous that I will not pass this class and am extremely worried, stressed, and frustrated with everything. Keep in mind I am still a senior in High School, and have more homework for that and the other couple college classes I take weekly, and I have a job. Any advice would be appreciated. Very worried "
Friend Management,"I'm just having a hard time trying get to keep up with friends after college. I'm dealing with a 9-5 office job, living back with parents, and juggling personal and social life.

I really want to stay friends with the people from college. Most of the time we talk via discord and do a lot gaming. 

However lately they are getting really serious with the whole 'esports' mentality. I want to play and talk to them more but I just don't have the time or freedom to dedicate to that. I would love to play more and get better with them (because they are my best friends).

Stressed about life in general,"For starters I have GAD, so of course I'm going to be worrisome. But, here is what's going down: I'm 19 and never had a job.

But, in high school I lost all motivation for anything and everything, and barely tried in all my classes, even ones I enjoyed. So, I don't have the best transcript. On top of that, I also haven't taken the ACT, because I didn't think I'd even consider college. I literally feel like I know nothing and am completely unprepared for the ACT no matter how much I study, because I never payed attention in my classes.

Stress and Health Issues,"After years of practicing law at a big firm, I began to struggle with health issues that my doctors attributed to stress. I moved away from my law practice and got certified as an integrative health coach. My approach considers whole-person health--not just physical fitness and nutrition, but also sleep, professional development, relationships, and community, among other things. In particular, I partner with women to create and sustain healthy habits. This holistic approach was instrumental in helping me to feel better and thrive. I'm trying to determine whether career-minded women are interested and able to invest the time to get healthy by working with a coach. Here are my questions: 

(1) Is health a significant concern for you? 

(2) If so, what is the most important thing you would like to improve about your health? 

(3) Would you invest in a coach to help you achieve that improvement? 

Many thanks for your sharing your thoughts. I'm exploring these issues and value your feedback greatly.  Looking forward to connecting with you!"

"Family stress is affecting my job, can someone please hear me out?","Three years ago, I lost my mother to cancer.  She and my dad worked and lived overseas in South Korea for 20+ years.

I came back here to start on my own, 5 years ago, working my way paycheck to paycheck to make that happen.  My mother was the breadwinner and the pillar of our family, she kept us together.  When she died, my dad was never the same.  She was a US gov. employee, and he's an artist. 

Right now, he lives off her pension and social security as income and lives in an artist loft.  I live with a friend in an apartment and work in retail, as my job options and credentials were limited due to lack of experience.  I've been with the company I work at for 3 years, but have recently been slipping up due to stress.

My dad, a Korean national, barely speaks communicable English and relies on me for a LOT of daily routines.  He owns a convertible, because he felt like he deserves it, but has ME drive because he has an out-of-state license, since he can't be bothered to test locally in English.  He doesn't know his way around and has no convenient way of finding his way around without using photographic memory.

Also, typical Asian parent issue here but, he's not really approved my life choices.  He's 70, I'm a 31 year old bachelor, suffice it to say we have been living very different lives.  I'm doing the best I can to support myself, but having to help him has started to affect my own life, in a way that it could spiral out of control unless I do something, but am not sure what.  I'm sick of arguing with him because it doesn't fix anything, and if I can't take care of myself, how can I possibly help him, even if I choose to do less for him?"
Why do i keep making stupid mistakes at work?,"so yeah,i just joined this company recently and i can't stress enough how many times i've made mistakes at my job.it's definitely not something to be proud of when the other new hires are performing significantly better than i am.it's so embarrassing. i keep making stupid mistakes that are like the most basic things ever that everyone is supposed to know at the back of their hand. even i realise that. 

and it's not like i'm being careless when it comes to doing my job, i double check my work, even triple and multiple check it before sending it for approval. hell, i just spent literally 15 minutes today checking and rechecking my work to make sure that i didn't screw up anything. but guess what? i made like a total of 8 mistakes. and those are like the most stupidest mistakes you can make when it comes to doing my job. 

the worst thing is, my boss know about all the stupid mistakes that i keep making. he hasn't confronted me directly about it yet, but i'm paranoid that it's only a matter of time before he does. and when he does, i'm afraid of what the repercussions might be. i literally can't sleep at night worrying about what i might fück up next. a trainer of mine just literally asked me like what is wrong with you and why are you keep making so many mistakes? and he even said that ""i don't think you even check your work before sending them in to me"". but like seriously wtf? like i literally spent 15 minutes going through everything before i sent it in. 

WTF IS WRONG WITH ME?? 

i keep making mistakes even though i'm consciously telling myself not to do it. all the mistakes that i keep making has definitely put me on my boss's watch list.  i keep failing even though i try so hard to improve myself. it's like i try my best to go around and take notes and stuff when the other new hires just laze around all day and play with their phones or even take casual naps. 

i work my as$ off at work but i don't get the result that i'm looking for. and the ones who don't even bother making any effort in learning, are getting positive reviews on their work. like how is that even possible? 

just so you guys know, all the new hires are subjected to a 6 month probation period,i can't quit even if i wanted to.there was like a contract that i had to sign where i'm not supposed to leave the company while i'm subjected to the probation period. and i don't want to quit, i'm not a quitter. i just wanna make this work for me.it's at a really big multinational company.other fresh grads would dream to work at that place and earn as much as i do. not that i'm bragging about it, but i just feel like i'm not good enough for it. but i know i have it in me to excel at work, i just don't know how. it's bumming me out.i'm not getting better at my job, i'm getting worse at it. i'm trying so hard not to screw up, i just keep screwing up worse than before. 

i'm just not getting the hang of it yet. the thing is, i should have gotten used to it by now. it's been a month and i'm definitely not showing any productivity. for the love of all that is good and holy, what's my problem??

Why do I feel more stressed away from work than I do in work?,I worry about my coworkers doing my work when they already have shit to do. I worry so much about people looking after my deals. I worry about a big event I am planning and leaving things in the hands of others. I am not enjoying my holiday because I am worrying about work constantly. How do I stop? 
STRESS REDUCTION TECHNIQUES,Stress and anxiety will steal your peace and well-being if you permit it.  It is best to address their presence as soon as you become aware of them. Spend a few minutes periodically during your work day meditating.  Close your eyes.  Focus on taking in two deep breaths and releasing them.  Then focus on your heart beat.  Ignore any thoughts that arise.

Two jobs instant stress,"I just recently got hired part time to two jobs, on the applications I put open availability because I didn't think anyplace would call back. Now I'm stuck with having to tell both I can not work X days and I'm stressing. I think the main reason is the one job has me for Sunday and Monday day(memorial day) all day and I'm going to go into training for the 2nd job today and I have no idea if they made a schedule for me. Idk what to do or how to negotiate which company I'll work for if they both have me all day on those two days. "
Terrorized and Tortured By Thugs Upstairs,"Almost eleven months ago a couple with a child moved in the apartment above in July 2015. At first, it just seemed like they were loud and inconsiderate. The man was a saggy pants thug that kept traffic going at night. The building is an eight apartment building in a complex. In about a week, I heard taunts like, ""Wake da fuck up, nigga"", ""Dat nigga ain' gone git no sleep"", ""Weeze gone make dat nigga so mad he'z gone wonna fight."", ""Dat nigga muss be playin' wit hiz dick"" while stomping, beating, and slamming things on the floor. By week two they also started something that makes me wobble where ever I sit or lay. Often the wobbling is what shakes me out of my sleep.

Over the months the woman switched through 5 or 6 men to live with her upstairs. Everyone of them are thugs insane enough to participate in this behavior. The woman does most of the taunting. By the beginning of the year she started shadowing me. Nearly every waking hour I am in this apartment she stomps over me as I switch rooms or got to the bathroom. She and the men really love taunting over the bathroom. I struggle to sleep in a bedroom and living room, even on the floor. The woman always has my spot. She keeps me up anywhere from 2am to 5am. I am sort of fortunate I work second shift or I'd never sleep.

Technically, I am staying in a two bedroom apartment with my mother. The woman and most of the people in this building doesn't seem to have to work to have a place, a car, and kids. This arrangement makes complaining to the office off the table. Hours and pay from my job is been bad so the next move I'm likely to make is in a crappy room for rent in St. Louis city. :'( Anyway, the woman that I don't know has it out just for me. The third guy I tried to approach him. He threatened me.

I just need to know how to beat the wobbling or what it may be. More help with blocking the stomping and loudness can help too. Somehow she has been making it pass my earplugs and the box fan. In the pass that was even good enough to block people playing loud car stereos just outside a window or to a next door neighbors loud TV echoing through the wall. Please, help. This week she has been really pushing harder with some new tattooed giant.

I have other problems that technically should be worse; student loans, being obese, forgetting what I learned in school, went backwards financially, can't find a place other than renting rooms, never had a girlfriend. Still, all those things I can keep sane and work to improve everyday. However, this insane upstairs neighbor and her thugs deprave me of privacy, peace, and sleep everyday. The wobbling makes me feel violated. Before their attacks I worked on coding, applying for better work, and drawing. Now, I waste time I am in doors exhausted listening to Youtube videos and music with headphones while I cringe wobbling in places that feel disgusting. It is a miracle I prevented myself from being violent."

"Eat, Exercise and Ease Stress","Busting stress differently

Over the years, stress has become an inevitable part of our lives. It is a major health disorder affecting millions of people across the world. We cannot chuck out stress from our daily routine. Thus, the best remedy for many of us is to manage it. According to an online survey conducted by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA), 14% of people worked out to reduce stress, 18% talked to family or friends, 13% listened to music, 14% watched movies or TV, 17% went off to sleep and another 14% simply binged disregarding the risks of obesity. The remaining 10% succumbed to stress and spend the rest of their lives dealing with its harmful side effects as diabetes and hypertension.

Perils of modern life

Whenever you are stressed out, your nervous system and adrenal glands work overtime to prepare your body to deal with the dangerous situation. This is a basic instinctive behavior which has evolved over a period of time to help you encounter circumstances that can affect you adversely. Modern life is a potpourri of insecurities, work pressures, competition, jealousy, hostility and vengeance. These impending dangers keep your instincts on high alert.

Between the stressful periods are intermittent recovery phases when your body persuades you to eat and eat and eat. Your metabolic rate has dropped to conserve energy. Hence, most of the food that you eat gets converted into fat and results in weight gain. Some more cascading effects of stress are headache, insomnia, fatigue and depression.

Opinion of healthcare professionals

Countless clinical studies, researches and experiments have established the benefits of exercise towards improving health and fighting diseases. The world over, healthcare professionals reiterate that exercise is vital in enhancing mental fitness and reducing stress. Stress depletes your energy reserves as well as trims down your concentration. Furthermore, it affects your brain, nerve connections and muscles. Your mind and body are dragged to the verge of breakdown.

About 5 to 10 minutes of exercise, particularly, aerobic exercises, produce endorphins in the brain. They are natural pain killers which decrease the intensity of anxiety, elevate mood other than stabilizing it and improve sleep. Consequently, stress vanishes into the thin air. In one study, researchers found that people who do vigorous exercise regularly are less likely to be affected by stress, depression and anxiety.

The impact of regular session of exercise, which is at least one hour long, is different on different individuals. Some experience positive effects, while in others the impact is moderate and often short-term. The remaining experience no improvement. Nonetheless, the healthcare professionals emphasize that the beneficial effects of exercise on physical health are undisputable and each person should be encouraged to stay active.

Don’t forget to Munch

Exercise when complemented with nutritious food helps to relieve stress more effectively. A heavy breakfast, followed by a relatively lighter lunch and concluded by very light dinner will be a perfect plan for good health. For in between binging desires, you should restrict yourself to fruits, salads, soups and yogurt. Each meal should be balanced with the right amount of proteins, carbohydrates and fats.

Food items that are rich in magnesium and vitamins B and C are good stress-busters. In addition to helping you to feel more energetic after the stressful period, they reduce anxiety, loosen up muscles and stabilize your mood. While banana, avocado, leafy vegetables, meat, fish, dairy products and nuts are a good source of vitamin B, oranges, lemon, kiwi, broccoli, tomatoes and pepper contain abundant amount of vitamin C. Magnesium can be found in whole grains, oats and beans.

Caffeine, nicotine, alcohol, sugar and salt should be avoided. They tend to aggravate stress. Substitute tea, coffee, canned juices and soft-drinks with fresh fruit juices and sparkling water, which should be diluted. Stop smoking and avoid excessive intake of food items that are laden with sugar and salt like energy drinks and fast-food. They satiate your hunger, but nullify all the good that healthy food has done to your body.

Find that me-time

Apart from eating healthy and exercising, find some me-time too. It is the time when you do something that you thoroughly enjoy. It can be anything, as simple as lying on your hammock and reading a book, dancing at your favorite tunes or chit-chatting with your friends. Frequently, just doing nothing and lying down on the bed work wonders. You have to manage stress to live a better life, that’s the rule. So, do whatever makes you feel happy.

Conclusion: Living a healthful life has become a challenging matter these days. There are opinions and counter-opinions floating freely around us. You tend to feel flustered hearing and following all of them. The best thing to do is to pay attention to your instincts. Your mind and body know what is best for you. Hence, eat, exercise and ease stress. A perfect mantra for a healthy life."
"the stress of a levels, i just can't manage it!!","I'm so stressed all of the time. It makes me feel breathless and anxious all the time. My chest hurts. I'm doing english lit, spanish, french and classics as a levels and i'm at a 'high power' school in london, the expectations feel high and i'm surrounded constantly by high achievers. But the stress!! THe stress is killing me! I don't know what to do, I love going to sleep at night because thats the only place i want to be, inside a dream, unconscious of everything around me while i'm awake. I mean i'm physically fine I suppose but it's nawing away at me from the inside and making me into a horrible person - i can feel relationships breaking down because i'm so underlyingly uptight and it's not my normal me. I don't know how to manage it. I know a levels aren't the end of the world. My family will only be 'upset for me' if I don't do well, they won't get angry or anything.. but I suppose I expect a lot of myself.

I can't get out of this stress trance. It's terrible because I look at the foreign languages and I can't even read them sometimes because I'm so worked up and THAT only makes it worse. I just want to cry! 
I know it's a bit pathetic but thats just it, i then beat myself up over that... I just can't win.

"Work Stress, Life Stress, All types of stress","Not so sure on how to start but so I guess I'll just dive straight into it.

For like two years or so I was stressing over being jobless, that was from like 2014-late 2015. I managed to catch a break in November of 2015 working in a warehouse. 

And I was way happy,now I'm working as a Security Guard at an airport and right now, the thought that just won't go away is, is this what I'm going to be doing for the rest of my life? How do i move from this hurdle? The job is alright, I enjoy being around my current work team but if it's one thing I know for sure is, I don't want to be here for 15 years.. . I straight up do not want to be here.

Then there's the thought of moving onto college. I've tried it twice -studied in Information Technology- What I tell my self is the first time I went, I had my high school mentality, which was lazy. I figured since i now knew what my problem was, I could buckle down and you know pass! But. . Turns out that was bull, maybe I still didnt put in enough effort or maybe I just simply wasn't cut out for it but I flunked again and right now, when ever I think about College, i just go into over drive cause I can't stop thinking is this for me and if it is, what do I pursue? No way am I going for Computers again -Think I'm scared of that subject now :/- but.. that was all I knew at least thought I knew.  

And if College isn't for me? Then what in the hell is? How do I find my ground? I want to be able to support my self, I want to be able to help my family in what little way I can but I just don't know.

I've been told to take baby steps into life but, it's just so hard to do so, I was 21 and like JUST like that, I'm now 22. . I don't think life is taking baby steps and I'm pretty sure I don't have time too either.. 

I don't know what to do or how to stop my mind from going into over drive... unless I drink.. which is something I'm trying to stop do.. stress drinking but that's a different thing for another time."
Looking for a hobby to reduce stress? JIU JITSU- the gentle art & chess match of fighting,"I am a petite female; so ladies let me tell you this might be even better for you.

Jiu jitsu really helps my stress in more than one way:
exercise of course= endorphins, essentially hugging somebody all class=oxytocin, major positive reinforcement from professors, choking out your opponents.

This is the only activity where I forget EVERYTHING I am stressed about. 

Note: this is not an overly rough sport; my 110 lbs handles it just fine. "
I've Associated Stress With Everything and Get Real Physical Symptoms From It,"I've been suffering from an injury to ligaments around my upper neck and back for 4 years. It's healed to the point where the symptoms (caused by instability) come and go throughout the day. However when the symptoms occur I can't function -- for instance, one of the symptoms resulting from instability around that area is a pretty severe reduction in cognition.

Over the years when the symptoms were bad and I couldnt think I would stress and stress over my work because I couldn't do it properly.

I notice now that I'm at the point where if I watch tv all day I'll be fine and won't have any symptoms for the most part. However, all I have to do is start work for 5 minutes -- or even just think about work -- and it'll trip my symptoms. My muscles around my neck will instantly start to tighten and everything will start snap and crack. The snapping and cracking in my neck causes things to move around and it triggers my symptoms (cognition issues, etc). Even if I stop work immediately I'll still feel terrible for hours until things return to normal.

I attribute this to the fact that my stress has grown so great over the years that I've basically psychologically anchored it to my work. And its at the point where all I need to do is think about work and a light switch literally goes off in my body where it triggers stress, anxiety, muscle tightness, etc despite me actually not being stressed out. I can imagine the same phenomena/principle applies to people with social anxiety, panic attacks, or abuse/torture victims when they instantly get ""triggered"" from seeing something or thinking about something.

I've tested this over and over and despite it sounding nuts its true. Show me even a picture of my work and my body will instantly tighten, stuff will start cracking, and my symptoms will come on full boar. But, put me in front of a tv where I don't have to think at all and my muscles remain relaxed and everything is fine for hours and hours.

Does anyone know of a drug I can ask my doctor about that can break this type of issue. I'd really like to work and not have it trigger a physical reaction. I honestly feel like my brain is broken at this point because this seems so ridiculous to me."

"
Serious work stress,"I apologise in advance as this is likely going to be random and a bit of a ramble, but its what's currently going through my head as I type it.

So, firstly, a bit about me. I currently work in a tech call centre which is basically the biggest bullshit of a job I have ever had the misfortune to work at. But unfortunately I need this job for bills as it pays well. This I would say is the biggest cause of my stress. Its not the product, hell I can run circles around it, but the people. OH THE PEOPLE. These people are meant to be professionals at their jobs (and the products I support are quite specialised) but I swear when I talk to them I feel like I am talking to a 5 year old. I don't understand how these people dress themselves or look up in the shower every morning without drowning. 

Then the fact is they will call a specialist to help them and FUCKING ARGUE against us. I mean WTF. Were just meant to sit there and take it like a bitch and let them argue but if I was asking for help and advice, I for one wouldn't argue with the person who has been trained in this properly who is trying to help me.

Then there is everything else in this place. We are micro managed, hell my manager is definitely one of the decent ones but its not always been the case. Right now though, I know am being screwed over. Let's see if you peeps agree. I was on the sick at the start of the year (ironically also down to work related stress and anxiety). They stopped my sick pay and told me about it 3 weeks later (I am monthly paid). Then it comes around to bonus time. Last year I got a nice bonus because hell I am very good at this job. This year I don't get a bonus. Because they changed the statistics around so much that I kept missing (alot of people in the same position as me right now I might add so I am not just generally moaning or being shit).

I guess what doesn't also help is the fact I've just been abandoned on Xmas day by my own mother. She has decided she would rather spend the day with her new partner instead of with me and my wife like organised.

She has known this new guy for about 2 weeks. I mean come on that's fucked up.

I am just thankful I have my wife by my side. If I didn't I honestly don't know where I would be.

I might edit this later but thats pretty much it for now."
Work Stress All Time High ...,"So the stress levels at work are so high, I'm anxious don't want to go to work. I want to walk away but it's not an option. I feel like as soon as I get a little ahead of the game and can ease up a week later it's always right back up to the point where I'm not sleeping or eating . 

Most of it I have zero control over but I feel like I have failed BIG TIME in my arena and it SUCKS . 

any tip? Ideas? Advice?"
Strange experience while sleeping last night,"My dad told me that he thinks this could be stress. I want to see what you all think:

I woke up in the middle of the night and I don't know if I was fully awake, but I felt really tense in my neck. That tense feeling that feels like you need to have a cold chill.

And my mind was in agony. I don't understand it.

It was like all of my thoughts were happening at the same time. As if my brain were still working overtime while I was awake. If I started to think anything I'd fall into this state of pain and confusion and tension.

I can't remember what specific thoughts I was thinking. But I do remember that the stress came from complication. I knew that if I let my brain ""work"" I was thinking of things that were too painfully complicated to resolve.

So as I was trying to fall back asleep every time my mind wandered it wandered back into that same sort of mentally paralytic feeling.

Any thoughts?"
"I'm always tired, stress may have started it but its the cause of my stress.","So, maybe it started a few years ago with my depression and different eating habits (basically, I was fat, like 17st at age 12 fat, and dieted wrong. I'm just under 12st now at 19), but the real difference I felt was a couple of months ago, when I started going to bed at 11, instead of my usual midnight, 1am. Fair enough, sleep patterns change, but I've just started work at an electronics store, my fourth job, and I did a 5 hour shift, 3pm to 8. And I've done night shift work and I've done landscape gardening work, and I just went straight to bed after I got back from that shift. I'd done longer shifts at my current workplace the week before for fucks sake! And I just feel more lazy, despite going on walks to try and keep myself active. Admittedly, I don't have many local friends (many have gone uni) so I fill a lot of my hours just gaming, but most of the time I either want to lie on my bed watching TV, or sleeping, and that's stressing me because its frustrating not knowing the cause. Thanks in advance for any helpful comments, and sorry for bad formatting, I'm on my phone.

Edit - Oh, and its not my place of work. In fact, maybe apart from the gardening job because I got that from a family friend, this has been my most enjoyable job. I'm so confused."

Need some advice please (x-post from /r/anxiety),"
I'd like to ask for some advice from the good people of Reddit of how I can help my wife.  She is a very focussed and organised individual but who also suffers from general anxiety and stress, and depression also runs in the family. We've been together for nearly 10 years now and most of the time she has been happy and healthy and we have worked hard to build a good life for ourselves, coping with the odd bout of anxiety/stress during tough times. 

I love this lady so much, and she's hit a big low right now and I need some help to figure out what I can do to support her. 

Our situation is that we've recently moved house so are new to our area, we have two kids who are wonderful but hard work, and to support our life plan I have taken a job where I am away 4 days a week overnight. 

This was a tough choice but we decided it was the best way to achieve our goals and provide for our children in the next few years. Whilst it's hard and probably the catalyst for my wife's current feelings, we both want it to work.

Physically she is feeling nauseous most of the time, tired, introverted and almost scared to interact with new people and has become uncharacteristically forgetful and disorganised.  She's finding it difficult to cope with the kids routines and nursery runs balanced with work, and her therapy outlet in the past - running - isn't practical when you are home alone and can't leave the kids unsupervised. Relaxing in a bath or trying to chill doesn't seem to work as she can't slow her mind down to get any benefit from that, so recently the anxiety level is high and its hit hard. 

Some may simply say quit your job - and I am prepared to do this but even if this turns out to be the right thing, it takes time to find something else paying the same level so we can afford to cover our budget (and we don't spend a lot on ourselves).  We are not being greedy or materialistic we are just trying to work towards a nice home in a safe area with a good community and some financial security for later life and children. 

She has been on anxiety medication before and takes a low dose of fluoxetine daily but in our new area our GP seems a bit more old school and is a bit ""just pull yourself together and deal with it"" 

I feel really guilty that I have caused this and I am trying to relieve the pressure by taking on as many jobs/errands/online research etc. I can do while I am away in the evenings to take the mental pressure of day to day organising away, I've hired some home help, and I am hoping to get family to chip in more regularly with childcare/moral support. 

But these are all practical solutions - this is something we find difficult to talk about together and I struggle to find things to say/do that will help and not sound like the typical man trying to fix everything and ends up in an argument. 

I really want her to feel better but I am pretty useless and I don't know if it's anxiety, stress, depression or just being exhausted, or all four, or even if I am posting in the right sub! Hope this all makes sense. 

TL;DR - want to help my wife with her anxiety and stress problems but I am away a lot and don't know where to start. "

I mean it's fine and pretty and unique but it's kind of a lateral move as it's still DTLA and still another fucking apartment. Just further away from Grand Park, which is a nightmare. Ultimately I want to live in a quiet neighborhood but Los Angeles is hilariously expensive. I get to live in an apartment or no where. Can't afford anything else. Partner doesn't want to move further out. I just feel so wiped out.  I have important matters to attend to and my brain and body are noping out every time I try to tackle a goal. I was just looking at couches ffs and now all I want to do is go on our current couch, and pass out for the rest of the night. I am sick of this shit. Nothing can get accomplished if I'm constantly shorting out.

[Seeking Advice] TTC but anxiety is making it difficult,"My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 6 months now, with no luck. I have a feeling this can be attributed to my own anxiety. I get stressed out over everything, and I'm not sure why (this really seemed to have developed over the past year or so). Then, not having success with conception just adds insult to injury, increasing my anxiety (what if I cant have kids?!)

I already workout regularly, which use to do the trick and now it really isn't enough (working out too much or too little makes it worse). I have a glass of wine or beer, but that also just seems to make it worse these days. I also eat a fairly healthy diet. I went to get a massage and the guy was just terrible, and didn't help all to much. I have ADD, which may cause part of it, but I dont take meds, using exercise to regulate it.

My upper back is so tense on a daily basis from the stress.

My husband is the exact opposite, and ""chill"" about everything. I really wish I could be more like him. I started writing in a journal, in hopes it will help in the long term.

Does anyone have advice to naturally reduce stress in hopes of conception in the near future?"
"But really, should we elope or do the complete wedding thing??","Recently engaged and realizing the pricetags of a wedding......yeah yeah yeah there are ways to be cheap about it but who really wants to go to a cheap wedding? If we'd do it we thought we would do it right and we thought a budget of $10k -$12k would do it, but honestly everything adds up fast, especially when you live in a destination wedding state. Looking at you married people here for advice, is the big 1 day/night, stress, and money really worth it? Or should we say fuck it and elope and go on a 3 week honeymoon??"
"College is kicking my ass, and I do not know how to handle it!","I've never been so overwhelmed in my life, a giant wave has knocked me off my surfboard and I don't know how to get back on. I'm a college freshman at a major university (ASU), and I'm failing in all aspects. For one, I cannot handle my roommate. He's an international student from China and all he does every day is play League of Legends on his laptop obnoxiously clicking his mouse 24/7. It's not just that, on top I'm doing horrible in class, I have a ridiculous amount of schoolwork that I'm finding impossible to complete. As far as the social aspects, I've not bonded with anyone and the depression of being alone so often is starting to hit hard. I've talked to my parents and I'm moving back over winter break and living with them while attending the local community college back home. Anyhow, what I'm trying to say is, how the hell am I supposed to make it 2 1/2 more months here?!?!"
Stressed by work + medical issues. Any advice?,"Hi all, I'm having a bit of a rough summer right now. I like to think that I'm generally a high-functioning individual, but it seems that life is kind of just screwing me at the moment. I'm working in a pretty renowned research lab, and I'm in the middle of writing a draft for a paper I hope to have published, and it is due next week, along with a whole bunch of data analysis that will likely require my full focus and attention for the next couple of days (long days + nights). However, other things in my life are dragging me down and it's making me very anxious and unable to perform at my best level. 

I've been sick for a couple of weeks now, with a combination of allergies, cold, and sinus infection. My sinus infection is getting better, but I'm visiting the doctor again today as my ears still seem to be clogged as a result of the infection or something. For about two weeks, my eyes had also been bothering me (very itchy), and when I finally went to the eye doctor two days ago, I was told that I had some sort of allergic conjunctivitis, and that I would be unable to wear my contacts for two weeks. This is even more stressful as I really hate wearing glasses since they are heavy and uncomfortable on my face. I've made efforts to improve my situation + health as well. I've been getting 8 hours of sleep a night, going to the gym about twice a week, and I've just stopped my year-long habit of smoking weed every day (I'm on day 6 of not smoking now). I wanted to be totally sober so I can focus during this important period in my life, but it seems that kicking the habit has resulted in a bit of withdrawal effects too (random bouts of sadness, although it is getting much better now by day 6). My trouble is that I'm already stressed about this big important paper that I'm writing, but all these smaller things in my life are just dragging me down and making it so hard to just sit down and do work. I try to find time to relax (watched a movie last night), but I'm worried that my efforts to relax will ultimately lead to inaction and a failure to complete my work, and I just don't know how to balance everything right now. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated in this super stressful time. "
Reducing Stress and Anxiety; 3 Things That Work For Me,
How do I concentrate after stressful day at work?,"This is the summer between college and I am back with my family. After work, I often have to finish some mundane work things. However, I get home late and am stressed, which leaves me unable to concentrate. I live in somewhat noisy place and it is hard to concentate. How can I relieve stress and get back to concentrating mode?

I also don't have much space for myself to work at home so that makes it hard, in addition to the stress."
Best way to come down from a high stress environment?,"Hi everyone,

Just curious about the best way to transition from a super high stress environment (last week of my internship, my project doesn't work, tomorrow will be my 21st consecutive day in the office, a 10 hour day is a short one, etc) to a significantly less stressful one (driving across the country with some friends, generally having fun).

In the past, when I've gone from a state of high stress to a state of low stress, I tend to get really sick (immune system slowing down or something like that), so I'm hoping for ways to avoid that.  I've been sure to get at least 8 hours of sleep every night, and I've been eating pretty well (not much exercise, but no one's perfect), so I'm wondering if there's anything else I can do to hopefully avoid the inevitable illness.

Thanks in advance!"
Work related stress and tripping to sleep,"I'm looking for some advice, not for myself but for someone I know.

They are currently away from work due to stress created in the working environment, I don't think they should go back to work at all and I'm hoping they won't. 

The issue is that this person is having serious trouble sleeping, waking up in pools of sweat and once they get to sleep it typically disturbed and interrupted as their brain tackles their stress during sleep.

Has anyone had any experience with this/can offer any advice?

The first time it happened I went to the doctor and went on anti biotics, I think I had 2/3 different types and it cleared up after five weeks. This was end of November.
I work as a self employed musician and tutor so my work is very mentally demanding and obviously not the securest of professions! I decided to start exercising and have been going to the gym since the last episode but they came back on Tuesday/Wednesday. I was very stressed about a number of things and it just built up until I started having pain and then I noticed lumps again the next morning.

Help/advice with my situation?,"I'm not sure if it's the right place to be posting about this but maybe someone can help.

I'm not depressed i don't think but i am unhappy in allot of ways, i've taken the right actions to correct the things that make me unhappy but in ways it's all action of doing rather than emotion.

I've had a wonderful two days of feeling just feeling alive rather than dull and was at ease. There were moments in the last two days that situations that were stressful didn't impact how they normally would. That was all going ok until a call there with the gf and she got stressed over xbox working and in an instant i felt just back to how i've lived my life for the last year at least. I felt numb, like glass came down over my heart and body as a defensive action.

I finished the call and i said in my head and then out loud to myself that she was not stressed or annoyed at me but towards the xbox not working. It didn't change anything, i still feel how i feel, having felt great and to go back to this is horrible. I'm tired of living my life this way.

I think this kind of defensive action in my head started when i was a kid and my dad kinda messed me up by treating me like an adult and telling me things i shouldn't know at a young age. I've done cbt and it did help to an extent but i cant afford it right now and god there comes a point where you think, why cant i just feel? feel like a normal person. I had 2 days of it and now i'm back. I feel like that joanna newsom lyric in a 'fist fight with the fog'. I can understand intellectually what's wrong but cant figure how to fix my emotions.

I might go to a doctor but you know anti depressants may be the prescription and i've been on them before years ago but dont feel this is it at all. It feels like an inability to cop with certain stressful situations and even those i cant even quantify or grasp which situations.

Messed up at work and don't know how to tell my boss,"I was working on a software at work that requires us to put in comments whenever we change/save anything to keep an audit trail. A couple of weeks ago when I was writing in a comment, the software froze and I didn't notice and continued to type a couple of letters before I realized and stopped. When the software finally unfroze, it typed in some of the letters that I was typing when it was frozen (not all of the letters so what was written doesn't make any sense) and saved the comment and changes  on its own. I'm guessing, I must have pressed the Enter key as well while it was frozen.  When this happened, no one was around, it was the end of the work day and everyone had already left for the day.  I went home really stressed and did not bring it up to my supervisor the next day. I had made a mistake a couple of weeks before that and on top of this I just did not want to get in trouble.  I just wanted to avoid thinking about it. My mental health had been shit those few weeks due to the mistakes I've made at work and other stuff in my personal life.  I'm  new to the job and on top of the mistake from a couple of weeks ago, I just didn't want my supervisor to regret hiring me and my anxiety/stress levels are high as it is and I didn't want it to get any worse. I got really busy at work after that and I didn't get a chance to tell my supervisor.

 

Anyways, I'm now realizing I should've just said something when it happened. The software freezing could've happened to anyone. I dont want people to find out about my mistake through an auditor so I  want to tell my supervisor soon. I just dont know how to bring it up and what to say without looking like a big idiot. I'm stressed I'm going to get fired or in trouble for not saying anything.  Any advice on how to tell my supervisor?"

"So, I ended up staying up super late because my neighbor didn't know how emergencies work.","So, I have this neighbor that calls me every time something happens. Any emergency I'm getting called. I don't have official emt training, i don't have the medical equipment at all other than for personal use, I do have some triage training from growing up poor and from the south, so there is that. I've got some RN training and I have a cool head under pressure because of a ridiculous amount of siblings.

I am playing FO4, just minding my own, and playing the nuka-world DLC because i've not played that one to death yet. and my phone that had been playing youtube videos is suddenly ringing. I pop my headset from the computer and into the phone. answering. because if it's a number i know, and they're calling, it's bloody important.

So, she is shouting over the carbon monoxide alarm telling me it's going off..... SMH.

""Get the baby, get the dog, and evacuate the house NOW. Come upstairs, call 911, and i'll call the gas company.""

Sure enough they're in the breezeway in front of my door, i make one of the guys sit down as he's showing signs of exposure.. (Dizziness, sudden headache, stumbling with words etc...) I check out the baby and my pregnant friend for immediate dangers, she's on the phone with the cops, i'm on the phone with the gas company, and noticed two of the neighbors hanging out on the balcony above us. I called up to them to gtfo, there's a gas leak in the building. They checked for neighbors, (only four occupied at that moment on our side of the building. problem is there are four apartments each on levels 1 and 2, and two units on the bottom. it's a weird setup. and that's just my half of the building. so, doubling that means 10 apartments evacuated.)

So, the only warm-ish, not raining night this week we end up hanging out outside with people we basically never talk to because we have different schedules and when we get home, we're done socializing for whatever day. I'm talking to a neighbor i've never seen the entire three years i've been here, and we're basically being pushed further and further back away from the building and across the main ""Street"" that goes through the center of the apartments to the back end.

Spent about an hour and a half total just waiting on everything to be cleared so we could have access to our homes. I took a guy to the back end of my apartment and showed him where the roofing guys messed up and put a leak into the heat/air vent and the exhaust from my gas water heater. Completely effed up my METAL pipes and rusted completely through without us knowing about it. So, turned out the gas company messed up my account and shut off my gas.. he came back in to re-light the pilot lights for the setups and found a second one next to ours, and i didn't check with the other gas employee but i'm going with the assumption that it won't be the last.

TLDR: Got evacuated because of a gas leak, i evacuated the upstairs neighbors, then the fire dept came out, the gas company took forever to get out here, and i'm always the first person called during an emergency. go figure."

My Home,"I have just recently moved out of my childhood home. Both my mother and I got an apartment together to escape my abusive father. It's me, her, and a couple who are our roommates. 

My mother decided recently she wanted to move back to the house we escaped from because she wants to "" take control"" of the house when my parents ultimately divorce. 

The problem is that our land owner will not allow just me and my roommates too stay on the lease since I don't have at least a year of rent experience. My mother has to cosign for me in order for us to keep the apartment but she refuses. She said that she would rather put in a thirty day notice for the entire apartment and everyone would have to find their own place to stay after that. 

I don't have a place to go. My childhood home is abusive and I wouldn't be allowed to stay there because of my bad relationship with my dad. I am scared, and I feel hopeless. Just wanted to vent my frustrations out. Thank you for reading. "
A little story of my stressful experiences,"Over the past few years I have been having depressed mood and thoughts that only began to grow stronger as time went on. In that time I had a girlfriend who I cared about very much for nearly 2 years. Long story short, she ended up cheating on me, and it was one of my least favorite experiences and it ended up giving me some bad trust issues. For a long time there was nothing but intrusive thoughts that made me want to stop thinking and living. 

After about 2 months I met someone new. She put a genuine smile on my face and allowed me to get out of bed with some sort of purpose. The problem ended up being that it shortly became a long distance relationship and it makes me worried and stressed when she can't be there with me even though I know there is nothing that can be done about it.( Her mother hates me and tries to limit our communication as much as possible) There is nothing I wouldn't do for her, so I plan to do whatever it takes to make her happy. 

 I have been preparing for my future and thinking of what I need to do. College is coming around the corner and I am very worried about all the debt that will be coming from there on out. I will end up needing 8 years of it for the profession that I want so I doubt that it will be affordable. I am taking AP classes that not only take up time during school but around an hour and a half of my free time at home. I have a job that I do not get enough hours to justify for gas and other expenses. I have recently been pulled over by a state trooper (for an exaggerated  reason that can't be argued in court) so that will set me back a few hundred dollars.

Aside from this information the only other thing causing my stress is myself and my thoughts. I am constantly baraging myself with thoughts of the future and how miserable it will probably end up being. I keep on believing that it will be a constant cycle of boring work, finances, basic needs in life, and time fillers for everyday life. It seems like it will be that for my future and I can't think of a good substitute for it. I can't think of a realistic future that I will enjoy.

What about my girlfriend? I want to be with her more than anything in the world, but she is across the country right now. I dream of traveling to go be with her but life gets in the way of it. 

There are probably a ton of little details that I could add, but this is all I have at the moment. If you have read this, I would really appreciate some sort of feedback of what I should do."

Can we adapt to stress & is it causing ill health?,"**Stress** is so common nowadays, and it is something none of us can avoid. Dan L. Lieberman discusses in his brilliant book *""The Story of the Human Body Evolution Health & Disease""* that numerous of our chronic health disorders such as particular forms of **Cancer, Heart Disease, Arthritis, Diabetes and Gout** can be attributed to mismatches between ourselves and our current environment - and it's how we are **not adapting to the Stress of everyday life**. 

Today you can learn what exactly the stress response is, how the body responds to stress and how you can use certain tools for ultimate stress management and more importantly how you can react better to stress.

&#x200B;

I always had a stressful life, during the past 10 years i have always worked in fast pace environments / jobs, dealt with toxic people and i have always survived. Now i am in a really stress-free environment, but for some reason i am looking to create stress for myself. I start to worry about things that does not even matter. My latest obsession is my teeth / gum. I started to check them very regularly, meaning, maybe 20-30 times a day. I had my teeth checked twice in last month and i am going to see another doctor next week. I dont get satisfied when they say everything is okay, just because i see or at least think that my gum is recessing. What will happen if they do? Nothing! Besides the possibility to loose a tooth, which can be replaced with some amount of money, i can't get myself not thinking about it.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone that can give me a piece of mind on this? I am someone who does not usually stress for things that can be bought by money and yet i am literally obsessed with my teeth. Anyone been in same situation?"

Breathing again,"I have good days and horrible days. Well, today started out really great and breathing was fine, staying focused at work until the down time. I sat down, temperature in the room was hot and dry. I started to focus on the way my mouth felt, dry. I drank water and it was ok for a couple minutes. In those minutes, I’m saying to myself “ok, good! Just dried out”. Well, a couple minutes later, I’m dried out again, told myself “am I breathing”? Started to freak out. Heart rate got going quick, so I get up and walk around. Got a little dizzy and just super worked up. Take deep breaths it helps for the moment. Mind is still triggered on my mouth being dried out. 

Time to go home... in the car with a buddy who gives me rides home. It’s cold, so in my mind... “ahhh yeah! Cold fresh air!”. He turns on the heater. It takes a couple minutes for my mind to realize the change. I start to focus on the change in the way my mouth feels. From a cold sensation in which I feel the air come in, to dried out and my mind saying I’m not breathing. Try to work through it on the way home but couldn’t. Breathing techniques didn’t work because of the hyper focus on dried out mouth. Rushed to roll the window down as I’m starting to panic and it came down just a tad. Buddy Chuck doesn’t realize my freak out because I’m use to this and didn’t really make a big scene but boy, I’m all worked up at this point. Something about me rolling it down and getting just a taste of fresh air to remind me I’m breathing, takes away the delusion of not having air. 

Stress is hard to go through. The mind set during the time, like “I’m going to die”. Is the WORST EVER! After the melt down and battle of the mind, all I can say is I’m alive and shall keep looking forward to the future and not be stuck and settle for nothing. All because my mind is saying “I don’t believe I’ll survive”. Like I really know anything about the body. 
I do believe I need to practice better ways of focusing my attention to prevent these from happening. ALSO living a life that my mind knows that I should. Meaning, live by my convictions because if not, you will ALWAYS have those thoughts in your heart and mind that create an unsettling rollercoaster of emotions.

I'm in a complicated ass relationship. When I'm not talking to her I feel like ""ahh I love this bitch we went through so much together n we had good times, getting to know new people is long I'd rather just be back"". When I talk to her, we disagree a lot. Her views are different n it's like she's trying to feel rebellious n ""free"" by disagreeing. Then I get home and I get pissed off cos I don't know where to go from here.....in terms of everything....which leads to more stress. Right now, all I can feel is ""fuck this"" which stresses me out too cos I should probably be doing some productive shit. I'm not doing well. I started smoking hash again after 9 months THC-free.

How do you deal with stress based eating?,"Whenever i am stressed(and recently pretty often + depression) - i tend to eat a lot. I always want to snack on something. Salty. Sweet. I know i am not hungry, because i don't feel like passing out and i know what and how much i ate during the day.

I hope someone can help me please!,"Hello, I am going through an extreme amount of stress/anxiety/bad luck sinse September . It would take me an hour to list everything. :(

Here is how my life is now... 

I know some  things that would help but some days I can't leave my house (just another trigger)

I would love to go out and walk. Kind of hard when I'm crying Alot....I've tried just can't go.i get little panic attacks. It has greatly helped in the past. 

Doc keeps telling me to take Adavin. Yes I have taken them, they calm me down for a few hours then wake up to stress... Took one today didn't help... Can't figure that one out... 

Talk therapy was told a month or two.. Now I'm told end of January and she says she never told me month or two. Yup thanks for kicking me while I'm done! 

Pysicatrist increased my Lyrica (for anxiety) 
Not helping yet. (only been a week) He told me I worry too much ( I know that) I'm not good at being alone (yup thanks for the info) and everyone has losses. Also I've tried so many antidepressants that just cause terrible reactions. 

All my so called friends ignore me or are ""busy"" I was Always there for them. Now I'm reaching out to people I haven't talked to in years. I'm getting sick of hearing if you need me call me. When I need them they aren't around = more stress. 

Only thing that helps is talking to distress lines. They calm me down then boom! Anxiety is back. About an hour later. I have NOONE to talk too. = stress

I've taken dbt/cbt classes. Yes I've tried grounding techniques and get frustrated after a bunch don't work.

Cannot Afford a pyscologist. Not working sinse September.  And $100-$200 an hour is crazy! It may not even work. 

Journaling use to work but now all i  write about how I hate my life. It mostly stresses me out even more. 

Just found out yesterday mom might have cancer. Have to wait a month or so for biopsy then wait for results. We Thought we would get results yesterday. I'm very impatient. I couldn't even go there and it broke my heart. 
Mom is the only person I have. I cannot let her know how bad I really am, she does not need to see me like this. She's stressed out too! And thought of loosing her is way too much to handle. I'm trying to think positive. But keep hearing the word mass.... 

Meditation/deep breathing is okay but right now I can't even focus. Trust me I've tried. 

Holding ice cubes do not help. 

Usually putting on some vicks vabout rub helps. I know sounds silly but does help and chewing gum too. 

If anyone has any suggestions, I really appreciate it. I don't care how silly there are. They may help! Thank you so much!

Please help.,"Okay, so I’m starting to feel extremely stressed recently and would like a way to cope with it. 

Basically a few months ago my friend started feeling depressed and contemplating suicide and despite how often I tell him to seek help he says he emailed therapists and they all refused to help him. He uses him being suicide to get things to go his way as well ( once when he ran out of money to buy food he asked me to buy it, I said I only had enough for me so he guilt tripped me about being depressed). He has done it to lots of people and says every night that he is going to kill himself but then never does anything. Not even self harm. 

This also affects my family life as I come home everyday feeling stressed and this causes conflict in my family. (I still live with my mum and she works hard and travels a lot so she is also stressed) so I try to bottle it in to not give her more stress but then it eventually comes out in the form of arguments, because we both try to bottle in our emotions, so we end up falling out and both feeling very upset.

Please can someone help me find a way to cope with all of this, it would mean a lot to me."
A helpful video on a holistic approach to manage time! (stress management),[https://youtu.be/sZ4trlBWvXI](https://youtu.be/sZ4trlBWvXI)
Last school year,"I´m in final school year of electrical engineering and I´m doing a practical project so that I won´t have to repeat a ton of things for practical finals (which include the practical side of electrical enginnering and programming). The thing is, my teacher gave me the materials for the project way too late, and now I have to submit it next week, which stresses me the fuck out because I have about 4 days left to finish AN ENTIRE PROJECT (from the schemes to part list). And on top of that, I have to learn literature and slovak language for oral exams (which I have, by a coincidence, also next week) and I have to finish reading a book so I can make a review of it (it´s not optional, everybody was given a book in my class), WHICH ALSO HAS DEADLINE SET FOR THE NEXT WEEK.  


I´m stressing this entire fall break, I´ve been learning for 5 days for about 8-10 hours a day, and I haven´t finished nothing, even after making a schedule (breaks every 45 minutes, dedicating one day to one thing).  


When I feel stressed, I feel like I´m about to throw up (or I´m about to cry) and I get anxious to the point of total mental breakdown. I have ADHD and stress gets to me really easily, because I can´t keep my attention in place.   


Any ideas on what to do in this situation?   


PS: I am 50/50 INFP/INTP-T (50/50 dominant and inferior functions), that might have something to do with it but I´m not quite sure about it."

Idk what i should do and needed advice (very long read),"So first and foremost, this is a throwaway account. 

So I'll get right to it; my parents are on the verge of losing their house and possible divorce next year. This is all stemming from my dads hoarding issue. So you might say ""JuSt CaLl A tHeRaPiSt"" — Wrong! (Thats my breaking point step). I honestly don't want to seem too intrusive/forceful. I know by the end of it well all be in family counseling. 

So we've been dealing with his issue for decades (I'm 24). It was manageable or more so non-classifiable because its not acute interest like buttons or newspapers. Back then it was just stuff to help be frugal and/or a hobbyist in engineering (granted that's what he retired from now). His real hobby is hunting, fishing, etc. He'll grab a few trash like objects and turn them into a quick fix or a (very) useable tool. My guess is more of a survival instinct.

Fast forward to my HS graduation. I'm descending into college. I'm 18 and I'll be leaving home for the first time. At this point, you can see that my dad like to ""collect"" things but it not like our house looks like and episode of Hoarders (yet). 

Fast forward 18 months, I'm transferring to a college closer to home. Between traveling and not being able to find a job in the barely populated, conservative, town I was in, it was in the best interest. Also a key point, I changed my major from Veterinarian Bio to general Psychology since my hometown college didn't have vet bio. 

I come home and not much has changed. My dad has pack a few corners (not a lot of stuff, just a box or two here and there), but my mothers demeanor and tone and changed. It's was very unsettling mostly because I'm closer to my parents than my sibling (my only brother is 12 yrs OLDER than me and wants nothing to do with the household. A whole separate issue I can tell upon request).

My mother tells me that she has come under fire from the city about the accumulation in the backyard (also by this point the basement has looks more like nature trails in terms of home to maneuver). It went from multiple warnings and phone calls to fines amounting to $1400 (three times with increases each penalty; Total to date In fines = $5900). Also a lean has been put on the house because the Electric and Heating company put in a notice/complaint to the city about the basement when coming to read the meters.

Fast Forward to current year. My mother and I are doing everything we can to clean up the house before winter comes again (this is a northern state, US). I feel not only at odds but completely conflicted emotionally towards my father. It's has gotten to the point where I have walked in on my mother crying to herself about how she got into this situation. More than once I have heard her questioning her religion; ""why aren't my prayers being answered"". 

All the while we offer solutions for him to get rid of his stuff be its like he doesn't want to listen. My dad will sometimes completely ignore and disregard what is being said. I've even tried sitting him down and not only expressing my concerns about their well being but also my feeling on how I feel as his son. He went on rant (not aggressive) about how he worked all 50 something year's for the stuff he has and how everyone want to just thrown it away. And at that point I feeling like a gave up (it being 6 yrs to this day since I've graduated High school and grasped an idea). 

I currently want nothing from him. I still love my father and would do for him as he is still my dad but I don't trust him at all!! I did not mention the fact that he'll go through the garbage to see what me and my mother thrown out. I have also made a list of some of my friends trash pick up days so he can't get to some of the stuff. 

I'm just tired of feeling like he doesn't care. Like he doesn't care about what happens to my mother, our home, their safety, or even how I feel about any of that!! 

Edit: A list of thing that is now junked up or a contribution to such:
-Basement (serpents path and I currently go to the laundromat because the dryrr broke and we can't just wheel a new one down there or call in a fixer)
-Attic (currently working on and coming along great! :D)
-backyard (I might attach a picture)
-3 storage units (yes, 3 separate 'rent-a-storage' units amounting to $390/mnth or $4680/yr)
-His sister's 2 car Garage that he FILLED (This is funny because he possible lost all that due to her eviction. No sympathy)
-His own 2 car garage that ""you'll need a shovel to make a path"" (that is a quote from my mother when I came back from college. We go through presidents more often than he opens it)

Stress and lump in throat (globus),"Hey guys,

I recently started a new job about 4 months ago and ever since I've had this globus sensation whenever I started feeling a little stressed out. It started with the new job and has continued ever since. It's pretty much a daily occurrence now and I hate it! When my stress goes down the globus sensation goes away, when it comes back up it returns.

 About a month or two ago I saw my doctor about going on an anti anxiety med for general anxiety disorder (GAD) and was put on Lexapro. I've never taken an SSRI before, but I find it has helped me tremendously with my other anxiety symptoms. However, the globus still remains and I'm at my wits here about how to stop this sensation.

Has anyone here experienced this? Is there a way to treat this?

Thanks!"
Psychology Class Project,"Hello everyone! 

So I have a Psychology class project where we are focusing on stress. For the project we are supposed to interview people about their stressors and ask them about it. Is there anyone on here that drinks alcohol when they're stressed? 
You also have to be 25 years old or older, and don't consume alcohol recreationally or on a regular basis. The interview is, like I said above, only for when you drink when stressed. 
I would really appreciate any help and it might be great for you too since you're talking to someone about your stress instead of keeping it in!!"
Short-term solutions to bad home situations,"Hi, this is my first time on this sub. I've been extremely stressed in general lately (friends moving away, schoolwork, my job, etc) but I was kind of, in some weird way, managing it fine. I wasn't unhappy. I still had fun. 

&#x200B;

But now I'm being hit like a bus with all these things. I have two big exams this week and last night there was a big family emergency that kept me up and was very emotionally stressful. The things going on in my life have caused me to fall a bit behind in school, and I was so upset after last night that I skipped half my classes today. I know I'm probably overestimating how stressed I really am, but if I continue like this, I feel like I'm going to have a stress-induced episode of psychosis. 

&#x200B;

Things at home are still terrible and I can't ask for extensions on assignments/exams this late. I can't afford therapy. Does anyone have any short-term stress-relieving techniques that can just get me through these next few days? I think I need something a little more intense than a breathing routine to help me through this."
Overthinking a situation,"Hey Reddit,

Just to put my current situation into a little more context, I'm currently living away from home, at university and I've just started my final year.

I'm constantly finding myself in the same situation over and over where I'm overthinking about a certain assignment/piece of work/being single/my future after university (finding myself a good, secure job with good income). This seems to get me down in the dumps quite a lot, sometimes I get so lost in this trail of thought that it counters my productivity. 

I'm also finding it really hard to direct myself away from these negative feelings most of the time, I just feel like I'm always stuck in a loop. 
 
My question is how do people handle this? I currently find time management a big issue, this is where all the work related stress comes from. I've just moved into a new place where I'm living with positive, motivated people but this only helps me around 70% of the time, the other 30% I'm left twiddling my thumbs and starting the cycle all over again. I want to make myself the best person that I can be, get good grades at university without the pain and trauma that comes with over thinking a situation.

Does anyone have any experience with this and could possibly help me out? Thanks."

For example, if I am on the phone by the end of the phone call I realise I've been holding the phone with excessive force and my fingers are hurting by the end of it without even realising. Another example is when I'm concentrating on a task I'll be grabbing a piece of my clothing (that I'm wearing, so sort of hugging body or putting my hand on my lap) with my left hand for example and forming a fist around it really tightly and won't even realise I'm doing it until I need to use my left hand.

interesting technique to avoid stress,"Hello guys, Have you ever practiced a meditation? I've been practicing this one [http://dimensionalconsciousnessacademy.com](http://dimensionalconsciousnessacademy.com/) for 3-4 years with a lot of positive results. I think it's quite different from all the meditation that you can find in the web, but still for me it is amazing, this meditation changed my life (i dont have anxiety attacks anymore, i feel more confident with myself and i actually enjoy my life a lot more since i introduced this practice in my life). If you tried a lot of different things to avoid your stress and your anxiety or whatever other problem you might have but it didn't work out, i definitely suggest to try it, it is completely free.

Fucked up ordering at my cafe.,"I work at a cafe at University, and we just opened for business for this school year. It is my first time taking over such a large-sales location, after having been pulled from the smallest-sales location on the other side of campus due to my higher than average ratings in customer service skills.

Naturally, coming from a smaller scale operation, you get comfortable with a smaller menu, smaller workforce, smaller numbers, etc. I busted my ass trying to make sure we were ready and equipped for opening by ordering heavily. And we were ready! Our first day was great...

The problem lies with the fact that while using the par-sheets (numbers that we should maintain for product between calling in orders to our food providers) from the previous ""perfect"" manager's order guides has left me SEVERELY limited on our best selling ingredient, with no hope of lasting until my next conceivable order day. 

This was even after I had ordered heavily prior to opening (doubling his pars, etc.) to compensate for heavy-opening traffic. Now, I DO have avenues and contingency plans set in place to get myself ""by"" until I can rectify this. However, here I am at 3AM-4AM reaching out for help because of the crushing amount of stress I am feeling, robbing me of the precious sleep I need to survive my 12-hour shift tomorrow.

It doesn't help that I have begun to question what my purpose in life even is anymore. All of my younger friends are more successful than I am. They are married, have houses, and have all sorts of closeness and happiness going on for them. I felt like this was the one thing I could do, that I could have, and here I have potentially fucked it all up and will be facing such scrutiny and embarrassment as a result, after the regional manager of the company I am contracted through said he had high hopes for me.

I just want to curl up and die. This is what my life feels like now. I goofed off in school and now this is my reward: Crushing stress, low pay, crap benefits, and a mountain of student loan debt that will eventually, literally kill me off.

I can't break free from this and I do not know what to do about anything. Please help. Or just wish me the best. I feel so cut off and alone."
Can’t eat due to stress,"I’ve been feeling incredibly stressed recently and I can’t eat properly. I’ve lost an unhealthy amount of weight in the past two weeks because I can’t eat. I know that I should be eating, but the thought of food makes me feel really sick. 
Does anyone have any tips on how I should start eating again?"
You don't deserve this,"I believe everyone deserves their own way to happiness

but people always point the figure at you, making you look like a freak.

You're not living the typical standard life. So people tend to oppose who you are.

go to the doctor, go see a psychologist. You're sick, you are weak.

Maybe the best remedy you ever needed was self care.

I've been home bound due stomach problems, and I've been JUDGED and JUDGED.

Why are you losing weight? you look pale. I feel like a freak. Some days I just don't want to be alive.

People come into my life promising me so many things. Love, affection, jobs. Then they turn away.

It's my fault, I should have known better. Nobody owes me anything.

But you owe it to yourself to be with people who care about YOU even at your lowest.

Look how people turn away from you when you are constantly sick, and you wish you thought it was a joke.

But it's not, it's my current reality. People will not stay when you are unhealthy, eventually they will dispose of you at some facility. Because they cannot be there for you much longer. Stress will stay as long as you want it to stay. Eventually it becomes a conditional problem that you are use to. "

"Potentially going to the dentist soon, absolutely petrified.","Hi everyone,

I have an extreme fear of the dentist. Every time I sit in that dentist chair, my heart's beating at a million miles an hour, praying that he doesn't tell me I have a cavity. This has led to me not going in 3 1/2 years. The last time I went I was 15, 2 years after the time before that. Luckily I didn't have a cavity then. I know symptoms of a cavity are often pain and/or sensitivity but I don't have that and my teeth aren't significantly discoloured either. That being said, I do have some tartar buildup and mild gingivitis so I should probably go. I've never had a cavity in my life and I really don't want one now. The concept of drilling through my teeth is just too much to bear."

Introduction To a Stress Headache:
what is a stress headache 

The reason for writing a detailed post on stress headache is my encounter with this monster. Like everyone else I also have my own shares of ups and downs in my life. I have an encounter with a headache a lot many times. Sometimes I was able to understand the reason behind a headache and sometimes I was NOT.

The country from where I belong, headache is not taken very seriously. Most people treat it as a very ordinary thing and they take some medicine for temporary relief. Most people aren't aware of the problems that a headache can lead to.

A headache can be associated with symptoms such as 

Vertigo
Nausea
Vomiting
Vertigo
Stroke
Tenderness of the Scalp.
And many more...

Can you die from a regular headache?

Any Guess?

The answer is Yes.

Before I answer this question, let's discuss a technical term 'Thunderclap'. It is also called lone acute severe headache that is sudden and reaches a very high intensity in an idiosyncratic span of time.

Many doctors believe that the blood leaking from a brain aneurysm causes Thunderclap kind of a headache and there are chances that it can lead to the death.

Again an important question I would like to put in front of my readers.

Can you get a brain damage because of a headache?

Again my answer is Yes...

A migraine is a form of a severe headache and frequent migraine can lead to brain damage.
You will be surprised to know that 20 MILLIONS of AMERICANS suffer from a migraine.

As published in AmericaMedicalal Association Journal, frequent Migraines are associated with an increased likelihood of brain lesions.

The real reason behind a migraine is still a mystery. Some connect it to the genetic while other beliefs a person having Migraine problem has a sensitive nervous system.


Migraine Headaches

So let's define a stress headache, It's a common type of a headache that can lead to mild, moderate or intense pain in your head, neck or back of your eyes.

 Sometimes stress a headache gives a feeling of a tight band around the forehead. Many people call this kind of a headache as an episodic headache because of the repetitive nature of the occurrence, mostly once or twice a month.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, chronic headache affects around three percent of the US population and women are at the higher end of getting affected as compared to men.
Cause Of a Stress Headache:
A stress headache is mostly caused by muscle contraction in the neck and the head region. There are many aggregators for a stress headache. Sometimes a cold temperature can initiate the headache symptoms. A long drive or sitting in front of a computer for a longer period of time is, in fact, the two most common reasons behind a stress headache.

Other triggers involve:
Alcohol
Eye Strain
Dry Eyes
Fatigue
Smoking
Caffeine
Poor Posture
Emotional Disturbances.
Sinus Infection.
Cold or Flu.

I'm failing my classes. Advice with struggling with depression?,"I know this may seem so small, but it's really stressing me out, since I already deal with major depression, and it's just making my grades worse every semester.

I'm a 21F that's a senior in university. I have about a year left before I can graduate, but that seems like it's becoming unrealistic. I took summer classes so I can graduate early, but I'm failing those classes and they end in two days. My depression has gotten in the way of my education (I spent a couple of days last month in the crisis stabilization unit after stress cutting myself) and I have been drowning ever since. I unintentionally got off my meds after that and ended up publicly drinking and using drugs at 7am and blacking out by noon. Got arrested for a PI. So both of these events have led to me disinterested in my studies and now I will probably receive two F's in two days, when I already have a 2.8 GPA. Which makes me highly stressed as I still have work to attend to 'til then.

Has anyone gone through similar events and have they turned out better or worse for you? I guess I just need reassurance that I'm not the only one, but I feel like I will struggle more with my depression if I never come up from this."
I did a video on stress,"Hey folks! My teacher said something very wise about stress and I had to make a video about it. I just want to add to it that the theory of stress is only applicable if the stress isn‘t about survival, like for many of you folks. I just hope it helps a bit!

Help ! How to eat when stressed and lacking appetite ?,:(
Does stress work like this?," Hi everyone, 

I've had a really difficult six months. Most of that difficulty has now come to an end. During the time that the difficulties were ongoing, I didn't experience any physiological responses to stress. However, now that the stress is mostly over, I've found that I've

1) Increased the number of seizures I have. (I'm epileptic)

2) Developed constipation

3) Developed headaches

Am I correct in assuming that, sometimes, the physiological effects of stress manifest themselves once the stressful circumstances have lifted? 

Any thoughts? 

Thanks. :)"
Seven ways to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder,
Severe subconscious stress?,"So I've had stress symptoms for a few years now but it's always been subconscious. To the point where I've always gone to doctors and they've checked physical stuff, and thr conclusion has always been stress. For example, numbness in different places of body, burning/hunger sensation in stomach, intense stomach pains and cramps, pains in head, grinding teeth, very tense head muscles and jaw muscles (couldn't eat).

Anyway, it's really tearing down on me now, feels like it has really grinded my soul away. Starting to get depressive symptoms as well.

What's the best way to tackle subconscious stress? I don't really feel stressed as SUCH, so not sure what to do. I know I used to be stressed because I forced myself to stay with my ex in a town I didn't want to be in (she said she would kill herself if we broke up, long story, whatever). 

But It's been more than a year since we broke up now, and 3 years since the whole ""I'll kill myself"" thing. In the year since we broke up and I went back to my hometown, my stress symptoms have gotten worse, at least the past half year.

Have any of you dealt with subconscious stress before? Is this possibly residual stress? "

"Alright, I need help with this stupid thing.","So my summer holidays next month are coming to an end, and I have decided to learn a bit of more programming to get ahead of my class. Ad the weather was quite nice I decided to take a few days off and enjoy the nice weather, which is rare where I live.

Now when I try to ger started with coding and programming, I just get anxious like hell. I kind of start to panick a bit, and I don’t know why. I watch toturials and I get more worried when I watch them, because when I try to follow them I get seriously anxious and impatient, to the point where I just slam my laptop and lay down on my bed. 

Anything to do with this? I don’t want to bother my parents anymore about such stuff, it’s just stupid :("
Dealing with stress,"I'm a student on summer holiday and in order to get a nice looking CV, I signed up for voluntary work during Easter in a hospital. Also signed up for aviation camp because why not. Everything was fine and dandy until i decided all these were unpaid work experience and I needed some pay and interviewed for a part time job in a local fair ( Basically all-year indoors winterwonderland . Now the rules of the company is that I need to at least work one weekend per week, and the hospital has trainings nearly every 2 days. And aviation camp is 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Seems all planned out and neat? Well here's the kick up. I've been working 10 hour shifts everyday for 3 days now despite being a part time employee and instead of being an ""attendant"" I am basically repair man / cashier / cleaner and warehouse management. All for about 5 quid an hour. Its really doing a toll on my legs and head, and this is me working at ONE place. Now the hospital needs me to go work morning shifts too, I basically have to shift my actual job to late shifts or other weeks, which cause 2 problems. 1. I wake up at 7 for either places of work and return home at at least 1am. 2. I have to shift my hospital shifts to later weeks as paid work has timetables I take priority in, and it clashes with my aviation camp. Long story short, I put too much on the plate to eat.
I have not gamed, slept, relaxed or played music for 5 days (Yes its a big deal to me sorry I'm a failure ) and I am so stressed I can't sleep well or think straight, when I most need to be in order to not let these time clashes occur again. People at work work me like a donkey and its quite tough opening and closing a fking carnival when your supervisors just stand there and chat. 
Any ways to de-stress or advice ?  More details can be provided if anyone is actually willing to help."
Worried about losing new job,"I feel like I might be having second thoughts about my new job. I enjoy the work and I’m trying my best, but I’m starting to think maybe it’s not a good fit for me. I’m working at a local State Farm office, doing mostly entry level stuff. I have made some mistakes, and since this is a field I’m completely unfamiliar with (I know next to nothing about the insurance industry, and this is also my first office job ever), I feel that a few small mistakes are inevitable. However, I feel like these mistakes are being held against me. I’ve been working here for about a month, and I’ve already almost been fired twice. I want to keep this job, but I also feel like maybe I should look for something that doesn’t expect me to hit the ground running in a type of job I’ve never had before. Does anyone have any advice?"
Stress is making my irrational thoughts skyrocket and I don't know how to manage,"The way stress affects me is pretty weird. It makes me hyper-aware of any small changes in the way people close to me talk to me, then I start having irrational thoughts about *why* those changes would happen (we're talking about super small stuff here), concluding the worst. 

Usually, with everyday moderate-level stress I can manage to keep the irrationality of such thoughts at bay by means of CBT method. However, during the last 1.5 months I've been under constant, high-level stress (it didn't even really get better on weekends, and yes, I've been trying all relaxing techniquest, meditation, phyisical exercise, kept my sleeping rhythm in shape, doing whatever else I could beside the work I *had* to do that could help keeping my brains occupied in a helpful way. Didn't really help.) and even tho I'd managed to keep irrationality at bay on a day-to-day basis, it somehow still managed to add up inside me.

On weekend, I stopped for a bit because I was really tired. That was the moment when the gremlin inside my brain decided it's time to connect all the small things I've been noticing in the way a person close to me was behaving towards me in the previous 2 weeks, into one Big Horrible Thing that I *need* to panic about right *now*. One thing led to another, I panicked, said some stupid irrationality-based things to the person in question, we fought. The day after I realized what I did and apologized and explained.

Even tho me and person in question in this event made up, I would like to ask if any of you has had similar experiences. If you have, how did/do you manage? I would like to get more control of my thoughts, especially in those moments when they all seem to start connecting into this Horrible THing I need to Panic About, but I don't know how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

P.s.: I currently have no financial means to afford actual therapy. If I did, I would definitely go, but alas that's not a viable option just now. So I'm looking for any ways that don't require therapist, anything I can do myself. "
Stress or Medicine related?,"## Anxiety and/or Depression?

Hey all,

I am in my 30s and have dealt with stress/anxiety since I was a child due to family trauma that kept in states of fight/flight periodically throughout a year for at least 7-8 years. As puberty came I was an overthinker, very sensitive, a bit obsessive on certain things - particularly romance.

I had my 1st panic attack in my mid-20s and did 7 years of on-and-off again therapy (CBT/DBT), which has helped give me perspective but has not been a solution to my personality type/anxiety/stress.

Recently, I have been under an inordinate amount of acute stress and while the external stressors have dissipated my body hasn't seemed to adjust back to baseline. As I entered into the period of acute stress I was prescribed Prednisone and then stopped it abruptly after having several panic attacks, combined it has been about 6-8 weeks of random physical and emotional turbulence.

Symptoms:

1. foggy head
2. random spells of light-headed/dizzyness (particularly after working out)
3. Days of intense workouts make my symptoms worse
4. Intermittent blurry vision for distance - only started around acute stress and prednisone
5. feeling weak/out of body experience almost daily (comes in waves sometimes)
6. almost daily headaches
7. eyes feel dry
8. mouth feels dry despite drinking a ton of water and getting enough sodium in
9. Random days of panic (particularly in the evening and after hard strenuous workouts) after a few minutes of the physical symptoms then it is followed by thoughts of impending doom (life is pointless, i'll never be in the lifestyle/position I want, i'm unhappy, nothing is worth it, etc.)

These symptoms come and go, some together, some separate, some days/weeks better or worse than others. My blood work shows that I am very healthy except my White Blood Count is low even for me (normally 4.7 and currently 3.7) and Red Blood Cell count is a bit low as well.

Has anyone experienced these symptoms in isolation or together?"
Stress out due lack of time with video games,"Hi, I'm stressed out for not being able to play video games because my parents hide my console. Is this normal?

Stress allergies?,"I have high blood pressure at the age of 20. I notice when I get particularly stressed, I develop a runny nose and sneezing. I do have pollen allergies, but medicine takes care of it. 

At the moment, I have a runny nose, intense jaw pain from clenching, tension in my head, sore throat, and some IBS symptoms. 


Pretty fun, but I was wondering if anyone else goes through this and has any tips?"

Math exam is stressing me out. I need help...,"For the past year and a half, math has been a huge load of stress for me. I'm understanding the classes, and I am fairly confident, however the exams are a nightmare. I feel like no matter how much i study, how much I try, I always end up failing. It's not because math is my weak point. I'm in the top class. I used to always get at least 90&#37;. Last year, a new math co-coordinator arrived, and since then, the exams have become impossibly hard, and I've dropped to 40&#37;, went up to the sixties for the next two exams. 

With the results of around 60&#37;, with the addition of the fact that we had done this content both this year and last year with a few additions, I thought That I might get a great result. I start off well, relatively relaxed, when all the sudden half of my time is gone, and I'm nowhere near finishing. I skipped multiple sections and ended up rushing the last section, leading to silly mistakes like forgetting to square a number.

I got my results back yesterday and nearly had a heart attack. 30/80. Around 37&#37;. I'm trying to wrap my head around this. I burst into tears when I got home. This is rubbish, I studied so hard to get yet another test that was far too long. This is really stressing me out, and I'm no longer looking forward to going to class. My mother believes that I could have finished it had I studied harder, despite the fact that 50&#37; was considered a high mark. I almost feel like pleading to go down to the third highest class, because I hear that the second class, which has the math coordinator, is even worse, and more stress inducing. I've even entirely scrapped the idea of going into advanced Mathematics for my senior years.

I don't know what to do, and I'm hoping that someone can help me. This is all becoming too much."

This sucks so much right now,"So it's finally happened.  My mom got a transfer to Florida and is selling the house in the next few weeks.  I'm trying to keep myself in a positive mood but every time she calls there's added worry and stress.  I've lived in New Jersey since I was two year old and leaving puts my anxiety through the roof.  I'm going to have to leave my job, my car, my friends and the house I all love.  She's been in Florida for a few weeks living out of an AirBnB and has procured an apartment which I'm worried she didn't take the time to investigate entirely.  She wants me to get a some form of transportation that will carry our things there but the cost of the smallest U\-Haul is $1700.  She's gone through all of this without an ounce of what it will entail and she's dragging my family and me through the mud.  The only solace I get is when I'm asleep but then I wake up again to this nightmare.  My little brother and my older sister aren't stable and my grandmother has to live with an a person she doesn't even like.  My life has been a living hell for months and I honestly cannot take this anymore.  Everyone expect her loses here and the only thing she tells me is how beautiful Florida is which gives very little relief if any."
3 ways to calm your mind and reduce stress,"I use these three practices to reduce stress and calm my mind. They can be done anywhere, anytime.

1\) Get into your body

In body scan meditation, you slowly bring your awareness to the different parts of your body. You can simply notice the sensations in your body or consciously imagine softening and relaxing that part of your body. At first it might be difficult to stay focused on your body and your thoughts might take you away. But slowly, with more and more practice, it will become easier to remain focused on your body as you scan through all my body parts. You will start to feel more and more sensations and become more aware of your body as a result. You will notice where you hold tension and stress and be able to release this tension.

2\) Get into your breath

The simplest breathing technique can help you calm your mind. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. Simply, place your hands on your belly, then ribs, then upper chest and practice breathing into your hands.  At the end, you place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart and breath into your belly up to your heart and back out again. By placing my hands on your body, you can choose a certain number of breaths to count and focus on the physical sensation of your hands rising and falling. Not only do you stop thinking while you’re doing this, but also you come back to your day feeling refreshed and full of energy.

3\) Get into your senses

Another great way to stop your constant monkey mind is by getting into your senses. This one can be a meditation exercise or a writing exercise. Just going one by one, notice what you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. Spend 5 minutes and think it, say it out loud, or write it down. This is a great practice to get you back into the present moment. You may even notice things that have been around you all along that you completely forgot. You may even find that you smile or laugh at something you never even noticed.

What do you do to calm your mind and reduce stress?

I'm looking to interview a few busy and ambitious women looking to overcome stress and exhaustion and unlock their inner energy. If your available for a 20 minute interview over the next week or so, please PM me or leave a YES! in the comments.

In exchange I am happy to offer you a FREE \(no\- pitch\) private call with me to pinpoint the top thing causing stress in your life and 3 strategies to unlock your inner energy.

Thanks!"
"At work, saturday night/sunday morning, doing a solo deployment of significant code changes with no QA validation, in a company of 10k+ people","So I work for a multi-national company. Due to ""It works for me"" and ""If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It"", and ""That's the way we've always done it!"" We use an antiquated technology -- Lotus Notes. A significant minority of the company requires it for tracking various tasks throughout their workday.

Due to some changes in our _actual_ product line, we have had to make some changes to lotus notes. This decision came down the pipe _at roughly the exact same time the previous person in charge of administering lotus notes quit_. The day before that I had been a QA engineer, developing automated test cases, the day after I was the sole administrator for all lotus notes related activities within the company. Unfortunately, the company is trying to starve the beast -- make getting changes and maintenance to notes so impossible that more and more teams drop off, but that doesn't appear to be the end result.

Anyway, back to tonight's issue. I'm deploying this major change, some of the code written on the first day I'd ever seen lotus script (read: bad horrible code). I've tested it to the best of my ability with help from one other team member in the company -- I'm fairly confident I didn't break anything that wasn't already broken. It should be noted that I was not in the minority that used lotus notes prior to this responsibility shift, so I also had to get a major crash course in the business logic these notes applications followed.

That said, in this company the smallest possible entity to assign blame to is a team. Every team, regardless of size schedules regular meetings to try and root out implicit assumptions and unknowns -- ergo we can assume that whenever there is a failure, it is the entire team that failed. I'm not gonna say consequences don't occur, but they generally occur on the team level.

Except I'm a team of one, I'm here on saturday night, alone, deploying major changes while ensuring backwards compatibility and hoping and pretty and checking and double checking and triple checking that nothing explodes during my deployment. It's a wee bit stressful (and I think slightly ridiculous) that in a company the size of the company I work for I am the only person who is responsible for this without any help."
Stress Management,Stress is a big problem for a lot of people. I'm wondering what people have found most helpful when it comes to stress management?
Navy and college stuff,"So this might go over a lot of people's heads; this first part anyway,  but I'm in the Navy and I basically got told I'm getting a P eval which is not a good eval for a promotion. I suppose in the grand scheme of things it means nothing, I plan on getting out of the navy. It's just made me think about myself though. I feel like I work really hard but now that this outline of me has been created it makes me think that I can't cut it in the outside world. I'm studying a lot of math right npw taking calc 3 and physics 1 most people would say that's impressive but I feel like it's fake because I'm going to an online school. This all leads up to me transferring schools to a nice brick and mortar university where I can study electrical engineering, because I like my job as an electrical aviation tech. That eval makes me think that I can't make it in the real world and that I really don't work hard. I feel like I work hard though am I right in that I'm just lying to myself? Is all of this college just a facade? I took 12 classes last year and I feel like that's a proud accomplishment something a lot of people wouldn't normally be able to do but in the Navy's eyes its almost worthless?   


I feel like I'm trying to reason my situation though. I'm listing off things that a person would associate success with but I'm not seeing the things I'm failing at. Or maybe I do and the Navy is just exaggerating the things they want out of me? I feel like the Navy is easy and I don't put a lot of time towards it \( I mean qualifications\). When I'm at work I feel like I really  focus in on a task. When I get told I'm not performing up to standards it makes me think that me saying ""The Navy is easy"" Is just a big lie. How can I say the Navy is easy if I'm not performing to the standards but at the same time how can I be taking 12 classes and working a full time job and not be working hard? I don't understand?   


This feels like the same kind of crisis every person with an inner dialogue has about everything in life, an unexplainable circumstance that can't be validated. The only way I can know that I'm smart enough is if I go out and become and electrical engineer and that's very stressful and even then will this go away? Will I always be living with the fear of not being good enough? I feel like I'm good enough for myself and I work towards goals I want and value but then the Navy tells me those things aren't what they value. I wish I had a message from an all seeing god to tell me that ""YES YOU ARE A HARD WORKER AND YOU ARE SMART, YOU NEED HOLD YOUR GOALS IN THE HIGHEST REGARD"" I have nothing though I'll have to just try as hard as I can. God I really don't want to fail I'm so scared of failing when I get out. I feel like my whole family is watching and they all think I'm extremely smart and that I'm the only one doubting myself or that knows the truth that I'm just a colossal idiot and the Navy knows the truth. Maybe I'm that book smart person people talk about and that would be some shit. I hate that I don't like that book smart mindset, smart people should just be smart and this is too fucking long to read and I have to study and I don't know what response I want from this. "
"Is it justifiable to quit a stressful inbound call centre job with nothing else lined up, if it's impacting your mental and physical health ?","Long story short: Worked in a call centre for 4 years for a vehicle breakdown service, starting to not be able to cope with it any more due to a combination of things (change in management, not enough staff for a constantly expanding customer base, rewards based on whether your face ""fits"" rather than actual demonstrable achievements, etc).

Unable to relax after work, constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it, either intensely rageful, or wanting to burst in to tears. Headaches that go on for 3 or 4 days at a time are now a regular occurence. Starting to manifest in other physical ways (unable to sleep, constantly weary, having a lot more sickness than usual).

Desperately trying to get out of it, but the current job drains me that much I don't seem to ever have the time or energy to properly hunt for a new job, as it cuts into the fleeting time I have outside of work to spend with family, partner and enjoying hobbies. Work and the negative thoughts about it seem to devour and consume all my spare time and energy. Most of my thoughts are usually about bad calls I've had during the day, or dreading having to go into work after time off.

My family and partner have said they are willing to support me, and just want me to be happy, and I must admit, leaving this place would help enormously (free time to relax, get back to being a happier me, and time to invest in job hunting something I actually want to do as a career).

I just want to know what impartial unbiased people think. If a job is making you feel so bad that it manifests in a constant fight of flight feeling, tightness on the chest and in breathing, headaches that go on for days and generally sour your view of life: is it a good idea to just hand in my 4 week notice and spend the free time fixing myself and job hunting, in the UK's current job climate?"
What to break to relieve stress,"So far, I've been ripping paper, tearing tissues, and breaking pencils to help relieve stress. My parents have been fucking me over recently. I know you're going to say they do it because they love you, buy I have no time to be myself. I come home, work 'till 11, and am dead tired in school. About 2 hours of that is required homework. Is there anything else you reccomend breaking that hopefully has more than a one time use? Pencils have worked the best so far, thanks!"

Comparing my future self to others.,"I am currently in college and have not yet had a full time job. I feel like I am constantly stressed about how much money I will make when I get out and I can't rap my head around how much money is enough. I know people that are making $80,000 jointly a year and have three kids and are doing well. I know other people that make $170,000 jointly and are deeply in debt. I can't figure out how much you need to make to be at any specific standard of living and I have been spending several hours every few days just hopelessly scanning Youtube and Reddit in the hope of figuring it out. This is wasting hours and hours of my time that should be dedicated to studying, but once the stress comes in, it's been impossible for me to get rid of it for the rest of that day."

I went to the doctor a few years back and got meds, I don’t remember what they were. But I didn’t like them. Any tips on natural ways to relieve stress? Sometimes I can’t even get out of bed. "
My mother is stressing me beyond all reason and I am not able to withstand it more,"Im studying at a university abroad
And I have failed or got a really bad grade my first semester subjects due to starting a month late and searching for accommodation for atleast 2 weeks or I would have stayed on the streets. I have been doing my absolute best to pass but the subject were very difficult on my own....I have tried studying and watching old lectures and everything but the syllabus was too long in several cases ( mathematics was much more difficult and longer than abitur according to our professor) and exams were just too hard for me in my situation so I failed.
The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company. On top of that she demands excellent grades in future not knowing how hard it is or how hard I have worked. I dont know how to deal with her anymore she just shouts or demands things I cannot fullfill atleast as of now which gets me so much stress, fear and tears. How to deal with that?
Please note that I by no means hate her but appreciate how hard she works and sacrifices for me but I just still cant just accept this.
Also I have got in high school pretty competitive grades that allowed to be offered places at different universties"
I'm trying to be calm,"I don't like being stressed. I really, really don't. When I get stressed, I get frustrated and annoyed by little things. They build up to the point where I have to shout at people because they're either not listening or bothering me when they shouldn't. Sometimes I feel that some people are doing things just to upset me and I don't know if it's just me over thinking things or if they're actually seeking out my frustrations to make themselves look better. 

I don't believe that I'm a ticking time bomb. I believe that my mind can only be pressed so far before I snap into what feels like the angry crabs from Mario Brothers VGA. I wish there was something to help me take my stress down, so that I didn't feel this way. I don't believe that any walk, tea or hot bath will calm me down. "

Stressed about high school,I cant seem to find motivation to do any school work. I lost my motivation after February vaca. And now im 2 weeks behind in school. I have so much pressure put on me to do good in school and get into college and its just so much on me. What do I do. (SAT's next week:( )
Am I being unreasonable?,"Hi,

I'm a 25-year-old student in a vocational school for special needs people. I study office work and accounting.

I started in autumn 2016, hopeful that I would finally be able to complete something in my life. But all this school has done for me so far has been stressing me out with mundane, repetitive tasks. For a full year now, I've been the only one responsible for the accounting of our student organization and that's pretty much the only thing I do at school. My teacher keeps saying I'm the only one in our group capable of handling it. 

I'm both bored and overloaded at the same time. After school I'm too tired to do anything fun. Whenever I tell my teacher about this, he tells me to just wait. Sometimes I think about giving up, but I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt of leaving yet another school."

Gosh I have so much goddamn work I don't know what to do I keep messing up I think I do grade A studying but I don't get the grade I want cause i'm a stupid person who can't mess up along the way gosh why am I like that I feel like other people succeed and don't even try and here I am dealing with the whole burden of my family, my work, and the fact that I can't do anything cause I'm such a stupid person gosh I don't know what to do these anxiety attacks are preventing me from doing anything and I'm messing up more please help me 

Gosh, am I really who I think I am? I can't even get my driving license cause my parents won't let me as they think I'm not ready yet and so much yelling and them rubbing it in my face that I can't get it yet and everyone has gotten it. I could be doing something about my life but instead, I'm stuck at home where they don't wanna drive me even to school gosh I just the feeling of finally getting it won't even be nice as I have so much crap associated with it so many people around me so happy about geting it and getting great grades when they don't even remember half of the things they learn gosh I work so hard but I mess up on one thing and then that totally ruins me I just oh my gosh why am I like this I can't do anything right withought messing up "

Life goes up and down too quick for me,"I think I bring this stress upon myself by overthinking but anyway this is what has happened and is happening. I just need a place to vent.

Firstly, In 2017 I lost one of my best friends, they didn't pass away, they're just no longer apart my life. Moving on from her has been really difficult but I think it's for the best. I still miss her from time to time but it isn't as excruciating as it used to be. 

Secondly, I'm working on getting my passport renewed for a trip that I'm going on soon and it's in the state now where if the passport doesn't arrive on time, I won't be able to go on that trip.

Thirdly, I went snowboarding and fell pretty badly and haven't been able to walk properly for a few days now. I called in work to make sure they knew I won't be able to come but I still got a call today to come in for a shift that isn't on my contract but I had agreed to sign it on my contract, just hadn't gotten around to because I haven't got to talk to my manager. I really do want that shift because it's perfect for me I just hope it's not taken because of this one day. Also, in my report for work I haven't accepted many shifts and it's a 2/5 rating. This is because of having to look after my little sister while my parents are at work. I get scared every time that I'll get fired because of not accepting other shifts, I feel so bad, but I genuinely can't. 

Fourthly, my stress is for university. It's my first year this year and it starts in 2 weeks. I haven't had any help from anyone sorting anything out for university, I've had to take care of it all on my own which has been a pain because I don't know what I'm doing. Anyway I have an appointment at the university tomorrow to help me sort things out and I hope I can make it as I can barely walk. 

Lastly, their is nothing more in the world I want than my drivers license. It would make my life so much easier, but my dad never does and I fear that I am a horrible driver even though I've had a fair amount of practice. 

The entirety of 2017 was like this for me and I just felt like I could never catch a break, I feel like I still can't even though I'm in my summer holidays.

How do I stop ?,I have really bad social anxiety and just stress caused by existing. My problem is the way I coop with all of this is eating even when I'm not hungry I've been dealing with this on and off similar to my depression for years. I drink a lot of water in between meals even tea but I still eat to comfort myself. I've tried weighted blankets and going to a psychologist. Sometimes I can get a handle on it but it's not a self image problem. I have to be a certain weight for work because I'm military. I'm also vegan I eat plenty of veggies but too many carbs. The longest I've kept my weight down was a month with out someone constantly looming over me.

I have finals tomorrow. It's 1am and I'm too worried to sleep,All I can do is think about how bad finals are going to be. I hate it so much. I'm going to be so tired. I'm going to fail. My grades are so low I have to do great to keep them above passing. And the girl I loved is gone from my life too which makes me feel worse since I can't vent my feelings to her rip. why am I like this? What's wrong with me? Why do I get so stressed and anxious I can't focus and bomb everything 
"In the final semester of my degree, starting to doubt if I chose the right field for me","Stressed so bad I could vomit, what even is sleep anymore?

Internship like a full time job, lost my only parent at the end of last semester and had to take 2 incompletes in other classes, working on the weekends to feed myself so I never get a day off, honors project and a student award that require me to travel and present at conferences (when the fuck am I supposed to have the time to go with all of this piled on me now?), handling the estate of the deceased parent I mentioned earlier, and the list goes on and on.

My heart isn’t in this anymore. Me 3 months ago could have probably handled all of this, me now wants to fall apart at the thought. It’s hard to set your sights on graduation when you’re trying to keep your sights on staying alive.

And I’m even more stressed because I know that parent wanted me to finish more than anything. I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do."
"Tonight has been too stressful, and it's only getting worse","First, I had a surprise birthday party for my 16th that gave me a lot of stress because I hate surprises, and since the party was watching a movie, that stress lasted for hours. Then, I procrastinated again (as usual), and I haven't finished any of my homeowork, and it's 3 AM. I'm just so stressed and I don't know what to do. I don't have time for breaks, so I know it will only get worse."
Almost blacked out from stress?,"Hi guys first post here, i wanted to start a discussion to see if anyone else has experienced this. So this has happened to me a few times (8-10). I’ll describe what just happened to me today. 

So i took my dad to a cheese shop to try some cheeses. I felt a little stressed out but not a lot. I tried some cheese and some had pretty intense flavors and being an highly sensitive person this i think caused some stress. We stood for about an hour when i felt this dropping feeling in my stomach. I knew this was a sign to get some food and sit down but my dad was very happy checking out cheeses so i risked just waiting and chilling out. Then my whole body felt that dropping sensation and my hearing started going. I started getting warm and it felt like pin needles on my body. I got a chair and sat down. I started to panic realizing that my vision was going at a fast rate and my hearing was almost gone. A worker rushed and got me some water and dried apricots. I rushed to the bathroom and sat against the wall and smashed them as fast as i could. I immediately felt relief and the downward spiral had stopped

We all know somebody that freaks out and throws punches every time they get mad. As much as we love to laugh at their antics, it gets old fast... real fast.  

That's why we invented Rage Cube. We don't want to cause a fit, but if somebody's throwing one, Rage Cube will absorb it. It's time to put a bumper on their fists of rage."
How do you manage stress?,"I’m so mad. Since April I spoke with four professors: all for course evaluations and two for letters of Rec. They all agreed and I send them the necessary documents. I just called to check the file at my university and out of all those professors, only one submitted a course evaluation. I apply for a masters in a month and have no letters, despite having periodically emailed to update these professors. I email them now and they don’t reply. It’s ridiculous. I honestly don’t even want to apply anymore. This masters is just to improve my application for medical school but at this point, I don’t see it in my future.

How do you cope with stress?"
"Out of touch with stress, but physical symptoms","A month ago I ended up in emergency with chest pains, which turned out to be acid reflux and some inflammation. Determined to get to the bottom of it I've started eating extremely healthily (or rather, cut all GERD triggers and started FODMAP because my system has always been a bit off), but the doctor said stress was a contributor. 

I got an appointment with a psychologist who took my patient history (sexual assault 5 years ago, finished my PhD, now in a new and unstable job, 2 massive life changes coming in the next year, and mum got a life changing diagnosis the week before my chest pains started and I'm not able to travel home) and then laughed and said it was little wonder I'm stressed. 

The thing is, aside from grinding my teeth at night, occasional desire to cry over my mum, and being anxious about everything, I honestly hadn't considered myself stressed. I do my 8-5 and then it's just pottering about at home. I don't have the energy to take on extra responsibilities or activities, so I don't push myself to. I sleep 7-8 hours a night, and rarely drink. Maybe I've just been under pressure for so long that it doesn't strike me as odd. 

Anyway, what's the best way of dealing with this? I'm going to see the psychologist again but I think he's going to focus on anxiety rather than stress. "
"I love my job, and my manager is awesome, but my stress causes lots of missed work..","I have this great job, more at my speed (I don't work well under pressure), and my manager is a fantastic understanding guy who would bend over backwards just so someone could tell him to deal with their shit, more specifically, mine. I have stress in nearly every other aspect of my life, and it causes tremendous physical pain sometimes, which then means I have to call out for work. Now I'm beginning to stress about this too because again, job is perfect for me, but I'm still in my probation period and I have called out several times, most of which at short notice. I'm about to have to do it again (tossing and turning, getting less than five hours a night of sleep, for the past week, and now I've slept maybe an hour, grinding my teeth away) due to sevre bruxism flare up. My mouth guard is worn out just from this week alone.

My question is, how do I explain this to him without sounding like I'm just a weak little kid? I'm 22, and a hard worker, but I call out at least once every month and a half, sometimes more. This will be the 3rd time in a month I'm calling out, each time for a different source of stress induced medical issues. I don't want to lose this job, I haven't been able to keep one because of it and I even had to lie about references to get it. I know if I say it right he will be compassionate and understand, but I'm terrible with these things, believe it or not, it stresses me out. Help..!"
How do I release stress from my neck?,
Looking for my stress but can't find it,"Hi;

I suffer (infrequently, fortunately) from migraine headaches. Three years ago, I had a migraine that wouldn't go away - more than a week. I went to a pain doctor who prescribed meds but they weren't helping, so I went for an MRI and saw a neurologist who pointed out that I had high blood pressure. Went to a cardiologist who ran a bunch of tests and we determined that the BP was related to stress - I was in the middle of a life event that was fairly stressful. The BP meds helped bring things back to normal and I went on with my life.



Now, three years later, my BP has been elevated recently - much higher than usual. I'm still on the meds, but they aren't helping as much. It's causing headaches and I'm constantly clenching my jaw, even while sleeping. I'm going to see the cardiologist again later this week, but I'm trying to figure out the root cause and I just can't find anything in my life that's that stressful right now - at least not compared to three years ago. 

I'm assuming it's caused by stress again... but can't figure out what's causing it. Any advice on how to figure it out ?

I want to transfer to another Uni that is around the same distance as the one I currently go to and I want to major in Neuroscience instead.

When I get up and go to the bathroom my eyes become frozen and I keep looking at the wall for a minute or so.

Stress research study,"Hi all,

I'm a research student at University College London and I'm currently recruiting participants for a study investigating how stress evolves throughout people daily routines. The study uses your smartphone and an automated chatbot to regularly sample your stress level throughout the day with one 2-second question, over the course of a week. As a thank you, participants are entered into a prize raffle for a £50 Amazon voucher.

The reason we are doing this study is we are trying to figure out when exactly it's best to target relaxation methods and to identify any typical trends (stress building, reclining or staying elevated etc.)

"Whenever I'm stressed, I often have random moments of brief relief.","I suppose you could say it's similar to getting a high, except it's from nothing, and as far as I'm aware, it's caused by nothing.

Dealing with doctors,"I don't need to write a whole story here unless it's needed but I've had a real horrible 2 years where I've seen my GP regularly about my mental health (voices in my head, suicide thoughts, absent days) and I'm getting no where. I'm in the uk so I'm seeing NHS staff either my local surgery, mental health clinic or mind (mental health charity that offer counselling). I'm at a stage where every day I do very very little because I can sense it's going to lead to a breakdown or worse so I need to go back to my doctors. I have no idea what to tell them that they've not been told before. How can I get the help I'm not getting?"
My life and how i fucked it up !,"Hi guys,
I'm Yash, I'm 21. I want to write this not seeking for advice or help, although i deeply appreciate whoever it is who is trying to help or be concerned. From my childhood I've had the reputation of delaying things till the last minute. I love my parents and my sister so much , but I've never failed to disappoint either. Yes, there were good things that they were proud of but most of the time I fucked up. I dint know what to do. I've always wanted to be the cool guy and fucked almost many situations. There is a saying that goes he who understands that he is a fool won't be a fool anymore. I'm a fool , i know it, but i can't really help and I still continue to be a fool. My parents on the other hand are very hard working. My dad (greatest dad) worked from scratch to become a multi Millionaire . He literally dint have nothing. My mom on the other hand understood and helped my dad and gave him so much emotional and financial support. 

Now the worst thing is although i know all of this. I've never acted like their son. I have so much ego inside me that one day when my parents were scolding ( they did it for my good) i back-lashed at them saying something, very offensive, i.e I told them I don't deserve such parents ( Its true, for what a dick i was i never deserved them). They felt very bad and assumed they had a flaw in their parenthood. Trust me, they were very nice people they dint have a single flaw in fact i should be really lucky that i had such good parents. 

Later i joined for university, Where i started to smoke up and did drugs , alcohol. I dint do it because of peer pressure. I did by myself and i wasn't an addict also. I could control it but still i'm a faggot. My parents were so worried about me. I've lost myself in studying there. All my friends have graduated but i remained there for 6 more months because i couldn't finish the course. I've literally broken myself from the inside. I dint have any girlfriend since childhood( I'm a not a virgin). I always used to let others have a take on me. Sometimes i feel like dying but looking at my parents and my sister , I refuse to die because they wouldn't want that , my parents have worked so so so so so hard to be in very respectable positions as they are today ,they came from nothing to the top , for first they don't deserve a faggot like and second they will be very traumatized by this if it comes out to be true (which is what also they don't deserve), although if i die i wont be aware of their trauma , i cannot do that to them. 

I had so many dreams and i'm now worried about all of them. I used to study really well until my 12th std ( 97%) , i failed in school once in a year(5th class) but secured a decent score at school with 8.4 CGPA. Now in university my CGPA is below 5 out of 10. These numbers are very drastic and are at complete opposite ends. Basically i did well in my 12th because i studied by myself rather than listening to some teacher in the class. 
But in engineering i could have done everything right but i used to smoke up every day and ended up spoiling myself. I just don't know what to do now. I have no clue as to what career should i choose. I always wanted to be a billionaire ( Lol  Me!) , but that's an altogether different story which i know i'm simply assuming all this and satisfying myself by giving fake hopes to myself. I'm an idiot . I don't know how to act. 

I'm not proud of myself at all. Please don't be like me. I urge whoever reading this to learn from my mistakes. I broke into tears writing all this, this is not fake or some sympathy gaining trick i'm using.

Feeling stresses? I faces stress from time to time. A long-term stress can build up and it effect on my health.I need something to help me get past this stress,
Stressed. Too much is happening at one time,Well a girl at schooled squealed me out and now everyone knows a secret about me i didn't want them to know. It really pissed me off in embarrassment and im not sure what to do plus im going to NYC soon so i cant handle anything when im not there.
Having an off day today,"Hey y'all,

Just needed an outlet to get some stuff off my chest. I'm going to a community college right now doing an engineering degree. I've been at the CC for 3 years almost and I'm so ready to get out of there and go to a 4-year school. My motivation has seriously tanked this year since I don't have anywhere near the prerequisites needed for transfer and I don't feel like I'm moving. I'm tired of the way people look at me when I tell them I go to community college. 

Got some of my worst grades on exams in my upper math classes this semester and I can't seem to get motivated enough to do better. 

4/6 colleges I've applied to have denied me so far. I'm still waiting to hear back from the other two. I feel like I can do so much better with the opportunities I've been given, but I'm just so mentally exhausted from trying so hard with little pay off. 

I have a fantastic job working at a research facility. Out of 800 candidates I was chosen to be one of the 15 to work there, and out of the 15 I was one of the 4 chosen to work year round. Without a doubt, my skills in my field are above average and it annoys me that I have to jump through all these hoops to prove this to the academic community to get accepted into a semi decent college. Once I'm at a 4-year I will flourish for sure, but I'm just stuck in community college where I'm juggling prerequisites that may not even lead me towards anything since every school requires something different and there is no way I can do it all.

I have no problems spending another year at community college, but I just have no motivation. 

Thanks for listening!"

16/04/2017,"So. Here is number 2 of my texts. Im not sure if anyone is even reading this but it doesn't bother me. I have come to the conclusion that i dont have any friends. Haaa. Anyway. The only friends i have are older work colleagues and that they are also into music. So people my age i dont get on with. They are childish. 

So im thinking more about my ex. I still have feelings for her but after 2 years they are going eventually but slowly. There's a few girls i like but not sure if they would feel the same way about me. I mean how could anyone feel that way about me. 

I am in the middle. I want a relationship but i dont want one also. I want someone to be able to help me and be a partner with me in life but it is so difficult trying to find someone that is compatible. 

Im sat looking at my PC waiting for files to copy over and im listening to music. It makes me want to go out and get wasted. But my bank account says no lol. 

So what could i do. Im not making enough money to pay bills. My job is very fun and all good but at the moment its not making enough money to support myself on. Hopefully that will change soon. 

If anyone has any questions for me i am more than happy to answer. Thanks. "

Stress is piling up - do we ever get a break?,"I turn 30 in a week, and life is just too much right now.

In the past 2-3ish weeks:

-Grandfather is 90 - had a heart attack and gallbladder surgery- is home and doing better, but still very weak
-Grandma is losing her mind slowly - barely talks, but when she does, she talks about my grandpa dying soon
-Other grandpa has health issues and leaves tomorrow for a trip across the ocean - we are all worried how the flight will impact him (history of blood clots - but he insists on going)
-Father diagnosed with non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver - still waiting to find out how bad it is but people keep telling me about people they know that died from it and how ugly it is

On top of it, Hubs and I have been house hunting for 8 months, and trying to get pregnant for 6 months. 

I started a new job 2 months ago and it is a lot to learn, so that is still stressful too.

Please tell me that adulthood gets easier? Or at least calms down for a few years at a time? I need a break. My hub's dad died 2 years ago and we are just really starting to heal from that, just to have all this happen with my family now.

"New job, things are doing a bit downhill","I recently started my first full-time job in September since graduating college (almost 2.5 years) after doing struggling to find a stable job as an editor. 

I work for a small pharma/consumer health advertising agency. I previously freelanced for another pharma ad agency that was huge but it felt very corporate and too structured and I hated it. I thought I hated the industry because of how dull it seemed at the last job. With this new job, the first few months felt great—I started out as a freelancer and they liked me enough that I was offered the FT position within 3 weeks instead of the 3-month grace period. I actually find the work interesting, now that I am only one of the two people in my team (compared to 20+ people at the previous job)—my manager has done an phenomenal job taking me under her tutelage and teaching me almost from scratch, especially when work is at a rough, high volume. My supervisor is also really sweet and looks out for us. 

However, at the nature of the industry, we've lost business and there is an enormous amount of pressure to keep pitching with presentations, so there have been layoffs and people are worried about their jobs. Going in, I knew how much responsibility I had to take—all these uncertain late nights, the burden of making factual errors, staying on top of almost every project because we have to look at almost EVERYTHING and being consistent. I'm an editor and the editing and fact-checking is play a pivotal role in our work, especially having to work around the FDA. 

I hate to sound like I'm sugarcoating it, but the first few months were pretty great, but now I'm starting to see the cracks of the company and it bothers me. 3 people (whom i thought were doing okay) were let go and I am constantly frightened that I can get fired any minute. I can't help but feel like I'm fucking up a lot and getting nitpicked at for doing something incorrectly because I didn't know, and it doesn't help that my manager can be a bit passive-aggressive about things in an open-space office, where we (as in the entire company) all sit so closely to each other and can hear a pin drop. I am really trying my best and I like the challenge of the job and learning about the health scope and the people are really great, but I just feel so overwhelmed and at most times, extremely inferior and useless because I don't know as much (compared to my manager's 20+ years of experience) and I don't get filled on things as much as I'd like to. I feel like I'm constantly being rushed when I'm given such tight deadlines and it burns me out. Ideally, I'd like to stay at a company for 1.5-2 years but I'm getting so burned out already and I'm worried it might not look good in the future. 

Things are also not looking great at home—I'm having a fallout with my parents. They just bought a new house and I want to take this opportunity to move out but I need financial stability to sustain that, which is why I fear for my job most of the time. "

Effects of Stress on the Human Body,
Stress when I see my classmates,"Hey guys,  
here is my problem, whenever I see my high school classmates I get stressed. I finished high school about 4 -5years ago. But I still really care about some of my high school friends. Especially, I kind of feel something for the girl whom I used to hang out a lot with.  
I only managed to avoid stress only once, when I came accross my high school teacher before meeting with my high school classmates, so it was kind of breaking the ice in advance. I guess my problem is that I really care about them probably more than they do about me(this is probably because after high school I didn`t really have a lot of new friends) and despite that, we meet only once a year. And at the same time I always feel like I must be or look better than I used to look when I was at high school, and if I cant fulfil this, I feel huge stress.  
So, what would you recommend me to avoid that stress?"

I was a hair stylist, for about a year. After realizing that I was making less than min wage... and that the job was making me super anxious (because of the direct effect on peoples lives and appearance) I decided to find a different job. I can't do hair anywhere else bc I signed a non-compete agreement and fucked myself. So I've been working at an outbound call center for about 3 weeks making appts for sales reps. I don't find stress from the work itself. But from the fact that the company is totally churn and burn. If you don't make quota, you're out. The pay is actually pretty good too, 13.50 an hour base pay. 

Because its so easy to loose this job, I've been apply to other places for customer service reps. I know I have a great resume, and a professional demeanor. But I haven't gotten callbacks from them. 
Idk what to do. I really want to go back to school for psychology, and have always wanted to be a psychologist. But I wanted to get a job where I can feel secure and also go back to school.

Stressful project made me give up trying at work,"There was a project at work that I put loads of effort into but turned out badly. Since then I've been really apathetic at work. 

I'm thinking now that it's because I put so much effort in and the more I worked, the more the project just kicked me in the balls, so to speak. It was like a whole month of conditioning telling me: ""Don't bother trying"". I haven't been trying at all since then and that was a month or two ago, I just really don't care at all.

Just today I thought about the project for the first time since it ended and put two and two together to come up with the above. Thinking about it also made me feel really angry. 

I'm glad I had the insight, but I don't really know what to do with it. Has anyone got any ideas of how to look at the situation so I can stop feeling angry and regain my enthusiasm for work?

By the way my boss is very understanding and everyone at work is really nice. But I'm thinking of moving jobs to give myself a reset and new challenge and I have an interview on Monday for quite a cool job. I just wanted to unload all of that and see if anyone has any input.

There is this one girl I really like, and she has been giving me a cold shoulder for the past month but hanging out with other friends and all. I asked her why isn't she talking to me and she said that I have other friends to be with and don't care about me. She knows that she means the world to me, and I love her and care for her.

Overwhelmed,I just don't know what to do. I started a new job this week but its across town. 25 to and another 25 back. Im stuck in school and I've just started to study for my written drivers test
I need something to help me relieve stress,"That's it. 

I've reached the point where I'm so stressed I just can't take it anymore. 

It's school.

I hate having to study for subjects I do not care about. I honestly and REALLY don't care about knowing how to prove that some quadrilateral is a trapezoid, or how electrons move from one atom to another. 

I would've been able to beat this if I had time to do things I actually care about, things that will actually help me advance in my future career choice. But no, even though I want to become a translator, I still have to know why angle AOD is congruent to angle XYZ. 

 I'm so stressed and tired of this endless cycle of studying pointless crap I couldn't care less about. 

I have dreams and ambitions, I want to become a professional translator/interpreter. I've learned Spanish on my own, and my next goal is French. But guess what? I have no time AT ALL to learn what I actually care about. What I'm passionate about.

It's honestly depressing to think that school, whose main purpose is to help students discover their passions and talents in a ""fun"" environment, can have such an effect on me. And I know I'm not alone. I'm positive many students out there are facing the same difficulties. 

I can't drop out of school, that's not an option. I've suffered through 8 years of it, and I'm not about to give up on my first year of high school. 

But that doesn't mean I like it.

I have two exams in the upcoming hours, but I couldn't bring myself to study for one of them. I'm usually a perfectionist, I try to make everything as perfect as possible, I try to study as hard as I can, but I don't care anymore. 

I might fail that exam, but I don't care (or at least I'm trying not to). I don't want to stress myself out over something completely pointless that I will never use in my life. 

I just want time to continue doing what I'm passionate about, but thanks to school, I can't.

Stressed out by Roommate,"I'm really stressed out. I get stressed out really easy by small things. I already suffer from depression so I’m worried I’m gonna get worse again. 


My current issue is with my new roommate. She owes my other roommate and I $36.11 each and doesn’t want to pay us back. She owes because she went over the utility cap by herself when the other roommate and I weren’t here for the summer. She doesn’t think she owes us money so we had to pay it. Another thing is that she doesn’t clean up after herself, messes up the decorative blankets and pillows I have on the couch, takes up most of the space in the fridge, uses my dishes and doesn’t wash them. I’m kind of a neat freak and I really like to use my own items. My favorite cup is missing, some of my silverware is missing and one of my pots is just completely gone. I realize it’s just things but they’re MY things. If I get them back, it’s all going in my room. This is my senior year and I picked easy classes with a good schedule and it was suppose to be great. The new roommate’s habits don’t seem to bother my other roommate so I feel like I’m stupid for getting stressed out. 


I know it’s just stupid little things but they’re all piling up and it’s starting to take a toll on me. I’ve already tried talking to her about the bill but she just decided to ignore me. 


I’ve been going on walks for 30 minutes with some jogging thrown in, and I’ve also started doing yoga. I don't know how to just ""let things go."" I don’t know how to deal with stress.

Work stress.,"I recently accepted a new title at my workplace. Before I say anything else, let me say I *love* what I do and wouldn't trade it for anything. With that said, working in an industry (news) where everything is based on precise timing, the public and basic journalistic integrity, the level of stress it casuses is almost too much to believe at times. 

With my new title, I now have *a lot* more responsibility. It's great, but I have not quite adjusted to it like I thought I would. It's only been two weeks. In time that will change, but holy hell; when I got in my car tonight when I finally left, I screamed at the top of my lungs for a few seconds and then felt better. (I never do that so I was like, ""Okay, that's weird."") I've been home for a few hours now and I still feel restless. I've joked about it a few people, but I feel like I'm going to have grey hair by the time I leave this place.

Stress-measuring with sensors,"Hi, I am working on a software that helps to measure stress. Has anyone experience with sensors from wearables, particularly we are measuring HRV, right now we are using Polar H7 chest straps. Ideally I would be able to get HRV values from something that is worn on the wrist, can it be calculated from devices such as an Apple Watch,I am not looking for high accuracy, since I am measuring the HRV over a prolonged time period and I am interested in variance.

The other thing I am looking for is an affordable portable cortisol measurement tool with Bluetooth. I am not sure if that exists yet."
Being ambitious is great... until it isn't,"I've always been highly ambitious and a bit of a go-getter.  There's no project I'll turn down if I have the skills to do it.  I'm a workaholic anyway, so having down time freaks me out.

However, right now I'm dealing with too much.  I have a rapidly approaching contract deadline, and everybody else just figured that out.  So, in the next 36 hours, I have to do the work I was just given in the last 3 days, instead of the last 2 months.

I know it's my fault for taking on too much, but at the same time I panic and don't know handle it.

Usually what I can do is write out a Task List (colour coded by either time consumption or priority), and that helps me visualize the workspace and make a plan of action.  But there's just so much that it's actually making it worse.  I've run out of whiteboard...

Stress causing lack of emotional control. Crying constantly for no real reason.,"My (28m) emotions have been on a hair trigger over the last six months or so. Anything can cause me to start bawling like a child or a hysterical pregnant woman. It honestly can be anything, a moving or sad song, something unexpected happening that doesn't go my way, my wife doing something frustrating, etc. (Seriously anything, even as I write this out) I have no idea what is happening. I've generally just chalked it up to stress (money is really tight and I've been working lots of overtime to try to make ends meet) and have tried to move on, but things don't really get better and I feel like there might be something else going on. 

I wouldn't say that I'm depressed, but I also don't really know what that would feel like. I mostly just feel overwhelmed and helpless. Anyone ever felt this way before? Any advice would be appreciated."

Seeking stress relief,I'm working a freelance designer but my employer keeps on pushing me to finish my work so he can drop another big one on me. What should I do? I don't get paid and I'm only an intern. 
I only feel relaxed at work.,"It seems odd when I think about it. I think work is an escape, because everyday it's the same. I know how to act and what to say and what to do and the more I work the better right?
 
The more I work the more money I make which means I don't have to be scared the lights will go out or eat instant oatmeal for breakfast 2 weeks in a row. 

But I think it's because when I'm not at work I feel lost. Does anyone else feel like they don't know what to like or what to do? I spend too much time thinking about what I should do or doing things I think I should enjoy, things I used to love, but I feel no entertainment. Just scared, weak, mad, uncertain.

Stress affecting my health in the strangest way,"So I recently started working a new job over the summer and its been a great learning experience, but my boss really stresses me out. She thinks I'm inside her head and know everything that's going on even though I don't. Not only that but I'm super stressed out as it is since I'm an engineering student.

My problem began during the middle of last semester. During midterms I got so stressed out that I started ripping the hairs out of my beard. As painful as that sounds, it became stress relief. I have since stopped that, but the problem migrated to my eyebrows. It's become somewhat of an uncontrollable obsession. Even though I know it's not right and it hurts I just can't seem to stop. After I tell myself that I can't pull at my eyebrows I go back to my beard and even some hairs on the back of my neck. It's becoming really unhealthy and I don't know what to do.

what is your best stress relief technique?,I have tried all kinds of things with myself and my clients... I'm just curious what your go-to for stress relief is
Bullets,I am just getting sober (1 month). My realationship is strained and has been since day one. I live with him. Its our 4 year anniversay this coming week. I left a good job because my drinking finally affected my work. I got a jew job. Its unfufilling. Im quitting tomorrow. I cant stop crying. I cant bring myself to do yoga or hike or anything anymore. Im going to have to figure out how to not to spend money since im not motivated to get a new job. I have car paymenys. Rent. Phone bill. Insurance. Pets. I still have random triggers that remind me of all the thinga ive done while i was drinking. My head is always racing. Tomorrow once i quit will be better. Less to think about. More to plan but less to worry about a job that's not a good fit. I hope.
Why do we think about things that never happen?,"it rarely ever happens, so why stress out over something that rarely happens? Curious to what you guys think. Example ” I’m afraid this is going to happen”. You stress on the thought,it never happens. So why stress in the first place? Should we go with the flow to reduce the stress?

Do we stress over things that never happen because of a thought? You bring the thought to life make it feel so real that we think about it and stress about it? Is that why we think about things that never happen?"

My telomeres are rapidly depeleting and my cells have stopped dividing. My brain cells have been genocided by the unabating torrent of cortisol secreted by my adreal gland.  I'm gonna go insane and shoot everyone up. (just a joke xddd) Save Me.
It is impossible to put into words the extent of which I am deceased inside. 
I think I'm retarded. EVERYONE thinks I'm retarded. The voice in my head thinks I'm retarded. 
I've absolutely wasted this entire year. 
Everyday since September, I'd wake feeling like fresh dog feces and wishing human euthanasia were legal. Then it's drag my dead sack of bones to school. I'd pull through all eight periods and rush home where I anesthetize myself with cs:go and lol. 
I've failed almost every class and don't have any extracurriculars. 
I START RANTING HERE:
I don't find any of my classes necessarily hard but I failed pretty much every exam.  I'm too dead inside to do anything. 
I have friends but I'm always the 5th wheel. It's just me, myself, and I. 
I can't find any motivation doing anything. 
I feel retarded. I don't know whether it's the chronic stress or its just me. Chronic stress kills brain cells; Is that why I'm failing? Cortisol causes the myelin sheaths in neurons to thicken, brain cells prefer to be light and thin to allow signals to be transferred quickly and efficiently. Thick myelin sheaths will slow impulses. 
If I'm constantly exposed to stressors, there's no way for me to escape stress. How do I relieve chronic stress. 
 If I stop stressing, how long should it take for brain cells to regenerate? 


 Sorry for my ranting, really needed to get that off my chest.

Stressing about school :(,"Hey to anyone reading this

I've been really stressed out lately. I went to college last year around January. It was incredibly fast paced and hard for me to handle I was anxious and constantly freaking out. I would wake up in the morning get all ready to go to school and then last minute decide to stay home because of my anxiety. I ended up dropping out after 1 semester (which i didn't tell my parents) this year I went back tot eh same program feeling a bit better hoping to do better which I kinda did but I was still suffering from anxiety issues so I missed attendance a lot, it wasn't like I was not doing anything at home I followed the curriculum and read the books and studied but I just couldn't get myself to class and now I've failed 2 class and I'm most likely gonna fail one more and if you fail 3 times you're out. I've been doing so well and if this happens to me I'm gonna be so knee-deep in anxiety that I'm having a hard time sleeping every night. :( I just feel like I need someone to talk too, my girlfriend has been with me through all of this and she's been really caring and supportive with me (she's amazing) and I just want to be a better man I want to graduate, this anxiety is killing my success. :("
Chronic Stress,For months I have been having chronic stress for months.    I've been trying top get rid of the stress through exercise and medication for my depression and ADHD that has helped about but the stress part still lingers if I do something that I enjoy the stress goes away for that period but when that's over the stress comes right back. I don't know what to do any suggestions?
Told a lie and I'm having insane anxiety!!,"So during this semester I was sick for two weeks. I had the stomach flu but it was very painful and I couldn't go to class. But for some reason when the teacher asked where I was when i returned, I said I had hernia surgery (IDK WHY) to make it sound more serious. Therefore, she asked for medical intake and release forms. I gave her some old hospital papers with changes dates but this lie is eating me alive!!! Ever since I did this I've been stressed/anxious 24/7. Reason being, if you miss 2 classes you automatically fail the class. Without attendance, I have an A+ in the class and I don't see the point in failing a good student over some absences (I'm in college btw). Anyways, this stress is absolutely awful and I'm constantly nauseous because of it. Can y'all give me some advice??! 

P.S. She only wants them just incase the department wants to see them"
"Whenever there is stress, I have a blackout and get in procrastitating standby-mode. What can I do?","Hey guys,

I am very clueless right now. I have that problem for a long while now (some years) and I don´t know what to do.

A little backstory: I suffer from depression and social anxiety. Since I can think, I had problems with someone telling me what to do, work my ass off for stuff that doesn´t synch with my values and what I´d like to acchieve. I can´t really focus on things that seem dumb for me (things that do not change anything in the world, doesn´t really help people). For some years now, I didn´t have any real friends (only two over the internet, with one being my best friend) and my girlfriend broke up with me about a month ago, I also hate the job at the company I´m at right now.

Now the problem is: Whenever I feel stressed (it doesn´t need much), I totally panic and at my job I have at the moment, I instantly get into an standby-mode, procrastinating, doing something else online. Forget the advices to turn every disturbance off. If I didn´t have internet (which I need as a web-dev) or something else, I would just stare holes in the air. It´s a heavy fear of wasting my life. I had an apprenticeship as a designer and also love to design, but my boss always tells me, I´m NOT a designer and should not decide on any design-questions. Being told I´m no designer (I´m not only a trained designer, but also creative artist) really hits me hard and that adds to feeling shallow and afraid.

So, when being in that procrastinating-mode it´s clear that I´m not very productive. That also adds pressure and fear that I could loose my job in the future. I mean, I reeeaaaallly want to leave that place, but I´d love to be freelancing (which needs a lot of time to prepare, gather a big customer base, etc.) or having a dream-job (I guess it´s not very likely) where I don´t have too much pressure, where I´m not super responsible for things (but maybe I can learn to feel good with responsibility) and where I have room to be creative and people that listen to my tech- and design- advices.

Now that you know my main problem(s): What can I do? Also I don´t have thaaaat much work atm where I work (but I know that you have way more work and pressure in similar media companies), so I´m also afraid that when I change my job, it´ll only get worse..."
Uncontrollable Sneer,"I've noticed that when I talk to people I start to feel a tug in my cheek muscles. It happens more often on the left side of my face than the right.  Sometimes the tightness develops fully into a sneer rather than just an uncomfortable feeling from my cheek to my nose and it can also manifest as a twitching feeling near my eye on the same side of the face.  

I don't feel this only when I'm in a stressful situation but I'm wondering if it is a sign of stress or anxiety.  Does anyone else have symptoms like this and if so what do you do to try and overcome it?"
Stressed in school and with parents (not sure where else to post),"So to give some context I'm a junior in highschool. I'm pretty much average, I have a ton of AP classes but I'm not some superstar at them, I get A's and B's. I also do a sport, and I'm also average at it.   
The problem I have with at school is my math class. Last semester I scraped by with a B. This semester I am currently at a C-. I perform poorly on the tests, and although I do study, I could be studying more. The main problem is my parents. They expect me to get at least a B in the class, and I don't think I can do it. I told them I wanted to drop the class before the semester started, but they told me I could do it, and not take the AP test. Then comes signups for the AP tests, and they still sign me up for the AP test, using the logic that *if* I pass it, I'll skip that class in college. So that's 95 dollars down the drain.  
Honestly, every time there is a test, I know I'm going to mess it up. I know it, and when I get my grade back, my parents yell at me for it, ground me or something and then I end up hating them for it. It makes me sad, because they try to do their best to help me succeed, yet I hate them for it. Every time I get a test back, it ruins my mood for the rest of the day and makes me worry for what's coming at home. And my parents' anger is completely justified, and honestly I don't know what I'm going to do with myself in the future. Sometimes I really wish I could just end it, but it's over something so petty.  
PS: I'm sorry if this deviated from stress, and bled into other areas, I don't know where to get help. The main stress thing here is math classes and my parents."
messed up during probation period!,"Greetings all and welcome to my very first post on Reddit because I'm incredibly stressed and needed somewhere to look for some help. 6 months ago I got a fantastic career level job in a field I'm interested in. Great, right? Well, today my boss pulled me into her office...
1) a manager has seen me using my phone on multiple occasions. both times at conferences. I immediately owned up to this and very briefly explained I get some anxiety in large crowds and I find my phone is a quick and easy coping mechanism. regardless I also said that is no excuse and the phone will be out of sight.
2) I was seated with a senior management person at a conference. I said ""just wondering, can I have a raise?"" jokingly. he said he wouldn't be the person for that, and I assured him I was kidding and added ""worth a shot I guess!"". I'm from a pretty small town where everyone is relatively laid back and crack jokes all the time. I was just trying to break the ice really. rookie mistake. I owned up for this as well of course 
3) My probation period is being extended 3 months. My manager assured that it's not a reflection of me or my work ethic, just that I was hired at a very awkward period of time where there wasn't any role specific work for me and now that things are picking up she wants to see how I perform. I disagree because I have taken a lot of initiative to make work for myself and when they hired me shouldn't be my problem but there's no way I'm going to argue that
so now I'm stressed beyond belief. I can't sleep. I'm afraid of losing my job which I can't afford. I'm humiliated. I'm angry.

Hi guys, My name is John, and I am conducting a stress/self-esteem survey to try and find a correlation between the two. My hope is to find some sort of relation between the two, so i can potentially start programs at school to help build up people's self-esteem and, if there is a correlation, bring down stress levels. However, in order to prove if this even works, I need as many people to fill out the survey as possible. Go ask your friends if they can! Maybe a family member, or just a neighbor!

Thanks in advance to anyone participating!

I hate my own land am I bad?,"First off I'm a Vietnamese. I'm 24 years old and have lived in here since 1992. When I was a little kid, I always question myself about how my people treat each other, how their way of motivating in our minds can be so illogical. I'm sure that I have studied in a brain washed education system (with not even a single clue of true history). I was treated like garbage by my own people just because my thinking is different than them (like how sex, pornography and masturbating is just a way of removing stresses and good for your health). I don't think I'm superior or my friend is inferior to me but the things I always see in Vietnamese are: selfishness, poor creativity and short sighted. Whenever I try to be a good people or helpful to each other they just use that to take over me (It means they use you for their own benifits), laugh of my face(cuz I want action more than theory), think I'm trying to show off that I'm so kind (like when you help a people to move ton hospital in a car crashed). Vietnamese love back stabbing you (don't try to tell them your secret or put your faith/money in them) and try whenever tactics to make you lose your temper and doubt of your self to fail in life (like insult or hang a gang to pick on you), be a clown to them. Talking about love I lost all my trusts in the girls who live in my town, sure they're pretty and charming but...that's all. they never try to improve them self they just try to ""improve"" their boy friends over the year (and they just want cash). I have cried a lot that I'm not even bother to cry any more cause that's just make me even more pathetic (but deep inside I wanna cry like a wimp). Last year when I'm finally can open up a business in translating english language into Vietnamese, my friends stabbed behind my back and use their ""law"" and ""acceptable degree"" in working to bring my reputation down (those assholes won't even bother to test my ability because degree IS the only thing they can use to criticize me). I'm trying to learn how to cook well and put my cash on an IELTS test to get out of this horrible place. I will start up from all over again get a good wife and help my next generations can earn the system they deserved. Am I thinking too negative? Am I a traitor? Am I a bad person? Please help me find the answer in my life... "
Realizing you can't do something,"I have just come to the realization that I cannot possibly do what I am trying to do. It's not humanly possible. 

I'm a 21 year old, 3rd year university interactive media (media engineering basically) student, I work a part time sales job that pressures me often, and an online freelance job that doesn't make enough to be self sufficient. My program is a degree and diploma joint, 5 courses a semester, we were told that it is a job of a program, 20-30 hours of work a week. I spend almost all day each day I'm not working at school, whether in lecture or working there on assignments, and these assignments aren't even pertaining to what I want to do with my life. I've failed 3 so far. As well as starting our senior project, which starts now and runs through April 2017, which has us expected to produce an industry grade product in a year, while also taking a regular course load. On the side of this, I've been trying to get a start up studio going with some peers, but they're hard to keep on track because of school. Additionally this start up would require a lot of work to get moving, but with every passing year it will only get harder due to the nature of the industry, however it is my life's dream as well as my life's work that has gone into its formation. While doing this, I'm also trying to maintain some social interaction with friends and family, keep relationships intact but most of the people in my life don't understand how busy I am so that makes it a challenge.

I need to stay in school because it's a program that is either you do it all this fast in order or you're kicked out, I need the two jobs because my family is not well off and I pay for school with government loan help, I need to do well on assignments because every course is a prerequisite for the next, I need to work into the senior project because my team is relying on me and it's the single most important part of my program, I need to get the start up going because the longer I wait the farther it gets away and before long it won't be possible, I need to maintain relationships with friends and family because they're the only thing that keeps me sane, and I need to start leading a healthier lifestyle because I'm unhealthy and without that improvement there's very dangerous outcomes not to far down the road for me.

With that in mind, I suffer depression and some anger management problems, and probably some kind of anxiety problem at this point but that I'm not sure about. I take Advil daily for migraines, and my body is starting to become physically ill and sore as of late.

Looking back on that... I don't think it's possible. I have dreams and goals but I'm honestly lost. I don't sleep often but when I do it's 3-4 hours max, I don't eat regularly or well, and I'm often unable to focus on anything because I can't help but worry about the 5 other things I need to do. I haven't felt legitimately happy in months and the depression I thought I'd conquered years ago is creeping back it seems.

I hear often about these great people who overcome the challenges and it makes mine sound small, which makes me feel especially weak for not being able to handle this.

tl;dr Between university, 2 jobs, my own company, social interaction, lifestyle changes, and my mental conditions, I'm drowning really fast.

I suppose my question is am I crazy? Is this actually too much for one person or am I just not seeing a simple solution to my problem?"

When will it end? [rant],"I've always prided myself on my maturity and ability to handle things. I get stressed out as much as the next person, but by putting one step forward can always get things done.

Too much is happening at once and I can't deal anymore. I'm crying just thinking about all that's happening.

I had a baby,
My husband and I are having ""post baby"" marital trouble - none of which I think is unusual but still we haven't had sex in like 3+ months. 
I feel gross and fat,
My Dad suddenly died with tons of debts we didn't know about,
I'm the emotional support for my elderly, mentally unstable, depressed, insecure mom and am also trying to keep her on a budget. She's lived a champagne life however and is angry at having to make cuts to her lifestyle,
After many years with the same company, my job is ending soon (I'm currently part time from home since having baby) and I'm having a hard time finding another position at same or higher pay,
My baby is wonderful but I am so bored being at home with him,
My apartment's floors buckled and we are suing the co-op board to replace them - I've been living with buckled floors for almost a year now,
My furniture is all broken and I'm not buying new stuff until I get the floors fixed so I'm living with broken and hole-y couches, chairs, etc.
I'm arranging my parent's estate sale, house sale, and general finances.
My MIL is very pushy and does her own thing and wants to throw a 75 person 1 year bday party for her grandson. I told her I just want the family, but now she's all pissy and childish that I don't want to make a big ""to do"". 
I'm adjusting to who I am, not seeing my friends as much, not making money like I used to, etc.

It's like all I want to do is go on vacation and drink and cry but I know that will solve nothing. I'm doing my best to get each of these issues resolved and NOTHING IS MOVING FORWARD FOR THE PAST YEAR.  

Like, I make all the efforts to ""check list"" and solve the problems but nothing is changing. I am starting to break!! Random crying, angry thoughts.. When will it end????"
My stress is messing with my brain,"When I get really stressed about school or life, I feel like my brain itches. I feel like if I look at my paper, my throat will swell shut. If I move, my arms will fall off. I cry every night, but that ends up stressing me out in the long run because I feel weak. Everything I do is wrong. Everything is stressful. Sos "
Not graduating on time,I've been a total fuck up since I've been at school. I'm not failing out but my grades are shit. However I was lucky enough to get a job lined up after school through a family friend but I just found out I'm not graduating on time and might have to come back next semester. This could cost my parents another 20k and fuck things up with my job. Im trying to take classes during the summer to clean it up but I'm absolutely losing my mind right now and needed to vent. 
I can't calm down,"My ex had a child and the guy she was with put his name on the birth certificate without really confirming the child was his. She was living with just the baby for awhile, but now she needs money and he's no help for her. Now she is going to hope he is mine, make me get a test, and make me pay child support. He could very well be mine. I can't afford that. And I don't want that bitch to be forever part of my life.

 Any advice on all that would be cool, but really I came here because I can't stop thinking about it. My head hurts, I sleep away the day to calm down, I can't eat, and I can't get any work done. I don't know how long it will take for her to take action or if she even will. The uncertainty of 'when or if' is the worst. A close second is I'm tremendously afraid of my friends and family judging me if he is mine. I'll never hear the end of it. The first couple weeks of everyone finding out will be the worst. I don't want to have to explain it to everyone and be judged and get pity. It scares me so much that if that day comes, I'll be put into a state of depression and just stay in and sleep everyday.

How can I calm down for now?"
17 yrs old guy suffering from too much stress,"I get 5-6 hours of sleep everyday,getting 6 hours of sleep is a success.suppose today,I slept at 12:00 and got up at 4:00am not because I wanted because I was ******** disturbed by a person who sleeps next to my room.I found a solution,I will put earplugs but I dont have time to sleep anymore because I get home late from school,got to do school works and prepare for exams although I am zero at studies.

School is place where I get huge amount of stress.I am just like a doll,I do nothing.I feel like I go school just to humiliate me or show how pathetic I am. 
I just cant socialize,speaking with people puts too much stress(I start sweating) and I can't even make eye contacts with people. 
I got all posture problems. 
I got all the ******* problems.I just cant stop thinking that I have no future,I am doomed."
I feel like I'm downing here.,"So recently I've been really stressed out financially , physically, and emotionally.  I've gotten the emotionally and physically under control a little, but financially I feel like I'm in a losing battle no matter what and its killing me. Every few mins I'm thinking about what can I do to fix my situation and work out a plan.  


To give a picture, I need $650 by next friday due to a $1000 dollar loan I took out to help pay bills and help with expenses where my small pay checks couldn't cover, I have rent due on the 1st which is $200, A $100 gas bill past due, $100+ phone bill due tomorrow, I need at least $250 for food and travel to work for a month, and I have a girlfriend that I take out a lot to eat and stuff which helped put me in this hole to Begin with. My account is overdrawn $156 and I think my rent check for this month bounced if my understanding of overdraft protection is correct.


A few weeks ago I talked to my SO about the emotional and physical stress due to it causing enormous issues in our relationship. I even disclosed a little bit about my money issues but not all. Now all this helped a little but I am still in a huge financial bind.  I've so many poor money choices I can bare to tell her all of them and I don't want to make her seem like a burden.


Here's a little back story. At first when I met her when we first started dating I would spend a lot because my responsibilities were sorta low then plus I was crushing hard. After a few months I seen I was spending 400 to 500 on eating or going out. Not too long after that to keep up and to keep her happy I would borrow small.  After more time passed, I had to keep doing borrowing. I got in to huge holes. After I changed jobs and worked a lot I was finally out. But then things happened where I needed pay some expenses back to her since I ended up having to stay with her a while. After I gave her that I was pretty much back in the hole again and honestly it spiraled even further down. I still was spending 500 a month and my new jobs hours were getting cut.  So I took out that big loan thinking I could pay it back over time. I cant right now.


Honestly I often feel like disappearing because this like way too much for me to handle. I Want to tell my SO everything, but I feel like it will just cause damage as she is more poor than me and already feeling the burden with just the little I told her. She wants to go out and stuff but I can't afford to nor can she.  I thought about breaking up until my shit is together but she wouldn't like or want that."

Hip Hop as a destressant,"Hey Guys, 17 Yr old A level student here, who's pushed out of social circles, so I know a thing or 2 about stress and management

I'm not talking new age stuff like future or drake, I'm talking old school. If you find yourself feeling stressed, listen to [Pete Rock - Petestrumentals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wV1RWQP-jXs). Nod in time with the beat. Go with track 4 or ~~6~~ 7 first, very relaxing tunes. I'll see what else I can find but sit back, with a green tea (or hot/cold drink of choice) and put these on, very good for R and R

Support only please!,"Hey So I'm a 24 year old girl struggling everyday in life. I haven't left the house on my own in two years. Everyday is another battle for me, will I win it or will it win me? I've been dealing with these emotional issues for many years now but my life was ok and then it started going down and now it's gotten to the point where I'm just wasting the days . If I go out, it's with my parents and that's all I do. For the most part I am in the house from day to mid day alone and I might go out to a store once or twice a week. Not that I even wanna go out. I feel miserable all the time. I have nowhere to go. No work or school. I am too nervous to even think about getting a job, because it requires leaving the house on my own and I'm worried. It's just a scary thought when you're use to being alone in the house everyday. I don't have any friends and I don't even know how to trust anyone anymore. I've been to many doctors , psychologists , psychiatrists, and even the psych hospital . the medicine they give me is ok I can sleep at night but other than that it does nothing. I don't like feeling so sad everyday. people tell me it will get better but I don't see it . They also say only I can change it, but how you suppose to change it when nobody is there for you? I can't get the proper help and it's drivin me crazy. People try to force me into working but how you suppose to work when you can't overcome your problems? Everyone tells me the same things. Seeing others living a happy life and working and in school and then there's people like me who can't even get out of the house. to anyone else going through something similar I would appreciate a comment here . It took a lot out of me to write this and share it with you .

Should I go to the doctor if I'm under a lot of stress?,"So im 21 and I have literally been stressed all my life. I have had to see my mom and dad argue everyday 24/7.

I have also been stressed out with school since having to deal with all the trouble my parents brought I have had problems keeping up with school, having to stay after school to try and get caught up with everything I end up missing and know that I'm in college I have had to drop some classes because I always had to pick up my little brother from school and take him home or I end up falling behind and again end up droping the class. All this stress has made it to the point that around may I started to get insomnia and barley slept. I had to go to the doctor to get medication to help me sleep. But after that my insomnia went away but everday I wake up and go to sleep so tired and my body feels so heavy. Should I go to the doctor and tell them that I'm am under a lot of stress.

That sounds a bit theoretical, but nevertheless: There is a framework with a place also for mental health. If your employer has an OHSAS 18001 certificate for his workplaces but didn't record any incident e.g. in catergory 1.2.2.1, then the certificate just may be a decorative badge on the wall.


So, if you work in a OHSAS 18001 certified company, have yo been educated (as required by the standard) to recognize and report incidents in this category?

How I learned to stop stressing about stress.,"For the last 14 months I've been tracking various aspects of my emotional state with Nomie (http://nomie.io). For this post I'll focus specifically on my monitoring of stress. 

My criteria for stress tracking is fairly simple: I record each time I need to separate myself from a situation to cool down. 

Here's what I learned. My stress was never as high or as intense as I imagined it, but I continued to perpetuate the belief that I was always stressed.  Looking back, I believe this is because when I was stressed, I would see everything (past present and future) through my current stressed filter, which lead to more stress. Without a light at the end of the tunnel, I continued to let my stress compound until I was ready to go nuclear. 

Now that I've been tracking with Nomie, I no longer need to hold on to those feelings. I know no matter how stressed I am, it will pass in a few days.

> I can say to myself: ""Brandon, chill out - go watch Netflix and it will pass in a couple days"" and confidently know it it's the truth.

All of this is not to say that Nomie has cured me of all that ails me, it hasn't. It has helped me focus on doing more positive to negate some of my negative, which is a good way to break behavioral cycles. I believe the biggest take away is that I now see my negative experiences as just that - an experience, that I can either engage with and mold, or I can step back and simply observe as it takes its course. 

### My Stressed Stats

- Most Consecutive Days I've been Stressed: **4**  
- Most Consecutive Days I've NOT been Stressed: **51**
- Day Most likely to be stressed: **Wednesday**
- Day least likely to be stressed: **Thursday***

***It's worth noting that while Thursday is usually my lowest day of stress, it's the highest for unhappiness (but that's for another post).*

*Side node: What I've found most engrossing about my negative emotions, is their ability to quickly compound in intensity. Stress bred more stress, just as my depression bred more depression, and anger bred more anger.*

Anyone try Hyland's Nerve Tonic?,"I'm new to this sub, by the way!  Hello all, it's nice to be in a community full of people that recognize how shitty it is to be a stressed out person.  Anyways, it's the middle of the night now, so I don't think it's possible at the moment, but I'm planning on buying this stuff tomorrow afternoon!  Anyone have any experience with it?  Is it a sham?  From other places I've looked online it seems to have positive feedback so...yeah."
How do you release/cope with stress?,"I'm 18, just out of high school. I live in a house with 7 of my aunts and they stress me out big time. I've never let anything out, I've always kept to myself because they are hard to talk to. I can't take it anymore, my head is always killing me.

How can I get rid of this all? I already workout, walk outside, go out. But every time, the thought of going back home just puts me in a bad mood. And once I'm in the house, It's like all the stress piles on me at once. I can't move out yet, I just started working at the theaters and have no money to move out. And all the dorms at my university were taken."
Life can be a real challenge...,"   Hey everyone or no one, not exactly sure who all this is going to reach. Let me preface a bit, I have never posted anything on any sites ever, except maybe Facebook, and I don't really even use that anymore.

   I started this career recently, its a solid career but it is very stressful and very dangerous. I'm thankful for everyday that I come home from work alive.

   However everyday I work, I feel myself getting more and more stressed. I literally can feel the stress, my heart flutters and I feel like I can't get breathe sometimes. I have never felt this way before I started this career.

   My whole life I have had goals, things that I expect of myself, and I know that I have a bit of a ""perfectionist"" complex. I have been very successful with my goals, but with this new career I'm very nervous as to if I can stick with it, if I will be successful. I like being prepared and I like knowing the next step, but with this career its almost impossible to plan and be completely prepared all the time. Don't get me wrong though, I want to be successful, I really want things to work out.

   There is so much that I don't know and that also stresses me out, I'm the newbie so I don't have many friends and I get the hazing/harassment of a newbie. I don't complain and I don't retaliate, but it is starting to all add up.  

   I suppose I'm posting on here because I dont really have anyone to talk to, and I wanted to get it off my chest. I'm not looking for sympathy, or a pick me up. I am just wondering if anyone currently is feeling the same way about their career or a certain point in their life.

I dont handle stress well?,"So, I feel like I can handle it just fine mentally, and want to be able to handle it, but physically my body has very bad reactions, even sometimes to minute things causing stress like a video game or homework? Some of the symptoms I get are: Pain/tightness in chest, dizziness, headches, pressure in my head, nasuea on the rare occasion. Apparently these are symptoms of stress and I only seem to get them when I've been building stress lately, even over small things. I plan on going into the military (AFROTC) and I can only imagine I will have stressful situations, that I can deal with just fine mentally, but my body doesn't let me physically. Any tips?"
"I'm so friggin' stressed about this, I could REALLY use some advice","I've posted like 4 maybe 5 times about this same subject before but everytime I still can't be at ease with it, so this is about my sexuality, just typing that annoys me. I'm 14, I'm a dude, and I keep questioning my sexuality. Nowadays whenever I see a YouTuber come out saying, I'm gay, or I'm a lesbian or some shit like that I get a tight feeling in my chest and can't even look at the page because I freak out about that possibility of me being gay. 
I don't want to be gay for several reasons, one is the social reasons, I don't want people that would find out to just whisper behind my back something like ""Yea, when we were kids and talked about the future and he always talked about having a wife and kids, but now he's gay so..."" I also can't really imagine a future without a wife and kids, even if I had a husband and kids it just doesn't seem right to me somehow, anything in my future without a wife and kids just seems...lonely I guess. 
On to the dirty crap. So I've seen porn and crap, and erotic manga and stuff like that. For straight things I get an erection, lesbian things too, not gay things though (I've only seen like 3 or 4) and on cam 4 I thought I saw a girl blowing a guy and got a sort of chub then I saw it as a guy and it slowly went down. On that website I've seen women by themselves and gotten an erection and that should be proof enough for me but it isn't, I don't think I'm gonna be okay with it until I have sex, so when I go to college I may need to hook up with a girl in my school or maybe even a mom on one of those websites if I get desperate enough. 
I have so much doubt but under that I have the feeling that I'm straight. So this leads to my other worries.
I feel like, if I am straight, or even if I'm gay, I won't ever fall in love with someone, or someone won't fall in love with me. I don't want to end up alone, whether I'm straight or not, I just stress that I won't ever have a wife and kids.
The reason that I can't tell from all of this stuff is my emotions, my emotions are so f***ed up. Seriously, I used to get a warm feeling thinking about a wife and kids but now in the things that are straight and gay I just get a tightness type of thing in my chest. I can't figure out my emotions when I get that feeling when I'm talking to my friends or watching a dirty video. 
I could really just use an anonymous outlet to talk about this with, so please, could you help me out?"
First Time Experiencing Stress,"Im 17 and have never truly had a problem with stress before however theres a lot of things on my mind at the moment. Firstly, my mum has recently just been diagnosed with cancer. Although the doctors think she should be okay it is not something which is comfortable on my mind. Also Ive just finished my exams and really am not confident with how I have done on them and I am just really worried about getting my results in august as these will decide on which universities I go to. Finally, I also have quite a few things coming up in the next few months which need to be planned however just don't seem to be moving forward and its just really starting to stress me out. So overall things just really aren't good in my home environment at the moment and its really messing with my head.

I just need help trying to cope with all if this. How do I deal with all this stress? Please help."
Too many things for my brain to handle.,"I hope this is the right place for me to post.

I am currently in high school, and I am sitting my first set of GCSE exams. That in itself is usually stressful enough for anyone. I have made a timetable to guide me and have found some things to help me revise, but they rarely work as I just feel too stressed to be motivated.

I really dislike my school life. I spend my break times with good people, but half of my lessons just bug me. The teachers are so unenthusiastic, and one of my teachers is just a down-right condescending butthole. She makes my school life miserable.

I also have a few events coming up, things I need to practice for, and I also have a small part time job. I am having trouble juggling revision, and other events. It's stressing me to no end.

My parents and my SO do provide emotional support but I feel my stress is bugging them, and would like advice from someone who doesn't deal with me on a regular basis.

Does anyone have any advice for a situation like this?

I'm most likely going onto academic suspension and I really need some words of encourgement,I really dropped the ball this time and boy am I going to be paying for it. I'll have to go through an appeal process and right now I am really freaking out. A few words of encouragement would really help.
What To Do When Job and Life Are At You,"That sounds cynical, but it's kind of true.

Right now, I'm learning that I might not have a job, and the job I had was fairly stressful anyways, with lots of workplace... competition.

But now it looks like I might not have one soon anyways, and my BF is with the same company.

Even then, because they're losing money, we're losing our paid vacation time and sick leave.

Then there's me being sick on the little bit of vacation I did use, sinus infection, and the same weekend I learned my little kitty of 10 years was going to be put down.

Now I'm just constantly headached and kind of freaked out, anyone got any ideas on how to relax?"
Income Inequality Stress Survey,"I am in a senior seminar class where we choose a social issue and investigate further into it, and hopefully by the end, develop some sort of solution.

My topic is income inequality and how it effects quality of life. I have already determined that stress is one of the major results from not having enough income, however I would like some fresh perspectives on it. I am placing this survey to judge how much of an impact income related stress has on people, and how much background knowledge people have on income inequality.

I have a survey which I hope you would take the time to answer so I can make sure that all of my bases are covered before I begin to develop a solution. Thank you for your time.

I'm having a difficult time but have started exploring support,"I booked myself onto a workshop a couple of months ago, called 'being connected' and yesterday it came around. It was quite odd and all of a sudden I felt really exposed. I was teary-eyed when everyone else was introducing themselves, and when it came to me, I lasted all of 10 seconds before crying. 

I am so not used to talking about myself, and I never realised how anxious doing so makes me, but all of a sudden I was sharing. It was really odd, and not much was said about the fact I had cried. I stopped crying then got on with the workshop, it was about connections. Not just with oneself, but with others. 

My main thoughts were that I struggle connecting with myself, as I distract myself with telly, Internet, etc, and also that I need to focus on connecting with myself before I have any chance building real connections with other people. 

I felt a little freer after the session, as if being so open in a public (but confidential) domain opened the channels for me to try and be more open generally. But it also opened some floodgates and I'm feeling more depressed - possibly because I've acknowledged feelings rather than distracting myself from them. 

I'm thinking about attending another session, but I'm understandably anxious, and worrying that I'll open the floodgates to a whole load of shit I didn't know I was harbouring. "
I get so stressed and i cant control it,"I've come to realise recently that I have a stress problem. 
I always have to have something on my mind to stress about otherwise I don't feel at ease.
Right now its my best friend, his anxiety is bad and he wants to die, so I worry about him all the time.
My Nan has bowl cancer, I come back from uni every 4 weeks and I see her in such a bad state and it stresses me out.
My ex-girlfriend has been on my mind recently because I have slept with someone other than her, which was strange since we had been going out for 4/5 years and she broke up with me.
I just don't know what I have, anxiety, stress or depression, or maybe all 3. I get so down and I don't tell anyone about it, usually im the most chatty out of my friends but then I stress when im down because I don't talk and don't want my friends to notice.

I didn't know where else to post this,"Almost every day, I am not able to go to school (8th grade) because I just end up freaking out and crying on the way to the bus stop. I have no reason to be and I have no idea why I am but can somebody try to enlighten me? "
I NEED HELP! Stress is taking over my life!,"Time to right whatever comes to mind as in comes to mind. Maybe this might be a way to deal with stress. I’m always dealing with stress. Constantly. It does my head right in. Tight chest, headache, stomach knots and a complete frustration that seems to be endless. I fear this may never go away, because my brain will not allow it. I speak to people in whom I trust and that helps. But once I get a positive answer or the one my brain is searching for, for peace as you will, it immediately returns to its normal function of stress. It thinks, wait a minute that sounds like a good solution but are they forgetting the many variables to the prospect they have outlaid upon me? Yep, someone gives me brilliant advice and I hinder any chance of progress, unconsciously by adding in all what ifs? Which yes, is completely ridiculous but I can’t seem to change this. I am at my wits end. But what problems are I dealing with you ask?

Let’s list them;

**Weight:** I have had a problem with weight since I hit about 18. Before this I was very underweight. At the same time I started getting weight around my mid-section is the exact same time that I started to fill out with my post pubescent muscle. This is confusing for my stress brain. Because of all of a sudden I have gained quite a rapid build, which is genetic and I was wondering when I would look like the rest of my family, but then also I had started work as a mechanic a very male orientated world where drinking mass amounts of alcohol and eating fatty foods on you breaks was considered the norm and put on a fair amount of weight around my belly. I used to deal with this fairly well. I am not obese just overweight. But then slowly more and more people would comment. Or call me fat. This hurts tremendously. And this made my stress fall of the fucking edge. Obviously with that my whole outlook on myself as a person. This was made worse years later when I moved out of home and moved in with my current partner and her parents. They are massive advocates for telling you how overweight you are and how you need to exercise more and so on and so forth. I was treated these people with a great deal of respect and so I wouldn’t talk back or stand up for myself. But it made me feel terrible. Mind you at this time I weighed about 100kg. But I am fairly muscly my optimal weight is around the 90kg mark. Anyway, this went on for the next 3 years of living at this house and it fucking murdered my confidence. Even to this day, we will go over to their house for a visit and it isn’t unusual for them to comment about my weight. But fast forward to now, and I have been with their daughter for 5 years, we are engaged and have 1 beautiful daughter together and a new baby on the way. You would think that this alone would make me happy. Hmm me too. Now that I am working away for days at a time to make sure that my family has everything they could ever want or need I don’t even contemplate the thought of exercising. I’m usually to fucked from work and either try to take my mind off being away from work by hanging out with work mates, or calling my partner and child. In between this going for dinner, showering, doing my washing and trying to get a decent sleep so that I’m not completely fucked for work the next day. So you could say with another 16kg and a lot on my plate I don’t bother with exercising or having a decent diet. Yeah your right with what you’re thinking, well you could change that by going to the gym and eating better. If you lost weight wouldn’t you be happier. I might be, but I have never been the type to go to the gym, or play sports. I work a fucking physical job in the heat of 45 degrees plus. I have more on this, but for now that’s a little insight to the way I’m feeling with this subject.

**Money:** Now this is a good one. I earn just over $100 000 AU a year. But, with the cost of living in WA, little known Australia this doesn’t go far. I am by no means Lamborghini rich. I explained this to my friends who seem to assume that I’m made of money, yet I’m paying their annual wage in tax and that accounts for some of the reason the money even know it sounds great doesn’t go far, that the only difference between me and them, is if they get a bill they might have to split the cost into 2 separate pays, if I get a bill I can pay it out of 1. Not much difference. Being the sole income and paying a higher than average rent price because this was the only rental I could get being young (24), then food, bills, having a small amount of emergency cash, partners clothes and other needs and my daughters and then almost my next babies etc., we are not left with much. And by no means frugal with our money. And yes I am not naïve enough to not realize that there are other people out there doing it way tougher. But dealing with chronic stress/anxiety issues I just make mountains out of mole hills. But I seem to be able to not to help this at all. So money does my head in. We might get left with a few hundred dollars for our self in a pay maybe, and this still stresses me out. I worry about enjoying ourselves at all just in case we need something. It always makes me feel sick and makes me feel like I’m failing my family. 

**Obtaining a Mortgage:** This was a massive issue for ages. And still is, but we are in the process of getting it sorted. But renting is stressing me out. I always think we are going to get kicked out or something. Even know I am not doing anything wrong, look after his house and pay my rent on time every time. My brains just keeps bringing up everyone else horror stories with renting. But in saying this, I was happy to rent. Until once again, my parents in law hammered us for so long that this is the ultimate goal in life and that my father in law will not accept us renting. Hammered into me for so long I developed a huge complex about the issue. He has since then apologized for being this way, yet it is burnt into my brain so hard that, well it won’t leave. Then now, we have almost been pre-approved for a loan for a house, but because I was bankrupt (currently discharged and I am half way through the 4 year default period after bankruptcy as per Australian Law) I could only obtain 1 lender who would lend me the finance through a non-conformist loan. Great, I can get into the market. But at a cost of paying back a 7% interest rate which is quite high in Australia. And the amount that I can afford to pay the repayments with such a high interest rate isn’t a whole lot for a house. It will not buy a house where we need to buy. If I moved 2 hours away I could, but not really practicable for getting to the airport for work, and for my partner being close to her and my family and friends for her comfort when I am away. So this now is an added stress.
 
**Loneliness:** I feel very lonely. Quite a bit. On my partners’ side of the family, she has 1 brother. Who also has a partner and child. And my god does my sister in law get favoured over me. My mother in law goes to see her, tags her in shit on Facebook, will have a conversation with her other the shit about her life, or if I’m doing something wrong that I personally receive. And she is always talked about so highly. Not myself, I recently found about them all talking behind my back. Yet I have done everything right by Brooke, am ALWAYS respectful, always help with dishes and stuff when I am around at their house. Things like this, nothing have I done, but am always blamed for shit, or my opinions don’t matter or are wrong. And so I feel like the biggest outsider to that side of the family. Now my family, when we go there for dinner, quite often my parents will starting telling me the things that they I think I do wrong or what not and will all gang up on me. My partner will tell them things she thinks I’m doing wrong or what not and cop it. Every time we go there. A massive reason to why I feel lonely. Feel like an outsider everywhere. These people I do think love me, just I feel through these things alone and unloved.

I do have a lot of good things in my life, like a stable job, a beautiful partner and daughter. And one more on the way. Yet I always feel stressed. I don’t know anymore. But I’m starting these blogs, for a maybe hoping to help relieve but maybe get some advice and see what I can do.

Tools for Stress Busting.,
"Meditation, medication or manipulation?","Hi
I've had back pain for three years now. It comes and goes every 3-4 weeks and can stay for 1-2 weeks at a time. I usually feel it in or around my bones all up and down the spine and back of the pelvis but it could be my muscles too. I've had blood tests and MRIs done and nothing is wrong there. My doctors think it's stress.

So i recently did an intense 10 day meditation course and when i left i felt i gained some real knowledge into myself. I realised how stressed i've been since i was a kid. Actually my mother said i was a tensed, stiff baby too. When i left this camp my body was the most relaxed and flexible it has ever been. It was simply amazing and it showed me that part of my problem was postural problems. The other part was simply stress. I realised that even though i wasn't running around pulling my hair out i really was activating my mind all the time and over using it without the ability to turn it down like a switch or volume knob. Likewise with my body, i just carry tension all over from being a stiff person i guess.

After one week back in the city from the meditation camp, not even back at work, my body was back to it's usual stiff self. And shortly after the pain returned as usual. I wasn't keeping up the meditation to be honest though. I didn't realise that i needed to maintain the calm mind or else all would revert as it did.

How do i go forward? How does one really change their life to living a calmer life in body and mind? I've tried yoga for a year now, which i love, but it won't work because my body always gets the pains and then i go back to a terrible state in my body. This battle is probably originating in my mind. I've taken other relaxing steps in my life to try and naturally combat my stress. But now i need to get more serious.

I see three options. I could do a long 3-4 month stint in a meditation center and hopefully really change my hardwired habitual patterns of living. This is intense and scary but possible. Can you really change who you are in 3 months? They say to try something for 90 days if you want to change habits which is why i came up with this time period.

A second option is taking anxiety medication to increase serotonin i might be lacking from stress. I could do this. But i guess i have obvious problems with this to start with it. 

The last option is manipulation like from osteopaths or chiropractors. This might actually be good but i feel that i could spend alot of money for the changes not to stick. I never have had medium/long term results with my osteopaths in the past. Do they ever work for people?! I absolutely know that they CAN maniuplate a body. But i don't know if they can do it to fix the problem at hand. My problem is to fix some blockage that might be unknown to me at the moment. Maybe this isn't entirely in my head. 

I'm thinking of a little bit of osteopathy and a few months off work to do some meditation camps if i can get it. What do you think? Please any help and advice is welcome as i'm dying with pain and need some outside views.

tl;dr for a serious step in managing my lifetime of stressful living should i try meditation for say 3 months, take anti-anxiety medication or do some manipultions like osteopathy?"

"Extreme amount of positive stress, any advice?","I am in a currently very good job but I do not love it, I recently received a verbal offer for a dream job and I had to tell my current boss who I am extremely close with.

Hiding this interview process was stressful alone but now I am in limbo that he knows about my new offer.  He knows I want to go there and we are ok as far as I know.

Now I am waiting for the physical offer letter and they have called a few references whom I have spoken to and all is well on that end, even the Director of HR at the new company added me on Linkedin.

This stress and anxiety of getting the physical letter is killing me.  I can't stop worrying that this offer will evaporate and I will be stuck with my boss knowing what happened.  My eye has been twitching a bit for 2 months and now it is very frequent.  I emailed my contact at the new firm this morning and have gotten no reply (which is normal from time to time but like I said, I am surprised by my amount of stress over this situation).

I would love any tips, or just for someone to read this who wouldn't mind discussing a bit.  A girl I'm dating basically got mad at me for not being happier about this but I can't enjoy it until I have the official offer to sign.

In the algebra honors class I take at 6:30 am, I am stressed daily because of my nervousness. I have never gotten a C+ or below and just having a B fills me with fear. Other things rush through my head that I just push back. I don't get enough sleep and don't know how. I probably get near 6 or 7 hours even though I have a fixed bedtime. I really can't get to sleep fast enough. I  have a great academic and social life, but sometimes I fear I push myself past my boundaries. Really would like some tips, thanks."

"Alright, I need some advice, I feel like I am going to go insane","Im 21, at my parents, droped out of high school, I have a 2 year old daughter who I have on weekends. I recently got a full time retail job doing stock and I really started to wonder tonight, what the fuck did I do to myself?? I love my daughter and her mom I want her mom to do well. But my ex is such a controlling, right all the time type person and I will forever have that link to her. I left construction and I still dont regret that choice but I wish I held on to it a little longer as I did sweet fuck all for months on end and money is low. My dad has to pay a lawyer numbers in the five digets to keep him out of jail, so he will need my help to help pay in my near minimim wage job and I cant argue with that cause I live here. My ex demands me to pay daycare 500 per month and im going to have to tell her to take me to court because she gets money to pay her living for school and child tax. I know ths court wont make me pay that much.

I just want to get the fuck out of this house, I wish I had week ends as I cant date or nothing. Not that I even want to living at my parents with no car. I just wish I had time to spend with friends. The only smart thing I did in my teens was quit hard drugs and alcohol. Because if I didnt drinking would be way too good right now. But I now see it from an outside perspective. What the FUCK do i do? I feel like im going to just lose my shit at work sometimes when my ex is leaving me endless texts whinning about something, feel like throwing my phone and throwing random shit at the wall and kicking over boxes. But I wont... But sometimes I just reallyy feel like it. I feel trapped"

Stress Management Tips for Winter for IDEAL MAGAZINE | Steve Richard Braithwaite,
Help? My little brother seems to be consistently stressed about school.,"I wasn't sure where to post this, and I don't know what to do. Any advice is welcome.  
My little brother (Sophomore in HS, 15 yo) has always been a perfectionist. He's gotten straight A's since grade school, he's really smart, etc. Recently he's been really really stressed and anal about all of his work. I started college this past fall and he refused to miss two days of school to help me move, stating that he couldn't miss any of the first week of school. He's always worried about getting work turned in, even though he does 90% of it in advance, his teachers love him and he learns quickly. He cries when he gets under an 80% in a class or on a test or assignment. He's not stressed because of outside pressures- his parents and teachers are constantly telling him to slow down, calm down and not worry so much but he doesn't listen to them. He's the one pressuring himself into working so hard he barely has time for anything else. He complains about being stressed constantly but he can't de-stress himself and he refuses to let anyone else try to calm him down or talk to him about it, including my parents and myself. I've tried suggesting to my parents that he might need professional help, since he refuses to listen to any of us, but they are quite against any sort of professional psychiatry (""my little baby isn't crazy he just needs to calm down a bit"") and will not admit that he has a serious problem. From what I've heard he's also shown symptoms of depression and anxiety surrounding his schoolwork and his girlfriend (who is very understanding and supportive, and very wonderful about the whole thing). I don't know what to do anymore because it is clearly affecting his and my parents' life and I don't think any person should ever be under that much stress.  
An example- and what made me make this post: We are all currently on winter break, and his ends on Monday 1/6. Our family is planning on taking a short drive to a major city in our area to visit some friends and sightsee from Thursday until Sunday evening. He flat-out refused to go because he is ""uncomfortable with getting back so late"". He's got all of his work for the break done. I certainly don't understand any of what's going on with him or how to fix it, and my parents have no clue what to do with him. He's currently being yelled at. Reddit, help me out!

"The stress of a college senior, HAE ever been in this situation?","This is my last semester of college, I'll be graduating with my bachelor's in about a month and a half, and this feels like my most stressful semester yet. 

I've been taking less classes than I normally do, yet I feel like I've had more homework and studying than other semesters in which I've taken more classes. There's exams every other week in another class that I'm in, and there's also been some extra assignments I've had to take care of as part of the graduation process, along with community service work that I've been trying to help with for a school org, and everything becomes so overwhelming at times.

The most overwhelming thing to me lately has been the fact that since I'm about to graduate, I need to try and find a good out-of-college job, yet every time I think about working on cover letters and applying to different positions it seems like there's an exam I need to study for or an assignment I need to finish. I try to relax on the weekends but I can't help but think about other things I should be doing. 

People keep telling me that I'm so lucky to be graduating really soon, but its hard to feel lucky when there's still so much to do and not knowing what I'll be doing after I graduate makes it even worse. I'm also afraid that I'll disappoint relatives and even friends if I don't find a good job soon after graduation, and I really hate that pressure. I'm honestly afraid about what life will be like when I'm not in school anymore, I read and hear so many stories about college graduates having a lot of difficulty getting good jobs, and getting jobs that aren't even related to their majors. When all these worries and stress from schoolwork invade my head I feel like I'm going crazy and little things start to make me really angry and sometimes I just want to jump off a bridge. 

One last thing: every time I go to look at job postings to apply for something after graduation, each position seems to require several years of experience in the related field.... how in the world am I supposed to have so much experience when just out of college?"

Sick for the 3rd time in 2 months,"I just keep getting sick and it’s causing a positive feedback loop of stress. I get sick, can’t get my work done, miss class, work my ass off to catch up, and in the process get sick again which makes me even more stressed. What’s odd is that I’ve started getting sick more after I started eating better and working out, which I thought would have the opposite effect. 

How can I break this cycle and reduce my stress? "
overwhelmed by stress choosing new career path,"Im at a stand still currently due to overwhelming stress I feel at choosing a new career path. Now Im not fresh out of school or anything , Im 34 but I need a better job where I can hopefully buy a house etc.

Ive worked crap retail most of my life and its gotten worse rather than better. I tried moving up into management in the past and kept getting rejected . No matter how good I was it was never enough. Now after being at my current job for four years , doing my best since i also help look out for my grandmother. I dont live with her but I help her with bill payments , Dr visits etc.  I hate my job and its making me a miserable pile of crap , plus its a dead end. 

My own fault I know , for staying at a dead end job so long. And my coworker that has been working here like 8 months after coming back from leaving to work at another job , has been given a lead position. Ft and a lot more pay ,,,, I just wanted to walk out right then. I was so angry , but I cant i have bills , rent...

So im being pressured by my family to find a real career  , like...now. And I know what they are saying I know I need one. I want to have my own home etc. I have been trying to find something online that i could do where i dont have to move , since i look out for my grandmother. And where I wouldnt be away for long periods of time.

I look and look and look. And I just dont know what to do.I feel such pressure to find it I end up overwhelmed and Im not very useful in that state. I did find however that the unemployment office has financial assistance available to go to school for trades or a lot of other things. Where they will cover the cost of the schooling as long as you get a job asap right after you graduate.

So I thought of truck driving  , like local routes etc because i like to drive. But I get very stressed/angry in heavy traffic and people ,well they drive like their insane. Also thought of the Postal service as a mail carrier. But i just dont know. How do i calm down and make a choice? I have to make one I have to get out of my current job as soon as possible. "
mom waking up at night and having anxious feelings,"so my dad used to be an alcoholic when he was together with my mom. mom spent about 10 years always worrying and being very alert because dad was always out and drinking and he was also very violent to her.

now, after about 8 years since the divorce, my mom keeps waking up at night. sometimes she smokes a cig because she feels anxious. it is a weird sensation for her she says. then he just calms herself down and tries to go to sleep again.

...and the stress set in.,"I usually do my best to avoided the thought of being stressed because then it makes it real... but fuck it’s hitting me like a bull.
I (M/24) am incredibly stressed out. I’m in the military, at my last base we had a storm that destroyed it.m, after that people broke into my house and stole things that have taken me and my wife years to acquire. There was a accident at our storage location and we lost over $8000 of belongings especially momentous from my kids childhood. Someone broke into my car and stole items out of it. 
Fast forward 2 months, I’ve gotten orders away from my last base and my wife’s (who is in the reserves) commander won’t release her from her unit so she’s still in that area and I’m alone in the new house/ new state. When i face time my wife and kids my kids cry and tell me they miss me. I don’t have a couch because it was stolen. Don’t have a tv, because it was stolen.  4 days after moving in guess what? Mother Nature decided to knock down the poser lines. It’s been 7 days that I’ve had no electricity. It’s 33 degrees in my house, i can see my breath....
The first day i lost power i drove to my brothers house and stayed there 3 days. Felt like i was intruding on him and his wife, finally got a text saying my power was back on, checked my app.. and it was! After getting stuck in the snow for 3 hours and finally got to my house at 2am i decided to take a shower after noticing my $300 worth of groceries were spoiled but i wanted chipotle. Got my food and decided o would eat after i get cleaned.. mid shower my power (again) turned off. Told myself it’ll turn back on in a couple hours. Then at least i could heat up my now cold food.
8 hours later no power, drove  1 1/2 hours back to my brother, to intrude some more on Valentine’s Day. When i walk through the threshold i get a text saying my power is on. Used a app in my phone to check and it sure enough was back on.  I left and forgot to turn down my heat and make sure all the switches were off in case the power turned back on....which it has. I also forgot my food, chipotle isn’t cheap...
Almost forgot to mention. I would love to workout to relieve some of this stress but due to my career i have arthritis in both my knees, a destroyed rotator cuff in my left shoulder, my right shoulder is starting to hurt because of reasons unknown, i think my eyes are going to shit because i have to get up to read things i would usually be able to read from where i originally was, and a little side note is i don’t have enough money to buy a couch to sit on so i got a $15 bean bag chair that hurts my back, that already likes to have random spasms. Also i can’t find my Ambein that was prescribed to me because i can’t sleep. Someone probably stole that too. All this while juggling the regular stress from the military.

At this point i just don’t care. I’ve given up. I’m way too stressed. My life has been shit for the past 5 months. Every corner has a big fuck me when i turn it.
I just want my family back.
I just want to be happy again.

If it weren't obvious from the subreddit I posted this on, I'm obviously very stressed. In the last few weeks I've been suffering from headaches and I relied on meds. When I finally went to see a doctor she said that I ""Do forty hours of work in a day"". As I also sleep for a minimum of 7 hours and maximum of 10 I don't think lack of sleep is my problem.

Spent 2 hours drawing a little girl in a charcoal portrait and now have to redo the whole thing!,"Sigh, I’m just annoyed. It’s my first time doing commissions for people outside of family - I have given portrait gifts, and have had family members request things (and pay me) for gifts for other people, and they’ve always been well-received - but a family member of a friend requested this large picture of 2 kids and 3 pets. 

I’ve been trying to work on it between work (which leaves me so exhausted some days I just come home and sleep), other projects, regular responsibilities, and my depression that likes to pop up and have me waste hours being sad, angry, or numb but doing nothing.... 

Anyway, I got about halfway through the piece after drinking a big soda to stay up late and work on it. Over 2 fucking hours I worked on the little girl and one of the dogs. I sent a progress report pic to the customer and last night she had some minor criticisms but nothing too bad. 

This morning she messaged me and was like “I don’t know about this. She doesn’t look like in the photo”. So I offered to redraw her but said that since in the original photo the girl is making a bit of a weird face, it might look a little awkward in the drawing (which is one of the reasons it might not look like her as much). She hadn’t messaged me back yet either. I’m gonna assume it’s a yes. 

I Can understand where she’s coming from, and I Will redo it. It’s just annoying to spend several hours on something and then be told to do it again. I will of course. I just need to complain about it first.

Update: Made adjustments, but she still wasn't happy with them. She asked if another picture would be easier and I was like ""Look, it's not that the reference picture has to be easier; my art style is not photo-realistic, it has a certain style to it, you can see that and my skill level in the examples I posted. If you want a photo-realistic style, than you're not gonna find it with my art. I'm sorry."" (Not exactly word-for-word but you get the gist). She agreed that it wasn't gonna work out than. It kind of hurts because it feels like I'm not good enough, but I know that logically that's not it... I just hope the feeling passes.

For as long as I can remember, **I've struggled with stressing over what people think.** It wasn't as big a deal before, since I mostly hung around close friends, co-workers etc. But since I moved to Austin (and met a ton of new people), I routinely stress about what people think of me.

And because of that, I tend to hide parts of myself: what I'm passionate about, what I think about topics, even parts of my faith. It all depends on who I'm around. But I'm always thinking

""What if they don't like that?""

""What if they think I'm weird?""

So then I hide parts of myself. But **every single time** I do that, I regret it afterward. I get this stinging feeling -- like a part of myself is being chipped away. I suppose that's because, well, it IS being chipped away. And those new relationships seem kinda fake.

**Can you relate to this? I'd love to hear about it in the comments..**

Anyway, a little while ago I learned something very important about emotions. 

*Our emotions are driven by extreme desires.* 

And if we understand our emotions, we'll have a weapon to overcome them and be our best self. The story below is about one of my struggles with stress and a strategy I use to have (some) success in overcoming it. I hope it helps you guys too.

Is it normal to feel stressed about the prospect of being depressed?,"So basically I struggle with depression. A lot of times it comes over rational reasons but often times for trivial things. Right now I feel more or less happy.. but I find myself getting really anxious and worried about future depression and it's really stressing me out. Is this normal? If so, how do I manage it?"
Deep rooted self esteem issue at work causing stress,"So when I first started at my job - I had a shaky foundation that set the stage for everything else. 

I inherited clients from another more senior consultant and the handover was done incorrectly. It happened too soon before I had been properly trained which resulted in me making mistakes that made the client see me as the incompetent new and young person.

Those things are holding me back from
Operating at my full potential because I know I operate out of fear. I doubt and second guess myself a lot. I hesitate and fear picking up the phone. Fear coming off as too aggressive or too pushy or not sending the right person and Err On the side of not being aggressive enough. I’m afraid to take control as I fear ruining relationships etc. 

Last year i still did surprisingly well despite all this and even earned a rookie of the year title and won a trip. This year, my existing client base has gone a bit quiet and need to acquire new accounts and the fear and self doubt has reared its ugly head. If I don’t sign up new clients I won’t make money and if I don’t make money my job may be on the line and thats stressful.

I know I’m fully capable of doing this if only the self doubt and dwelling on past experiences would go away. But since my foundation was so shaky - I wonder - is It repairable? Should I ask to be re-trained until I’m confident in my ability? What is the best action to take so that I feel fully confident in what I’m doing and not operate out of fear?"

I have kinda reached my peak here in terms of brain fuckery and I am just looking for advice. I understand there are hundreds of posts dedicated to this, I just really need to vent to someone about this really, and if anyone has any words of advice it would be appreciated.

I am a senior at a university, and the stress is definitely packing on and directly affecting academics and my work. There are so many things to do and work on every day but I manage to get less than the bare minimum complete if at all.  I feel the main contributor is recently (a month ago) being prescribed zoloft for generalized anxiety, depression, and some ocd tendencies. 

&#x200B;

This semester I am only taking four intensive, time consuming classes, and I have roughly 10 hours of work a week which is mostly done remotely. I also dog walk for some extra cash to afford food. The problem is I have been way too lax, and unfocused, generally taking way too long for basic assignments or just not finishing them, which evolves into not submitting them. With my work, I used to be able to put it first and get things done even between my classes, sometimes working over 10 hours a week as I'm given new projects. Lately, I have barely gotten any work done outside of my meeting day.  I believe it is the zoloft messing with me, maybe it was the anxiety that was fueling me to actually get things done. I feel like I just keep digging a hole for myself, and its my fault I'm in there. With work I get emails about updates to projects and I usually these days don't reply, and submit what I have worked on minutes prior to my meetings. Which always results in a pissed off boss really. Then I feel even worse and my ocd comes back telling me that I'm a horrible person and everyone hates me. Its a weird tick, I don't know how to describe it.

I've done meditation, I'm in a defense taekwondo  class currently ( I was physically abused so I'm pretty messed up in a lot of ways), I'm the secretary of a club on campus and try to do art things like inktober this month (haven't really been able to stick with it and instead of stress relief, became a chore). When working and doing homework I usually listen to binaural beats and chillhop together to try and boost concentration. I just somehow find myself staring at a blank screen, and getting distracted by anything and everything, and I'm just so tired all the time, like i can feel my breathing being much slower and calmer which is great, but as a result it feels like I in general am so slow. Drinking caffeine just makes me feel like I'm moving even slower somehow, my anxiety and ocd come back a little bit, and a cup of coffee only helps for about an hour. I feel like this entire post is just all over the place. Definitely goes to show the state I'm in. I used to be such a great student, able to handle 17+ credits with a 3.7gpa studying and working hard all the time.  I just want to get back to that point. Now, I get back home at 5pm exhausted, clean and make food, take care of my pup, before I know it its 8pm and I didn't even start work that needs to be done.

My life just needs a major revamp and evaluation. Maybe I need someone to help me schedule and prioritize what I need to do everyday. I don't know. I know theres a way out of the hole, its just getting to that point.

TLDR; Student recently on zoloft is having trouble focusing on work and studies, drastically affecting life, income, and academics. "
Any tips about dealing with stress for an angsty teen?,"I'm a 16 year old Male and I am just constantly stressed when I am alone(which happens often).

Stress from Hurricane Recovery,"&#x200B;

Hey everyone, 

Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago, my  personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my  maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay  with my family in Wilson, having to have family members be rescued from  their home due to a severe flash flood, and dealing with the shock and  emotions of loss once returning. On top of that, two of my family  members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of  recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major  impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with  insurance adjusters and etc. Has anyone else been through something of  the sort?"
College Stress,"This semester is supposed to be my last semester. I took four classes over the summer semester so I could graduate early. My summer semester didn't even come close to being stressful, I literally left the summer semester feeling great. All my stress started this semester, I don't know if its from nerves because I'm about to graduate or if its from this one professor. 

This professor I am taking for one class this semester is new, this is his first semester at my university. He basically started the class two weeks late because he was out of the country. He doesn't go over stuff in class at all, he goes over his papers (this is an empirical paper writing class).  He demands a lot from the students for this class, which I understand. Yet the part that keeps getting me stressed out is that I keep submitting paper ideas to him and he shoots them down. This past week we had our midterm, two weeks ago we went over what the midterm was going to be on in class. Two days before the midterm he emails the class and changes the parameters for what the midterm will be on. (Two weeks ago he said it would be 75 questions multiple choice, he changed it to 25 questions multiple choice and we had to answer 5 short answer questions and fill in a chart). Come the day of the midterm the whole class is worried about passing, some people are talking about sending a letter to the dean on how bad of a professor he is. The average for the class for the mid term was a 59%.

This class has me so stressed out that I feel like I am going to fail it regardless of what I do, that is how my friends in the class feel as well. The stress is also affecting my ability to do work for my other classes, I literally don't want to do any work at all.

I don't want to fail, I cannot afford fail. I have a nice job lined up for when I graduate, but if I fail it won't be open again for another year. 

How can I deal with this type of stress? 

&#x200B;"
I find myself getting stressed when people around me are stressed. How do I deal with this?,"I just started a new job. Always a stressful thing to do. I don't think I'm coping with it entirely well. A lot of the problem is that everyone in this office is highly stressed and it makes me stressed as well. I can't really escape it. If I lay out all my work it's not really a high volume or of a stressful nature, so I should be fine. But for some reason I'm in a haze of anxiety. 

And right now I'm sitting on the couch watching football. A very relaxing thing to do and my partner sitting next to me is trying to renew the car insurance and is being all stressed out about it, huffing and puffing. I can feel the agitation and anxieties building in myself.. Kinda ruining my evening.

How can I make this better? "

"My best friend is stressed, trying to help","So my best friend (practically my brother for over a decade) is beyond stressed right now. He's working a job he use to love but is burnt out on at the moment (fast food store manager so vacation isn't an option right now), his commute is about an hour each way, he's  working opposite shifts as his wife so he's barely seeing her. His kids live 4 hours away and he's barely seeing them. He's just beyond stressed.

I live 3 hours away so I want to send him a care package but not really sure what to put in it. I'd do candles or bath soaks generally, but I've never known him to be into those kind of ""girly"" relaxers. He's huge into music, but sending CDs is so obsolete with Spotify being a thing. I thought about sending a gift card to a restaurant so he and the wife could go out, but I almost think it might upset him more if they can't use it for awhile because of scheduling.

I'm at a loss, but I need to do something for him. Any ideas?"
What are your ways to deal with stress?,"Hello, I have some bad habits (nail biting, hair pulling, etc) when I'm stressed and I want some advice on how to deal with stress and it's effects."
Mental Abuse bc of my Mom,"i don’t know what to do anymore, my family is going through reallly tough times right now, you can’t imagine. and some way even though we’re all hurting, my mom still finds a way to mess with me. i don’t have any mental illnesses and my mom has none either ( not diagnosed maybe ). She continues to tell me things that i have seen or done that aren’t true. she’s telling me these things that are not true and trying to make me think they are and if i don’t she yells at me in front of my sister and curses at me as i’m crying in front of her because i can’t take it anymore. She tells me i don’t support my llittle sister and that i don’t love her ( she’s 10) and how i don’t show her affection. Except i do all those things, me and my sister are extremely close and especially now because of stuff. she said that because i didn’t show enthusiasm for her 8:30 am soccer game i have to go to. Another thing is that she thinks i met my dads “gf” which i didn’t even know he had, if he even does. she’s telling me i’m not telling her because i’m on his side and i should go live with them and she’ll take my sister and leave. i’m 15, i don’t want to be anywhere near my dad bc of the shit he’s done and this has been going on for 4 years now. she also claims i give her an attitude anytime i do something. today i took the pair of shorts to fold and she looked at me and said “ are you really gonna grab them like that? your a fucking asshole. your giving me an attitude after all this shit? you’ll be in fucking trouble” and i said no i didn’t. then she goes, “ yes u fucking are, your father is setting you up for this, your still trying to protect him. don’t you dare say ur giving me an attitude”. and every time i said i didn’t she would tell me to shut the hell up and to say it one more time. i would tell that i’m not and why would i, then she would chase me around the couch with her hand raised. she then tells me i’m self centered and i’m a fuck up and i’m fucking my sister up. And once everything has been said 10 mins later she acts like she did none of it. she asks me if i want tea and to watch tv with her. this all probably sounds so confusing but it’s mentally making me lose it. i cant do this anymore, i can’t balance school and my personal issues and family issues and her altogether. what do i do??   plz?
