A stranger just saved my life...,"I woke up today wanting to die. I was planning on doing it after school so I decided school was pointless to go to. I walked to the mall by my school and went to a Kneader's and ordered french toast. French toast has always been my favorite so I figured it would be a good last thing to eat. I pondered a ton about my life and what it is I really want. I felt super empty but also my mind was racing with thoughts. I had convinced myself I needed to finish my life today. I had been thinking for about half an hour when an elderly man sat across from me and gave me a hot chocolate. He said that he ordered it for me because he could tell I needed it. He told me ""I don't know what you're going through, but life will get better."" And then he left. And then I cried. And now I'm back at school, and I think I want to live. 

Edit: Thank you to everyone who responded to this and messaged me and just were so kind. <3 "
"""Depression isn't always at 3am when you're alone with only the thoughts in your head. Sometimes it's at 3pm, when you're surrounded by friends in the middle of laughing."" This is high functioning depression. So many people don't get it.","I look normal on the outside, but that's because I try very hard to."
"I want to be alone, but not lonely. I want friends but hate socializing. Want success, but have no desire to be productive. I’m lost in my own conscience.",Thank you all for the supportive messages. It’s heartwarming to know that I’m not alone. I know we can all get through this together. I love each and every single one of you 
I wouldn't commit suicide but if I had an option to suddenly stop existing I would choose it,"Does anyone else feel this way?  This has been crossing my mind a lot lately

EDIT: I just want to thank everyone for the thoughtful, kind comments I've been recieving.  It's been a nice change and I really appreciate it.  You guys are the best.  :)"
Do you ever just stop dead in the middle of whatever you're doing and feel a great wave of existential dread/self-hatred,"Happens to me a lot. Cooking, walking to class, brushing my teeth...sometimes I just stop for like a minute, feel a tremendous sense of self-hatred and suicidal ideation, and then continue on as if nothing ever happened."
"Anyone else ever feel like the “old you” died years ago, and now you’re just limping along as someone you really can’t stand?","Like, the old me wasn’t even that great either but damn "
My whole family just died in a car accident. Tomorrow is thanks giving. I'm 24.,"My mom and 13 year old sister died in a car crash yesterday. Tomorrow is thanksgiving. I'm feeling really sad and alone. Really sad and really alone. And I have tears in my eyes. I'm 24 and have no other family. It's just me now. I'm feeling really really sad. It hurts in my chest. I don't know what to do. I don't know. I feel like I'm in a cage, aw really small cage. It's really sad. I'll never get to see them again. I no longer have a family. I'm really really sad. And I'm angry. I'm really angry. But I'm not going to do anything about anything. I don't have a girlfriend so no shoulder to cry on. And even if I did I probably would feel ashamed to. The way I see it I don't really want to live. I'm not suicidal. I'm just very very sad. All I have to remember them by is their ghosts in my head as memories. My jaw is hurting from clenching. And I'm just really sad. This isn't the first big sad thing that happened to me. There's a book series called series of unfortunate events. My life is a lot Like that book only it get worse with every event. It has now snowballed into this. I'm expecting something even worse to happen because that's been my whole life. And the only good thing in it is gone now. My mom and sister. I miss them so much. I miss them so much. "
Imagine if the cure to a broken leg was to run a marathon with it. That's what getting help for depression looks like to me.,"I'm discouraged today! :D 

Edit: This is a bit overwhelming. But reading all your comments was lovely. I hope every single one of you struggling will find the light one day. I guess we can run this marathon together if that's what it should come for. You lean on me so your broken leg doesn't hurt as much, and I'll lean on the second person, etc. Have a wonderful day ❤️"
"Does anyone else swing from ""I'm seriously going to improve my life!!"", then have one setback, and suddenly be like ""fuck this shit, I'm going to kill myself""?","It's so weird. If I'm in a good mood, I'm totally optimistic and actually willing to put in the effort to improve myself/my life (e.g. start volunteering, go to a MeetUp group, get fitter etc). But then something happens, like as simple as a bad day at work. And suddenly all those plans fly out the window and my new plan is figuring out my suicide method, genuinely planning to go through with it. And look back at my ""positive"" self and think ""... wtf was I thinking? I wish I was dead."""
Does anybody else ever stay up late so they can avoid tomorrow?,
"When I don’t have a job, I want a job. When I have a job, I don’t want a job. When it’s hot, I want it to be cold. When it’s Fucking cold, I want it to be hot. When I’m myself I want to be with people, when I’m with people I want to be by myself",Do you guys see what I’m saying here. I’m always constantly completely bullshitting myself 24/7. I always pretend that there are a few certain things that would make me feel a little better then I get them and I want the opposite. Complete self destruction and all 
"I feel like I'm getting stupider, less talented, clumsier, and that soon I will be completely retarded.","As the title says. I feel like I'm getting worse and worse at everything. I feel like I'm getting weaker, much much dumber (I used to know a shit ton of trivia, a lot of history and be really good at helping people out. Now I've forgotten most things unless I read up on it daily, I've been relying more and more on canned responses when talking to people and I've become completely socially unaware). Things that used to be easy are now difficult, I constantly make typos and I can't even concentrate on things I like, much less things I dislike.

Anyone else feel like that?"
"anyone else get super motivated at night to get your life together, then when it's daytime that motivation is gone?",i wish i could still be motivated throughout the day. 
Anyone been depressed for so long they don't even know if they are depressed or if they are just really boring?,"I don't know if I'm depressed or if I've just lost my personality and identity. I don't know if this is me now or what? 
I'm nothing like the old me and it kills me to admit it. 7 years back dad said it was just a stage I'm going through, yet here I am. All my friends are still themselves I'm completely fucking different"
Sleeping is the only activity I don't hate because it's like a free trial of not existing,"Dreaming is also a bonus. Sure the occasional nightmares are bad, but at least it's better than being awake, where you feel bad 100% of the time."
Anyone like being in the shower not for the purpose to get clean but standing in the water while the hot water just runs through your body while you just stare,It makes me feel less alone and its like im safe from everything in there and a sense of dread takes over me when im finished and i have to get out and face the world again Weird post lol sorry
Suicide ice cream,"I contemplated suicide a few years ago. Couldn't take it anymore, everything was going to shit (you could argue it still is), obstructive suicidal thoughts,etc. So one day I decided to kill myself by hanging. Pretty straight forward right? Well the thing is i live in a bad neighborhood and there aren't a lot of hanging -friendly trees. They were only on main streets and i can't hang myself in front of the free clinic. I'd make them feel bad. And someone would take my shit, cant have that. Very surreal and fustrating using Google Maps to find a half decent suicide spot especially when you're working with shitty MetroPCS service.

Finally i found a spot. Small walking bridge in a secluded section of a neighborhood park. Good. Now for the suicide note. I get to work, banging it out all through the night. ""Not meant for this world"" ""i know you'll miss me but it's for the best."" Hit all the basic bullet points. Done. Now..........make a noose. But idk how to make a noose........so i look it up on WikiHow. 20 studious minutes later i have a functioning noose. All of a sudden i feel something from deep inside my deadened, numb brain. I'm proud of myself?? I'm proud if myself!!! I try to switch back to suicide mode but my mind is wandering now. ""I made a noose, thats kind of dope."" ""What else can i make?"" ""Homemade ice cream? Hmm."" So at around 4:30 am on a weekday, possibly a tuesday, i made homemade ice cream and here i am now typing this from a crappy android phone.

P.S. the ice cream was terrible
"
I´ve been told my whole childhood how intelligent I was. Now I can't live up to those expectations put upon me by others and myself. I feel like a failure.,"I am one of probably millions of people who where told as kids how intelligent they were, but I don't see it in myself and I can't live up to those expectations put upon me. In middle school I got lazy and relied on my ""intelligence"" too much. Now I i feel like everyone has surpassed me just because my naive 10 year old self thought that I was somehow special or above average. Now in almost everything I score below average and can't keep up with others. Its been like this for all of the latter part of middle school and my high school years. now as everyone else is just about to graduate, its not even clear if I even will graduate. Everyone has clear goals and ambitions where as I don't see any real future for myself."
"Does anyone habitually say things like ""I fucking hate myself""","I've developed a habit of saying depressive thoughts out loud bc I'm always alone, always thinking them, and talk to myself when no one's looking. 

It's reached the point where instead of saying ""fuck"" when something goes wrong I'll say ""I want to kill myself"". It's become so engrained in my mind that I've come close to accidentally saying these when other people are around. 

Anyone else do this?"
"Anyone else feel like their ""fake depressed""?","it's stupid, but i always doubt the fact i have depression, even after getting an official diagnosis, i'm still scared that i'm just an attention whore taking up everyone's time. Most of the time when i go to post something on here, i end up deleting it because i don't want someone in the comments to say something like ""your not actually depressed, your just a whiny teen"". I don't know. 

EDIT: Hey so i'm not the only one who feels this way. If anything it's slightly comforting to know that

EDIT 2: Yes i'm aware of the spelling mistake in the title, it's kinda hard to spell correctly when you're rambling at 11 pm"
One of the shittiest feelings is having a dream where you're genuinely happy then waking up to reality.,This happens to me a few times a year. It's like my brain is teasing me.
"Nobody cares if you're suicidal, only if you commit suicide","I have been through a roller coaster of absolute pain and there is no light at the end of the tunnel that isn't just more of this roller coaster ride. The people close to me no longer show concern because that's just who I am to people now. They either don't know me, or they know how much I'd love to not exist but am still not strong enough to put an end to it. And that's the thing isn't it?  
  
**Nobody cares until you're gone.** Nobody cares until you can 'prove it'. We're 'attention seekers', except I've isolated myself from everyone and I don't communicate how I feel anymore to anyone but internet strangers who also don't know me and therefore don't care.   
  
Unless you're actually about to pull the trigger, people would prefer if you shut up, fucked off, stop bringing down the mood, stop being a burden, you're simultaneously too much and yet not enough.     
  
They don't care what's causing my misery. God forbid I mention a person, or people are the stressors to what I'm feeling. That is manipulation. Suicidal people are manipulative. We just latch on to people and bring them down.  
  
I'm sorry. I don't want to be this way. I have asked, pleaded, begged for help. Nobody has offered anything to actually help me. Throwing vague suggestions and hotlines and websites isn't help. Leaving me to figure out my own shit does not help.   
  
At the very least I have learned how to bottle most things up. Nobody will have to worry about hearing about my pain. And eventually, hopefully soon, nobody will have to worry about me at all.
  

  Edit: I think a lot of people misunderstood. Nobody in my inner circle is foreign to mental health struggles. My mother is half the reason I have them, biologically speaking. We have similar symptoms. I've made it clear what kind of help I need and what I need help with to get there. I'm shrugged off because my struggling with suicidal ideation is not as pressing of a matter as whatever else is going on.  This was also general observation of how people react to suicidal people."
"Depression is when you don't really care about anything, anxiety is when you care too much about everything. And having both is just like hell.",
Does anyone else get those little highs that last like 10-15 seconds where you feel like you can do anything and are genuinely motivated and no one can stop you..but then it passes and you're back to feeling like complete shit?,
Anyone else stay awake late just because the idea of “tomorrow” feeling exactly like today is such a depressing thought?,"I know depression can sometimes be sleeping to much or little, but this is different.

It’s just that knowing that I’m not going going to fall asleep and stay asleep, that I’ll wake up in the morning and have to do this all over again, is so soul sucking that I force myself to stay up as late as I can. "
I wish i could transfer all my remaining days to someone who actually enjoys living.,
Did anyone else's depression fuck up their career or university/schooling experience?,"I was a high-achieving student in high school, went to university and shit hit the fan, graduated a year later than everyone else and is still unemployed 9 months later. I think about killing myself everyday, some days the thoughts are more active (with intention and a plan) and some days they're more passive. I look at who I used to be and get so sad. But I think ahead about the jobs and career choices, and I don't want to work in a cubicle 9+ hours a day for the next 40 years in a company that I don't give a shit about. "
Anybody ever been depressed since a child but only realised it was depression when you got older?,"Ever since I was young, I can't remember what age but definitely younger than 10. I would have this feeling inside me like emptiness and I didn't realise until I was an adult that this was depression when this feeling came back. "
"Nobody at all cares how depressed you are when you're alive, as long as you don't kill yourself. Now if I kill myself, then I'm just a huge selfish jerk who didn't think about anybody. Jerks...",
Do you ever feel guilty that your parents got stuck with such an incompetent failure?,"I think about it a lot. My mom has a friend of hers who has 2 kids. One is in an Ivy League school and the other is going to a nice university. They both get good grades, have a social life, and know where they're going in life. 

Meanwhile my mom got stuck with a total wastoid that sits around all day on his phone. I don't drive, don't have a job, don't really wash myself unless it's been a few days or I have to go out somewhere. I have severe ADHD and don't really do well taking basic classes. I just feel so guilty that this is what my mom gets to deal with. She always tells me about how it was such a magical moment when I was first born. And I just think ""if only she knew how I would turn out."" It wasn't her fault, though. She is such a loving caring person. She didn't deserve this. 

Anytime my dad comes home from work I have trouble even looking him in the eye because I know I'm probably such a disappointment in his eyes. I act normal around him but the anxiety and dread is always there in the background. I wish I could just kill myself and end the bullshit, but that would just hurt them even more. No matter what I do, everybody loses. "
"Today I brushed my teeth, took, a shower, exercised, vacuumed, played with my cat, stayed hydrated, and read a book.","Still want to die. Still a worthless, unemployed piece of shit with no potential. Still a burden to everyone in my life. 

Edit: went to bed after writing this post (I say bed because actually going to sleep is a rare occurrence) and did not expect so many replies. Thank you for your kind words. 

Edit 2: I'm in tears right now. I really didn't expect this kind of response and I'm feeling both grateful and a bit overwhelmed. I've been at the bottom of this hole for at least 4 years and things seem to be getting worse. Letting this out felt so good and I'm truly touched by everyone's comments. I'll be honest, I just don't have the energy to reply to everyone, but I appreciate this community so much. "
Does anyone else feel like depression and anxiety ruined all their potential?,"Now I'm not in school, can barley make rent, have no friends, family gave up on me. It's sad. It really is a travesty "
"People say they support people with mental illnesses while calling people who show obvious signs of mental illness 'creepy, lazy and messy.'","I'm sorry I'm not like the attractive, sad people on tv. Depression isn't just listening to sad music and brooding. It affects just about everything in your life and people need to stop pretending to care while insulting people who show actual signs of depression. "
"""I think the saddest people always try to make everyone happy because they know what it is like to feel worthless and don't want anyone else to ever feel like that""",Good quote by Robin Williams. Story of my life basically. I'm one of the goofiest/weirdest/most outgoing people you could meet and no one would ever guess what is going on inside my head.
I just want to sit on a rooftop at 2am and talk about life with somebody.,"While cuddling of course. 

Edit 1: I fucking love all of you

Edit 2: So many people in the US, no one is down under :("
You know something's wrong when you can't even muster the strength to play a fucking video game.,I just open up steam and endlessly stare at my library.
Today was my 21st birthday,"I turned 21 today. I live in one of the biggest college towns in the country. When you turn 21 here, it's a big deal. I just finished my third year of college and my third year of having absolutely no friends. I'm not the party type or anything, but it still is a bummer not to have a single friend to share the occasion with. Today I received three texts (more than most days): one from my mom, my dad and my cousin wishing me happy birthday. In all fairness, I don't have a facebook and I don't expect people to memorize by date of birth or anything, but it still feels really sad not to hear back from anyone. I guess I've never been comfortable with having a facebook, the idea of being so interconnected which each others' lives and making daily status updates is such a foreign concept to me. But I think in not having a facebook, I've sacrificed my social life absolutely. 

Anyways, I've spent the entire day in my room with the lights off trying to drink away the depression of today and of college. There is not a single person who if I called them right now, they would pick up and talk to me. I've been fighting with my parents and after a few shared 'unpleasantries,' are not answering my calls because they want we ""to cool off,"" and understandably so. I've been 'no contact' for ever a year with my girlfriend ( I knew from highschool) who I ended up dating long distance when we started college. Today, I made an attempt to call her (went to voicemail) to ask her if she'd let me take her out to lunch as friends to catch up but I haven't heard from her. It really breaks my heart that I lost that person who was my best friend for a good part of my life. I assumed she would have remembered today was my birthday. I certainly didn't forget hers. 

Anyways, If you've made it this far, from the bottom of my heart, thanks for listening to me vent. 


EDIT: The Reddit community has been absolutely amazing. You guys have been sending me happy birthday wishes from all corners of the globe, I've been getting offers for people to buy me drinks, and some have even given me their cell numbers to talk/text me if I was still feeling down. You guys are unbelievable. You turned what was a miserable day for me into one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. From the bottom of my heart, thank you. For all of you who took the time to help a stranger on the internet, thank you. Your words of encouragement have lifted up my spirit exponentially. I can't say it enough: thank you, thank you, thank you. "
Do you ever wish you would accidentally die?,I would never try to commit suicide again but sometimes I wish something else would just do the job for me. 
I desperately want to talk to someone about everything but I really don’t want to talk to anyone about anything.,
Dae else feel depressed because everyone else your age is going out and living their life and you sit alone in your room every week," People my age should be out living life and making memories but here I am feeling like shit in my room alone. Every fucking week it's the same shit. I just exist, I don't live. "
whenever I have to do anything stressful I briefly consider that I could just kill myself instead,
Reminder: NO ACTIVISM is allowed here at any time.,"We know that September 10 was World Suicide Prevention Day. And, we're all for activism. But not here, please and thank you. It takes focus away from our OPs in need of support and understanding. "
"""Depression is living in a body that fights to survive with a mind that tries to die.""","This was the caption of a photo that my classmate submitted for a photography class. (We have this Facebook group where we submit all our photography works)

**And it just resonated with me.** Depression is such an ass. Struggling with depression has fucked with my life so bad that I ended up self-harming and nearly killing myself three times this year. And I couldn't do it because I'm too afraid. I want things to end. But I couldn't. 

At this moment, I'm not suicidal. I'm not even at the point that I'm severely depressed to the point I can't function normally. It just resonates with my struggle, especially with my experience for years, but this year in particular... The fact that my mind has been telling me to die but my body doesn't. The fact that I still have it despite having great family, friends and a loving girlfriend. The fact that it has been affecting my life quite severely. The fact that it gives me anxiety and doubt for the future. And ultimately, the fact that I realize that its such a miracle that I'm waking up each day, still alive, and bravely battling depression.

Peace out, and much love."
My dog just saw me crying on the back porch and started barking at random things.,"She wasn't sure what was making me upset, but she wanted to scare it off. Getting a dog hasn't cured my depression, but she sure has made it easier to deal.

I love this dog."
People who are depressed should reach out to their friends. *tries to reach out* Nobody replies.,"UPDATE: So, I thought it would only be fair to post this update. While one friend still doesn’t seem to give a fuck, I’m meeting another friend for lunch tomorrow. Turns out she’s been having a thyroid flare up. One other friend also wants to make lunch plans soon so we’ll see about that. Some people care but have stuff going on, other people don’t care. Pay more attention to the former.

Original post:
Seriously, fuck everyone. It’s so easy to say after someone ends their life that they should have reached out to a friend and talked, but who’s really willing to listen? Only a select few of us are blessed with friends who listen with sympathy and respond in a timely way. The rest of them are just faffers. Capitalism has rotten human relationships to the core and everything has become disposable, including friendships. Hang on with dear life to those who really care about you and are willing to talk. More often than not it’s people who have struggled with mental illness themselves.

Edit: It is usually better to talk to a therapist (if you can afford therapy, that is) about issues that friends do not have the professional training to deal with. I don't recommend burdening other people with all your issues because that would just drive them away. People have enough shit in their own lives to deal with. However, it sucks if you want to talk with a 'friend' who clearly knows you're going through a tough time and they don't return your call. 

Edit 2: Looking back at my post I realise I sound a little angry and cynical, but I really wish for a culture where mentally ill people could get the nurturing and support they need. A big part of that is also having access to mental health professionals who are capable and helpful. If you can, please seek the help of a therapist. It has helped me realize where my boundaries with others lie and how I can strengthen my own self to ask of others what I need/deserve from them. It can be a long-drawn process and you might not always land a good therapist at the first attempt. But please persevere if you have the means.

Thanks to everyone for your comments. I’m trying to reply to each one but it’s hard to keep up, so I’m sorry if I miss yours. Remember—you’re worth the effort and the struggle, so please hang in there.

Edit 3: If you're in the US, UK, Canada or Aus, you can use this directory to find a therapist near you, read about them, what insurance they take etc: https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/therapists."
Do you ever just hate the person you've become?,"I feel like I'm not ME anymore.

Just a tired, easily irritated shell of who I used to be."
I took my first shower alone.,Normally my mother or aunt is helping me shower since I'm terrified of showering and usually am forced to bathe . I just don't feel like I'm worthy of bathing. But today I was home alone and I decided to shower today by myself . It felt scary but great. I usually am terrified I'll fall or drown or some weird crap. But today I did it alone..
Why don't you talk to us?,"My parents keep asking me this question.
Today I decided to talk. 

I told them about everything and I answered their questions.
After I had talked they told me: ""You don't have the right to feel like that because there are people who are worse off than you.""

I didn't respond.

 They said: ""Oh great now you are trying the silent treatment!""
Then they left saying:""You can be such a dick when we try to talk to you.""

This is why I don't talk to you.

Edit: Just read through the comments. Thanks guys. It really means something to me."

"Does anybody else fantasize about just...disappearing? Like taking off to a far away place, cutting off all ties that you have, and just starting new?","I know that's not a solution to depression, but it's something I think about a lot as well as other things that depression consists of. 

I just imagine myself taking off, somewhere far away, near a nice beach, and just simplifying my life. Not telling anyone where I've gone, not speaking to friends and family ever again. Just...disappearing. 

Edit: 

Some of you brought up the point that our problems are internal and not external. I know that, but that doesn't stop me and my mind from thinking of taking off. "
You don't know how much depression affects you until you have a good day,"Yesterday I played video games with my best friend all evening, and afterwards I laid in bed still sometimes laughing about the things we did earlier. I suddenly realized an odd, light, positive feeling in my chest. I'd forgotten how nice good days could be, and how giddy, bone-deep happiness felt. I hope this is a sign I'm getting better again!!"
I survived my suicide attempt..,"Yesterday I had lost all hope and just went ahead and hanged myself from the ceiling fan.. made sure to lock everything so I can't be saved. As soon as I moved the chair under my feet I thought my neck would break cuz it was a high but it didn't happen, had a really bad choking experience and let me tell you it hurts like a bitch. 
Half a min in I went unconscious due to the severe pain, woke up to me lying on the ground my mum and dad crying and me choking on some blood( I don't remember how long I did stay that way but apparently not long enough). Had a long talk with my parents and tbh I feel very relieved as if the past me did die, I'm motivated for once and want to make my folks proud! 
I think I'm a little elated I didn't go away. I'll work my way upwards from now! Thanks for reading it all the way through, I think sometimes there's a little hope just need to find it, I think I've found mine.

Edit:- I never expected all this overwhelming response, thank you everyone who showed support and commented with helpful advices and their kind words! I'm just a 17yo teen who didn't really know what to do so I went to this extreme step. I know sometimes things get overwhelming, I'm not really out of troubles and not even sure if I'll pass this grade but I have support from my family and I'll redo it if things come to it. Thank you for the overwhelming support from all of you! I have utmost respect for this community!"
"""The loneliest moment in someone's life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly."" -- F. Scott Fitzgerald","This quote has always stood out to me as one of the most eloquent and simplest depictions of depression I've ever encountered in literature. One of the few times I'm actually startled by my own reflection. Just thought I'd share.

I'd love to hear any poignant quotes or excerpts you guys may have too."
“you look depressed” thanks it’s the depression,
Does anyone else feel like they only staying alive for other people,I hate the saying suicide is selfish because no one ever congratulates you for staying alive for others despite how fucking exhausting it is to simply exist. I've been depressed for past several years but one thing I've always had is my family which I'm grateful for and also ashamed to be depressed because how fucking dare I not be happy with all I have. Anyway I've purposely hid this from them because I don't want them to think of me as anything but the class clown type who's always seemingly upbeat and has his life together. The fascade is exhausting. I've wanted to die for a while but simply cannot bear to put my folks through especially my younger brothers who wouldn't even understand. Maybe this is enough maybe this will push me through until I get better. 
Anyone else feel like depression has made you dumb?,"I feel like I don't think as much anymore, like depression killed all my brain cells. I'm just numb and floating and not interested in anything. I can't remember words very well. Sometimes it literally feels like my head is full of air. 

EDIT: wow I didn't think this would get so much response! I made this post while I was in the middle of a brain fog at work instead of actually doing something important!

"I need constant background noise (youtube, watching series) because I'm afraid of being alone with my own thoughts. Going to sleep is scary because I don't know how I'll feel in the morning.","Just hearing a voice from a youtube video or a series provides me with a little bit of comfort. It feels like I'm not entirely alone then. My friends can't really get through me and I'm constantly tired.

I want to sleep the entire time and I'm much more exhausted in general, but I'm also afraid. Will I feel better when I wake up or worse?"

I've told 2 college professors that I am suicidal in less than 3 days of each other and..,"I was quite shocked at their reactions. I sorta expected a very stigmatized reaction for some reason. The first professor blew up on me in immediate concern for my well-being. He too had actually been through similar circumstances when he was younger. And the second professor, he had a close friend who was suicidal and very depressed as well. He was very calm throughout the whole conversation actually. That was a really fucking cool thing to have a legit chat about mental health with college professors. 

Edit: I really can't express enough how reassuring all of your supportive comments are. I would like everyone to know that I actually just recently started therapy for the first time this semester. And it is doing wonders. Hopefully I get the courage to schedule with the on campus psychiatrist soon to see if medication can help. Also, thank you all for reminding me that people do care about others. Thank you greatly."

I hate it when people criticize me for not doing enough because of my depression. I am literally trying my hardest. This is my best right now. Stop comparing me to someone with perfect brain chemistry. I'm doing all I can. This is going to have to be enough for you because it's barely enough for me.,
do you stay in bed for the whole day because you have no motivation or energy to do anything productive and then you start feeling guilty because you're not doing anything productive,and then you try to get up to do something for once but as soon as you sit up on the bed you feel no energy whatsoever so you just lie back down and quietly wish for death lol

I drew a comic about my experience with depression.,"Hey all. A couple of years back I had some very long and intense bouts of depression that seemed to cripple me completely. A significant part of my experience was apathy; I knew somehow that I was in a lot of pain, but I couldn't feel anything most days. When I could, it was anger. I isolated myself from everyone and lost a lot of friends during that period.

I still have a very hard time with depression, although it's been more manageable nowadays. I transferred schools and got engaged to my favorite person in the world. I still feel like garbage a lot of the time but I have to stop thinking that I'm *actually* garbage. I'm trying.

Anyway, about a year ago I tried to illustrate some of my experience in a [comic](http://imgur.com/a/RF48C), and I just wanted to share it with you guys."
Does anyone else actually want to talk about your depression with a loved one but then convince yourself that you’re just an attention seeking piece of shit that doesn’t actually have depression at all?,"Even despite an official diagnosis, I constantly think, anytime I want to share my thoughts, that I’m just desperately seeking attention and being dramatic for the sake of getting attention and reassurance from my loved ones. It makes me feel guilty the moment I open my mouth to talk about how I’m feeling. Anyone else?

It makes it worse that every time I talk to my partner about it, she always twists it into some underlying meaning that I don’t want to be with her. And I get livid that she’s made it about her. Maybe I am just selfish and attention-seeking. "

I haven't been taking my medication lately, not sure why I just haven't, I know it helps and I know one reason I've been feeling bad is because I haven't been. I just need to make more of an effort to help myself and keep moving from the person I was back in February 2014."

Warning: Watch out for PMs pushing religion.,"**Update:  We are aware this person has been PM-ing everyone who's participated in this thread with claims that we are lying about their actions.  I hope it goes without saying that we're not.  One of the people who let us know what they're up to used the phrase ""persecution complex"" and the behaviour unfortunately does seem to be consistent with that.**

After warnings and explanations, they said they would cooperate then persisted in doing exactly what we told them was against the rules. After we resorted to banning the account, something we very rarely do here, they announced that they were going to escalate their rule-breaking behaviour.  The sort of person who claims to want to help, but ignores a community's rules while claiming to want to follow them is, in our regretful opinion, exactly the sort of person that our vulnerable OPs need to be protected from.  

If you received any PMs as follow-up to a comment you made on this post, please click ""report"" on all of them as this brings this person's behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.  Thanks.

We've had reports of PM-ing behaviour from a serial religious proselytiser whom we've had to take action against for persistently trying to ""save"" people in this sub.  Their favourite tactic appears to be encouraging people to join a church because it's a way to find a ""community"" - this is a notorious evangelical recruitment tactic.  Don't fall for it.

**Edit:  I should have worded that last sentence better.  We're not saying that all religion is ""notorious"" or anything.  We're saying that *this particular person* is being deceptive and manipulative, and misrepresenting themselves and their intentions in a way that's representative of the worst types of cultish ""religion"".

depression feels like dying before your body has died,"after depression there is no more need to live, its as if mental and physical death went out of sync"
My 12 year old sister attempted suicide.,"She was being badly bullied by people at her school for the past 6 months, and yesterday she did the unthinkable and took 40 paracetamols.

Going to try and get the first flight I can to be with them.
She sent me a picture of her laying in the hospital bed, and she has teddy bear plasters on her skin. She's just a child. It destroys me that somebody so young, can feel so done with life. I suffer with depression too, and have attempted suicide in the past so I know what she's going through. I'm sorry. I just needed to offload of all this, as it feels like my head's going to explode with all the emotions going through my brain right now."
It’s crazy to me that there are people out there who have never been depressed or thought about killing themselves,I guess I’ve just been living like this so long it’s hard to believe there are people out there who have never felt this way at all

Or shaving my legs and think “just cut, bleed out, it’s so easy” but I never actually act on these things. They’ve just become a part of my life. I feel like my depression is almost personified in a weird cloud that follows me around with bad intentions that I have to constantly argue with. It’s exhausting. "
My girlfriend died,"Hey Everybody.

I’m writing this to vent. 

About 5 years ago my girlfriend died. She died on the night of June 13, 2013 from a car accident. There was a drunk driver swaying back and forth in the road. She swerved to miss him and crashed into a tree in a ditch.

We met each other when we were 10 going on 11 years old back in 5th grade. Of course, for a while we were just close friends, but eventually it turned into more. We met each other randomly I would say. We just happened to be in the same class. From 5th to 7th grade, we hung out all the time (mainly during school). After 7th grade she moved a little ways away and started attending another school. We still hung out with each other every weekend though. I would say it was around this time we started actually dating each other. 

Fast forward to senior year of high school. At this point we had been dating for some time. Both of us applied to the same university so that we could go together after graduating. We wanted to go for film/ photography. We loved each other very much. We were honestly just right for each other. We rarely ever argued with each other or got annoyed with each other. 
We graduated from high school in May. Unfortunately, right after high school she had to move about a state away for family reasons, but then she was gonna be back soon for college. Senior year and after graduating we hung out quite a bit. When she left we would txt throughout the day and talk on the phone at night. 
On the night before June 13th we talked on the phone about random stuff for a good hour. She really hated living far away from me – especially right after graduating. On the 13th we didn’t txt each other all day because we were busy. Later in the day I waited until she was free so that we could talk on the phone. I txted her around 7 but she didn’t respond. I just assumed she was busy. A little after 8 I received a phone call from her mom. I was somewhat surprised she was calling me because although sometimes she would call it just seemed odd. I cannot forget or even describe the pain in her voice. It must’ve took her a few minutes to tell me what was even going on. Eventually she told me that my girlfriend had died. I remember initially freezing up, but I could feel tears running down my face. The pain, anxiety and guilt was massive. 

That night I could not sleep at all. The next night I slept maybe a few hours. My life took a sharp turn when she died. I was so much more lively and joyful – I just became dull and lifeless. I felt lifeless as well. This is kinda random, but I never grew my hair out growing up. It was always buzzed short, but when she died I kinda gave up and grew it out for 2 years. My life spiraled out of control for about two years. I became a nihilist. I lost joy in life.
I don’t wanna go down that rabbit hole though.

Fast forward to now. I’ve really came a long ways since then. I didn’t go to college right after high school. I couldn’t find the motivation to. After about two years I got myself together and attended college though. Right now in my life I’m almost about to graduate from college. Not in film/ photography, but I think she would be proud of me.

I wanted to write this because most people in my life have no idea that I lost someone so important. Losing her was like losing half of my being. 

Lately I’ve been thinking of her – wishing she was by my side as I graduate. I wish she was here.   
It feels good to write this though. 

For about three years I had no desire in pursuing another girlfriend, but lately I’ve felt the desire to do so. I hope someday I find someone I can love as much as I loved her.

Thanks for reading.

High functioning depression is so hard for people to understand,"People are only just starting to understand depression but it's usually depression that's making you stay in bed all the time or not eat... 


I always feel like people think I'm lazy or I even question whether I have depression, I exercise regularly, go to uni, eat well, cook a lot of fresh meals for myself, socialise and work... But I had to cut my hours because I had a breakdown. I find it hard to make it into uni, my attendance is awful. I'll flake on plans to socialise sometimes because of the lethargy and anxiety of leaving the house. I have days where I'm like a zombie, everything is boring to me and i have a hollow chest feeling all day, I feel heavy and I kind of feel like I'm trying to run through deep water.

But nobody really expects this from a depressed person, it seems like I get through life just fine because I do get through life but it's actually much harder than it seems.

Edit: didn't expect this to get the amount of attention it has. I'm reading every comment and I'm trying to reply to all of them. Thank you for responding, feels good to know this isn't as uncommon as I thought, hope other people find comfort in that too.

Edit 2: still reading every comment! Just wanted to share something that might be helpful. I downloaded an app called Moodnotes, cost about £3? You can log your mood each day (which is useful if you're trying to map your mood changes) and identify thinking traps etc. I'm not advertising or anything I don't even know if this is allowed but it has been massively helpful for me, it's nice to have a bit of balanced reflection each day."

"DAE say ""I'm sick"" instead of ""I'm depressed"" because you know you won't get taken seriously otherwise?","It's ironic that depression is an illness in the first place, yet seems to be the only one that can be cured by willpower alone.

"I never realized it, but I always used to try to make other people laugh and smile because I never wanted them to go through what I'm going through right now.","Funny how none of those people are making the same attempt for me.

Looking back on it, it's kind of funny. No one wants to be around a sad person, so you fake being happy to keep them in good spirits and not be alone. The charade works so well that no one would actually think you're suffering inside. A ridiculous catch-22, isn't it?

I was like a frowning clown with a smile painted on.

And now the years of caked on face paint has started to crack, revealing nothing but an empty expression underneath. Completely blank and hollow... It's as if my face has been wiped away. Withered to dust."
I fucking lost it in the middle of class,"I was sitting minding my own business, my sleeves rolled up a bit (enough for people to see my scars) and this girl just says ""you know that you need to cut deeper to die right?"" I fucking lost it and yelled ""WELL THANKS FOR THE ADVICE I'LL REMEMBER IT NEXT TIME I ATTEMPT SUICIDE!"" My meds started to kick in recently and I've been feeling better but this human garbage ruined my week and I am still furious. Honestly I would never wish this horrible feeling upon anyone but her. 
Edit: thank you all for the support, you have no idea how good all your meaningful comments made me feel. Stay strong if you suffer keep spreading positivity because that's what you all do best! 
Update: Thank you all again for everything you said, as many of you suggested I reported the girl and she got a month of detention, I guess it's the best school can do. 
She never apologized and after reading your responses, I honestly don't care. Stay strong everyone!"

My therapist committed suicide,"Last week my long time therapist committed suicide and I don’t know how to cope. I feel so alone. This wasn’t just some therapist off the street, he was highly educated, well respected, and worked with a few institutions. Selfishly, I feel hurt and abandoned. Everyone is telling me to find a new therapist but not only does that feel like “a close friend died, get a new friend” but so much trust was broken. I don’t want to open up to a new therapist. The thought that keeps running through my mind is “if someone who dedicated his life to mental health and had so many resources couldn’t get better, what hope do I have?” And also, selfishly, “how could he?”  I know mental health is a beast and I know from his brief mentioning that he was fighting demons, but it feels so unfair. Like my symbol of recovery has been destroyed. Thanks for listening. "

He then proceeded to go though my notebooks where he found some letters that were address to my family after I was dead but had never intended for anyone to read. I didn’t even want them to read them even if I had killed myself. He freaked out and showed them to my sister, who showed my dad. They then decided to search my entire room they went though every box and they took all the cloths out of my closet. They took everything out of my desk. Read though all of my notebooks. This happen last Wednesday and they didn’t tell me until Sunday. I saw my parents 3 Times between the time they found the notebooks and SH stuff. They said the his hospital told them to go though all of my stuff and they also told them not to tell me. I am really devastated that they read something so personal that I never wanted them to read.

Night is the worst. It's dark, silent, empty and I normally cry to sleep. It's easy to get out of bed if one of the kids are crying but if not it's hard.

I can't even read stories of death or suicide anymore it's too heartbreaking. I used to be able to read them but now I explode into tears and anger.   

The kids are 4 months, 1 year, and 1 year. All boys. 


There world view is that everything is great. They smile everyday. I'm on paid leave to recoup.


I'm so alone. If anyone at all could just talk to me please. Even to just say hi I just need someone to talk to. I no longer have anyone to talk to about my day. 

I'm sure no one will read this as it fades into the abyss of /r/depression but its worth a shot. 

EDIT: She is alive and at the hospital in stable condition."
Who failed at 'everything' raise your hand,"No, not the ""I recently lost my job, gf/bf, divorced, got cancer, I lost everything."" no, you're not the case.

It's not 'failure'. It's just losing something.

What I'm talking about is, never been able to hold onto constant job, maybe dated some but couldn't manage any relationship, invisible to friends, socially awkward, never was pretty, never achieved academic/career success, who never had anything much to lose in the first place,

Would you raise your hands? I wanna see how many are there besides me."
Depression has made me so stupid,"I can’t concentrate, I don’t focus, I miss the picture of concepts. Overall I’m just disengaged and demoralized. I live the same repetitive day over and over. Dropped out of school for the 4th time, can’t keep jobs, lose passion. I’m comically miserable. I don’t even feel like a real human anymore. I used to be articulate blah blah but nope. At this point I just drink a gallon of water and eat cereal that’s next to me until I have to move. No wonder my brain is rotting. Hell I can’t even get through reading paragraphs on Reddit. I generally don’t engage in anything bc it all feels like a chore in lots of regards. Same fights"
"“You’re Mexican, depression is a white-people thing, we don’t have time for that”","Yup... This is what one of my closest friends said to me when I opened up about my struggle with suicide and how the previous year I actually tried to kill myself after years of self-harm. I don’t think I have ever had someone invalidate my feelings so quickly. It just makes me laugh now when I hear some people’s ignorance and dismissive attitude when it comes to depression. Like damn lol. Anyway have you guys ever gotten a response like this? If so share it, I’m sure we could all use a chuckle or two. "
"Does anyone else just spend most of the day on YouTube,Reddit,twitter etc ?","I don’t have a life (haven’t in many many years,I’m only 25) I’m depressed and anixious all the time even when I’m watching YouTube vids. I just spend the day in zombie like state scrolling through Twitter or YouTube.

I’m just living through other people I’ve never meet. I’m just waiting for the latest news and drama. I think about suicide everyday. 

Can anyone relate ?"
A stranger hugged me yesterday,I was crying yesterday talking to my professors because I was having an awful day. And this stoner kid comes into the room because he didn’t realize we were having a conversation. He felt really bad and gave me a hug and left. He was definitely high but it made me feel slightly better.
It pisses me off that people think happiness is a choice,It just isn't. And not because I say it isn't. It just isn't. I try to turn my goddamn thoughts around to be positive every goddamn second of every goddamn day and it just does not do anything to make me feel better. Coping strategies just calm me down. Smiling is so damn fake and uncomfortable. I don't even know. 
Anyone tired of pretending you’re fine because not being fine makes others uncomfortable?,I’m talking specifically about my immediate family here really. I’m sick of this “what’s wrong with you?” accusation. If you really want to know what’s wrong ask me to talk about it. Ask me if I’m okay. Ask me if there is anything you can do. Don’t just make the statement that you think I’m not doing well and then think that you’ve done your part in helping me. I’m sick of pretending to be fine because my not being fine makes you uncomfortable. I’m tired of feeling so guilty all the time because I’m not fine and my not being fine is so inconvenient for everyone else. Christmas coming up is so scary to me because I know they all want me to just be perfectly fine so that Christmas is great for everyone else but it’s going to be so suffocating for me to pretend and I’m absolutely terrified of it. 
"I achieved one goal in 2016. I started brushing my teeth. For the first time in 25 years of life, I brushed my teeth everyday for an entire month straight.","I did it you guys. I'm so happy to have one small thing. I don't know how I'll reward myself since I have no money, but I'm definitely going go since this is an achievement and we need to reward ourselves when we do good. 

I  hope all of you who struggle with this know you aren't alone and aren't losers or horrible people or failures go being unable to donut on a daily basis. I know you're trying and I admire you for it. 

I love you all. Happy New Year! "
People are so keen to post on mental heath awareness day and on social media saying they want to help. But you can literally be crying in school/public and people will just stare at you and not do anything,And then when you kill yourself they say they couldn’t have done anything to stop it. And they say they’re here for anyone who wants to talk. That lasts about a week. 
My experience after surviving suicide..,"My therapist suggested maybe writing things down to help process emotions, and hell if it can help anyone else..


In June 2017 i took a walk to a park that would forever change my life, I had everything planned out perfectly, i was ready.

I tied the rope around a branch and the other end around my neck, i had wrapped my hoodie around my neck underneath the rope, i didn't want to feel the rope directly on my skin and for some reason having some cotton between my skin and the rope made me feel better.

After some hesitation, i eventually let myself drop, it wasn't a big drop, my neck certainly didn't break..but i felt a large amount of pressure in my head very suddenly, it didn't take long before what felt like a huge headrush take over and i began to lose conciousness.

Then, i woke up..on the floor with a dark figure stood over me, it was a security guard...i didn't even know the park had any sort of security.

He had cut me down and was checking if i was breathing, when he realised i was alive he didn't say much. I think i had shocked him way out of his comfort zone. I refused to let him call the police but i eventually allowed him to call the hospital, i was struggling to breath. My head was all over the place.

The man had saved my life but i was so caught up in the shock and chaos i never even thought to thank him.

I was in hospital for the night, they treated the wound on my neck, the cotton hoodie i had wedged between my neck and the rope hadn't done much to protect my skin. The hospital put me in suicide watch and the next day i was with a specialist doctor discussing what had happened and getting me access to the support i needed.

The police did turn up, but they only really enquired why i had not called them, calling the police on myself was never something i had ever really considered.

After about 30 hours or so I was taken home, i wasn't allowed to be alone so my ""Emergency contact"" my Ma, had to be with me. This was probably the most difficult conversation i have ever had in my life. Witnessing the expression on my mothers face as she learns that i had hung myself isnt something i will forget anytime soon, i had destroyed her, she was trying to compose herself but she broke down.

No amount of pain i had previously been subjected to was anything compared to what i felt witnessing that.

She had questions, i answered them without feeling the need to downplay or under exaggerate how i had felt for a large portion of my life, somehow in the recent events i had found the strength to talk to my mother about things i would just suppress before. We discussed my fathers abuse throughout my childhood and teenage years, something we had never talked about and i was not the only victim, but i did recieve the worst of the violence.

My most vivid memories from my childhood are me running down the stairs and hitting my father with pillows  to try and stop him hurting my mum, as i got older that violence was pushed onto me.

I don't know how much sense this post is making, but it really was my mum who brought me back from this.


It was at that point i decided i was no longer going to live the life i had chosen to end. 

I was going to live a better life, take big risk, drop everything and persue my dreams. I cut out all the toxic people from my life at that point, i don't miss them. I ditched my depressing job, I bought a Motorbike (cliche i know)

Motorbikes are pretty damn good for mental health, just saying.


I suppose my point is, you don't have to end your life to live a different one. 


[Edit] my mother eventually tracked the security guard down and thanked him, i wasn't able to face him at the time, hopefully in future."
"Slowly, I didn't realize I was already killing myself","First I killed the athlete. There wasn't much of him to begin with so it was easy. At the least he tried to give an effort to materialize during my college days. He even joined some after school group of friends to play with, that didn't really go anywhere.

Next I killed the gamer. He was easy to kill too because of the need, the corporate life taking much of my time didn't leave enough breathing room for him to keep up a fight. His antics still surface every now and then, making me wish for adventures and the blood pumping suspense or action of his previous endeavors. I just stuffed his mouth with career dreams, he didn't really struggle as he believed that to asphyxiate was actually reasonable.

Next I killed the party boy. This one, took a little bit more orchestration than the previous two. I had to kill his connections with his friends. I had to starve him of his former social saturation - and in a way that he won't easily recourse back. I made his friends believe he didn't need the contact, that he was happy. The party boy slowly lost his spirit, that's when I went for the jugular to end his pain.

Next I killed the musician. I almost didn't like killing him. He's the most recent one, and the most difficult one to get rid of. He has support your see. All the feelings and emotions closing through him everytime he hears, plays, or sings a song; gives him enough strength to push back. He's even made a solid group of friends that push and pull him to their graces, but an opening came in the guise of leaving the country - that tiny waver in his resolve let me sneak in a stab. It was easy enough from then on. 

I'm just afraid, that eventually, I might kill the writer too. And when I do, I don't really know what's left.

I'm actually surprised to realize that I've been hurting myself without physically doing so. I've lost more of myself in the past few months than I ever had in years. And I'm not making any more of me than what I already have.


PS. I wrote this to myself at a bad time about a year ago. And putting what I've been doing in words, has surprisingly help me curb and slowly regain ""myself"" throughout the past year. I still get spans of time where I feel like nothing, where I feel afraid of being nothing that I'd rather just lose my life. But remember all you've been through, things may not feel the best now but you are not worthless, you matter, there's a value to everything you've done and accomplished. So let's all hold on and hold tight :)


Edit: Thank you so much for giving my first gold kind stranger! And to everybody who's commenting I wish I had more time to reply to all of you, I'm surprised with the turnout and even more with how people feel the same and are/is going through ""losing"" parts of themselves. Let's all keep holding on to those and try our best not to lose more than we do. And for those who feel empty - it's never too late to find yourself, let's all fight for it, even if it starts with just getting up from your bed in the morning :)"
You ever wish you didn't have any family so you wouldn't feel so bad about wanting to kill yourself,I think about killing myself fairly often but I don't think I could ever do it because it would devastate my family sometimes though especially on bad days I wish that I was just alone and no one was around to care so I could just do it 
I’m out,"Hi guys,


I just wanted to let you all know I feel well enough to finally say goodbye to this sub. I have gotten a lot of support here, got some good advice and made a great friend. 

Whenever things go South again, I’ll know I have this safe space to return to.

Thank you all, and best of luck. You can do this. 

EDIT: I thought you guys might want to know what kind of things I tried and what worked. I took 3 different kinds of antidepressants, I'm now on Paroxetine and they seem to work. I've tried therapists and that's not my jam. I spent 3 days in a psych ward after my overdose and I hated it there (other patients loved it though). The thing that worked most for me was reading. I read Furiously Happy by Jenny Lawson 4 times, and that's the book that helped me most. Also: the Tao of Pooh (I'm not religious), and books about being introverted because it made me realize I'm not crazy. And sometimes, I would just lie on the couch and watch bad reality tv. I keep a bullet journal now, playing with colours and just writing down 1 or 2 things I have to do each day. Do the laundry (but not fold it) and cook dinner. Stuff like that. And talk. And if you think that you don't have anyone to talk to, we're here. And I'm here. PM me, I promise I'll reply."
Is it just me or does depression make basic hygiene & waking up SUPER difficult?,"Ever since the diagnosis, it’s hard to get out of bed, including showering, socialising, walking (I’m not going to even call it exercise), vacuuming, combing, etc. 

My Dad thinks that it’s laziness. He says getting out of bed & working out can lessen depression."
Anybody wish they were 8 years old again and could start their life over.,"I have made so many fucking mistakes in my life that I wish I could take back. My life is in shambles and I wish I could just magically start over. My laziness is the death of me and I constantly fight demons in my head. It would be much better to just cease to exist at this point. That seems very peaceful. Life is so complicated and we carry so many burdens and problems day in and day out that living is exhausting. 

I used to be optimistic and said things like it will get better and in 10-20 years I'll be a happy grown adult with many loving friends and family around me but every passing year is getting worse and worse. Everytime I think I hit rock bottom my life gets even worse and pointless. I won't get into specifics because there are too many to list but I am starting to feel like a pathetic failure. I always wanted to be the best and be someone who others could be inspired by but I just ended up becoming a no life bum. I wish I would just die while sleeping sometimes. Waking up and sleeping knowing i have to wake up again the next day are the worst feelings in the world. Just leaving my bed is a fucking challenge at this point. I wish I didn't feel this way but I do. I'll end this incoherent rant here and get it out of my system. Even if one person reads this I'll he happy that I got this out there and could share my depression and rage which I kept bottled inside of me for so long. Keep kicking y'all hopefully we can all be happy one day."
"Can't because I'm depressed, depressed because I can't.","Anyone else feel this? 

Can't work because of reasons raised by depression, depressed because I can't work.

Alone, no friends, no girls ever interested in me because of depression, depressed because I can't have those things.

Countless more"
Anyone have trouble planning for the future and being impulsive because you think you'll kill yourself eventually anyways?,
Sometimes I wish I could get killed so people wouldn't be mad that I killed myself. Has anyone else felt this way?,"Sorry if this is the wrong place. I don't think suicide watch is the proper place since I don't necessarily want to commit suicide. I just want to cease living.

I feel like no matter what I can't escape the demons I have. No matter how well I'm doing, my mind is always like ""the fuck? Get back in line."" No matter what, they'll always come back up and I'll be in my room alone at nearly 2 in the morning wishing for some disaster whose only fatality would be me.

Even then it doesn't even really matter if they're mad or not. I'd be dead.

**Edit to add: Thank you everyone for responding. You all truly helped calm me down. Now that I've gotten some sleep and kicked the shit out of some weights, I feel better.**

Depression prevents you from doing the things you know will make you feel better.,
"I wish it were socially acceptable to tell your friends ""Hey, my life is super toxic right now and slowly killing me, can we hang out sometime?""",
"Anyone else get up, get dressed, and then just sit and stare at the floor or wall for 30 minutes trying to figure out why you’re even bothering?",Then the fact that I wasted all that time makes me feel guilty and sad. 
Do you guys ever quit typing your comment mid-sentence because you feel like your words aren't useful?,"I want to help people on this subreddit with my experiences and pains but it's so hard for me to bring myself to hit post when all I feel is like my opinions and advice are useless,,
Edit: oh gosh ! I didn't expect to see so many responses on this. I really am truly sorry for everyone who feels like this. There are so many supportive people on this subreddit and reading what some of you guys wrote really made me feel wonderful. Thank you <3"

"I made it through my first 40 hour work week without calling in, leaving early or coming in late in almost a year.",I don’t know how but I did.
"Does anyone feel like they shouldn't be depressed because of how ""good"" their life is, and thinking about that makes you feel even worse?","I feel my depression gets worse when I think about how I live in a nice house, work a stable job, and am in great physical shape. Makes me feel like I have these things and shouldn't be depressed, but it ends up making me feel even worse. It's hard to explain"
My bed is my safe place,"I know this is the clearest sign of depression, but I love staying in my bed. Even when im not tired I feel tired. When I lie down and hide in the covers, I feel like I  can avoid the world and the anxieties that come with it. As a result I'm so unproductive as well and hate myself for it, and thats why Im in bed now.

**Does anyone feel me?**"
"Today, I had my first session with my psychologist.","It was tense, I talked him through some dark stuff. He showed empathy like no other and I immediately felt like I already knew him and vice versa. 

At the end of the session he asked for my ID for administrative purposes. When he saw my date of birth and realized it was my birthday, he cracked up and through his chuckles he demanded, ""who the hell sets up an appointment on his birthday?!"" Of course, I couldn't care less if it was my birthday - I tend to forget my own age. However, his laugh was so genuine and from such a good heart, that *at last*, I recognized the ridiculousness and joined his laughter. 

It was the first time I felt 100% comfortable with another person in the same room. I couldn't have asked for a better present.

Edit: I can't thank you all enough for the wishes and positivity. I've been an active /r/depression dweller for the past few months and I've never been let down. Recovery or not, this community will always have a special place in my heart.

Told girlfriend I'm suicidal and got kicked out,"Finally confided in my gf last night about my depression and she told her mom and everyone in my family and then she said I shouldn't live with her anymore. I got kicked out and she won't let me inside to get my things. We have a 6 month old daughter together.

I slept outside. It's 7 am now and I don't know what to do. I use her car to get around and now I don't have that. I also lost my job because she wouldn't let me go to work and I don't have friends or money for uber

She told me she did this to help me "
How do people just accept working 40+ hours a week for the rest of their lives?,"I know this is just how society works--we have to work in order to benefit from the work of others...the exchange of labor. It seems like most people have just accepted this as reality. They get their work done and then enjoy the rest of their time and the things they get to do with the money they've earned working. But I can't seem to do that.

The idea of spending more than half my waking hours 5 days a week doing something I don't want to do and find stressful for someone else makes me feel so incredibly hopeless. It's only Saturday, and I'm already dreading entering a whole new workweek. This feeling gets much worse on Sundays. And then during the week, I come home from work and know I have to go back in a matter of hours, and the thought makes me miserable and basically ruins the time I don't have to be working. 

I feel like I spend 5 of my 7 days a week just wishing they were over. That's depressing to me. 

Anyone else feel this way? "

Do you think depression has reduced your mental abilities and affected your decision making skills?,"I feel like I am not the person I once was. I've gotten slow at making simple decisions. And oftentimes just confirm and reconfirm it with people around me to make sure I don't mess up.

"Went for 2 AM walk in the rain, finally felt alive and free.","After 3/4 of a bottle of pinot grigio I decided to take my one woman pity party outside. I let the rain fall on my face. I let it soak my sweater. I walked down the middle of the street while the pavement shimmered in front of me. I stood by the water while black waves rolled towards my feet and the wind blew rain into my face. I held my arms out and let the wind blow across my body. I waked through the park. I got on a swing in the playground and let my legs take me as high as I could, like when I was a kid. I spun in the middle of the street while water got in my boots and soaked my socks. I fucking skipped down the middle of the street, in the rain, without a soul around.

And I know I will eventually fall asleep and tomorrow will crush me like every other day. But I really felt alive tonight for a little while you guys. 

Sorry for the theatrics, the pinot is still working its magic. Happy Tuesday.

Edit: Just wanted to say how moved I am by other people sharing their similar experience or saying that this post made them feel happy or comforted. As hard as it is to believe sometimes, we all deserve to feel that way. Today was as hard as any other day, but I know somewhere I have the capacity to feel better. We all do. "

Started planning a road trip as an alternative to killing myself,"I've always wanted to travel by myself but always been too scared (I'm 22F). Now that I'm on the verge of killing myself it's like why not. I don't care anymore. I'm not doing anything with my time (summer break) and I have money to burn (probably shouldn't burn through it but whatever, it wouldn't be used if I was dead). At least I will get to be away from this town and state with all these horrible memories. 

Edit: I'm traveling from Baton Rouge. I'll probably just go through Texas (namely Houston and San Antonio) for a week or 2. It's not the craziest trip but I think big enough for someone who's never traveled alone. Hopefully if it goes well I can maybe plan another trip somewhere else before school starts 

Edit 2: OMG so many comments and messages. I can't believe so many people care about me taking a little trip. I'm reading through all of them and I appreciate all the tips and offers. I will update y'all after I leave (might be like a week) and will upload pics and stuff afterwards. One thing this has made me realize is how lucky I am to have the ability right now to pack up and go wherever I want with very little consequence "
"Just because someone has it worse than you, doesn’t mean that your problems don’t matter","If something upsets you, bothers you, hurts you, makes you uncomfortable, then it matters. Just because so-and-so has problems that seem worse than yours, it doesn’t make your issues invalid. 

It kills me when someone opens up and talks about what going wrong in their life, and the person they’re talking to says *Well at least it isn’t any worse.* That makes me feel so little and like an annoying complainer because *obviously* my life isn’t actually *that bad*"
"Life in this society is such a catch 22. People are always saying ""reach out, if you ever need me"" but actually don't want to be near anyone depressed. They either deny it or downplay your depression if they find out. Or just outright see you completely differently.",So you put on a mask of happiness and no one ever finds out and you sink even deeper.
I don't often see anyone mention the addictive nature of depression.,"All the symptoms are negative; short temper, self destructive tendencies, constant muscle pain, sporadic tears. Yet there's something deep in the abyss that beacons. There's an urge to indulge in all the negative feelings that come along with the disease, to be engulfed in it."
You ever just get so fucking sick of yourself?,"I don't mean just general regret for your life choices. I mean seriously annoyed with every thought you have, or the state of your living place, or even banal things like the way your clothes fit, or how your hair is hanging that day.

I don't know. I guess I'm just frustrated enough to bury my head in a pillow and give up on the day again."
I don’t want to kill myself because of the grief for others. Instead I wish I could just disappear and have nobody remember me.,
I finally told my parents I was struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts.,"They didn't care at all. I got a 30 minute lecture on how my life isn't difficult at all and ""what is so hard about your life that you are depressed and what to kill yourself?"".

When I struggled with an eating disorder, they didn't want to take me to counseling because ""you know they just put the parents under a microscope"".

I'm officially done. I don't care about these people any more. I told them the most vulnerable, deepest secret of mine and I so badly just wanted a hug and genuine help and all I got was a ""tough love talk"" about ""how I don't deserve to be depressed"". 

You are a peice of shit parent if you have done this to your kid.

"I finally came out to my close friends that I have depression, and now I'm being alienated because I'm ""not mentally stable""","Probably a rant, but what the fuck.

This last college semester was horrible on me, and I came out of it with depression and depression meds. I'm 19M in college right now. I thought it was pretty obvious, but I wanted to tell my friends about why I've been talking less and have been hermitting myself out a little. So the next time we're all together, I tell them that I have depression and that's why I'm taking meds and that's why I've gotten so quiet, ect. And... Barely any response. Basically just some ""oh, ok..."" Like really? But it get's better.


So the night after I tell them, I get a message from one of my ""friends"", whom I was going to room with next year. The message said, and I can quote, that they ""don't feel safe around a mentally dark person"" in their house. Ok, what? Even better, the convo goes on and says that my group of friends were talking... And they don't want to, in quotes again, ""Associate with a mentally dark person"" as a friend. Like what the fuck? It's been a week and they've lived up to it. Suddenly I'm not getting invited anywhere or anything. If I'm with my friends (I still try to hang out), I'll get heavily ignored. Like what the fuck, my depression has now gotten so much worse.


I want to ditch every single one of them, but I honestly don't have any other close friends outside of this group. I'm trying my best to find new friends, and if that happens, I 'll happily leave these people who consider depression sufferers ""dark and unstable and unsafe"". Just needed to rant

Edit: Also thank you for all the hug PMs they really do help ;-;

Edit 2: Wow this blew up, in my point of view anyways. I'm going to talk to them, and cut out whoever is still toxic about it. I'm going to try hard to make new friends. **I WILL MAKE A PART 2 TO THIS IN MAYBE A WEEK OR TWO, JUST TO UPDATE WHAT IS HAPPENING BECAUSE A LOT OF PEOPLE SEEM TO HAVE GONE/ARE GOING THROUGH THIS AND I WANT TO HELP THEM IF I CAN WITH MY CURRENT STUGGLE**

Edit 3: REALLY THANK YOU FOR ALL THE HUG COMMENTS AND PMs ;-;"
Does anyone else feel like their life has been irreversibly destroyed by mental illness?,"I sure as fuck do.

I don't know what to do at this point. Suicide sounds like a very convenient option at the moment, but I just don't know how I would go through with it.

I mean, what's the point of living if you have to spend a substantial part of your life battling inner demons? It's exhausting and I feel mentally crippled.

This has been going on for about a decade with no signs of any quantifiable progress or improvement.

What the fuck is the point?"
What depression actually looks like.,"Playing a WoW vanilla server trying to remember fun from a decade passed.

Staying up till 5am even though you know you have to work at noon.

Scrolling through your Facebook timeline and wondering who these people are.

Earing garbage from vending machines instead of proper food.

Saying you'll quit smoking as you buy another pack.

Wondering why you still have these problems at 30.

Crushing loneliness despite not actively seeking a relationship.

Never calling what little friends you have and wondering why they don't call you."
"Does anyone else get the feeling that everyone around you is living a fuller, happier, more complex life full of promise?","Everyone around me seems to be doing better; like they’re happier, like they know something I don’t, or they’ve figured it out. I know everyone has their own problems, but everyone else overcomes theirs. I feel stuck; even when I make progress I feel slow, like I’m behind everyone. "
Anyone else casually want to die all the time?,I would probably never commit suicide although Ive thought of it a lot. but i get suicidal about the littlest things.  somebody ignored my text? wish i was dead because no one cares about me. say something awkward ? wish i could jump off a bridge. its like my brain rationalizes suicide as normal option to the smallest problems. 
I am really sorry for people who post here and nobody replies.,I think it feels like nobody in the world cares.
I've showered every day for 5 days.,"I know that this is probably pathetic, but my depression got very bad and I didn't shower for months, now I'm back on track, going to try and keep going in every day now.

Sorry if I bothered you."
"When I talk about myself, I feel selfish. When I ask others questions about themselves, I'm sad because they don't ask me questions back.",F*ck this... Not having a single true friend that genuinely cares really sucks...
I’m going to kill myself,"Maybe not today, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not in ten years, but I have a burning feeling inside of me that my life will end on my own terms, when I am ready, and I don’t know how I feel about it. "
"I hate that time is passing so fast, and I'm still the same depressed shit.","I seriously want a change in my life. In terms of my social life, love life, everything... It's been 3 years I'm trying to find a change and yet I'm still the same. For 3 years I am the same shitty person, and still counting...

I want this to end."
Anyone else feel like they're just trying to survive rather than live life?,"During a conversation with a friend I came to the realization that in my existence I don't feel like I'm trying to ""live life"". I I feel like I'm more trying to survive, just get through each day without collapsing mentally.  

Anyone else? 

Edit: thank you guys for the response. I'm sorry that people feel this way, but I take solace in the fact that I'm not alone."
i can’t believe there’s barely 1 month left in 2017...time flies when your life is falling apart,
"If the moods of normal people fall between ""happy"" and ""sad"", the moods of depressed people fall between ""distracted"" and ""miserable"".","Some days I'm pretty okay. Well, not really okay. It's just that there's enough time for me to anaesthetize myself on Netflix, video games, and other shit that doesn't do anything for me. It keeps my mind off of things. It keeps my mind off of trying to kill myself. It's pretty much exactly like taking painkillers. You know you're not okay, and you know the pain will come back no matter what, but what matters is that in that moment you're managing to not feel anything. And that in itself is a massive fucking success."
I am 58 M. Seems to be most subscribers are young.,"Just like the title says I am 58 M.
I visit r/depression every day and start by clicking NEW. 
While reading the Posts I am always looking for those in my age bracket. Which is few and far between. My depression has its roots in 2001 but it really took hold during the financial collapse starting in 2008. When I first visited my Therapist (about 6 weeks ago) I typed a one page summary of my life from 2001 to current. It wasn't pretty. Went from a financially secure, entrepreneur, business owner, great father, decent husband, community volunteer, coach, etc. to......
Lost house, broke, in debt, IRS issues, Depressed mother F-er.
The issues were caused by me putting my head in the sand and NOT being proactive. Before, I ALWAYS took the INITIATIVE and CREATED opportunity. Slowly but surely I lost that ability and piece by piece my world came crumbling down. 
So, my story is different than a young person facing depression as a sophomore in college, or a 16 year old afraid to tell their parents about their depression. I care about what they write because I have 2 children (30, 25). And I hope they never experience what we are going through.
BUT, I still read EVERY new post, because I hope to find the Answer to my condition. 
Ok, time to go and look at the Pile of important things to do, and decide if I am going to take the INITIATIVE or go into my typical Depressive State.
Have a good day. "
Why do non-depressed people think depression is about being sad all the time.,"I don't feel sad. I don't feel much, actually, if anything."
"Diagnosed with cancer, mom passed away, wife asking for a divorce. All within a few days.","To my surprise, 3 of of the worst things that a grown man can experience has happened to me within the lapse of a week.

First, diagnosed with stomach cancer, then 2 days later, receive a phone call to inform me that my mom has passed away. Immediately I take the first flight back home to attend the funeral and help. Next day, after the funeral, I phone my wife for emotional support but instead I get the divorce talk. Unbelievable.

All of these things were completely unexpected. Right now I'm busy taking care of my mom's affairs and making sure my dad and brother are ok, but I can tell the next few months will be hard and sad.

I've never been depressed. I exercise regularly, eat right, go out, etc. But I don't think I will be the same after all this.

Anyone else feel that their best days are passing in front of their eyes?,"I’m in my mid twenties and I feel all I do is sit around and mope. This is supposed to be the golden age of people’s lives? I’ve accepted that I am different than other people who know
How to live fully. But what if this is the period that it gets as good as it will ever be. It feels like I took this time by my hands and flushed it into the toilet. Like i am responsible for my sadness and there’s nothing I seem to be able to do about it

"Do you ever wonder if you are really just selfish, lazy and manipulative person who convinced youself that you're depressed to feel better about it?","I felt like this very often lately. It's terrifies me. I keep telling myself that this is all just in my head, but is it true? Or is it merely a comforting thoungt I am desperately clinging to?

(Sorry for my terrible english.)"
Anyone else get depressed simply over the fact that their own life is so boring and repetitive?,"This happens to me everytime I read a really good book/manga, watch a really good tv show/anime/movie, or listen to an amazing song/track. I get so engrossed in it that once it ends, I remember my shitty boring life that isn't going anywhere, and I just begin to cry, simply because of how benign and mundane my life is. I just want to escape my life to go to that distant place that I read about, watch or listen to.

I wish everything existed."
Anyone waste time doing nothing?,"I spent the last hour or two just switching between youtube, reddit and some other websites, spending no more than a couple of minutes on each. I couldn't barely finish a single video on youtube and I'd just keep refreshing the home screen for a bit, then checking reddit, then some other forums, then the game I'm afk in, then repeat again. It's too much effort for me to even finish a video from start to finish, let alone listening to music or even playing the game im afk in.

Anyone else just feel like doing nothing, feel like not wanting to live, when you are depressed?

  

Edit: Thank you for the reddit gold, even though its my first time getting it, I don't feel as appreciative as I should be considering the state that my mind is in, sorry"

Does 2018 seem like a blur to anyone else?,I woke up today realizing how little of the past year I actually remember. I can remember bits and pieces but otherwise its just a blur.
Does anyone else just sit around and do nothing a lot of the time?,"Lately I’ve been feeling so lonely and shitty that I’m not really interested in doing anything. I don’t want to be seen by people, so I dont leave my house. I spend a lot of time watching tv and if I’m not doing that I’m browsing around online aimlessly spending hours looking at nothing. I feel like I’m wasting my life but I don’t know how to change."
Has anyone else seen a significant drop in their IQ as a result of their mental illness?,"Ever since I've had anxiety and depression it feels like my intelligence has just slipped away. I used to be sharp, in many ways I was above average even. Nowadays, my grades are failing, I have a hard time keeping up with conversation, and new ideas are difficult. Today, I tried to read a book and the words just felt so meaningless to me, like I just couldn't get the full idea. What has happened to me? Is this common with the other people on this subreddit? "
"Depression feels more ""real"" - optimism feels like a delusion","Throughout the day I'll have moments, sometimes hours even, when things look up. I'll plan out ways to achieve all sorts of goals, get my life together, etc. - but all the while it just feels sort of...fake. Like I'm tricking myself. I'm always wondering, 'How long can I keep it up this time?'

When the time comes that I finally admit it's all pointless, that my life will be terrible no matter what I try to do, it always feels more like accepting reality than depression. 

This is always reasserting my belief that any sort of medication or therapy that actually had any sort of positive effect (none ever has) would just be a delusion. Like Cypher knowingly going back into the Matrix to be able to eat ""steak."" It just seems like a dishonest existence...and then I tell myself I'd rather be sad in the real world then happy living a delusion. 

I don't really know why I'm writing this here. I guess I'm just sick of talking to myself. This somehow seems a little better. That might be another delusion... "
being alive is so exhausting,
Do you ever secretly wish for bad things to happen in your life so you feel justified to be depressed?,"I keep on coming back to this in my mind but feel bad even thinking about it... does anyone else feel this way?

No one showed. I should have expected that.,"I've only ever had one friend in my life. I've tried to make more, but people hate me. I've gone to community events, parties, hobby shops...etc to meet people. People just don't seem to click with me. I'm seen as odd, annoying, weird to name a few things I've been called. The only person I can call a friend is my wife. And I still do not understand how that came along. She just gave me a chance and looked at my oddities a little different.

Earlier this year, my wife discovered I have never had a birthday party. I never really had any friends to have a party, so I just never tried to have one. She said that was an injustice and I should have a party and invite friends from facebook.

She decided to throw me a party a few weeks ago. We planned it out for a month. Made all the decorations by hand, hand cooked all the snacks and food, even made our own party games to play. Sent out invitations to people on my facebook, her friends. We even got RSVPs back. It all seemed like my first birthday party would be fun. I was hopeful coming up on the day. 

Then the day of the party happened. We rushed to get it all finished before the party start and we were excited. The party start time came and 30 minutes later, no one was here. No big problem. Everyone always comes to a party late. 2 hours later, still no one came. I started to eat my snacks by myself. 

We got various excuses throughout the night. ""I got sick"", ""Stuff has come up"", ""car isn't starting"", ""No babysitters"", ""My boss just called me in"". 

My wife went to bed early. She was upset and mad. I told her it's ok. I am strong outwardly for her. I don't want her to feel bad no one likes me. But I am being eaten up alive. I am now in my 30s and I can't ever said I've had a true friend (other than my wife of course. I'm thankful she gave me a chance.). 

I don't know what is wrong with me or why I seem to be broken. I never should have had this party because ever since then, I just can't get it out of my head. Everyone time I would say outloud to my wife or family, they would tell me, ""Don't say that. Plenty of people are your friends. You're just being negative."" Now my wife truly sees what I mean. 

If I would have just told my wife no to the party, she wouldn't have been upset, and I'd still be ignoring the problem of me being friendless.

Edit: Everyone, thank you for all of the birthday wishes. Trying to get through replies and messages. Didn't expect this many messages. Thank you all again.

Edit 2: I see a lot of messages telling me to be thankful for my wife. I am very thankful for her. She is the best thing that has ever happened in my life and I'm the best that ever happened in hers. We have been through everything together even homelessness. That being said, I feel as if she isn't enough socially for me. We are 2 different people and even though we share a lot of interests, we do not share all of them. Sometimes, it is nice to have other friends to share your other interests with too. Example: She hates the show *It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia*. She hates it to a point that if I watch it, it should be on my PC with headphones so she doesn't need to hear it. I do it because I can understand it frustrates her. But I love the jokes so much and I see random stuff in the world and laugh because it reminds me of IASIP, but I have no one to share it with except the subreddit."

I sold my guns.,"They originally belonged to my grandpa; I'm not a hunter but we used to go out target shooting and I was a pretty good marksman. When he died, he left me two of his old rifles. They've mostly sat locked in my closet ever since, worth a lot of money but unable to let go of them, partly out of sentimentality, but I'd come to realize that I also felt compelled to keep them around for more troubling reasons.

My depression has been lifelong and I've had varying degrees of success fighting it; recently things have been okay but I've had a nightmare of a time with intrusive thoughts. Impulses to do things I don't even want to do would pop in to my head at the worst times and I would fixate on the details of the aftermath until I would bring myself either to tears or to panic.

""What if I just went up there and did it? Would my wife be better off in the long run? Would the friends I haven't spoken to in years show up?""

This is shit I do not need running through my mind.

Two years ago I was feeling better. I was finally getting serious about art and photography again; I actually started selling prints and even had a little space in a local gallery for my work. Then the grey returned, and I started seeing less and less worth going out to see... Then the darkness came back and I became convinced that those things I used to see and enjoy were gone now and nothing good was on the horizon.

So, last week, I made a decision. Packed up the guns, all the ammo I had left, and drove to the sporting goods store.

I got $2200 cash for the pair of guns, and on the way home I stopped by Best Buy and bought myself a Fujifilm X-T3 for just around $2000.

Later that evening, the intrusive thoughts returned as I tried to think about dinner...

""What if I just went up there and--""

Then it cut off. The pressure was gone. Went up there and what? Grabbed the camera I've always wanted and started taking pictures?

I did. I cursed the cold, bundled up, grabbed my new gear, and lost myself in the woods, taking pictures of snowflakes and a family of deer that happened to wander though.

I've been shooting the camera for the last week and I can't put it down. I feel something; I'm really fucking good at this and I'm motivated to do it. My worst impulses have been stopped in their tracks and replaced by the desire to improve and surprise myself.

It's always going to be a struggle for me and I know that, but I feel free in a way that I never really expected.

Does anyone else’s depression make them feel dumb? Or...unable to focus on school work or semi difficult tasks?,"Information in class is difficult to obtain. As I’m usually having anxiety attacks and trying to talk myself down. If not that I’m just mindlessly taking notes. Not really focused on what my professor is saying. When I look at a question it makes my head hurt. Literally. I just want to put crumble the paper, shut my laptop screen, and lie down. As a matter of fact I don’t want to do anything but stay in my room. It has a full bathroom attached so my favorite thing to do is shower and watch Netflix. I do have a few friends so they randomly come in and out. But I have no desire to be sociable. I’m a shit friend. Now I’m rambling. Help

"I procrastinate because I'm depressed, and I'm depressed because I procrastinate",
"Anyone else find that, while you're super hard on yourself, you're almost too forgiving of others?","In my hardest moments of depression, the thought monster convinces me that I'm worthless but that other people still have worth. I also happen to be convinced that people are either lucky or unlucky and that there's really nothing we have any real control over. Because of this, I can even see the people who do the most atrocious things as forgivable. But with myself, nothing is good enough. Every decision I make seems to be not good enough, not worth enough to justify ongoing existence. 

Are there any things you do that work to remind yourself that thoughts do not necessarily equal truth?"
Casually suicidal?,"Is anyone else “casually suicidal”? Like, you’re perfectly okay with the idea of dying and it’s just an average lingering thought part of your daily thought process. It’s more like thinking of ways to kill yourself rather than actually acting on them."
"Does anybody sometimes hope they get sick, so they can die without having to use suicide and disappoint other people?","I just want disappear but I am to scared of the pain of suicide and the meaning which comes with it. Suiciding also affects all the people who know you. Why did he do that? Did I treat him wrong. My parents would probably blame themselves and maybe get suicidal. 

Getting sick in a way that I couldn't be healed and die would be like an escape from this world. "

Does anyone else live in their own head?,"I might sound like a total nutjob but hear me out. 

Most of the time I start daydreaming and fantasizing about actually having friends (as if) and an interesting life, like in a cartoon adventure or something. Sometimes I even make up scenarios in my head with real life people about things that could've happened. 

It's starting to become more and more frequent and I'm finding myself moving my lips to the conversations in my head. Then reality comes crashing down and it feels horrible when I realize my crazy fantasies will never happen. 

It's just so much better in my mind. Anyone else?"
"Why can't people understand I'm not just being lazy, I just feel unable to move","No I'm not staying in bed until 3pm because I think it's cool, funny or that I'm lazy. It's because I can't bring myself to get up.
I'm not wasting my life away on purpose or by choice. This isn't how I want things to be. "
Does anyone else always keep suicide as a plan B in case things get worse?,"I don't really have to be suicidal, I just feel sad and depressed. I'm not really scared of death anymore, nothing really matters, so why should I be scared? I couldn't care less tbh. I help my friends and comfort them all the time, but no matter what I say to them, I just can't transfer the words I tell  them to myself. Whenever something bad happens or something has the potential to go bad, I just tell myself ""Don't worry , you can always just kill yourself and no one will remember you and it"". And for some reason, those words comfort me, I wont be sad, instead ill just go ""cold"" for a few minutes, and I wont really feel anything, then it comes back.

Edit: I have no idea why and how this blew up, but I'm glad I'm not the only one and reading some comments here made me feel a lot better. I hope you guys are doing better than I am and thank you :)"
Today I witnessed the most horrifying moment of my depression till date [TLDR: a TV repair guy kinda literally woke me up after 5 years.],"The TV in my house is really old and constantly needs repair. Recently it went out again and after procrastinating for days I finally called the technician. He told me that the like last time, this time too the circuit board was out. He changed it and gave me the bill. I was like the circuit board had a 1 year warranty and it had only been 8-10 months. He looked at me for a few moments and then handed me the last time's receipt. It way dated May, 2013. 
At that time it struck me; I had no clue of the past 5 years of my life. I was on the bed surviving and still doing the same. I just can't stop crying since he left. The worst part is these 5 years were just the peak years. I have been depressed since the past 11 years and I can't stop thinking how much have I lost in life. "
Anyone else feel like they go through each day just waiting to go to bed?,"I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I feel like I wake up each day just to wait to go to sleep at night.  I'm almost 27 and I just quit my job that I was overqualified for a couple of months ago because my psychiatrist and I came to the conclusion that the nature of the job was not good for my PTSD or OCD.  Now I wake up everyday at around 3PM because I can't sleep at night until around 4AM no matter how much or what medications I can take.  I also feel tremendously guilty when I get down because I remember all the people in the world with disabilities who would do anything to be in my predicament because it pales in comparison.  I also feel like outside of my parents I have none to talk to, not even necessarily about my struggles but just about everyday stuff.  I have friends but they never seem to want to do anything.  Nothing is interesting to me either, so I am bored out of my mind despite having things such as video games, books, tv, and laptop at my disposal.  I just want something to live for, and for life not to be so lonely anymore.."
I've thought about killing myself for so long I've forgotten that's supposed to be a red flag.,"I'm too chickenshit to do it though. I'm too afraid of whatever potential afterlife awaits me, and I feel too guilty about how it would affect some of my family. 

I dunno...the idea of suicide used to scare the shit out of me, but it's become such a mundane, frequent thing that I've become numb and desensitized to it. I feel like it's no longer a threat since I would have done it by now if I'd really do it."
Tried to draw how I'm feeling,"Might not be good but whatever.

https://imgur.com/a/wMpWdF9"
You can never have an honest conversation about suicide,"When I was 18, someone at school had found a rough draft of my suicide note. I had planned on killing myself at the end of that week. The following events were an absolute  shit storm. 

My at the time girlfriend was devastated, my father was a wreck, my mother acted cold to me, and the whole school found out that their thoughts on “that crazy asshole” may have been justified. 

It’s been almost 3 years since then and I’ve seen therapists twice since. The part I hate the most about therapists is how you can’t have an honest conversation about suicide and wanting to die. When they ask “Do you have thoughts of suicide?” or “have you made plans of suicide?” I know I have to answer “No” because if I’m honest and say “Yes. This is my plan” then I’m going to get thrown back into the Psych ward for an indefinite amount of time for my “safety”

If I can’t be 100% honest with the person that’s supposed to help me, then how am I supposed to get any help. 

When I realized this I stopped seeing a therapist. Even after she promised me to keep coming in. 

At this point I feel like I have to fight this alone. "
"As of today, I'm no longer a depressed teenager!","...Now I'm just a depressed guy in his twenties.

This sucks."
This is how I tried to explain to my (gamer) friend how depression feels like:,"When one of my friends asked me to explain how it feels, I was at a loss for words at first, but then I remembered that we both like video games and tried it like this. Thought I'd share it, maybe people can relate to it.

EDIT: Thank you all so much. It means a lot to me that it means a lot to you.

""Okay, imagine you're playing an RPG and you've been going through the most hellish dungeon ever. You've been unprepared, underleveled and barely survived. Then at the end you find one of the most awesome pieces of loot ever. It's called the cape of depression. It's completely OP. Putting it on would give you immunity to nearly everything the game can throw at you. Sure, there are some negative stats on it too, but those seem managable. You put it on.

And it's as awesome as you thought it would be. Nothing can harm you. It doesn't deflect or defend you against attacks, they simply pass through you. Nothing can touch you anymore. Swords, arrows, fireballs, doesn't matter. It's all the same to you, because you simply dont feel it anymore. For some time you feel like a god. You glide through the masses and it's exhilerating. Nobody can touch you. You're completely free.

But the cape has disadvantages. It doesn't just let attacks pass through you, but also any blessings, healing spells and potions. Sure, it's a bit inconvenient at first, but you'll manage. After all nobody can hurt you anymore, so you dont need these kind of things anymore. Actually you dont even miss them anymore. Since you put on the cape everything has felt the same anyway and those signs of affection dont have any practical purpose to you anymore, so why bother? 

So you continue with your quest, wrapped in the cape. But somehow it doesn't feel the same anymore. Nobody can hurt you anymore, so you walk right through your enemies, not bothering to fight. Nobody can heal or comfort you anymore, so you walk right through your allies too, not bothering to talk. It's just you and the cape. 

It's starting to get boring so you think about trying it without the cape, but as you try to take it off, you look down at yourself and realize that you're still carrying the very same injuries you got in the dungeon in which you found the cape. They never healed, but you never got any more either. Then you remember how difficult and dangerous it was without the cape. It's easy to remember too, after all you have those injuries to prove your point. You need the cape, so you decide to leave it on.

At some point things just happen around you without you taking notice anymore. Nothing can affect you, neither good or bad, so why bother? You're truly like a god now, but not in the grand, majestic kind of way. You are simply not in touch - both literally and metaphorically - with the normal people around you anymore. Maybe you're mildly confused and irritated by them. Why do they act like they do? What's the point?

You dont want to feel left out, like a freak, so you pretend to still be in touch with them. The cape helps you. It grants you a +10 to Acting and Deceiving when talking about yourself. And you need that buff, because if someone would come to close to you, touch you, they would see that they pass right through you and realize something is very, very wrong. You dont want that, so you stay away from others, which in turn makes you even more distant.

By the time you've realized that the cape was cursed, it's already too late. It has become a part of you. It's wrapped around you, around your true self. You are still somewhere inside, but around your true self is that vast cloak of nothing that keeps any feeling, no matter if good or bad out. You've worn the cape for so long that you have forgotten how it feels... to feel.

When you go to your allies and ask for help they dont see what the cape has done to you. They only see the old wounds and think you must be in pain. They cast their healing spells on you, but they pass right through you. However all they see is that those old wounds just wont heal, so they get frustrated and give up. It's just you and the cape.""

EDIT 2: Oh, and I while this was not in my original explanation, I feel that this should definately be in.

""...though some of the worst days are those when the cape randomly shifts your alignment to neutral evil. Suddenly you can feel again, but the cape allows you only one single feeling: Anger. You're angry at the cape for having so much power over you, you're angry at yourself for letting it happen and you're angry at your enemies and allies alike. You start to remember every single time insult and injury, from the small goblin that threw rocks at you all the way up to the lich sending wave after wave of mindless undead after you. You remember every single time your tank failed to protect you, every single healing spell cast just a second too late. Suddenly you're the fickle god again, looking down on the masses with a smile of disdain on your face. For a moment you're glad. You feel. And then the next day it's over. The cape has worked its curse again, only to leave you ashamed and guilty for being cruel to your allies and vindictive towards your enemies. But fear not, the cape is still there, wrapping you in nothing that protects you from nothing."""
"I hate it when people say that people self harm or talk about killing themselves just to get attention. Of course they want attention, they need HELP.",How else are you supposed to get help if no one knows?
"I wish I could just press a button and never have existed. Everyone would forget me, and I'd just be gone.","I fantasize about this every day, but it's impossible. I want this more than anything else."
I spoke to my UPS guy.,"When I go to sign for packages I make a joke everyone he comes about my handwriting. I say 
""please don't judge my writing"" 
  and he usually says
 ""it's alright""  
until the other day he went on to say. 
""You love to sign huh?"" 
And he went on to explain why they require people to sign and how he doesn't mind my terrible scribble. He even smiled and told me to have a good day. This little interaction made my day. As soon as I closed the door I told myself I did good. I held a conversation. It's the little things guys. Stop beating yourself up and focus on the things you've done successfully. Have a great day/night."
"Every time I'm faced with some kind of challenge my first thought is ""I should just kill myself so I don't have to do this."" It's pathentic.",
I talked to a girl on campus today and asked if she wanted to hang out,"She had a boyfriend so she had to decline but that's alright, at least she was upfront about it. Just wanted to share this small victory I had today."
"So I have this virus ""depression.exe"" on my computer...","About a year ago I realized my computer was running slower than usual-of course this took me a few weeks to realize since the decrease in performance was gradual. Once I realized, I opened the process tab and find this program ""depression.exe"" running, hogging a lot of my CPU. I'm fairly sure it's a virus, but the weirdest thing is that I haven’t been downloading anything that would contain a virus… and as far as I can tell it doesn't even have a function! Its only purpose is to hog CPU and make it more difficult to perform basic functions.

So anyway I try closing it, but nothing happens. I try again until Windows gives me the typical “depression.exe is not responding”. Obviously I click “close now” and wait a bit, but still nothing happens. I keep clicking everywhere and mashing buttons to end the program (PSA this is an awful idea… trying to do too much will only overload your computer) but my desktop only freezes. Oh well I say, I’ll just restart the computer and hope that tomorrow I’ll have more success in getting rid of the virus.

The next week or so I keep mashing buttons and hitting “end now”, but again this only overloads my computer and forces me to shut down for the day. Meanwhile the virus has been getting greedier and is taking up more and more of my CPU. Programs run slower, and I experience more stutters and lags in processing. Eventually I gave up trying to end depression.exe by conventional means, and sought antivirus software.

The software was a bit of a pain to install at first and costed a chunk of change, and unfortunately did no good. Sure, it was able to detect the virus (it turns out that it’s not so uncommon), but was useless in actually removing it. I had the same experiences with other antivirus software: not powerful enough, didn’t detect the problem, misidentified the virus… the list goes on. I still try to run antivirus software once a week just in case, but most of the time it just uses up even *more* CPU.

Some other users try to help, but it’s obvious they never had this malware. “Have you tried turning it on and off again?” “Sometimes when my computer is overloaded, I just need to delete a lot of processes for a bit”, or “It’ll run quickly again, you’ll see”. They don’t understand just how terrible depression.exe is.

It’s difficult because I rely on this computer for school, work, you name it. When I first had the virus it wasn’t too difficult to still carry out my responsibilities, but since the virus has grown, it’s become *much* more difficult. Some days the computer won’t even boot up. I miss assignments and fall behind, all because of this awful virus. I see others whose computers run just fine and wonder what I did to get this virus, and how my computer is just so different compared to theirs when we have the same model. 

Some days, I just want to scrap my computer. Even though I can’t afford a new one.

Edit: Thanks so much for the positive response guys. I've enjoyed reading all your responses, and hope you get a hug for every bad day you've had :)"
Has your memory gotten worse with your depression?,"My memory is absolutely terrible now, to the point where I second guess myself about whether something really happened or not. I can still remember information as well as I normally did. But for the life of me I cannot clearly recall highly emotional interactions (normally negative). I can replay the situation once in the direct aftermath, but then I’ll keep questioning whether or not I imagined certain things. The only thing I can confidently say I remember is on a scale of 1-10 how shitty I felt during said situation. Little details slip away and I don’t trust my recollection of what actually happened. I always end up asking someone who was there if my recollection of the situation is correct and it almost always is, but I keep doubting my memory."
Does anyone else feel like they’re falling behind everyone else their age?,"I’m 23 years old. I’ve failed two years in a row of university, I’m back living with my parents, I’ve never had a job, I can’ drive, I’ve never had a partner, I’ve never fallen in love. I’ve never done so many things that people my age have done.

I know that really, that doesn’t matter, and that people will say I’ll get there in my own time. But I get so down thinking about how the people I went to school with are so ahead of me, and I’m just stuck here, not even living, just surviving . I hate myself so much and I feel completely hopeless about my life. 

Please let me know if you feel anything like this, your experiences, or even successes!

"Some people think depression/anxiety is just a way to get attention, but attention is the last thing I want. Just leave me alone and let me die.",
"Every time I try to speak about my depression, it sounds like a cliche. So I keep it to myself.","I have tried to write something in this group so many times but I always delete it (I've typed this exact sentence at least 4 times in the past, but haven't hit send)

So fuck it. 

I'm depressed. I'm dealing with it in my own way. 
I listen to music a lot. It takes me somewhere. I just wish some songs were longer. 
I take codeine to numb myself quite often. I get a prescription every now and then, as I have a condition which leaves me sore nearly all the time. Haha. Life's a cunt. 

I can't cry. I need to. I feel it nearly everyday. Being right on the brink of tears. But there's nothing there. 

I don't know how it's possible to feel so emotionally empty and numb but at the same time feel EVERYTHING. EVERY FUCKING THING. I can't breathe sometimes because of just how real it becomes. So many thoughts running through my head at once. Every little insignificant detail about the most pointless fucked up things. All at once. And yet if you were to look at me, you would see the most blank, dull empty stare. I'm nothing. And yet my mind tries to be everything haha. Such a broken piece of shit. 

I think about hurting myself and dying a lot. It used to scare me. I remember the first time I genuinely thought about killing myself. It scared me. And it kinda felt good that that's how I reacted. But that was ages ago. It's so common now, it's just part of what it is to be me.


Insignificant. 



***Hey, Thank you everyone for the response. ***
When I typed this out, I didn't expect it to get noticed and I almost didn't send it again haha. I just thought 'fuck it what have I got to lose'. But I'm glad I did, I cant believe how many of you are in exactly the same position as me. People who have commented or messaged me personally and said that I hit a personal note to them. It means a lot to me, I'm sorry if I don't get around to replying to everyone (you know how it is) but believe me that I appreciate this more than you know. 
In the future I will try to refrain from deleting my post instead of hitting send. Much love."
"I wake up, I eat, I sleep, I binge watch 16 hours worth of Netflix and then I go to bed.",Something has to change. I have to change. I refuse to be this person for the rest of my life. I refuse to let depression win. 
Anyone else feel like when they ask people for help that you are being a burden?,"This is definitely because of my anxiety, and I know that I really am not a burden to these people.

But does anyone feel the same?"
"Do you ever just look at people and think, ""Wow, Im a giant loser""",I just need to know im not alone. Im tired of seeing all these people better than me with more skills than I have because I wasted my life playing the video games and being on my phone. I mean right now while I cant concentrate in my calc class everyone else is taking notes and im just here on my phone because I cant understand the material and while everyone else has the capacity to study for hours on end for finals I cant focus for more than half an hour before I take a fifteen minute break. Tldr: dae feel like a loser and hate life
What depression isn't.,"Depression isn't an emotion. Depression has no cause. Too often is depression conflated with sadness or anxiety. I came out to my boss over my depression a while ago, and though he is one of the most kind and understanding people I know, he won't mention it. He sometimes asks me how my anxiety is doing.

Depression, when it is present, is more like the force of gravity. It is there, pulling down on you under all circumstances. Though I'm depressed I am often very happy- but still there is the unfeeling wet blanket of muddled confusion and writhing frustration seething under it all. Waiting.

A creeping numbness that insidiously degrades and diminishes every aspect of conscious life. A storm of screaming and hatred in dreams. A dull apathy in waking. A sinking stomach in the face of joy and a faithless lassitude in the face of hope. 

Depression isn't an emotion. Depression is a contradiction to every worthy aspect of life."
"I feel like i'm drifting through life, seeing how far I get before I kill myself.",
My friends remembered my birthday,"It made me happy, that is all :)"
My girlfriend died and I don't know how to go on...,"She had cancer and was 27.. We've been together for 9 years and were going to marry in a couple of years.. We had lived for 2 years by now and everything was going perfectly.. maybe too much.. We were faithful, devoted to each other. She was my oxygen, I was hers. She was my first and truly love. I've never been with any other girl but her.. 
I feel kinda depressed and alone.. We had no many friends, so that just the two of us was enough for the most part of our lives.. I'll leave for our house next week, since I've been with my family so far.. I'm joining my old job again, but this time, no one will wait for me at home, my salary will be just for me, and all that mattered now it doesn't..  I've got no reasons to keep on living. Somebody tells me I should be glad to still be in this life. But as I see it, it's a curse, a damnation. She doesn't suffer anymore, as I am every second of my life now.. 
Just wanted to open up to you..."
"Depression: The disease that makes you isolate yourself from your friends, and then helps you be extra miserable later when your friends do things without you.","Thanks, depression. I *knew* isolating myself and pushing everyone away was unhealthy and unhelpful, and yet I did it anyway because I felt I didn't have a choice. Now that I put myself in this position, even my small group of friends that ""understand what I'm dealing with"" or know what's going on have stopped inviting me to things entirely, and I know it's really not their fault, but it still hurts when I see the pictures or hear about it in passing. I know I can't expect people to still invite me to things when I always decline, especially now when the days that I feel up to being around other people are few and far between. The (anti)social aspect of depression is such a hard cycle to break out of. "
"Has anyone ever had a period of being okay, only to crash back down into the blackness without any discernable reason why?","I struggled for a fair while, probably years. The last two months or so I’ve felt great, however since yesterday I’ve just seemingly hit rock bottom again, can’t see any positivity in anything, can’t motivate myself to do basic things. I’m trying to tell myself it’s just a passing blip, however I’m low key worried I’m going back to the bad place, anyone have similar situations/experiences?

EDIT: I wrote this and fell asleep shortly afterwards, I’m blown away by the responses. I’m going to read through every comment and try and reply throughout my day at work."
Have you ever felt so sad that you actually feel a sharp sore pain in your heart?,I feel so stupid. And so worthless. I feel like I try so hard and my trying is either unwanted or unappreciated. I feel like I burden everyone I meet just by being around them. I worry about all the wrong things never any of the right ones. Sometimes I just want to up and go and escape all of the chaos. And other times I feel on top of the world. Today I’m at the very bottom. 
anyone else here have no real hobbies/goals/interests and justs waste time on reddit/youtube/etc ?,
"I don’t know if i’m still depressed. I don’t feel numb or sad, but i feel unmotivated, unfulfilled, blank and flat. I don’t want to end it all, but i don’t care if i live or die.","I can almost feel pain and numbness creeping into me sometimes, but it just goes away as soon as it came.  I honestly don’t even know what i want anymore."
Does anyone else feel that people only “tolerate” you?,"I hate thinking this way. I have a few friends, but I’ve never felt I was truly “in” the group.  We “hang out” together, but most of the conversations would be other people talking. Sometimes I wonder if they only take advantage of me because I would try my hardest not to lose them so I won’t be alone. 

Do they really enjoy being around me? Do they like me? I wonder...if I should find new people. But i don’t want to be alone.

Edit: waved hi to a friend. She completely ignored me. :/"
Does anyone else feel like depression has lowered their intelligence over the years?,"I feel like after years of being depressed I've become worse at everything I try to do, I used to be able to grasp new concepts quite quickly but now everything is such a struggle for me. When I'm studying I'l forget everything and even when I'm focused on reading I almost feel like I'm just staring at a blank page. 

No matter what I do I can't seem to control my life and the more that time passes the more I feel like I'm getting dumber,slower and less interesting."
Hospital bills after suicide attempt,"I attempted suicide about three years ago, and I'm still struggling to pay the hospital bills. Yesterday, I received a bill for a charge I didn't even know about.

It just doesn't make any sense. I wanted to be dead, but they forced me to stay alive, and now I have to pay them for it. Plus I have to pay for medications and therapy to keep me from getting to that point again. I feel like I'm literally just being kept alive for the purpose of paying bills. 

Why couldn't they let me just die?"
"Anyone else basically waste all their time on reddit, youtube video games, discord, youtube etc etc all day ?",
I feel like I’m not as important in other people’s lives as they are in mine,"I have very few friends, and even then I’m not really close to them. It’s VERY hard for me to make friends, and even harder to open up to them. I know they have plenty of other friends they’re much closer to and it wouldn’t really make much of a difference if I disappeared. Meanwhile, if they disappeared from my life, I would pretty much have no one. I just wish I really mattered to someone."
"I created my first reddit because my boyfriend was drowning in his depression, and I wanted desperately to help him. Since then, I've gained more insight and listened to all you beautiful people and because of you, I've learned how to better help him.","I'm not sure if this is right right place to post this, and I hope I don't upset anyone. (this is my second acct by the way, I wanted to create a new one yesterday for personal reasons) but the title pretty much says everything. I wanted to thank each one of you for being vulnerable with your feelings and helping one another, as you've helped me help the man I love. I hope nothing but the best for each of you and I hope this means something to someone. "
Has anybody else been mentally ill for so long now that sometimes you don't even realize how bad it is anymore?,
"This is horrible, but... Does anyone fantasize about ending up in the hospital, being bedridden for a while?","I picture myself finally being able to believe that my friends and family care about me after seeing their concerned faces upon visits. 

I picture myself finally having a shift in perspective which makes me grateful for the life that I have.

I picture myself finally being able to do what I want- to stay in bed all day with no responsibilities.

I picture my ex visiting me, and us finally able to work it out because my damaged health made us realize how short life is.."
Anyone else take days to recover from a insult?,"Every fucking time... first I ignore it and just brush it off then it pops back in my head and I'm stuck on it for days it eats away at me.. I manifest the insult and let it define me. The most common one is a insult to my intelligence, every time it happens I'm fucked up for a week."
Attempted suicide last night. Now I'm being guarded 24/7 by police officers.,"So last night I got desperate and attempted suicide in the most stupid way. I took a bunch of pills with a lot of vodka. I would have chosen something more effective if I had thought about it more and I'm so mad at myself right now. I had the chance to die and I ruined it by saying goodbye to my friends who then proceeded to call the paramedics on me. I refused to go with them so then I got fucking detained and handcuffs. Cos the best way to deal with suicidal people is to fucking treat them like criminals 👍
Currently being guarded around the clock by police officers. Luckily they've all been really nice but this fucking sucks. I wish I'd been less stupid and less of a pussy. Pills are not worth it man. Probably fucked my liver up for life. 

Oh and only one person has visited me. A friend. None of my family have so much as messaged me to see if I'm okay. I'm also being told people are fucking angry at me for worrying them so much. How fucking dare they! I'm going through some of the worst shit in my life and they only care about their own feelings. I fucking hate how suicidal people are treated in this world.

Sorry for the rant, maybe someone here can relate.


Update:
I'm so overwhelmed by how lovely you have all been. I knew this community was amazing already but I've never made an actual post before (I'm using a alt account so when I shitpost people can't see all my private life to this extent) 
You are all awesome humans and I wish you all the best with your battle with this terrible illness.

So update on me if anyone is reading, I was moved to a secure unit 2 hours away from my home city to be assessed. They've deemed me fit to leave (NHS is very underfunded, I repeatedly told them I'm probably gonna attempt again but they still cleared me) but none of my family or friends are able to take me in yet (I needed a 'safe space')
I met the most lovely psychiatrist who arranged for me to stay in a B&B for the night in the lovely city of Salisbury  (For Americans/not Brits this is near to Stonehenge)
He was beyond amazing. It's not usual for people to get a B&B but I was so distressed at the thought of staying on that ward another night he arranged it all. He even drove me here, gave me a massive hug and told me I was lovely. Don't think I'll ever forget his kindness. 

I'm doing okay, of course I still have near constant suicidal thoughts but I've resolved to give life another try at least for the next few days. 


Thank you all for your comments and love <3

Lots of love,

Anyone else feels like they would actually be someone if they were not held back by psychological problems?,"Like seriously mabye i would actually succed relatively in my studies, actually have a couple of friends i could hold on to, actually have something worth living for, if it was not for all the shit you get from staying inside and stacking up a shit ton of problems in your head.
At the same time i would be happy just having one good friend, living a mediocre life, aint nothing wrong with that it's just you keep hindering yourself with all the crap pentup in your head.
When i point this out i'm sure a lot of you guys/gals can sympathize with this difficulty when it comes to social interaction, it's so goddamn hard, unless i'm speaking to my family/a nice psychologist, i seriously can't keep the act together, i become this shell of a person not knowing what to do, and feel.
Not being able to feel like a real person and not knowing what kinda person you are yourself really hinders anything you do whether it's just in your head or whatever it's very real for us.
I think us in particular are the worlds most untapped resources, i hope everybody in the world will someday find a cure to this utter paralysing state, that is depression in combination with the extra package which comes for free (Yay free shit.)



Edit: It's always nice to know you are not alone, so for that i am grateful, but the fact that a lot of people feels similar/the same as me makes me really sad, it's a terrible state of being and i really wish the best for you guys out there, I really think someday this hurdle will become a walk in the park, and all of us will achieve that which we want :)."

"If someones willing to read this, itd make my night.","Coming from an already broken heart:
Okay, so. Yesterday was prom. I care about the girl i went with so much and were kind of talking too. she knows i deal with anxiety depression insomnia and some other shit. anyway. everyone got up at prom and started dancing. this freaked me the fuck out dor whatever reason. i really really felt like i was going to break down so i went outside and walked around. turns out i didnt have the willpower to go back inside with everyone dancing and shit. i was out there for 3 hours by myself, and the occasional teacher coming out to check on me which made me feel even worse. eventually i went back in just because i felt so fucking bad for not dancing with her and i just hung out with her on the dance floor. eventually prom ended, she was happy , and i wasnt. We went to afterprom and were sitting down together on a bench. i end up getting so tired im literally falling asleep. she reaches over and puts her arm around my waist and kissed by head and like rubbed me in an affectionate way. i looked at her and i hugged her so hard because thats literally one of the nicest things anyone has ever done me and one of the happiest moments of my life. prom is over now and i havent heard from her since and its making me super sad, and i know i only have 2 more months with her bc of college... i really dont know why this makes me so upset but it seriously does

Edit: Holy fuck this blew up. For anyone asking, i did text her yesterday. She didnt open my text and still hasnt this morning. Kind of confused.

Update: She is super busy and i will hear back from her tonight."

Depression is like being in an abusive relationship with your own brain.,
"If you get a PM from someone claiming that religion with cure your depression, please click ""report"" and then ignore it!","It appears that someone is indiscriminately messaging people and trying to ""save"" them after they've posted here.  Unfortunately, none of the measures available to us as subreddit moderators has any effect on the ability to send PMs, but if you click ""report"" it will bring this behaviour to the attention of the reddit admins.

We'd like to take this opportunity to remind you that we think it's a very bad idea to trust anyone who tries to take ""supportive"" conversations to PM right away.  The only reasons we can think of why someone would do this are:

 * They know that whatever they're offering is against the rules, or in some other way won't stand up to scrutiny by the community.

 * They have a non-supportive and possibly sinister agenda, and they're preying on your because they think they can fool you when you're vulnerable.

If you're here to help, please respond and establish a rapport *in the sub* where the whole community can contribute to the discussion.  We all get more out of it that way.  

**Edit:**  The above comments apply *only* to people offering/giving help and support.  We completely understand that there may be excellent reasons why a person *requesting* help may only want to discuss their issues privately.  In those situations, having helpers' comment history available can still be very helpful in identifying people to approach.

This time I want to share some points about helping OPs who may be at risk for suicide.  

* Although we understand that depression and suicidality are distinct issues and we encourage people whose main issue is suicidal thoughts and feelings to post at /r/SuicideWatch, we don't feel that *any* kind of ""you should post there, not here"" message could conceivably be helpful to a person in great distress.  However, the information in [the SW sidebar](/r/SuicideWatch/about/sidebar) may be of help to anyone trying to support someone struggling with thoughts of suicide.  We link the two most important posts for helpers, the talking tips and risk assessment guide, from the sidebar here, but there's a lot more there.  

* Almost nobody posts about their suicidal thoughts on reddit because they don't know that hotlines exist.  Just providing a hotline number without finding out how the person might feel about that option can make the person feel invalidated.  Also, if it does make sense to suggest a hotline in a particular case, don't just assume a person's in the US. Imagine the how it would feel for a US redditor to be told ""just call 116 123, that'll work everywhere"" meaning everywhere in the European Union. There's a global directory in the /r/SuicideWatch sidebar, which is also linked here, and that's the best link to offer someone whose location you don't know.  

* Remember that anonymity is a safety device in suicide intervention that saves far more lives than it costs.  The situations where breaching someone's confidentiality is the best option are the outliers, like when someone is strangled by a safety harness. Plus, we almost never have enough risk assessment information to justify outing someone (which has to go through reddit's admins and their legal team) and subjecting them to a traumatic, invasive, involuntary intervention, which may discourage them from opening up about their feelings in future.  

* If you do feel that a post needs attention from the mod team for any reason, including high risk of harm, please take a few extra seconds to send us a modmail rather than clicking ""report"".  The linkage between reports and spam is hardcoded into reddit's DNA, so clicking ""report"" on a post increases the risk that the post will be snagged by the sitewide filter, which we have no control over.  

* Keep in mind that the most reliable way to de-escalate someone is to give them the experience of feeling understood.  A strong interpersonal connection is usually enough to reduce immediate risk of suicide. That's one of the many reasons why [this little empathy video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Evwgu369Jw) is always linked from our sidebar. "
"Does anyone else want to die without committing suicide""","For quite a while now I've been pretty bummed out, and whenever I am just crossing the road or on the top of a building I just envy that somehow my death could be accidental. Or just wish that someone would kill me for no reason, I wouldn't say that I'm suicidal but I just don't want to be here anymore and it would be easier on my family if they thought it was an accident. Does anyone else feel this way?"
Today I realized I'm a panda.,"Proof:

* The majority of food I eat daily is greens (mostly just spinach and kale)

* I have low-no sex drive (due to antidepressants)

I feel like I'm becoming dumber everyday.,"I literally cannot focus on anything. I can't pay attention in class. I can't study. I can't read a book. I can't even pay attention to video games. I can't watch a 10 min YouTube video. I'm constantly zoning out. I'm just mindlessly going through life without really enjoying anything.

Edit : Thanks for all your replies. I didn't know so many of you were feeling the same way as me. Glad to know I'm not alone. Gives me a bit of hope."

I believe this little comic I found sums it all up...,
Anyone depressed in spite of good life circumstances?,"A lot of people here are depressed for very good reasons. I really don't have any. I'm pretty happy with my life set up (of course there are some things I'd change but on the whole it's good).

I just have this endogenous, chemical depression that's as bad as being in physical pain. I've been on so many meds in the past and they don't seem to work for me anymore. I run distance every single day and eat well.

Not asking for advice as such, just interested to hear if any of you guys are depressed even though your lives are good on paper. "
My mother died unexpectedly about 3 hours ago. The pain is paralyzing.,"I was at my friends bday party at a bar when my father called me and told me that my mother laid to down to take a nap but never woke up. He was in bad shape when I got there so I decided to spend the night. I’m laying here hoping it’s just a nightmare but it’s really happening. She was my best friend and I don’t know how I’m going to go on.

Who else desperately craves stable employment but has crushing anxiety and absolutely no idea what they want to pursue?,I have had this realization lately and it is very crap :(
"I desperately want someone to reach out to me, but when they do, I fucking hate it.","Anybody else do this? If so, why? And what the fuck?

You find yourself leading a life of self-imposed isolation, full of all kinds of self-hate, wishing desperately for some kind of validation, help, or support of some kind, wishing your friends (or really anyone) would actually reach out and give a shit...

...and then when someone does, and offers help or support of any kind, you get EXTREMELY uncomfortable with the human contact, and all the emotional aspects that come with it, to the point of getting really pissed off and hating that they even tried to feed you some obvious bullshit lie about you, “mattering,” or, “being worth something,” and wish people would just go away and leave you the fuck alone, thereby continuing the cycle of wanting someone to reach out but hating when they do? 

Seriously, what the fuck? I’ve noticed this pattern in myself and I can’t understand why. 

It feels like a combination of not deserving it and flat-out not knowing or even being able to begin to comprehend how to deal with actual genuine human emotion like that. It just freaks me out and makes me want to push away even harder, which logically I know makes it worse, but I can’t seem to break the cycle.

Anybody else ever felt or dealt with something like this? Because I’m at a loss here."

Does anyone else welcome the idea of an accidental death?,"I've recently come to terms with my depression. Ive contemplated suicide, but i don't think I will ever do it. But every day, when I'm driving to school, I have this wish that someone would just blind side and kill me. I think that's just an excuse for my selfish desire to die. I think it would be better for my family. The memory of having a smart and happy child would be preserved. I would go without anyone knowing about my mental health issues. They would just say it was an unfortunate accident. Does anyone else think like this?"
Do you ever feel like you're just not cut out for this world?,"Inb4 comments like ""you're just acting helpless"" or ""what makes you different from everyone else?"" I'm not trying to act helpless or like I'm different. I just feel like I'm too weak. There a lot of things that upset me that... shouldn't. Like I'm terrified of confrontation, to the point where I start shaking. And I can't have arguments. Everything makes me exhausted, after 10 minutes of badminton I couldn't breathe, even getting excited or nervous gives me a headache. It's like I have no energy, I get so tired when doing schoolwork. And I'm very sensitive to what kind of advice I get, stuff like ""tough love"" gets me close to hyperventilating and I'll be upset for the rest of the day. I just don't know what to do, and I admit it, sometimes I just want to quit. I guess I just have to try harder, but often I feel like I'm too weak and sensitive and I won't make it in the world, and that things would be better if I stopped existing. "
My mother died today,I hope that I see you again one day.
Does anybody else's mind immediately go to death as a solution?,"Every time a new problem comes up, no matter how big or small, I sometimes can't help but think, ""this is such a pain. I'd rather be dead.""

For example, here recently I caused a minor car accident, and afterwards all I could think was 'How can I kill myself?' because of the guilt and all my other faults. It almost scared me at how viable it seems as a solution. No more suffering, no more being useless, no more stupid mistakes..."

I'm currently not studying, and I'm looking for a job. I went to a job/recruitment agency this morning, and they asked me a bunch of stuff that I was unable to give a proper answer to.

> ""So what's your dream job? :)""

\*shrug\* er... I don't have one.

> ""Well, if you had to pick a job what would it be?""

I really don't know... I guess one where I don't have to talk to people.

> ""It says here you were recently studying. Can I ask what exactly you studied?""

I just graduated in Social Sciences.

> ""Oh, that's great! We can help you get a job related to that. :)""

Er... I don't really have any interest in the field.

> ""Then if I may ask... why did you study Social Sciences?""

\*shrug\* Old-fashioned parents expected me to go to university after school.

> ""Okay, moving on... what are your long-term or short-term goals?""

Er... I don't have any...

---

I just started tearing up half-way into answering the questions, thinking ""something's seriously wrong with me"" that I don't have any goals or dreams. I've never been ambitious my whole life. Even as a kid, when you're supposedly full of wonder and imagination, I never really had a ""I wanna be a rockstar/princess/astronaut!"" moment.

It was always just ""I have to go to school cos I have to"", ""I have to study hard cos I have to"", ""I have to get good grades cos I have to"". And now that I'm out in the world, I still haven't figured out what the fuck's the point of anything."
"I get a horrible comedown after fun days of socializing. After good times with friends, I get home and feel exceptionally lonely and empty.","Maybe being an introvert it is just a draining affect? I dunno. It stinks when depression smacks you in the face after a while of feeling ok or even ""good""."
I feel I am at the middle point where I don't 'deserve' being labeled depressed and I am not happy enough to be labeled healthy,"Don't misunderstand this title, please. I am by no means saying depression is any kind of privilege - suggesting you can use 'the depression card' or whatnot. My point is that I feel my problems are irrelevant because I know there are a lot of people out there who suffer worse than me. I feel I am not in a position to complain. Yet, I don't feel content. I feel more apathy than much else and I don't know if that is depression and I am too stubborn to seek help for a diagnosis. Some part of me believes I can solve this on my own, but another part asks, ""and how long will that take, considering your less than stellar situation, will and mindset?""

Oh, and then there's the part which definitely thinks I shouldn't waste my time writing this, which in turn may waste your time by reading this. I am just confused and a little tired. I seek no sympathy from you guys, but maybe someone can relate. I wish you all a good day."

Does anyone have literally 0 friends or people to talk to?,"Yes, literally 0. I kno we like to say we are lonely here, but actually most people here actually have someone to talk to, even if it's online. 

That being said I just havr to say that I am trying to deal with it and as embarrassing as it may sound I often talk to myself aloud just to hear someone speak (even if I hate my voice and I find it grating). I am mostly okay with it...I think. Sometimes it gets really bad, but I try to occupy my mind with video games anf music so I don't think about killing myself.

Edit: I want to thank everyone for replying to this, I had no idea it would blow up so much. I was very in my feelings when I made this post and on the verge of actually killing myself. I went to sleep and now I am feeling a little better.

"i fucking hate when that ""wtf am i doing with my life"" wave hits, and hopelessness that follows","sometimes it hits me at 2:49 in the morning when i catch myself in the mirror on the way from kitchen to my room, sometimes in 4pm when i realize how fucking alone i am and wasting the summer doing nothing

i hate myself when i see my parents with that disappointed look on their faces while talking to me, it's like i feel bad for myself thru them lol but then i remember that i basically have no more friends left, idk if having a childhood friend that is also a junkie who i smoke weed with twice a month when he has no one else to call counts as friend, no job except working a part time job once a year, i worked a 2nd one in construction until just recently, but was fired after 10 days because i was ""not needed anymore"", no girlfriend, that makes my mom so sad sometimes because she wants grandchildren so badly

where i'm from if you're in your 20s and still living with your parents and you're not having a decent explanation for it you are instantly a failure and ppl look at you weird because roughly 90% of ppl i know are either in college, or having a job and a decent social life or all 3 at once, i have NONE

for the last 3 years of being a depressed shut-in i didn't grow as a person at all i still have the same ambitions, when i ran into an old friend couple weeks ago he told me how the fuck am i still stuck in being a teenager, because i always tell the same jokes, do the same inappropriate things, talk the same...

my god it absolutely fucking hurts seeing my old friends being so normal, so happy, taking pic after pic from vacation, having beautiful girls, some getting married even, having decent jobs, a place of their own while i spend 80% of my time on reddit, youtube, facebook, watch tv shows, listen to music and play games sometimes

i can't see my life getting better because i've already tried some things and it didn't help, and good luck for me having a girlfriend because who the fuck wants a guy who is 22 and still living with his parents and basically never goes out, plus i gained like 20 pounds in the last 2 months, so not only i'm socially anxious and depressed as hell now i'm also chubby on top of all that, the only thing i do outside of the house is drive around with my bike every other day, visiting places i spent happiest and the most careless days of my life with my friends, i visit places where we'd get drunk and go to night clubs during 2011- 2013, then go out of town to see the beautiful landscape that makes me feel alive and then back to home

i had a decent life back in high school, it's like i peaked and my lfie is only going down the spiral, i never thought life could become this hopeless and hard"
I think one of my main fears is that I'm not depressed...just lazy,
Someone told me I look like I'm on power saving mode.,And that's exactly how I feel.
"I was depressed as a teenager, worked hard and got my own place and all the things I thought would make me feel better, and now I'm more depressed than ever in my mid 20s.","I can't maintain friendships. I can't connect with people. I push people away when I need them the most.

It is so hard to describe the feeling and experience. I look forward to my free time, I plan and structure my life so I have it. But when I reach that point it is like I've gotten dumped off, with a clear schedule and the world at my fingertips.

I should be enjoying life more than ever, but I don't have a social structure to lean on. I've grown apart from my friends and family. I make plans for my days off with people, but when they come I cancel them.

I just lay in bed and stare at the sky through the windows. The only thing that gets me up is caffeine headaches. I probably spent a whole hour today smacking the pull string on the ceiling fan in my bedroom and watched it for 5 minutes until it would stop moving completely and then I would smack it again. It was a boring, tortuous, and arduous experience but I wouldn't stop."

My parents are coming down tomorrow to pack my things up and bring me home, they’re going to get me the help I need, going to keep me under their supervision. I feel guilty as hell for wasting so much money and time for college when I knew I could never handle it with the way things are. My heart feels like it’s in my throat, my head feels like it’s stuffed with cotton. 

I’m going to have to quit my job and find a new one once I get home. At least I’ll try to find something to keep me sociable and busy during the day. "

My wife committed suicide yesterday,"My wife was struggling with depression for about 6 months. She attempted overdosing in December, but I found out and called an ambulance. Yesterday she jumped off the roof of our apartment building while I was out. I don't know why I'm writing this. It might be to prevent others from doing this, but I think it is a more selfish desire to just say it  

I found out yesterday that she stopped taking her medication for about 7-10 days because the side effects were unbearable. I don't mean to diminish this, but I believe it was mostly in her head. She operated normally as far as I could tell, but was fixated on this idea. I noticed she got worse recently but I believed it was because she was putting  pressure on herself to get back to work. I guess I was wrong.  

She thought I would be better off without her. That the pain I was going through watching her was too much for me. I truly believe that when she jumped she was partially doing it to free me. I wish I could tell her how wrong she was. 

Now I feel trapped. I don't see a light at the end of the tunnel for myself but I also don't see suicide as an option. How can I put my loved ones through what I'm now going through? I can only hope that the saying time heals all wounds is correct. 


Edit: thank you all for your support. I promise that, despite the timing of this, it is not an April's fool joke. I really wish it was. 

Edit 2: thank you again for all the support. I'm going to see someone today and Friday. The funeral is tomorrow. It's going to be a rough few days. "
I think so too.,
Just saying “I have depression” feels like I’m minimizing what I’m actually experiencing,"I really hate it when I try to explain to people what’s wrong and I don’t want to go into the nitty gritty due to a whole slew of reasons but saying “sorry, it’s my depression” just doesn’t seem to convey the weight and magnitude this illness has. I need a new name or word for it. "
I miss so very many people...,
I don’t want to have kids because I don’t want them to experience depression,"I’m only 16, but I’ve already made up my mind: I’m never going to have kids. I can’t stomach the thought of passing my depression down to them, or them having to grow up with a parent struggling with depression. It just wouldn’t be fair to them."
Anyone else's 'okay' days still pretty fucking awful?,"My okay days used to be decent, I wasn't particularly motivated or anything but I didn't feel like shit. Now my okay days are just days where I don't actively want to die but I still have suicidal thoughts and can't stop thinking about depressing shit unless I'm fully distracted which is really hard to achieve.

Edit: Thanks for all the words of support, it's really helped and I feel much better now I know it's not just me feeling this way, really appreciate it guys."
"Anyone else fantasize about leaving everything, running away, and starting over somewhere?","This has been a recurring fantasy of mine for years. I'm thinking, well, things can't get much worse, so instead of killing myself how about just leaving everything. Maybe go to a different country and starting over. I've been binge watching ""Disappeared"" a lot and can really relate to many of the people who vanished all of a sudden."
Anyone feel like you’ve gotten so good at hiding how depressed you feel that you start to believe you’re happy but then once you’re all alone it all comes back?,"This is daily. None of my friends suspect anything at all because I’m the “happy strong” one of the group. But as soon as we all go home, I can’t help but feel like I’m worthless and everyone would be better off without me. "
I’m so uncomfortable when people ask “What have you been up to” every time I see them.,"It’s hard fumbling about trying to think of something interesting when all I do is go on YouTube, play video games and go to class.

Girlfriend attempted suicide. I'm a wreck.,"I posted this on /r/suicidewatch before I realized this sub existed.

We have been dating for 7 months. I don't believe in love at first sight, but we fell in love pretty fast. We are great together. I can't imagine my life without her.

We both struggle with depression. I was suicidal a few years back, so I can understand what she is going through. I have been medicated for the past year and pretty ok; I convinced her to seek help, so she has been medicated for the past 4 months or so. Anyway....

I had just arrived at work. Only been there about 20 minutes, when I receive a phone call from her. We both hate talking on the phone, so when she calls it's usually because she can't text, so I answered and she was babbling; slurring; crying; the only thing I could understand was, ""I did it. I'm sorry.""

I bolted out of the office. She lives about 20 minutes away and by the time I got there she was in her bed laying there. I thought she was dead. I can't remember ever being that scared. I walked over to her and she was still conscious and sobbing. She had downed a bottle of wine and taken all her Klonopin.

I was able to get her dressed and take her to the hospital. She's in a mental health facility now and getting the help she needs. I'm just so afraid that when she gets out, she is going to try again and this time I'm not going to be there to save her.

I understand that it has nothing to do with me. I understand depression. I've been in a place, where no matter how much someone loves you, it's not enough. But, I can't help but beat myself up. I'm about as mushy and kind as they come. Spontaneous flowers, love poems, genuinely want to spend all my time hanging out with her, I listen and hang on her ever word, basically I know I'm a good and loving boyfriend. She kept repeating, ""I don't know why you love me so much. I'm horrible."" I tried to tell her that's not true.

Leaving her at the facility was so hard. She cried so much. She wouldn't let go of me when it was time for her to go. It's been almost a week and I miss her so much. We are never apart.

I know I'm doing everything I can. I just needed to rant and get some alternate perspectives. I went through a divorce a year ago and my circle of friends is relatively null, so I don't have a ton of people to talk to.

I'm depressed as fuck now. It's like this whole situation has made old memories and feelings come surging back. I'm not suicidal, but I sure would like to sleep for a couple of centuries. This is tough.

*EDIT* *UPDATE*

I saw her at visitation tonight and she was very upbeat. She is taking all therapy seriously and seemed to be genuinely happy for the first time. 

I feel a bit better about things. Thanks to all of you for your support. 

*EDIT*

She gets to come home this Sunday. Time to clean the fuck out of her house for her. =)"
One of the worst parts of depression is when people get tired of supporting you.,"I was diagnosed with depression 5 years ago, my family was very supportive at the start, I had a girlfriend who loved me and I wanted to make her my wife.

But the years have passed and my condition has not improved, people just start to get tired and see you as emotionally draining. This caused my girlfriend to leave me, my parents to get emotionally distant from me and my friends to disappear.

Now I am alone, miserable and suicidal. I have no one to talk to about this. My job sucks, my life sucks, and I see no way out of the miserable pit I live in.

Depression not only makes you hate yourself, it makes everyone else hate you as well.

Does anyone else feel shame in their depression because having it seems cliché and overused these days?,"I'm so tired of hearing ""everyone's depressed"" and ""other people have it much worse than you."" Like I'm completely aware my life should be great and now I just feel bad for complaining?? Are more people really diagnosed now or are we just hearing about it more? I understand I'm not a special snowflake who deserves special attention because I can't control my emotions but also give me a break.  

*edit: aw, guys. this has really blown up in just over 24 hours. I'm so glad none of us are alone and it's truly comforting to hear your stories and points of view. I have a very hard time deciphering my emotions and figuring out what i actually feel and what i think i'm feeling. it makes it very hard for me to trust myself that i actually have a problem, a chemical imbalance, rather than a bad few weeks. many of you explained how i feel better than i ever would have been able to. i kind of wrote this as a rant because i've been frustrated with my ""support system"" blowing me off as just in a bad mood most of the time because i'm highly functioning. i go to work, i run errands, i see friends, but then i just come home and crash in bed with my clothes still on for hours and hours until i have to force myself to get up and shower and go to sleep. ""you just need to sleep more,"" or ""try to relax,"" or my personal favorite, ""have you tried meditating or yoga?"" HA. we've all been there. 

i still feel shame in admitting my depression, anxiety, or eating issues, because i do feel like i'm looking for attention when you drop a bomb like that in a casual conversation and i'd much rather fly under everyones radar. but i am getting help. i've been on medications for several years, and have seen therapists in that time as well. if you even THINK you may have something wrong or you have thoughts of ending your life, please go see a therapist. many places accept all kinds of insurances, including medicaid, so it's completely free. please look into it! take care, friends. ❤️"

They never ask me how I’m doing, they ask me if I️ve gotten any homework done yet. And I️ just can’t take it anymore.

Edit: My parents do care about me, I️ know they do. They just don’t understand how serious its becoming.

has anyone else been depressed since they were children?,"i don't know if it's even possible for children to have depression-- everytime i've told a psych professional they've laughed at me. the thing is, though, i've literally always been depressed. like, i hear people talk about how times were easier when they were younger and how they could go back to that time of innocence and all, but i never had that. maybe, *maybe* in my first few years i was moderately happy, but from then on i've always been depressed. i just grew up too fast.

does anyone else understand what i mean?"
"anyone else just lies in bed trying to shed a tear, though it’s not happening because you’re so empty?","it’s probably around tenth night in a row where I lie hugging my phone and can’t cry, although my soul is getting torn apart and it feels like the only way out. why is it that the more thoughts i have, ironically the more emptier i feel?"
Do you ever feel like nothing matters because you'll probably end up killing yourself anyway?,"Why even attempt to self improve? I'll probably fuck it up and make myself more miserable, and since I'm going to commit suicide anyway, there's no point in even trying. Might as well continue down my self destructive path until I muster up the courage to end it all"
"Dear mods: Can you please do something about the influx of tough love zealots on this subreddit? It's a clear violation of the rules on the sidebar for anyone to advocate tough love bullshit. We need you to crack down on this. People are getting insulted, emotionally abused and put down daily.","The tough love ideologues are really getting out of control. I don't know where they are coming from. They are mostly idiots who are short on life experience and common sense, and long on hubris and a sense of entitlement. Many posts here lately receive comments that are just nasty in tone, and extremely judgmental, harsh and condescending in content. 

We really need the mods to crack down on this. I also request that you strongly emphasize that tough love has no place here. I understand that you say that on the sidebar. But I request that you say so in a more prominent place and in a more conspicuous manner. 

There are suicidal folks here whose lives may hang in the balance.

I strongly urge the mods to do something before somebody harms themselves after being publicly shamed in the name of tough love.

I think it's about time that we disempower the tough love acolytes and send them back to their Dr Phil reruns."

The Robin Williams Posts Are Triggering,"*Edit: My use of ""triggering"" in the title refers to how I felt reading articles and comments regarding Robin Williams on the night of, not the anger I felt the next day after having time to think and refresh.*

It angers me to see posts saying ""If only Robin Williams knew how many people cared/ loved him/ are sad now."" In my bouts with depression, I wouldn't have cared if 7 billion people sent cards saying they care; or 10 page letters; or a 16-hour phone call. I'd still throw the cards or letters away or hang up the phone and think, *They don't really care. They just don't want my death on their conscience.* I'd bet money Robin Williams was the same way. Who could be more loved than a funny-man?


When someone tells me [in the context of suicide] ""I'd be sad if you died,"" I think, *Great, so I should endure my pain every day because you don't want to feel pain yourself.* I think, *How selfish.* How is it more selfish to desire an end to my pain than it is want me to remain in pain? It's easy for the other person to ask me to remain in pain. They don't feel it. They don't see it. Because if I show it, ""Hey, perk up. Be happy. Turn that frown upside down."" Depression isn't an on/ off switch.


And so I never want someone to do something they don't want to do. I can remember one time that all I wanted was to play a particular board game with a friend, but I couldn't bring myself to say that. I didn't want my friend to play just because I asked or out of some moral obligation. (And I know that if I did, at the end I'd hear ""Do you feel better?"" as if they were just going through a undesirable task to make me ""less sad."") Instead I just sat there and said and did nothing for the rest of the evening, watching my friend get frustrated and angry with me.


The Robin Williams posts are triggering, because they are filled with ignorant comments about ""caring."" If I die, millions will never know, much less billions, much less care as one /r/self post proclaims. Friends and family will move on, because their advice to me is always, ""Keep putting one foot in front of the other. Just let go of that bad stuff."" 

Obligatory Edit: Thanks for the gold, kind stranger! It's my first!"
Anybody else feel especially terrible on their birthday?,"It’s my birthday today, and I feel way worse than usual. Am I alone in feeling this way?

Edit: WOW this post blew up. Can’t say I had the best birthday, but I very much appreciate all of the people who wished me to have a happy one, and it definitely made me feel better! Common themes that were brought up was that to increase enjoyment of birthdays, it is important to monitor your expectations, put yourself out there and be vulnerable, and know that it is common to feel this way, so therefore just make it your own celebration however you want to. Even if that means doing it alone and treating yourself. Best wishes and thanks again for your support!"
High-Functioning Depression Is...,"- keeping the appointment with the dentist, because tooth pain sucks, even though all you really want to do is stay in bed
- scheduling an appointment for the root canal you need, even though the mere thought of the procedure has you quaking in your boots
- paying the bill that's ten days late for no reason other than you couldn't bring yourself to task on the day it was due
- taking the car to the shop because the check engine light has been on for weeks and the inspection is due at the end of the month
- doing all of the above and STILL not feeling proud of yourself or accomplished because there are a hundred other small things you're avoiding or flat out ignoring just to keep from feeling like your life is spiraling down the drain.

"When I lie in bed, I look forward to living in the dream world inside of my head. There, I am the person I’ve always wanted to be. I’m loved, safe, and happy. But when morning comes and I wake up, reality sinks in like a brick. My youth is gone and I’m still a failure, and I wish I never woke up.","I have tried so hard through most of my life to feel accomplished, to live a life I can be proud of. To love and be loved. But every day is another act of failure and rejection. The days get heavier and heavier. I’ve run out of strength. I want to stay in my bed. I want to stay in my dream world. 

I really, really don’t want to wake up. "
Does anyone get triggered by being yelled at?,"All of my life, getting yelled at has absolutely been the trigger to bring me to such a low. It’s the feeling that I did wrong, and that I’m useless and a fuck up that slowly grows darkness over me. 

I am not diagnosed with depression but I have bad anxiety and I know that they can go hand in hand to completely screw your life over. 

Often, my moods fluctuate. I can have very high highs, where everything is good and I’m feeling beyond great, then with a simple trigger I can sink into this deep sadness where I go numb and have no interest in doing anything. 

I’m supposed to get a haircut today but I can’t seem to get out of bed. This feeling is scary and I hope for the best for anyone who deals with this. 

You are all loved!

Rick and Morty had one of the most realistic suicide attempts I've ever seen on television,"So episode 3 of the new season, at the end, Rick walks past his family, being a bit more quiet than usual, then walks downstairs and comes very close to completing suicide (he passes out at the last second.)

When I see a suicidal person on TV I feel like 9 times out of 10 they're standing on a bridge, weeping their guts out, waiting for someone to come along and talk them down. Maybe there's a crowd watching them, cause that's what everyone wants at their suicide: an audience. Now this obviously does happen, but I don't think it's the majority of attempts. Those might be more likely to be a ""cry for help"" scenario  (which is no less serious and tragic than someone who is fully committed to completing suicide. If you're standing on the edge of a building or taking any sort of steps towards suicide because you feel that's the only way you're going to get help, then you are really desperate for help.)

Anyway, for a person who has been suicidal for a long time and doesn't want anybody interfering, I feel like this  is so much closer to how it goes down. Family is home, they don't notice much different about the person, and it's completed without a lot of fanfare. You just want it done. It reminded me of Hunter S Thompson's suicide. His adult son was in the next room and thought he'd heard a book drop.

Rick is also one of the only characters I can think of that has depression and successfully hides it. He comes off as angry and mean, which is exactly what my husband has been saying about me. I'm angry all the fucking time. Because I'm in pain and I want to die, and I've used up all the fucks I had to give just getting out of bed today. I have no patience or kindness left for people annoying me or being stupid. Still, most people who know me have no idea how sick I am until I tell them.  

Rick and Morty likes to make you laugh at something, then force you to think about why you were laughing. Rick is a funny old drunk grandpa. Old people who are always taking swigs  from their flask and don't give a fuck are funny, right? Except nobody drinks like that without a reason. Healthy people do not need to be constantly drunk, the hangovers and cost to your health are enough to keep most people to some sort of reasonable level of consumption. Also, most people just don't feel the need to drink from when they wake up to when they pass out. 

Rick Sanchez makes me feel like somebody gets it."

I remember at my father's funeral, some man was there talking about what a good friend my father was. I looked at him and said ""Who are you?"" and then I asked him ""If he was such a good friend, why don't I know you? I'm his daughter and I've never seen you in my life.""

When I die, nobody will come to my funeral. Nobody will give a rat's ass that I am dead. That's why I'm donating my body to science.

"I'm 24. My father died, my girlfriend left, my mother killed herself, and my sister was just admitted to a psych hospital. In the span of 4 months.","I've been a subscriber to r/depression for a long time; I suffer from both depression and anxiety, and am currently taking medication that helps considerably. 

I guess I just need to get it all of my chest, and I apologize if it's a bit long. 

My parents divorced December 2012. After that, my father and I became very close, as my mother was exhibiting very selfish and irrational behavior that ended up pushing a lot of people away. My father was my mentor. He was my friend. He was a great man. 

In December of 2013, he passed away at 48. I'm 24. It was horrendous. I lost him, and was thrown into a massive storm of shit to deal with since I was the executor of his estate. 

A few weeks before his death, I began dating a girl. She was the perfect fit for me. She was smart, caring, and incredibly empathetic. When my dad passed, she began spending a lot of time at my house with me and my friends. She helped me through a lot. 

About a month and a half ago, she left. A half-cocked story about needing to find herself, and now I'm on my own, and still dealing with the aftermath of my fathers death. 

I was still not on good terms with my mom. She was not being a mother. She continued to disrespect my fathers memory, portray herself as a victim, and cut down the ones I cared about. Time and time again I gave her a chance to step up, and she failed to. 

This past week, my mother committed suicide. She wrote out her list of next of kin, took a handful of prescription strength sleep aids, and went to sleep for the last time. She decided she would rather be dead than reconcile the relationship she had with her children. 

My sister was just admitted under a 5150 as a last ditch effort for her to end her self destructive ways and get her life on track. It doesn't look promising. 

I sit here, smoking a cigarette, with my two dead parents dogs lying at my feet, and am overwhelmed by anger, loneliness, and defeat. 

I'm trying to keep myself from shutting myself away from the world and crawling back to my old hermit ways. 

If you took the time to read this, I thank you. I just needed to vent. 

And to add something; for those of you struggling with suicidal thoughts, as I have in the past, please PLEASE seek help. Don't do this to those that care about you. 

EDIT: Wow. I wrote this last night before getting some rest, and I woke up to a whole lot of positive feedback and support. I can't tell you how much it means to me. 

For those that sent me PMs, I will get back to you as soon as I can. Thank you to everyone here for being so supportive - you guys seriously have no idea how much it helps. I'll be going through everyone's response today. "

I don't live for myself, and it's been like this for too long. My loved-ones don't deserve the hurt it would cause them. With every thought of suicide I feel guilty for what it would do for my family. This has been the only thing that has kept me from ending it.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

New day, same shit. But today for the first time in a long time I was thinking about my future. I WANT to do better, I WANT to feel good again, heck I would settle for semi-ok any day. I was permanently excluded from mainstream education last year at 15, I spent a couple months on the countryside with my grandparents, couple months at home, and this was really the breaking point in my head. I cut for the first time at 12 and I have never really felt happy for longer periods of time since then, but how I've been feeling recently has been unmatched. I'm sure you guys can relate to this fucking pain.

BUT TODAY, I visited a school, a ""special"" school, designed for the children who don't make it through the regular educational system. I felt a tiny glimpse of hope, enough for me to wait it out. I can wait and see if this might finally make me feel any different, but if it doesn't...

I fear that I use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities.,"Hello everyone. First off, as I'm sure is the case for most of you, this post was extremely hard to write. I don't like complaining about my depression/anxiety because life is stressful for everybody. I am in a pretty good situation overall, with a good family, great girlfriend, great friends, and a nice apartment. Yet, despite all that, I feel so incredibly shitty most of the time. It makes me feel guilty - why should I feel like crap when I have it so much better than probably 99% of the world? Yeah, everyone gets stressed by work, traffic, money, etc but it's called life. 

These are thoughts I have all the time which is why I don't like to talk about my feelings much. I see a therapist and I don't really mind bitching to him because he gets paid to listen to me. But I absolutely hate talking about it otherwise. The thought of making my problems other people's problems is horrible to me. 

Another thought that I have is do I just use depression/anxiety as an excuse to avoid my responsibilities? Like am I just not mature enough to deal with real life so I can just say to myself ""hey I'm depressed so it's okay that I don't give maximum effort?"" I am so easily distracted and have such a hard time concentrating.  I often just think I'm incredibly lazy and that I use depression as an excuse which in turn gets me more depressed. Has anyone had these thoughts before (and apologies if this has been discussed in this subreddit - I'm brand new here). I just don't feel like I'm cut out to deal with the real word. I don't have whatever ""it"" is to be successful professionally - between social anxiety, inability to concentrate, and just extreme dread of working or doing anything productive.

I basically have a self-harm kit in my bag (razor in my phone case, gauzes and bandaids...) and I was really planning to just go and cut in the school bathrooms.

But then math period came. I usually don't do anything in math and fuck up most of my exams there. But lately I've tried to understand what we were doing there. 
And today, the teacher told me to go solve a problem on the whiteboard.
And after I solved it, my teacher said:

 ""See? You're really good at this!""

I almost fucking cried right there. I didn't actually feel like a worthless piece of shit for once. And you bet I didn't touch that razor today.

Some people dont know what even the smallest compliment can do to a person. So yeah, shoutout to my math teacher, she really made my day with this.

"People say you can't kill yourself, but then they disappear when you need help. Fuck everyone.",
"today I woke up without hitting the snooze button, actually made myself coffee, did homework I could have put off, and showered standing up!","I feel so proud of myself for not letting myself succumb to the depression today and actively fighting my lethargy! Even though I know that tomorrow morning I might disappoint myself, I won today's battle. Try to remember that every proactive thing you do (no matter how small, like making coffee) is a huge personal success! 

(to clear things up, I have taken to sitting in the shower since summer was over due to a lack of willpower/energy which results in longer, depressing showers instead of invigorating like a shower should be)

EDIT: so happy to see that my post has inspired others and thank you ALL for the congratulations and encouraging words :) this subreddit is truly a wonderful and supportive community"
Anybody else regret opening up to some people,"I feel like they didnt deserve to know me like that, some are too ignorant to deserve it."
"Many people I know wear ""I spend tons of hours at my job and I'm constantly exhausted"" like a badge of honor. I feel like I'm watching a group of masochists all slamming their heads off a brick wall, and then celebrating the person who can punish themselves the most/endure the most pain",

Me right now."
Anyone else feel like you have to be physically ill to make people realize you’re mentally ill?,"I have depression since childhood and nothing has ever been done until I cut my wrist once. 

I hate selfharming. I never had an urge to do it, but it did feel like something you had to do to ‘prove’ you’re depressed, especially when you’re a teenager. If not, you’re seen as someone who’s just sensitive and complains a lot. Other illnesses like anorexia also seem ‘necessary’ to have to make people finally realize that you’re mentally unwell. 

Even my own parents saw my suicidal thoughts as an afterthought at first. When I confessed to my teachers about my selfharming, they finally tried to find a therapist for me. "
Anybody else just used to being depressed and accept that's how it is?,"I've reached that point in my life, where NOT feeling depressed feels weird to me.  I'm just so used to that numbing feeling of uuuugh, that to actually think of life without depression just makes me roll my eyes.  Like that will ever be possible.  I can never just be happy.  There always seems to be some sort of catch.  Happiness seems to come at a price.

I've also noticed that after feeling happy, that I just *crash* hard back into depression and I feel worse than before.  I sometimes compare happiness to a hard drug.  The high is amazing and uplifting, but you fall from that high deeper into depression and you crave that happiness.  

I'm also anxious 95% of the time, even when I have no responsibilities or things to worry about.  I could be sitting down on my bed listening to music and then be having an intense panic attack.  I dunno, this might all just be me.  I just wanted to vent."
The Internet has turned depression into a meme and I hate it.,"It's practically impossible to have a serious discussion about it with anyone because if you say you're depressed and feel like dying they're always like ""LOL me too xD"""
Fuck Christmas,"It’s all fucking commercialized shit. Fake joy. Artificial happiness. Fake fake fake

And fuck people who say you can choose to be happy. If that was true then depression wouldn’t fucking exist

Fuck everything"
Being African-American and having a mental illness is literally the worst combo there is,"I just want to start off by saying that mental illness doesn't discriminate when it chooses its victims, I am just speaking from my perspective.

In no way am I saying that my mental health struggles are harder than people who comes from a different racial background, but it is difficult when you come from a community that stigmatizes and fails to recognize mental health as a REAL issue. From my personal experience and those of other black people I know, majority of us grew up being told that ""we're being ungrateful, weak, crazy or sad for no damn reason."" I am sure that other people have been told these things as well, but this is all too prevalent in the black community.

Recently, I have sought out professional help after experiencing a mental breakdown on campus. I was extremely grateful to be paired with an understanding psychologist. After the school year ended, I came back home and had told my parents of my experience with this doctor and exclaimed how much he helped hoping it would change their mind about going to a doctor, but they shot down the mere thought that anything outside of the bible could help me. The claim that ""going to doctors is what the 'world' does (they're pretty religious). All they want to do is put people on pills"". That is the furthest thing from the truth. Not once did the man I met with suggested that I be placed on any sort of medication and even if I were, I would be willing to if I needed it.

I hate that I am nothing like my family. If I believed in god, they would be more accepting of me. But I am at the point in my life where I feel that I want to believe in what feels right for me. I want to be my own person, not who anyone else wants me to be.

I just wish that my parents and other black people who still hold on to the same mentality could just open their minds to the fact that ACKNOWLEDGING MENTAL HEALTH IS NOT A BAD THING!

UPDATE: I thank and commend all of you for sharing your experiences in the comments. In the place of “African-American” I originally had “Person of Color” because I am aware that this problem  is very relevant within other groups. This was basically me speaking from personal experience and you all have definitely opened my eyes to what other groups endure.
Stay strong everyone. No matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, your problems do not deserve to be invalidated or told they are not real. I am proud of you all ❤️"
Sleep isn't just sleep anymore. It's an escape.,
I am in shock.,"Today at work my boss told me that she had a special job for me to do. She introduced me to a new hire (who is my age) and asked me to show her around. She was to hang out with me all night. Turns out we seemed to have a lot in common and we got along pretty well. We both left at the same time and when we walked out she asked me for my number. I'm just in total shock that anyone would like me enough to ask for my number, my awkward depressed self. Totally WEIRD"

Idk,"The thing is, you don’t want to sleep,
but you don’t want to be awake.
You don’t want to eat.
but you don’t want to be hungry.
You don’t want to be around people,
 but you don’t want to be alone 
You don’t want to do anything,
but you don’t want to do nothing.

What you really want is to stop existing,
but you can’t do that without dying,
and you don’t really want to do that either."
"Does anyone else feel like a ""bad person"" because of their depression?","I've never physically hurt someone, but I've emotionally hurt people. I'm manipulative, lazy, etc because of depression. I take advantage of people and I don't appreciate what I have. I feel like a bad person. Maybe the thought of being a bad person makes me want to die 🤔. "
"Wake up, neglect appearance and hygiene, play video games to escape life, watch anime in bed at night on my phone to escape the emptiness until I fall asleep. Repeat.","This has been my routine for a while now. Add in toilet breaks and eating food on the side. Sometimes I watch TV too and on days I'm feeling perky I brush my teeth and have a shower! Pushing the boat out right?

Living life on the very edge here. Or merely just killing time. I'll go with the latter. I don't feel very alive even gaming is more of a crutch to me than enjoyment."
Being suicidal is really scary because of how rational it feels in the moment,"Im not usually suicidal, im depressed but i only get suicidal when i have really bad days. And its really scary because in the moment it just feels like a rational and logical decision, that everything is hopeless and any motivation or happiness i may have felt was just me being naive and dumb. And then it lifts and i feel normal-ish again. It really scares me cause im afraid im going to go through with it one day."
"I've always had trouble articulating the severity of my depression, so I made some photographs that describe it instead. Thought you might enjoy.","I've always struggled with depression and anxiety, but the past year or so it's become a serious problem for me. I started seeing a therapist and started medication, and it's helped me tremendously. However, trying to explain how serious of problems these are for was really difficult. How do you articulate something that you've had your whole life? It's not like I really knew the other side, so to speak. It was frustrated not having people take my problems seriously.

SO…I made some photographs (all self portraits) that aim to describe how I feel. I've always been a more visual person anyway. Hopefully others find some type of comfort in this. Let me know what you think!

"My interpretation of depression. (Watercolor 9x11"")",http://i.imgur.com/D54zage.jpg
"The only upside to having both anxiety and depression is that depression keeps me from doing things that will trigger the anxiety, and the anxiety keeps me from actively trying to kill myself.","I didn't know how to phrase the title to make it shorter, but I am realizing this right now as I'm in the middle of a crisis. I'm depressed, suicidal, but also pretty anxious (especially socially anxious) and the one thing that is keeping me from jumping off the balcony is anxiety. Because I don't live alone, I feel like I wouldn't be able to kill myself without panicking. I don't want to be seen, I don't want to be acknowledged. The attention I would get alive, unconscious or dead is too much for me to handle if I think about it now. Just thinking about it makes me panic, and by trying to avoid the anxiety, I try not to think about my death. 

While the depression keeps me in my room almost all the time (yay, apathy and anhedonia!), which helps me avoid most situations that would otherwise lead me to a panic attack. 

So I guess that's a good thing, isn't it?   


Edit: Oh wow, you guys. I was not expecting all of this at all. I wrote this kind of in the middle of a really bad mental breakdown, while trying to give myself reasons to get out of bed the next morning. I'm sorry it took me so long to come back to this post.

Girlfriend committed suicide 10 days ago.. I'm crushed.,"I'm 26 years old. My live in girlfriend of a little over a year committed suicide 10 days ago. She suffered from extreme depression, and possibly borderline personality disorder or another disorder. Was a recovering heroin addict that was on suboxone for the past 9 months and recently tapered off...  After an argument she went out and bought heroin, wrote a suicide note, and then proceeded to do it via overdose. I haven't read the note, and I'm afraid of what it's going to say. I'm so completely crushed. Every day since then I've literally cried from the moment I wake up, and throughout the day randomly until I physically can't cry anymore...  I feel like this has really messed me up in the head. I don't know what to do... Everything I do reminds me of her, and I feel extremely guilty for even feeling the slightest bit of happiness at any time. Idk if a therapist will work.... because I don't know if I want to feel happy after this...  I'm not suicidal... but I honestly don't know if I'll ever recover from this.

Edit: This has also left me financially crushed... Not going into details right now... But I'm going to have to break our apartment lease and move home with my father... might get sued for a few reasons here.... God.. help me"
Anyone else been depressed since childhood?,"I don't see it being discussed much. It makes me feel rather isolated. I don't think I even remember joy. I only seem to recall fear and deep sadness. 

I've been depressed since I was 9. I suppose I was genetically predisposed to it as it runs on both sides of the family. A lengthy move across the pond, and the bullying that went with being the new, weird kid at school triggered it. An inferiority complex due to a learning disability only made it spiral uncontrollably. Most people my age (I'm turning 18 next month) seem to be so excited about life, but I only feel helpless. I am exhausted at this point in life, and feel like I can barely keep up with the ever so busy and growing world. 

Depression has taken all interests and motivation away from me. I have a rather vapid life with a personality to match. 

I'd be open to read your experiences and feelings! 

Edit: Wow, words cannot describe how relieved and elated I feel to know that I am not alone. All of you have dealt with such terrible experiences I wish no one had to go through. I wish all of you nothing but the best! I am exhausted on all planes of existence, but I will use what strength I have to carry on. We must all move on. "
"I'm desperate, please don't ignore","I can't think, concentrate, focus, i'm anxious, scared and feel like I've gone mad, my imagination is gone, i can't day dream or be creative, i can't function, i can't relax, i can't feel calm, my memory exists but recall doesn't work, I can't play games, or read long things, my inner monologue has disappeared and left me, i'm terrified.. I don't feel like myself, I feel I've been declining since February, depression or stress? but never been like this.. this has come on over the past 7\-10 days.. it's a leap from rough days to feeling mad, I don't know what this is and my google searches are not helping.. I need help.. and some peace of mind, has anyone gone through this? is this familiar to anyone, I've never heard anything like this before, like my mind has betrayed me.. or just, given up on me.

"Yesterday, was my 14th birthday. Got absolutely nothing.","So yesterday was my 14th birthday, got up in a good mood looking forward to it just to find that none of my friends really did care, same for my family. My family mainly just ignored me that day. But on that day they bought my older brother, younger brother some stuff likes clothes and video games (rounded up to $500 all together). But even though it was my birthday they didn't get Me anything not a cake, not a hug, not even a simple ""Happy birthday"" or ""Love you"". Just ignored me. But not going to complain since it's been like this for years and I was abused in all ways as a child by them, I was also called the problem and interference between them.

Anyways whoever's read this have a good day. :)"
Anyone else wish they could just die in their sleep?,"Like not so much actively suicidal as just kind of like, ""It would be super convenient if I didn't wake up in the morning""?

Lately I feel this way every night."
Doing nothing is boring but doing something is so hard,I'm so bored of just sitting in my room for the whole day watching YouTube videos or lying in bed til it's nighttime and I can go to sleep again. But whenever I have something I need to do or when I was employed and working everyday it was so fucking difficult and I just wanted to die. 
Knowing that I can kill myself is the only thing that keeps me relaxed.,"So, as in the title, One of the few things that makes me not fall in complete despair is knowing that I do have this way out. Just want to know if anyone knows what I'm talking about. Like, it came to a point where thinking about suicide actually comforts me enough to not do it. Am I a idiot for thinking this way?"
"I'm ""the funny guy"". I instinctively put on this act to make everyone laugh. Yet I really want someone to just see through my bullshit and understand how deeply sad I am.","When I'm around other people, I laugh boisterously and crack jokes like it's my fucking job. People think I'm this confident, hilarious guy who enjoys the fuck out of life. Of course, I can't blame them. I mean, I'm full of shit. That's the image I project. I can't help it. I just do it without thinking about it. But all I really want is for someone to understand the crippling melancholy that forms the foundation of all my jokes. I want someone to see through it all and just acknowledge how fucking hopelessly sad I am. The hilarious thing is that all it takes is a bit of honesty. Yet honesty feels completely unnatural to me. I can't be honest about my feelings. I just can't. I can face a wall and tell it about how miserable I am. But replace that wall with an actual human being, and suddenly it becomes impossible. I *pay* my therapist to listen to my true feelings, but as absurd as it is, I can't even bring myself to tell him just how dark my inner world has become.

I'm sad, Internet strangers. I'm really fucking sad. All the time. "
The only reason I haven’t tried to kill myself is because it would destroy my parents.,My mom is my best friend in the entire world and I couldn’t do that to her. I wish I could.
Does anyone else feel like just running away and starting a whole new life?,"I really just want to abandon my life and start over again. I feel like my life is just going nowhere right now, I'm 21 and struggling to find a job so it's hard for me to go out and do fun things which just adds to my depression.
The only reason I'm not homeless is because my mum owns the house we live in. 
My friends all have their lives together which just makes me feel really shitty about myself, don't get me wrong I love the fact that they all have it together and are happy, I wouldn't wish these feelings on my worst enemy. It's just by now I should have it all together and I should have a consistent job but I don't and the embarrassment alone makes me want to take my own life, I feel worthless.

tbh the only thing stopping me from just walking away or ending it all is my mum, I'm the only person she has and I know she would never be able to live without me. 
anyway thank you for listening you are all beautiful souls."

My parents and only sister died in a car accident. I am 20.,"It had been 4 months since I woke up to my uncle’s call telling me what happened. I feel so lost, I thought it will only get better but it doesn’t. I lie to my therapist so she wouldn’t ask to see me more. I lie to my friends. I have no other family. I have never been close to my uncles and aunts. My parents were everything in me and my sister’s lives. I never imagined life would be this hard. I never thought there is a jungle out here.

Litter saved my life.,"I was in my car this morning ready to kill myself (or at least trying I always chicken out). I went out driving looking for something like a bridge or a really sturdy tree so I wouldn't have to take anyone with me. That's when I drove by this massive LITTERING IS ILLEGAL sign and guess what? There's a fuckton of litter thrown around the sign! At this point I was beginning to somewhat calm down. I turned around and parked on the side of the road. I picked up litter for about 30-60 mins in the hot southern sun. Luckily I had a cheap duffel bag I wasn't using. Felt like I lost a pint of sweat (my fatass sweats a lot). After that I just got in my car and drove home. It's kind of amazing how such an inconsiderate act like littering became one of the most considerate things anyone has ever done for me.

Spending New Years in the hospital,"I’m typing this from the waiting room of the ER. I finally decided to get help. I’ve checked myself in for suicidal ideation.

I wish I could give my life span to someone that was taken too early that deserved to live.,"I just watched the Andy Whitfield documentary Be Here Now. He was the title role of Spartacus in the Starz series years back. The show was a hit and he was no doubt destined to do great things moving forward, but he was suddenly diagnosed with lymphoma cancer and died 18 months later. He left behind a beautiful wife and two children. He seemed to have been a decent and talented guy all alround and did not deserve to die.

I'm just a 27 year old pos working a crappy job and getting drunk every night. I'm short and ugly and will never find a women to start a family with. Why did a great guy like Andy have to die instead of me? Fuck cancer."
Does anyone feel like they’re not going anywhere in life?,I’ve felt like this for quite some time and can’t quite shake it off.
Wife is dying and I feel so lonely.,"I've suffered with depression all my life, I was raised by narcissistic parents and spent most of my life feeling alone and like I didn't fit in. My wife was the same, and when we found each other we found more than a spouse, but someone who could relate. I can't describe my love for her, we complete each other.

Around 5 years ago she was diagnosed with Ovarian Cancer for the second time (at age 20) whilst she was pregnant with our daughter. We lost our daughter to stillbirth, but my wife somehow pulled through, had chemo and got an all-clear.

During this time both of our families proved themselves to be thoroughly selfish, useless and downright nasty so we both went no contact and it was the best thing we did. After four years of healing we got married and life seemed to be getting on track.

Last month I took my wife to A&E because she was passing out and having trouble getting her blood sugar under control, only for them to tell us, after a few more tests, that despite having no ovaries left the cancer had returned, somehow spread to her lung and liver and there is next to nothing they can do.

She is due to start chemo soon, and is in an awful lot of pain. She has been prescribed morphine for it, but due to that spends most of the time sleeping, while I sit here and watch over her, making sure she is ok.

The trouble is I can't talk to her about any of this, it's too painful for her to do anything but ignore at the moment but I'm devastated and alone. Besides, how I feel should be the least of her worries at the moment and I don't want to put that on her.

I feel like I'm already grieving her even though she is still here, I'm completely alone with no-one to lean on for support.

I've already lost so much and I don't know how I am going to cope when I'm here alone. I feel like I'll probably just see out my cats life and then take my own, nothing feels worth doing if I can't share it with her."
Does anyone else excessively browse Reddit so they don't have to think about anything else?,"I spend all day on Reddit so I don't have to think about things that stress me out. The stupid thing is that there are things that I want to do, yet I always put them off until tomorrow. I've wanted to start a webcomic for quite a while now. I have a tablet and can download Photoshop for free from my university, yet I haven't drawn a single panel. If I can't even get myself to do something for fun, how the hell am I going to survive life?

I'm on winter break right now, but it ends in 6 days. Before winter break, I promised myself that I'd apply for the study abroad program that I need for graduation, but I haven't started that either. I'm so nervous about asking for recommendations, since I haven't had any professors for more than a term, due to switching majors twice. I know I need to just do it, but the more I put it off, the more anxious I get.

**EDIT:** Wow, this post got so much more attention than I was expecting. I'm really glad to know that I'm not the only one struggling with this. That being said, I think it's time for me to really make an effort to disconnect myself from Reddit. To help me in this process, I'm going to be deleting this account, so I'll have less of an attachment here. I've read every one of your posts here.

"My ex texted me ""I don't give a fuck even if you die""","So there we were arguing who fucked up the relationship, she'd never agree that it was her fault. I'd always apologize even if I was wrong. I refused to apologize and it all fucked up. She knew I had depression when we were in relationship. I told her I feel depressed and she said ""There's no such thing as depression""

Anyway, she found out from out our common friend that I visited my doctor to get help and will begin medication soon. So at the end of the chat,I told her I'm not okay and she is making me feel even more bad, she should just leave me alone, so she dropped the bomb and said ""I don't give a fuck even if you die""

I stopped texting her after that. I was already having suicidal thoughts, but since now she wants me to die, I fucking won't. Fuck you.. I'll outlive you , you stupid piece of shit.

Meeting a former bully,"I just found out that my hairdresser is one of the people who bullied me a lot earlier in my life. I didn't recognise him, but he suddenly asked if I was DNAli3n, and we had a long talk while he did his job. He apologised for what he did and how he acted, and it removed a big load from my heart. Just wanted to share a ray of sunshine"
It's so hard to get out of bed.,"I've spent 4 hours lying on the bed this afternoon. It's so hard to convince yourself because there's nothing to look forward to, nobody to talk to and you cannot find the reason for self-care. It's easier to stay in bed and struggle about things like self-hatred, sexuality, all the types of relationships and the future than to take steps to improve the situation. It's so hard when you have no emotional support, nobody cheering you on and nobody to go through things with you, step-by-step. 

Nobody's listening.

I'm aware that I cannot and should not rely on other for validation, and I cannot seek their help all the time. I'm aware that only I can change things. But as soon as I'm trying to be independent, everything just falls apart immediately. 

Why am I like this? I just want the demons to go away. I don't need to be happy, I just want this to stop."
"My depression makes me want to be alone, and makes me lonely.","What the hell is this bullshit.

Edit: Thank you for the Gold. It's very kind."
"No matter how early I go to bed, when I wake up it feels like my battery is at 50%, feeling like I want to stay forever in bed, so I try to rest a little bit and stand up after several minutes.",
I forgot where I live,"I have a brain tumor and the doctors told me my memory is going to get worse and worse. At first it was only little things, but today my friend was driving me home and I totally forgot where I lived. My road that I have lived on for my whole life seemed totally new. I had to think really hard to remember which house was mine. I've been crying for the past 4 hours over it."
does anyone else get jealous?,"i get jealous of other people’s abilities, talents, and achievements, since i have none. i also get terribly depressed when i hear stories of other people’s supportive families, their possessions. this makes me seem toxic and irritated out in public, when in fact i’m trying to cope with my worthlessness. i especially can’t stand people who have a tendency of humbly or subtly bragging. those people make me feel like absolute shit. 

does anyone else experience this... sense of loss? is it valid, or am i acting like an asshole? "
I won't commit suicide but I wouldn't mind dying,"So much shit has been piling on and on. I feel like I am not making the people I care about proud and the only reason they talk to me is because of pity. I am scared of not being able to reach the expectations my parents have of me.

I will not take my own life, but if a car hit me, I got a terminal illness or if something fell on top of me. I would not be sad about me being gone."
"I get really uncomfortable when people ask me ""Where do you see yourself in 5 years?""",Because I just hope I don't lol
Anyone else feel like they're just living the same day over and over?,"I feel like for as long as I have been depressed, I am  reliving the same day over and over again. Sometimes I just watch the clock change from 11:59 pm to 12:00 am and see the date change and think ""Yup, another day feeling the same way"". Time is moving forward and I am not. "
I dont want to kill myself. I just don't want to exist,I dont want to exist. I dont want to deal with all these emotions. I hate myself. I know people around me would no doubt benefit with me gone. I dont want to kill myself. It would just be another giant cost to my family who doesn't have much money to begin with. I'm an accident. Nobody wants a fifth kid in their 40s. I wasn't meant to exist so why am I here? If I wasn't here maybe my parents could've bought a house instead of renting their whole life. Maybe buy a car that the bumper doesn't fall off on. Maybe they could have enough money to retire soon. I just wish I didn't have to exist to be a burden on everyone
Does anyone have a completely normal day but still think of killing themselves?,"Like i dont feel like i have any problems, but the thought of killing myself just doesnt go away."
"""You can talk to me about anything! :D""",Biggest fucking lie I've ever heard. 
Life is too hard for me.,"You have to take care of your body. Brush your teeth, shave, shower, get regular haircuts. Eat varied, healthy meals. Exercise regularly. You need a varied and fashionable wardrobe for social occasions.

You need money to support yourself and your lifestyle. You have to work or study for years to advance in anything that's not a dead end career. You have to deal with your boss, with your coworkers, with your clients. You have to deal with a thousand other people in a cutthroat environment who all want the same job or that promotion. You have to devote at least 40 hours a week to this, sometimes more.

You need to develop your identity and your personality. Find what interests you and pursue it. Have hobbies, read books, be an interesting person. You have to maintain a social life on top of all this. You have your family, your friends, your significant other. Birthdays, anniversaries, Thanksgivings, Christmases. Mandatory social obligations. Gifts. Money. Endless conversation. Most of it is fake. There are so many unspoken rules and customs involved in social interaction and you're not allowed to show weakness. It's a constant, tiring charade and everybody knows it's an act but it goes on and on and on.

This is a fucking rat race. It's too much responsibility, too much chaos. I can't handle it all. How do people do it? I don't think I was meant to be human."
"Happy birthday, u/feelingdepressed, I told you I'd remember! :)","In July 2013, a redditor told me on a comment thread that he was planning on killing himself by age 21, and I just wanted to say:

Have a happy birthday, and remember that we here at r/depression care! I know this year has sucked, and I'm here to let you know that it WILL work out, and if I care enough to remember your birthday when you told me in July, others do too. Stay with us, death sucks, don't die, and PLEASE don't end yourself because you DO matter! We love you!

Depression is humiliating,"It turns intelligent, kind people into zombies who can’t wash a dish or change their socks. It affects the ability to think clearly, to feel anything, to ascribe value to your lifelong passions, your relative good fortune. It scoops out your normal healthy ability to cope with bad days and bad news, and replaces it with an unrecognizable sludge that finds no pleasure, no delight, no point in anything. 

You alienate your friends because you can’t comfort yourself socially, you risk your job because you can’t concentrate, you live in moderate squalor because you have no energy to stand up, let alone take out the garbage. You become pathetic and you know it. And you have no capacity to stop the downward plunge. You have no perspective, no emotional reserves, no faith that it will get better. So you feel guilty and ashamed of your inability to deal with life like a regular human, which exacerbates the depression and the isolation. 

If you’ve never been depressed, thank your lucky stars and back off the folks who take a pill so they can make eye contact with the grocery store cashier. No one on earth would choose the nightmare of depression over an averagely turbulent normal life. It’s not an incapacity to cope with day to day living in the modern world. It’s an incapacity to function. At all. 

No one chooses it. No one deserves it. It runs in families, it ruins families. You cannot imagine what it takes to feign normalcy, to show up to work, to make a doctors appointment, to pay bills, to walk your dog, to return library books on time, to keep enough toilet paper on hand, when you are exerting most of your capacity on trying not to kill yourself. 

Depression is real. Compassion is also real. And a depressed person may cling desperately to it until they are out of the woods and they may remember your compassion for the rest of their lives as a force greater than their depression. 

Have a heart. "
Is anyone else always tired?,"And I’m not talking about tired of life (Well not mostly.) I’m tired. All the time. No matter what I try to do, I can’t stop being tired. Exercise? Tired. Stay in bed all day? Tired. Try to socialize? Tired. Be alone? Tired. Eat or not? Doesn’t matter. Tired. Not matter how much or how little I sleep, I’m tired. I can’t find fun in anything anymore."
News flash!!!,"Hey people without depression who think I'll be cured by working out and eating better guess what!!! It doesn't cure it!! I run every other day and eat healthy with lots of vegetables, I journal, I do yoga, I go to individual and group therapy, I'm on medicine, hell I even have an essential oil diffuser to make my room smell nice. I make my bed and clean my room every day and stretch out morning and nights.

All neurotypical minds probably think I should be not depressed right now but guess what I still am!!! Doing all those healthy things makes my overall mood higher but it doesn't cure what's going on in my brain. I just want people to know that I'm trying hard and I still am not on neurotypical level like they want me to be. Thanks for coming to my TED talk"
Depression feels like you're drowning and no one wants to save you.,"Most days I feel like i'm in the middle of the ocean, gasping for air as I bob up and down trying to scream for help. Yet yards away are a beach, a beach of my friends and family. They know the signs, they know what ""drowning"" looks like, yet they do nothing. Just stare. Just stare as I try to keep my head above water. 

No matter how hard I scream, no matter how much I wave my arms hoping for someone to notice and help me out. No one moves.

Its just me. Alone. In the middle of the ocean. Praying I can just keep my head above water for at least a day."
"For those of you who have been diagnosed with depression, did you ever feel like you DIDN'T want to feel/get better?","Now first off I feel it's imperative to say that I haven't officially been diagnosed with anything; in fact I haven't even talked to anyone about how awful I've been feeling the past year or so.  However I feel I definitely have a lot of the symptoms that those diagnosed with depression have (also of note, I do not feel suicidal at all).

I suppose the title of this post is a bit hyperbole, but I was thinking that if I did talk to someone and they prescribed some type of medication I would not feel comfortable with taking it.  I mean for one, I have a lack of faith that it would even work (but maybe that's just me being cynical and/or naive) and for another it seems like even if it did work it would lead to a contrived happiness as opposed to a genuine happiness.  Even just talking to someone I feel like I wouldn't properly be able to open up about what I've been going through. 

...And sometimes I feel like (and this is going to sound just awful) that I'm just using depression as an excuse or outlet for just being lazy or not taking an initiative in life.  I mean, there are times where I am happy...it's just seems like a rare occurrence.  I feel like I'm feeling sorry for myself.  I mean I have a great job, I'm only 23, I make very good money, have a nice car/apartment, etc.  But something just hasn't been feeling right...and it seems like it's a combination of multiple factors.   

It seems like it would all be an exercise in futility.  Maybe instead of talking to someone or taking medication I just need an escape via some new activity or something.  I just feel as though an attempt at trying find genuine happiness is very stressful and borderline impossible."
I raised my hand and spoke up in class.,"After having to take a medical leave from a good college because of my depression and social anxiety, what I did today made me extremely happy. I hope I keep doing better.

Edit: thank you for all the support! I think this goes to show that any step you take to better yourself, no matter how small, is significant. I love this community."
"You know what kills me about being depressed, and how people view me/us? Please read this. Directed to all of you.","Is that depressed people are honestly some of the nicest, open-minded, loving people I have ever met/talked to. We all know how it feels to be in the darkest places, and we don't want to see anybody go through that. I feel like a lot of us would stand by somebody and help them through anything they needed. Whether it be big or small, depressed people know that there is no such thing as a big or small problem. Problems are problems. People just like to point and act like they know what we are going through. Like we are the mud on the bottom of the shoe, and can't ""Lighten up"". 

I really don't know any of you, but I already know that you are all some of the best people out there. I know how strong you all are, how loving you all are, how open-minded you all are. In some weird, seemingly contradictory way, you all are the love that is needed in the world. 

 Nobody wants to talk to a depressed person, but a depressed person would talk to anybody."
I've skipped work and laid in bed for 3 days straight. I don't know what to do. I just have no motivation to get up in the morning.,"This is becoming a problem. This is not the first time this has happened either. I am surprised I have not been fired. I just can't get up. I am so unmotivated. Help! What can I do?

Edit: I am currently in therapy twice a week and taking antidepressants. I also have been working with my Dr. to get a healthier diet and exercise routine. All of these things have help a lot. But I still can't seem to get up and face the day. "
"I realised depression makes me only try to re-live old memories, and never new ones.","Every week I buy a packet of strawberry bon bon's from the same shop because I did that every week when I was 12 and I associate the flavour and the smell with coming home from school, excited to spend the weekend playing video games.

I buy an energy drink every Wednesday because that was the night I used raid with my old WoW guild. Best times of my teenage years, and every Wednesday I had an energy drink alongside me. I'll probably do it tomorrow, too.

I stay up until 5AM regularly because I long to feel like I did when I was 14 and I remember staying up watching old movies I'd never seen before. I no longer get that sense of awe.

I used to eat pizza from the same place because I used to do it with my old band. The only place we ever went to and whenever I eat there I feel like I'm back in those days. 

Occasionally I walked the same route home that I did in High School so I can fantasise about getting home to talk the girl I fancied on MSN. That was a decade ago, though. MSN doesn't exist, she's moved on and I don't have anything to look forward to. 

The pizza place shut down recently, new management who can't make pizza worth shit. I fucking cried because I felt like that part of my life was finally gone. 

I wondered if, in 10 years, I'd be doing the same things but to re-live the memories I'm making now. I don't know if I will.

Depression has successfully taken away my ability to make new memories. Now my old ones are becoming harder to hold on to.

**Edit:** Hey everyone. I woke to an overwhelming response, thank you all for kind words, advice and for sharing your own tales of nostalgia. This is a hard subject for me, I look forward to the future but the past is special and I never want it to go away entirely. 

I'm not one for unique experiences, the memories I have were never holidays or the first time I kissed someone or when I left high-school, but rather a broad feeling because at some point there was a part of my life that was really good and even though doing it once was fun, doing it over and over and over again cemented it into my head as a source of overwhelming positivity. Hopefully by making broader improvements to my life they'll start to form again.

I'll continue to read the comments for as long as this post remains relevant. Thank you, if anyone else is trying to get one over on depression too, I'm right along with you."
I can't kill myself because of my cat.,"I realized that today. This little furball shows me a very specific kind of affection. She even learned how to give ""human"" hugs. Everyday, sometimes a few times a day, she hops on my knees, takes her paws and face on my shoulders and purrs loudly, knitting my shirts and sweaters with her claws. I never saw her do that to anyone or anything. Just me. 

Not always, but most of the times, when I'm stressed or I feel low, she storms into my room and just does kitty things. Sometimes she interacts with me, sometimes she allows to pet her without doing anything back, sometimes she's just there, having an eye on me. Also, she always sleeps in my chair, next to the bed. Almost everynight. 

Today, I felt suicidal since the morning and I was even making plans, but another session of a kitty imitating human hugs made me research the topic of cat feelings. It turns out, that those little creatures can get depressed when their owner is not around and overall it stresses them out, gives them anxiety, makes them apathetic and waiting for the owner to come back. 

As ridiculous as it sounds, I don't want to cause any harm to this little thing and that's what keeps me alive. "
Anyone else feel like your “friends” aren’t really your friends at all?,I feel like all my friends hate me. The people that truly know me resent me. I feel my presence isn’t enjoyed — just tolerated. I’m the clown of my group. I’m always the butt of their jokes. But yet they always want to hang out. Probably because I’m too nice. Probably because I have a car and everyone just uses me for a ride. I don’t know who’s really there for me and who’s just taking advantage of me. I’m better off alone. I don’t even know how to have a friend...
3 years ago I nearly killed myself. 2 years ago I posted some drawings here. Now I have some more.,"Hello everyone! About two years ago, on the anniversary of a near-suicide attempt, I posted an album here of different drawings I had made to cope over the year. The response was overwhelmingly positive and really encouraged me to continue pursuing my art. A lot of time has passed since then, and I’ve gotten a lot healthier as well as more skilled artistically, as it really helps me express myself in a positive way.

This project has taken me about 6 months to complete, and it’s been hard, but has really given me purpose and meaning. I cannot thank you all enough, for the role you have played in encouraging me to take this thing art thing more seriously. It has revolutionized my mental health.

So this project is something I've been working on for a while lately. It's called ""The Banality of Monsters,"" and it's ten ballpoint pen drawings, each with a corresponding text piece, telling a story about depression. Don't worry, I'm not selling this project or anything, I want it all to be free. I just want to draw. It gives me purpose. Thank you all so much for your support.

I had my first kiss today,"I know, Im really late on having my first kiss. Today I finally kissed my crush, and it felt wonderful. For a moment, all of my problems were lifted off my shoulders and I felt like someone actually cared about me.

A year ago today I nearly killed myself. The next day I bought a sketchbook. Here is an album with drawings and doodles from a year's worth of recovering and coping.,"Hello everyone. As the title says, a year ago on June 20th I hit my lowest point. I had close calls before, but this one was worse. I was going to throw myself in front of a train. After that incident I decided to get my act together. I started seeing a therapist and being more open with my friends about myself. In addition, I started to draw again. 

Some of the stuff in this album I have submitted to here or r/Anxiety, and it's been pretty well received. This is the first time I'm submitting almost everything I've done up til now, so I hope you guys like it and this helps you cope. Please tell me if this is harmful and I will take it down immediately.

Does anyone else wish they could simply sleep forever?,It seems only in my dreams does the feelings of hopelessness and unhappiness goes away.
"Who here stays awake late at night because you are trying to avoid the ""next"" day of bullshit at work/school.",I know I do :/ 
"Whatever you do, please don't ignore me.","You can cuss me out with insults, you can treat me like a subhuman, you can spit in my face, whatever. But please, please don't ignore me. I want my existence to be acknowledged. I want to be sure that I'm not just an invisible pair of eyes roaming around, witnessing everything happening without anybody noticing I'm there, like I'm an outsider looking in. Please don't make me feel any more isolated than I already do, like I have no friends who genuinely care about me. I know I suck, and I know I fuck everything up frequently, and you're welcome to hurl expletives at me for it. I deserve it. But whatever you do, I'm begging you, *please* don't act like I'm not there at all."
Does anybody else just feel like only laying in a couch/bed and just watch YouTube?,"I often just only sit or lay in my bed using my phone to watch videos or maybe play a game, since i have nothing better to do.

"I wish there was a way to restart my life, instead of permanently stopping it.",
I want to kill myself but can't because I need to play Fallout 4.,"You might think this is a joke. It isn't. I've wanted to kill myself for a long while now, probably since around 12 years old. The only thing that alleviated my depression when I was younger was Fallout 3. It was the best game I'd ever played. I swore to myself when I got bored of FO3 (two years after it came out) that I wouldn't kill myself until Fallout 4 was released. I didn't count New Vegas, because, well, it sucked. Now that 4 is coming out, I don't know what to do with myself. I still want to die, but I can't just keep pushing it off until the next Fallout release. I'm addicted to the series, yes, but I'd like to have some motivation to live other than a video game. I feel so pathetic. I've attempted suicide twice before and been admitted to a ward for two weeks once, which only made things worse. What else is there to live for? People generally bore or upset me. I have a girlfriend, friends, family, pets, a job, everything I could really ask for. I'm not allowed to get medication as I'm still under my parents insurance. I'm working on going back to therapy, but my parent's think my depression is just in my head.  I'd really love some advice, or just someone to talk about random shit online with. 

I hope people don't see this as some kind of joke. Just writing this has helped, to some degree. 

Thanks.

Edit: Fallout was released last night at midnight. I'm feeling pretty good about it so far, but it better have some damn good replayability cuz fallout 5 is probably quite a ways off... I'm honestly surprised to see how much attention this got. Its really pretty cool that other people can empathize with me. Thanks all."
everyone click on this and sigh with me,*big sigh*
My depression and anxiety keeps me from saying anything,"People don’t understand, sometimes I want to say stuff about how I’m feeling or talk about my depression or anxiety, but I just don’t. I just think if I tell my friends or anyone anything they won’t understand and think I just want attention. Sometimes I literally type whole posts on here and don’t post them because I feel like people won’t care. I don’t know why I do this to myself but I can’t help it. I just hate myself for doing this to myself."
"I hate when my boyfriend says, ""But don't I make you happy?"" That's not how depression works, love :(","Then I have to be the big bitch, instead I just ignore it, which could possibly be worse. I don't know how to explain it, but no, you don't make me happy because I'm too depressed."
Does anyone else retreat into their own self made fantasy's?,"Lately I have to keep my mind occupied on something, or else I feel like breaking down, like a damn that's about to burst. I keep fantasizing about a fictional version of me that isn't so broken. Someone who has made something of themselves. I've been watching hours of youtube and inserting my self into those videos and it's just making me more depressed. Someone who is normal and does normal people things. I feel like someone on the outside looking in. I still find it easier to just day dream than feel anything ""real"" in my actual life. Else I just feeling like killing my self. "
One of the most frustrating things about depression is how much of an idiot you become the longer you're depressed,"I feel like my brain has just rotted into swiss cheese. I used to have an incredible memory and now I can't remember what I did this morning (although doing nothing every day helps in this regard). I can't remember teachers names from high school or college without putting serious effort into it and even then I can't remember all of them. Seeing something about derivatives (math) and realizing that I took and passed calc 1 in college with a B but I literally can't remember what derivatives actually mean much less how to solve them is depressing in itself. It's like whatever work I managed to do 5-10 years ago is meaningless. It also makes the thought of going back to school impossible. 

I'd give anything to be average and to not constantly walk around forgetting what I'm doing or what I wanted to say. "
"People mourn you if you kill yourself and ask what they could've done to prevent it, yet they treat you like a pariah if you attempted to kill yourself and failed.",Sometimes I feel like people would appreciate my existence more if I were dead. Why is that?
Depression has turned me into a fucking idiot.,"My attention span is shockingly short, I forget things all the time, and my thoughts are all over the place. 

The worst thing has to be the memory problems. I forget shit all the time. What chores I'm supposed to do around the house, and whether or not I took my meds this morning. 

I also have a lot of trouble focusing. I can't get anything meaninguful done because my brain is so scrambled. Even driving has proven dangerous a few times. Sometimes I doubt whether or not I should be out on the road. I can hardly read a book for enjoyment because my mind is so disorganized.

People close to me think that I'm inconsiderate, lazy, and selfish, but I'm actually trying my best. But they won't hear any of it. They always see ""if you wanted to, you would"" and while I guess that might be true, it doesn't change the fact that I forget shit all the time.

On top of all this, the lack of energy makes me not want to do the things I *do* remember, so it's like an obstacle course of things I have to get through before anything gets done. I have to actually be awake and not sleep all day. Then I have to remember what to do. Then I have to have the energy to do it. Then I have to have the focus and overall mental competence to do it properly.

I feel like I have the mind of an eighty year old at age twenty, minus the wisdom and experience.

you ever feel like your entire existence is wasted potential and you never became the person you were supposed to be?,"i can't help feeling this way all the time. i look at the people around me and they've accomplished so much and done so much more than me. when i look at myself i see nothing special or interesting and it hurts more because i feel like i was supposed to be more, but i'm just nothing."
Depression has changed my memory-- has anyone else experienced this?,"I know depression makes it hard to remember things in the short term, but I feel like depression changes my memory in a way that I never hear anyone else talk about. After a depressive episode, I feel like everything that occurred before that episode is from the distant past, like in another life, and I have a hard time remembering it or connecting to it. Even after I have fully recovered from the episode.

My last episode was during last fall, and even though I got better in the spring, I still feel like I have a hard time recalling my life before the fall. It just feels like everything is so different now, like I moved to a different town, but I didn't.

I don't really know how to explain it, but it is just a distinct feeling to me. I am really curious if this happens to other people.

Edit: Wow. I did not expect so many replies. I know this is not even remotely the worst aspect of depression (at least for me it isn't), but even after I'm clear of the depression this still haunts me. And I have had to explain to people over and over again that my memory is bad, and I can't really explain why... sometimes it's even hard to convince myself that I'm not just stupid or flakey. But hearing that this happens to so many other people too... I don't know. It sounds cheesy but it just makes me feel like I am really not alone in this. I know there are other people out there who understand. Thank you for your comments :)"
Does anyone feel like they aren't good enough to date someone?,"Like your life is too boring? Like the fact that you have no friends and no prior relationship experience and nothing exciting about your life makes you not good enough?

The only reason I wont kill myself is because I don't want to make my mom cry.,"I want to die and I fantasize about killing myself everyday. The only reason I wont do it is because I do not want to hurt anyone. I am just here, rotting away."
Nobody thinks depression is serious until suicide happens,"I've been on medical leave from work to seek treatment. Few know where I am. Those who know have been telling those who ask some variation of ""She's fine, just taking care of what she needs to."" Three people know...all three have told that they've just been relaying that I'm fine.


The other day, my supervisor and I talked about sending the office an email about how I'm okay and fine (her exact words) with my expected return date


Fine. My apt. is a dumpster. I don't have real relationships. All I do is eat and throw up at 31. Never once have I uttered those words ""fine"", but others are saying it for me. I don't even know what I'm hoping for or want...but I feel like my illness is all made up in my head. If I had cancer, nobody would say I was fine. I get that they are protecting my privacy but at the same time it feels like it is ""less"" than a physical illness.  


I'm feel so suicidal lately but too numb to do anything about it. I'm unbearably lonely, sad and hopeless. I'm not fine. I don't want to go back to work with a fake smile plastered on, but I have to. Because depression isn't seen as a real sickness or as serious until suicide. 


Back when I asked for leave, my supervisor even told me to let people know it wasnt something ""serious"" so that people wouldn't worry."
You guys prevented me from committing suicide yesterday. Thank you.,you guys are so kind and supportive of a complete stranger. I felt a strange comfort seeing your kind messages when I asked this subreddit to help me kill myself with painless suicide methods. Thank you. I havent felt that warm comforting feeling in a while. I cried.
Yesterday a random girl on campus hugged me and I felt much better,"I go to one of the largest universities in the nation and am having a really tough time here while trying to not let depression take over my life. Yesterday, I was killing time in between classes as usual, sitting near some trees in a popular part of campus to study at. On a scale from 0-10, my depression was at an 8 or 9 and I desperately needed help. I posted on Yik Yak asking if anyone near me wanted to give me a hug (Yik Yak is a popular app among college students kind of like an anonymous twitter, and you can only see posts within a mile away from you or something like that). I ended up deleting the post almost instantly because I felt silly asking for a stranger to give me a hug. But within a minute, a random girl peeked at my phone, asked if I was the one who posted the anonymous cry for help and hugged me while I choked back tears. I still can't believe it happened. I didn't catch her name or say much to her but it really helped me get through the day. "
Is anyone else thinking of killing themselves after their parents die?,They're the only ones who would lose the will to live if I died. 
"i know what i have to do to get better; however, i don’t have the motivation nor concentration to do it",anybody in the same boat?:(
"""I'm just tired,"" has become my catchphrase, and a pretty huge lie, at this point.","The people I work with are quite bubbly, talkative, and sociable, but there are a lot of times I just don't have it in me to try to socialize. My job locks me in a room with 1-2 other people for 12 hours+, so talking and playing games is the only way to pass the time. When I'm not actively talking or contributing to the conversation and they ask me what's wrong, my response is always ""sorry, I'm just tired,"" when I mean ""sorry, I feel like a useless piece of shit today, you'll have to excuse me."" Do I want to socialize with my co-workers? Of course. Does my mood/brain want me to socialize? Hell no, it wants me to brood in the corner and overthink. 

I even do this in my personal relationships. When I'm in a bad mood (which is about 99% of the time anymore) and I shuffle around the house not really talking to anyone, and my mom or step-dad ask if I'm okay, my response is always ""I'm just tired,"" then I'll go to my room, shut my door, and only come out for basic necessities for the rest of the day. I haven't talked to my friends in God knows how long because I'm just not mentally prepared to most days. I'm scared I'll lose them eventually. My phone is never moved from where its set down when I came home from work because no one is concerned enough to talk to me unless they need something. "
Who else lives their life in a fantasy world?,"I spend probably 90% of my days daydreaming. Sitting in class, watching TV, playing video games etc I'm always daydreaming

I go to this fantasy world where I actually have a passion and I actually have support and friends where I'm the best at something. Some cultural icon.

It's unhealthy and it's caused me to stop myself from ever being happy in life. How could I ever be happy when all I think about is what if I was someone else? Some amazing artist? Musician? And not just this talentless loser who will spend the majority of his life grinding a 9-5 and the most exciting thing I do is play video games on the weekends?

And then I get the whole bullshit about ""well instead of daydreaming about it, go start finding your passion and get good at it""

I'm hoping you guys know that that is just bullshit. It hurts me every time. I'm tired of hearing it.

Learning how to accept being a nobody sucks. Idk if I will ever fully accept it."
Fucking Sick of this bullshit,"Fucking sick of waking up every fucking day to drag my ass to somewhere I don't even want to be just so I can come home, get high and play videogames. I'm fucking sick of pretending that life is some grand adventure that should be cherished. Fuck this shit I'm gonna eat fried chicken every fucking day till i have a heart attack"
Do you guys ever feel ashamed for having depression?,"Sometimes I think about my current situation I'm in and I think: "" I have no reason to be depressed"" and sometimes I see others with depression who have a good reason to be depressed but sometimes I feel ashamed to think I have depression when I think of other people's misfortune despite my own misfortune.

I even avoid saying I'm depressed and just say I'm sad now because I feel like I'm insulting those who are depressed."
"My mom asks ""Don't you get tired sitting around everyday doing nothing?"" I do. I want to do something, but I just can't be bothered.",There's just nothing interesting.
The scariest part is when depression becomes so normal you forget what happiness really felt like,"When I was 16 it was so strange to me. I have a journal entry where I wrote, ""This isn't who I'm supposed to be."" Everybody noticed me go from goofy A-student to constantly skipping classes and looking so empty and sad.

I tried to fight it. I really did. But fast-forward 11 years and the 16-year-old me is gone. The intelligence is there, just not applied towards anything useful or productive. The humor is there sometimes, just more morbid and mostly kept to myself. 

I am constantly fatigued, unfocused, sad, irritable, pessimistic, and anxious. The most common coping mechanisms I have that give me comfort are food and TV/games. ""Oh but I'm NOT really like this—it's my depression!"" That's what I said for a fucking decade and I can't even believe it anymore.

My depression is who I am now most of the time, and it's been that way for years. It's become my personality. It's become so normal I don't remember that people aren't supposed to feel and act like this. It's not fucking normal to take a few hours to get out of bed, not shower for days, and do nothing but binge eat, watch TV, play games, and sleep for days and even weeks on end. I can't stand it anymore.

I just took a Wellbutrin again after giving up on it after a week last time. Fuck it, can't get any worse. I have to tell myself that I have a serious problem and the only way is to get help. Because if I don't then I'm back in that damn pit again, feeling miserable yet powerless to ever change it. 

"
Anyone else constantly check their phone even though you never receive anything?,"I woke up with 30 Reddit notifications, thank you all for making me feel valued."
Depression has turned me into a mean person.,"This past year has been so scary because I’m noticing that my sadness and lethargy is turning into uncontrollable rage. Everything sets me off and I lash out at people who are only trying to help me. Ex: Yesterday I was cooking, and my mom asked me if I washed the vegetables. Instead of replying like normal and saying “yes”, I started yelling at her for over 30 mins and acted like an asshole to someone who was only checking on me. Same thing happens when I misplace something or have to repeat myself. Someone next to me parked bad? Let me yell/rant about it and exhaust myself and everyone around me.

Immediately after, I feel like absolute scum and want to cut/drink/do drugs/kill myself because I’m making life unbearable for everyone around me. I know how awful I am to be around and it makes me hate myself more than I already do.

For background, I’ve been living at home for the last 8 months after having a massive depressive episode my last semester of college. I want to go back in the fall but I feel like a massive embarrassment as a 23-yr old “super senior” and as someone who was always good at everything. 

I’ve always been known as “nice girl”, smiley and compliant. But now I get so fucking irritated to the point where every nerve in my body is on edge and my stomach is twisted. Like panic attacks but anger. I’ve never been physically violent in my life but sometimes i get this uncontrollable urge to cause damage. I feel so out of control and like a crazy person because my moods come so suddenly and I can only ride it out. It’s like I’ve become a different person. I’ve been replaced by a different person who’s cold, twisted and bitter. And what gets me is that there are parts of me that crave the anger and volatility. "
today i woke up at 9am and i'm going out!,"i just feel really excited and  happy right now. i woke up at 9:19, (I have been waking up at 3pm and staying in bed all day, too depressed) but today i woke up so early and i'm about to leave to go get starbucks! wow, maybe ""new year, new me"" can be true this year.... :) i hope everyone has a wonderful day"
Brilliant Mind?,
Does anyone else feel guilty about being depressed?,"I just feel guilty about being sad all the time. Like I have a decent life, no financial trouble, or family deaths, so I feel like I don’t deserve to be depressed. I always think about how much worse other people have it in life, and it makes me think I’m just spoiled and unappreciative."
The only messages I receive is from automated apps.,:(
I just showered. Tomorrow I start a new job. Feeling hopeful.,"Reddit,

A year and a half ago I was bullied at work and forced to quit. I've worked side jobs ever since and have been too afraid to apply for jobs in my field (medical assisting and gi technical specialist). I have nightmares still about my past work place. I truly am still afraid of working side by side with someone again and having them spread lies about me. 

My depression has been it's worst this year after my doctor had me lower my anti depression drug dosage because I was feeling better after a year taking my increased dosage. I soon spiraled into a mess. I financially have been struggling and that has constantly been a worry for me. Many days I stay in bed and do not shower, brush my teeth or eat. I currently cannot sleep at night without the aid of sleeping pills. I do take them now though, that's something I usually haven't done.

But a couple months ago I updated my resume, applied to jobs, went on interviews..and was hired (part time) by a local hospital with my start date being tomorrow. 

From that interview to now, yeah, I've still had a rough time. I haven't paid this month's rent and can't afford to. But I finally showered. I brushed my teeth this morning. I'll brush my teeth tomorrow morning and actually go to work. 

I'M GOING TO WORK. My new manager seems like a great person. I'm still filled with anxiety but this is an entirely new hospital system, all new (to me)people and this gets my foot in the door for a full time position when/if one opens. Plus I'll be soon helping patients again and using my seven years of experience of advanced GI procedures.

All of my previous posts here have been eaten by the auto mod I think, but thank you to anyone who reads my story.

Edit: Wow, thank you so much for everyone's support. 

Here's a little something about my first day:

These new co-workers, I already can tell they talk bad about others but basically to warn me about a chatty Cathy, and from two individually they mentioned that the IT guys walking around (doing yearly maintenance it looked like) were nerds through and through...but I can't help but chuckle at that. The guys looked like they were from the 80s with what they wore and their glasses and hair. I didn't participate in that conversation but I suppose I am now. 

I assisted during one procedure today. And it went well. My preceptor has twenty years of experience in GI and I can tell she's not aware of some best practices, but she's a wonderful lady with 4 grandkids and high energy. I can appreciate that she knows what she's doing. And has the answers to my simple questions. I'll actually be working at 3 different locations for this hospital system, but I'll get comfortable with hospital #1 before I move to #2 then #3.

I also was given a few checklists to complete. One was computer education, which I completed entirely. Long story short, I had a great first day!!"
I did it guys.,I talked to a girl and actually got her number. As someone with sever anxiety and depression I finally did it. She even called me cute and complimented me on my hair. For the first time in a long time I feel something.
I want to sleep so I don't have to be awake yet also sad because it'll make tomorrow arrive sooner,"I want to be asleep so I don't have to feel the crushing emptiness, to escape the painful loneliness and to have some relief from feeling lost. I'll snuggle up with my teddy bears as best as I can and try and sleep.... though what's the point if it makes tomorrow arrive sooner? Tomorrow... another day of feeling like this. Another day of feeling like this. Then another and another.

EDIT: thank you so much for all your responses and insight, I appreciate it."
"plenty of people have told me ""I'm here if you need to talk"" yet I'm sitting here and I can't think of anybody I'd be comfortable taking to at the moment.",that includes random online people.  not fishing for attention. 
Did you ever feel like your depression is fake?,Did any of you ever thought about you depression beeing fake and you just make it up to get attention? Or am i the only one feeling like that
I understand now what my neighbor said to me years back,"he's 5 years older than me, i remember it was like summer of 2013 and i just started dodging social events, i remember one day binging season 6 of how i met your mother while all of my friends(back when i had any) were outside playing football and messing around the entire day,

i heard rumors that my neighbor failed to join the army at 20 and how he got depressed, he shut himself completely, played world of warcraft for 3 years straight, got fat, worked a job he hated, spent most of his free time drinking and doing nothing, didn't leave hometown in over 4 years, 

he overheard how i'm being anti social, depressed, indecisive and shit, we had couple of ""talks"" on his porch, he tried to put some reason into me but i was just a dumb 18 year old, one of the last times we spoke he told me something like this: 

*you can't possibly understand now, but you will see it in couple of years if you become like me, how stupid you'll feel waking up one day to realize how everyone around you has left, moved on and you are still in the same spot you were years ago... if you sit in your room and jerk off on computer all day long nothing will happen to you, ever, but it takes you years to truly realize that*

i always found it funny how he's giving me advices and shit but he is fucked up himself, it's ironic how i'm exactly like him right now, soon to be 23, unemployed for 8 months, exhausted from social anxiety and depression, i spend most of the time inside on pc, watching my friends on social media being happy and having such normal lives, big majority of ppl i know has left for jobs or college"
Feeling like I'm faking depression,"I don't know about you guys, but I constantly feel like I'm just a lazy piece of shit, and not somebody with depression.

Doesn't matter how many suicidal thoughts I have... Nah, just a lazy shitbag who doesn't give a fuck about their degree and spends hours a day on League of Legends. 

That's me. It's great. Especially when it's backed up by your parents complaining that you don't actually study. "
Does anyone just want to move away and never look back? Just disappear from your current existing life,"And start over, fresh? I feel like I have the bigger desire to change my number, move to another side of the world and just live my life there.  I feel like I’m so done with my life and where it is. "
"For anyone going through a break up, here's a quote from South Park (of all places) that helped me a lot.",
I am so lonely,"Does anyone ever have that feeling of ""I want to go home"" but home isn't your old house or your family or a time in your life before . It's a feeling that you miss but you don't actually have anymore. "
I made my bed,Guys I know this might be stupid.  But I finally was able to make my bed. Like I mean having sheets on it and stuff. I know otherwise it's gross. This is really big for me. I final didn't feel like it was useless to do. Sorry. I'm gross. But I'm actually proud. (Wish it didn't happen at 3:30 am because I can't sleep but oh well I got a burst of energy so I did it.) I'm feeling tired now but I hope this boost will stay tomorrow to clean other things.  Sorry if this sounds stupid.
tfw you cannot function and have an intense fear of failure so you skip all your classes and spend your days in bed hoping for some kind of miracle,I want to die.
You know you're depressed when...,"* You sleep 4 hours some nights and 16 hours others. 
* The grocery store is right across the street but you just can't get over there to buy food. 
* You need a dedicated blanket for your couch for those times when you just can't get up. 
* You run out of clothes to wear because you just can't make yourself do the laundry. 
* Dirty dishes pile up in the sink even when you do manage to run the dishwasher, because ypu can't manage to unload it. 
* You come home from work and just lay down on the couch because you have no energy to do anything. 
* If you're unemployed like me, same, but as soon as you wake up. 
* Sometimes you do make it out of bed, and onto the floor. The door is just too far away. 
* You buy books, games, etc. and they sit on your shelf because you don't have the energy to read them. 
* You regularly go days without leaving your apartment. 
* You get a solid 8-9 hours of sleep and still feel exhausted. 
* You think of things you normally like to do, and just don't care to actually do them. When you do, you just get bored and don't get any enjoyment from it. 
* You hear the phone ring and just can't be bothered to get up and answer it. 
* You try as hard as you can to think positively, but everything just feels dull and grey. 
* When you do ""well"" you just feel apathetic and that you only did what was expected of you. 
* Your goal in life is to minimize suffering instead of maximizing enjoyment. 
* You'd be okay if one day you fell asleep and just didn't wake up, even if you don't actually want to kill yourself. 
* Everything in life just feels like a burden. Even eating. 
* You can't remember a time in life where you truly felt happy. Moments of pleasure are scarce and fleeting. 
* You don't take vacation days because there's nowhere you want to go. 
* You hate being around happy people because it just reminds you of how bad you feel. 
* You take antidepressants and see a therapist and it doesn't really help. "
"Does anyone else feel like you want people to care but when they do, you feel embarrassed and try to act like everything's okay?",I don't know why I do this. I don't like appearing vulnerable I guess? Or maybe because my mind's so messed up they wouldn't be able to help me anyway and it's daunting to explain everything.
Depression in its simplest form.,
Does anyone else feel “casually suicidal”?,"I’ve been dealing with depression for almost 8 years now. I’ve had good times, sometimes they’ll last as long as a year, but it always comes back.

I’ve reached a point where I know I’m too much of a coward to just kill myself. And I feel like if I did people would just say even more terrible things about me when I can’t defend myself...

So I call myself “casually suicidal”... I can’t bring myself to actually slide that razor... but if I just so happen to die in a freak accident... if I “forget” to look both ways... if I happen to end up in a dangerous situation... oh well... just does the work for me.

I fall asleep at night just thinking “I want to die I hope I die” in the hopes that if I think t hard enough maybe my heart will just stop while I’m sleeping and no one will be the wiser.

Does anyone else feel like this?"
When I say 'I'm tired'..,"I don't just mean because I haven't slept, although sometimes that is the case. 

What I really mean is I'm tired of fighting. I'm tired of feeling worthless and useless. I'm tired of trying so fucking hard and it still not being enough. I'm tired of getting up again. I'm tired of lying. I'm tired of people taking advantage. I'm tired of people not understanding. I'm tired of the pain. I'm tired of surviving. I'm tired of existing. I'm so goddamn tired"
"Does anyone else have unprovoked, ""casual"" suicidal thoughts?","I'm posting this here because I don't really know where else to put it. I noticed the sidebar link to SuicideWatch, but it didn't feel right to start a thread there among all the other people who really need help. 

Since I was a teenager I've had ""casual"" suicidal thoughts. I don't mean to trivialize suicidal thoughts when I say that, I literally mean casual; like, maybe you're driving home, everything is pretty much fine, then out of nowhere you go ""I made a small mistake at work today, I should just drive into that concrete barrier"" Or I'll be hanging out at home, maybe watching TV or something, and think ""you know, you wouldn't have to deal with anything anymore if you just shot yourself in the head."" I don't think there's ever really intent, the thoughts just come. And what's kind of disturbing is that the thoughts are almost comforting for a second, kind of like ""yeah, I guess that /is/ an option!""

This has been normal for me for so long, every day for years, but recently I've been thinking about how fucked up it is. And I feel alone because it's like you can't tell anybody about it or else they'll immediately go into call-the-cops freakout mode. 

I just had to get this off my chest. It's difficult to have these cavalier thoughts and feel like a freak on top of keeping a lid on the depression/anxiety/""imposter syndrome"" to seem normal every day. "
I neglect studying for school because of my lack of motivation and my depression,"I have so much to do. Like, VERY much. But every time I say to myself ""I should really do something for school now"" I always find something to distract myself with for, example playing videogames or watching videos.

Even when I try to study, as soon as I don't understand a single task (especially in math, my worst subject), I get such frustrated that I (rage) quit and leave it unfinished.
Anyone else struggling with that? :(


Thanks to all of you, this sub is such a great place to vent and seeing other people having similiar problems to which they can relate. This makes me feel less lonely."
Does anyone else feel like they don't exist in anyone elses mind unless you're standing right in front of them?,"I can't imagine anyone even thinking of me, even for a brief second, when I'm not in the room. All my life I've been forgotten and invisible. No wonder I'm so depressed."
I can't kill myself because I'll cause grief to others. Atleast this way I'm the only one who's suffering.,
So it's a Sunday morning and I'm going to go to a coffee shop on my own,"For no particular reason. 

Just as a baby step, going outside, enjoying myself **for myself**. I've forgotten how to do this. Let's re-try for hundredth time."
"I hate when people say ""if you're having depressed/suicidal thoughts, reach out and talk to someone!""","Ok, done. They said the same old platitudes that everyone has heard a million times. ""It gets better"" ""take it day by day"" ""lots of people care about you"" etc. 

So now that they know an embarrassing and vulnerable fact about me, what have I gained? Do I feel better? Are they going to have any insight or advice that I haven't already learned? Ha, no. At best they have sympathy for me (which I don't want), and at worst they will be uncomfortable and not want to interact with me anymore (this happened with 3 different friends before I finally learned my lesson).

I mean, perhaps that helps for people with very mild or temporary depression. And that's fine and all, but it's pretty discouraging when the advice literally begins and ends with ""talk to someone."" If you say ""yeah so I tried that..."" they'll just throw their hands up and tell you to use drugs. 

Or just say ""hang in there!"" Hang in there, huh? Just a few more decades and you'll die naturally :) Hang in there, every day is a living hell with no respite from the emotional numbness/pain, but do it anyway :) Depression causes you to be a worthless failure because you don't have the motivation to further your career or social life, but hang in there as a complete loser!

Then of course the natural progression beyond 'someone' is a 'therapist.' ""Talk to a therapist and get help."" Ok, let me just pull money out of my ass, and pay hundreds of dollars for someone who probably won't be able to do shit for me anyway. But that's another story..."
Does anyone else not remember the majority of their childhood?,For me I had a pretty traumatic childhood. I don’t remember most of it except for some of the really bad things. It feels like my brain just blocked everything to protect me or something.
Does anyone else procrastinate to a ridiculous degree?,"So I procrastinate far *far* too much. Absolutely nothing motivates me to do work any more. Nothing at all. Back in high school I was a pretty good student. I got all my work done on time, literally never missed an assignment etc. But in college, I just can't bring myself to do anything. 

I have a huge project that needs to be completed and the idea was that we'd do a few weeks of work in class and the rest at home. Ever since the class sessions ended, I haven't even looked at it. And it was due to be finished 2 weeks ago. I open the file, look at it for a couple of minutes and then put it away. In part, it is because I find it incredibly difficult (and yes, I have asked for help but none of it made it any easier for me) but it's also because I've pretty much just fallen into a pit of inescapable procrastination. I wake up way too late, stay in bed for at least an hour after waking up, sit around playing video games, glance at my work, play more video games and then go back to bed. For god's sake, I even put off making this post for a week.

Is anyone else like this? It's slowly destroying my grades right now and the longer it goes on, the harder it's going to be to get out of this complete mess that my life is at the moment."
Does anyone else feel like there getting stupider?,I have had anxiety and depression for a really long time and recently I've been thinking that I might have lost at least some of my mental capacity and I was just wondering if anyone felt the same or had anything to contribute to the thought.
My girlfriend took her own life today. I don't know how to handle this.,"She texted me to say good bye while I was gone for a couple hours today. I was busy and didn't even see the message for 30 minutes. She was gone by the time I got back home. She had been fighting depression and I guess she lost. I called friends and family for support right after 911. They've been with me all day, but now that everyone is sleeping, I can't. The image of her hanging there will haunt me until my dying days. That was my baby, my better half. Falling asleep without her at my side just feels wrong. There's a huge hole in me and I don't know what to do or how to handle it. I just cry, I've been crying since 3pm. My face hurts, hell, my whole body hurts. To anyone that has lost their love, how did you handle it? What gave you the will to want to go another day? Or anyone that just wants to talk, keep my mind off that image. Not suicidal though, couldn't imagine putting someone through what I'm feeling.

Thanks for the kind wishes everyone. The xanax has finally kicked, in chest isnt hurting so much and I'm cross-eyed.hopefully be able to get some sleep. Can't take any more tonight.

I was able to get a few hours of sleep this morning from the xanax. Spent today with friends keeping me busy, I haven't cared about any of it. I've been out of it, just following them around, nothing matters to me anymore. I know the sun shown today, but I didnt notice it. I've caught myself pulling out in traffic without looking, not on purpose now but it has happened a couple of times. Not sure why, I guess it just doesn't matter to me anymore. I'm gonna quit driving for now. My school friend said our college has grief counseling. I will be going there in the morning. I knoweveryone is trying their best to help me, but I'm just cold. Cold and hurting and it seems to be getting worse. Tonight will be rough again. 

Everyone is sleeping again and I've taken my xanax so I apologize for spelling errors and  whatnot. Just wanted to give some back story. Beyond an abusive family she had, gang raped, losing her son 3 years ago today, losing her mother to suicide 2 years ago today. She was the most compassionate person to me. She had tried this before before we met. We didn't find, never did. Once when I did get upset with her, I caught her heating up a lighter tip and buring.her self eith. I'll finish this in the morminf

It's night time again, this is starting to feel like a journal. I want to thank everyone for their kind words and support, being able to read your encouragements and relatable stories  throughout my day has helped, more than I can express in text. Today has been one fucking hard day to put it lightly. I got some answers to my questions on why what happened did happen and that only raised more questions. I'll give an censored cliff note version to keep from airing her dirty laundry in the public, but I think its important for me to write this down. And I apologize from typing errors too, been doing this on my phone as my computer is still in the apartment. My gf wasn't from here, I never met or talked to any of her family. I didn't even know their names. She told me that there was a really bad childhood for her and that she had lost 2 children  with her husband years back. So I never asked questions, I just listened when she felt like she needed to talk about it. Eventually, she finally told me there was a younger 3rd child that was still alive with the now ex husband. She said they divorced when the children died, on Oct 15. Fast forward a year, her mother took her own life on Oct 15 for the guilt of feeling responsible. That was 2 years ago.we started dating in no November of last year. She started seeing a therapist for the past 3 months this year that was a very nice lady that she trusted. Well then her incident occurs from the guilt and grief, she blamed her self for those deaths which was completely unwarranted. The coroner had no idea of how to get in touch with family, so that's been my goal since then. I got in touch with the ex husband and an old close friend of hers from back then. I wasn't prepared for theinfo they had about her. The reason shed been crying and putting herself through hell, didn't exist. Well her mom was gone but not for what I was told. There was only two sons and they were both alive, she basically drove off one day and never came back. That was a few months before we met. She liveds those lies for the year everyone kew her here. I talked to her therapist and she was just blown away. All we can figure was that she was so much more mentally dustrurbed than any of us had any idea. Therapist figures she was delusional, maybe borderline schizo. There was really nothing we could've done to help her given the info we didn't know, it was like throwing a bucket of water on a house fire. Id here her talking to herself, but now I'm not sure that she wasn't just having conversations with someone she thought that was there. She would tell me about her conversations shed been having with her old friends that she was able to get in touch with, that really haven't heard from her in over a year. It's just so much to process. Shed actually be excited that she got to talk to them. She believed her delusion so strongly, no one had a reason to doubt it. This just makes things clearer and so much more sad.

12/03/2012: I am doing much better everyone. I thank you all for you thoughts and concerns. Life has gotten easier as time is passing on for the most part. The only lingering effects is the last image of her, every time something remind me of her my mind goes straight to that. That happens quite a bit, but hopefully that will pass as the other pain has. To those that have messaged me saying how much this has helped them, it really means a lot to me. I am glad some good could have come from this at least. If anyone needs to talk, please feel free to message me."
Do you guys ever have random short bursts of crying that only last for a few seconds.,It happens to me when I watch TV or listen to music. 
My Wife Killed Herself Last Week.,"About a week ago my wife left the apartment, bought a gun, drove somewhere secluded, pulled over and shot herself. I have been with her since 2007 when we were still in high school. We became adults together.

I have always had mildish depression and anxiety, but she has always had major depression and suicidal ideation. It just kept getting worse and worse. She tried all sorts of medications, therapy (including DBT). She had a partial diagnosis for BPD as well.

I'm not even exactly sure why I am posting here other than to vent a bit. I see a regular therapist and have an appointment monday. I am also on an SSRI already, so I am taking the proper steps. I just am so beside myself. I always knew it would happen. She told me it would and that there was no way to change it. I lived in constant fear and anxiety that she would have a breakdown or even kill herself. I had to make so many excuses for her to my family throughout the years. I could always tell they disproved (even if only a little bit) of me putting so much effort into her. I think they better understand now.

I do not mean to be dramatic, but I feel like, even though I do not regret being with her, it has tormented me in a deep, possibility irreversible way. I know she never meant to harm me and it was the depressed train of thinking she had, but only about a week before she killed herself, I finally got her to admit what I suspected for a long time. She was distancing herself from me for 8 months in order to soften the blow of her suicide. For 8 months at least, she was purposefully distant, did not even try to console me when the situation became too hard for me. I felt so alone. I hate myself for being just a bit relieved that she is dead, because the pain of seeing her suffer was so unimaginably hard to bear.

I feel so angry at her parents, especially her mom, for always putting her down. Making her feel worthless. Her mother is the literal worst person I know. She always acted as if she supported her daughter in everything she did when out in public, but in private she shit on everything she did. My wife was literally a genius at least according to the IQ tests the doctors gave her when diagnosing her mental illnesses. She was an incredible artist who painted, drew, sewed, wood burned, and a shit ton of other things. Anything art, she could do. And her parents hated that, because she did not want to join the Navy like them or go into business. She wanted to teach and almost achieved her dreams before the depression worsened to the point that she quit school and work.

I just wish could have been different for her. All she ever wanted to do was help people and make the world better. I just want to sit on my ass and play video games. Why here and not me. I work in corrections and see a bunch of scum everyday who love the fuck out of themselves. Why not them. She never hurt a god damn soul.

Edit: A name.

Edit 2: I just want everyone to know that I was hesitant about even posting anything about my situation, but I am glad that I did because it has been very therapeutic. I only have two people in my life that really understand depression and how it affect one's thoughts, feeling and beliefs. Most of the people in my life just do not have the ability to comprehend what happened and I am both glad and deeply saddened that the people here do. So thank you everyone.

Edit 3: Thank you kind stranger for the gold. I think I know who is was, but I will just leave it at that.

Edit 4: Just a few photos of my wife's art.

Do you ever worry that you've been depressed for so long that you don't know how not to be depressed?,"If that makes sense? Even when I'm not feeling so down I still don't do anything like go out and see friends. It's almost as if being depressed has become an ingrained habit and I don't know how to break out of it. 

If I was magically cured of depression I'm not sure that anything would actually change because I'm so used to seeing no one and doing nothing. 

Does anyone else feel like that? "
"My therapist was like ""fake it 'till you make it..."" I actually was pissed. What the fuck do you think I'm doing? I'm faking it every day. I pretend to care at work, with friends, at the grocery store, etc. I'm sick of having a fake smile on my face.","I've been trying to do things that interest me, and even that's not working. I 'want' to put a new fender on my car, bought it, removed the old one, and don't care enough to finish. 

I've been embarrassed driving the car as is, but can't care enough to just do it. I don't care about work, eating, exercising, watching a movie, doing something online, etc. I just don't care. 

And it sucks. My life is stagnant and I wish I could move forward... 

&#x200B;"
"The moment I wake up, I'm already looking forward to going back to bed that night.",Wish I could just sleep for 16 hours a day and dream whatever the fuck I want to.
Does anyone pretend to sleep to hide from being social?,It takes so much energy just to socialize and put on a fake smile.
"I'm almost 24, and have completely wasted the past 5-6 years of my life. I'm in such a dark place and don't know what to do.","Hi there, I'm a 23 year old male who turns 24 in August. I have been struggling with depression for a few years now, and it's all coming to a sort of unbearable boiling point. I have completely, entirely wasted the 18-23 phase of my life, and I'm completely devastated about it.

If you'll excuse this, I'm going to allow myself to be dramatic and expressive in this post. I just need to get this out, throw it out in the world and see if anyone can help me. 

Honestly, I can say I've struggled with this all my life, but it's been more severe since 18. All I did in my younger years was play video games. I didn't learn a skill that would blossom into a career, I didn't grow into a man. I stayed a child, and I am a child now. In high school, all I did was waste my potential and genuine ability so I could play games and not have to think about responsibility. My senior year I didn't even apply for a college. I graduated and went to a community college even though I didn't know why I was there. 

From that point, all I did was aimlessly fail school for 3 years (18-21), meet a toxic girl (first love) that broke my heart after a 6 month relationship (21-almost 22), and instead of being a strong person and pushing through the heartbreak, I then let that heartbreak tumble into a toxic rut of depression that lasted for a year, where I left school and did absolutely nothing but work an unsustainable job (delivery driver with my own car that is now almost used up), lay around, and put on 50 pounds. Once that depressive period related to my ex was over, I realized with shock that I had done absolutely nothing during that time and failed an opportunity to gain inner strength. So what did I do? Did I snap out of it and start climbing upward? No. I was so horrified, and I slid into an even darker, existential depression that has lasted up to current day and is reaching a boiling point. 

The ""good"" news is that after three semesters of just laying around (not even using the time off to do something adventurous or awesome), I started back into school this spring, and though my GPA is shit from my earlier failings, I will almost surely finish with A's in both my two classes this semester. I still have no idea what I want to do long-term, but I'm ok with that. 

What I'm realizing now is sort of an exponentially increased version of what I realized after my first rut. I now realize that not only have I done nothing with my recent time, but I've done nothing during the entire 18-23 period of my life but wallow, and I will never be able to do it over. I'm almost 24, and I'm starting to feel my perception of time speed up. This is quite honestly making me panic severely. I feel like I'm going to blink and be 40, then blink again and be 70. I don't really know what to say. I feel so up against it. I could have spent the last 5 years actually finding myself, or traveling, backpacking, adventuring. At the very least I could have been responsible and had my B.S by now, and NOW I could be adventurous for a period before getting a job or going to grad school.

But now I won't finish my degree until I'm 26 or 27, and I could be 33 before I'm done if I want to pursue further education. I see people who are 18, 19, 20 and going on adventures, taking advantage of that time. People I know. And it makes me sob inside. 

I feel that there is some neoteny going on here. The thought of the magic of childhood ending has always been too much for me to think about. I feel that these years are a result of this. I was terrified to grow up. Now I'm at the age where I'm on the roller coaster of adult time with or without my permission, and I wasted those precious, fun transition years.

I wish I had done SOMETHING responsible in the past 6 years. I wish  I had worked hard, maybe learned a trade in my teens so I could have moved out, felt secure, and pursued a fulfilling career with my feet under me. I can't bear the weight of the situation I've put myself into. I can't even think about it straight enough to organize this post. The only responsible thing I've done is pay off 2k in debt last year. That's it.

My parents look at me with this look in their eyes. Like they're thinking, ""what is he doing with his life?"", that they can sense the personal Hell I've boxed myself up in. The reality of this is so damn final. 

Every time I watch a movie, I have this sort of sorrowful pang in my heart as I watch the heroism of the characters. Spiderman made me long to be 18 and start my youthful adult adventure, but do it right this time. Even about my childhood, I feel the same way. If I see a character in a movie being taught by his father to be a self-sufficient man, it makes me desperately wish I had spent my youth building skills, or learning self-sufficiency instead of gaming and ... gaming.

I just don't know what to do. My heart BEGS to have another chance, and I of course know that's an impossibility, so I feel paralyzed by finality. 

This part about my time perception speeding me up is what really  started this boiling point. I'm cracking under the weight of it. I want to grow into being a man, learn skills, become secure and self-sufficient, go on adventures, have a period of joyful expression and free adventure before I have to walk into the monotony of adulthood. But now, even if I do these things, I'll push my degree off even further, or my bank account even lower, and I'll be in my 30's before I even get to where most people are at my current age. 

I don't know what to do. I don't know what I should do. I don't even really know what I want to do. I don't want to be 24. I don't want to have this weight on me. I want to take this darkness and use it to make me stronger, wiser, more experienced, self-sufficient, mature in the truest sense of the word. I want to experience a full 50-60-70 more years, not a cheapened, sped up version that only feels 20 youthful years. I just want to conquer this, and finally experience fulfillment, adventure and joy."
"I was severely depressed during my teen years and at some point I was happy. During that time I would think back and I couldn't believe or understand how I was ever that depressed. Now that i'm depressed again, I don't believe or understand how I was ever happy.",
I bet al lot of you are like this aswell as me. ,
"When the little voice says ""I want to die""","I force myself to replace it with ""I want to try"". I don't know if it's working, but I'm still here."
Anyone feel depressed because they just don't care about life anymore? That to do anything at all is exhausting mentally and physically,"I have lost the drive to get through life and care about what happens to me and that makes me depressed.  I have been medicated and see a therapist but nothing is working. I also have friends and family that care deeply for me.  But that almost makes it worse, they're caring for someone whose ability to care about anything is broken. Its as if I am a black hole and their caring is matter that just disappears when it reaches me.
 There isn't really anything I enjoy and just existing is overwhelming.  And I am no longer young anymore (I am 34) so it feels like time is running out.  What is the point of living if I see no point in it?  I am alive because killing myself would devistate my mom and others that care about me, but is that really worth it? Existing just to please others while feeling no pleasure and mostly pain?  "
I feel like a background character in everybody else’s life,"I never go anywhere, always look the same, don’t do anything interesting or have any goals. It’s been this way for as long as I can remember and I know it won’t change. "
"I decided to ""come out of the closet"" about suicidal depression on Facebook when Robin Williams died. It went better than I thought it would. My friends were extremely supportive. This is what I posted.","Hey, friends! Today I want to talk about suicidal depression. Every time there's a big suicide in the news, I see a lot of conversation that makes me concerned. It seems like depression is a problem that lots of people don't understand very well. I'm sorry this is so long, but it's an issue that's very close to me. 

I see people say things like ""It was the coward's way out"" or ""he threw it all away over nothing."" You should understand that depression is extremely real to people who are struggling with it. It's an illness. Your brain isn't working properly, the same way a broken limb doesn't work properly. Instead of being unable to walk, you're unable to process positive feelings. You're constantly in a state of sadness, or anger, or fear, or self-loathing. This is a lifelong condition for many people. You can develop coping strategies, but there's no real ""cure"" or universal answer. If that imagery is not helpful, it's like having goblins in your brain. It's like fighting an enemy every single day that you can't see who makes it impossible for you to be happy. It doesn't matter that you have all these nice things and people who love you, because you physically can't enjoy them or anything else. That's a really hard way to live. It hurts me when I hear people with depression described as ""weak."" They have to be strong and brave everyday, just to leave their house or have social interactions. These are people fighting a war that makes it difficult or painful to do very basic things. It is tragic when someone dies fighting that battle, but it is not shameful. 

The second thing I want to talk about is dismissive solutions. I LOVE that treatment for mental illness is becoming more socially acceptable. However, it seems like some people think the conversation ends at ""Get help."" ""If only he had gotten help!"" ""Why didn't he get help?"" ""Why didn't he dial H-E-L-P on the phone so the Helpers in the Help Van could take him to the Helpatorium?"" It is absolutely important to tell people ""get help."" It is sometimes a little patronizing when it's coming from people who don't understand how hard that is. I've seen this taken to a very nasty place, where people say things like ""it's his fault for not getting help. Why should I have sympathy?"" If you're struggling with depression, I want to stress that seeking help absolutely should be the most important thing in your life after basic survival necessities. If you've never struggled with depression, I want to stress that seeking help can be MUCH harder than you think it is. 

I have struggled with suicidal depression for most of my adult life. I called the suicide hotline back when I was delivering pizzas. It is not a magical fix-everything service. They told me their nearest facility was further away than I could afford to drive on my gas budget. I've tried talking about depression to most of my friends. I'm fortunate to have some great people in my life, but I've lost a lot of relationships because I was open about depression. There are people who don't understand, and they get angry at you when their misguided attempts to help don't work. There are people who just slowly back out of your life because talking to you makes them sad or uncomfortable. I don't blame these people. It is very difficult to deal with someone else's depression. That's nobody's fault, but it makes depression very isolating. I've tried to get professional help many times. I've had doctors who were helpful, but we couldn't afford them. I've had doctors who were unhelpful and made things worse. I've been put on medications that made me better for a little while. I've been put on medications that messed me up so badly I couldn't leave my house and had to switch high schools. This is not even getting into how hard it can be emotionally to seek treatment. You have to be able to admit your deepest problems to yourself, and talk about them articulately with total strangers. I don't know a lot of people who can do that, even without depression. It is very difficult to seek any sort of treatment at all when you honestly don't like yourself and don't believe you deserve to get better. I'm not telling this as a sob story to try and garner sympathy. I just want people to understand that everybody struggling with depression has stories like this. We almost never talk about them because we are trying to pretend to be normal.

I hate when posts like this are all criticism, so I'll try to leave with something helpful. You have so much more power than you think you do to help another person. Even when you don't feel like you're making a difference, the smallest acts of kindness can really touch people in unexpected ways. You probably don't understand depression. That is okay! We appreciate it when you are honest about not understanding. We're sick of people telling us they understand when they don't. You don't have to understand. You just have to believe us. "
"I swear. Every time I feel positive and im talking happily and feel okay, someone says something or replies to me in a way that takes my smile away immediately.","Out of the very few times i have the energy to speak and suggest positive happy things, shut down. I feel my body's emotion literally shift. i get lethargic, my smile immediately fades and i don't speak the rest of the day. The out of my stomach drops and my chest begins to form that empty feeling.

It sucks. I hate this feeling, what's the point in being positive or telling me to be if you're the one that won't even acknowledge me while im speaking as well or reply rude or curt or short when I thought we were having a good time and im just talking about stuff i like or want to do.

It hurts."
I can go an entire day without talking to another human being.,"I’m 22, senior in college, and some days I’m in up to four classes. If I don’t have to work that day, work requires me to talk, I can go through the entire day with having little to no interaction with another human. No one texts me throughout the day, no one talks to me before or after classes, and I feel as though no one even looks at me when I walk down the street, Beyond the cashier at the cafe telling me my coffee and donut is $3, I feel as though I don’t exist. I’m not suicidal but that doesn’t mean the thought that if I’d I disappear the entire world would continue moving without noticing hasn’t graced my mind. 

To complicate things I’ve even walked by friends, best of friends, without them noticing me or saying hi, even if I make an attempt to. I try to just enjoy my walk but being surrounded by so many people makes me feel claustrophobic. 

Today in particular I decided to dress nicer, maybe I’d get someone to notice me. I wore something my ex-gf had always thought I looked handsome in. The painful reality is that I felt even more alone today, more distant from the entire society of college that I wanted to run as far as I could away from it.

People are always telling me that “if you want to make friends or meet a girl, you have to be the one to make that first conversation” but if that’s the case why isn’t any ever trying to make that conversation with me. 

Thank-you for noticing me today. "
Why am I so fucking tired all the time?,"Everyday is so monotonous and I have trouble doing the simplest things. Everyone says it's going to get better, but I'm just getting more and more tired of all of this. "
I Feel So Silly Getting Sad Over Downvotes.,"I thought this was my safe place. An accepting place.

Now I'm not sure where to go.

I feel so alone."
It hurts to exist.,"Don't get me wrong, I'm not suicidal. I'm far too cowardly to actually kill myself. I'm just tired of existing. I just wish there was some way I could just stop existing, without actually having to kill myself. I'm sad all the time, and I'm sick of it. I'm sick of pretending to be okay, because if I don't then I get accused of attention seeking. I can't stand being alive anymore. I'm tired, mentally and physically, and I don't know how to handle it anymore.

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone who commented with advice and offers to listen. It means so much to me and, I'm sure, so many others who feel the same way. To all those who commented saying they relate and talking about feeling suicidal, I'm not a certified therapist, but I'm willing to listen if you want to talk about it. I'm just a PM away to anyone who wants to talk. I'll listen. Thank you all for making me feel less alone, and slightly more normal for a while."
"My girlfriend dumped me, my best friend killed himself, my parents are getting divorced, and I lost my job.","I pretty much don't know where to go at this point. I keep telling myself things could always be worse and then things actually get worse and so I just repeat that phrase ad infinitum. Lately it seems like the big man upstairs has it out for me.

Edit: holy butts this blew up. I'm overwhelmed with all the love people are showing. I'll try and answer all of you."

no one asks me to call them when i get home 

no one cares enough to tell me, ""no, not another drink""

my mom would rather spend time with my brother and my dad loves my sister more than life itself

i am no one's best friend, i am not the love of anyone's life, i'm not anyone's favorite student. i'm not anyone's person. people care about me, sure, but i'm no one's favorite. there is not a single person that values me above all the rest and that hurts. 

i'm just another friend, another face to blend into the crowd. i'm no one special or important and it makes me want to cry. i'm not my best friend's best friend. i'm not my favorite professor's favorite. i'm not my person's person and it's fucking miserable. 

edit: i am so surprised by the number of responses. i had no idea that other people felt this way and, while i think we can all agree that feeling this way sucks, i'm glad that i could be a source of resonance for some people. and hey, fuck the world, let's be each other's favorite person. "
Being depressed is bad. Feeling guilty about being depressed is the fucking worst.,"Anyone else feel like it's not even the anxiety, isolation, lack of interest etc. that feels the worst, it's the sense that nothing sufficiently bad has happened to you to make you feel like you *earned* being depressed? I remember at one of my lowest points a few years ago not wanting to call the hotline because I thought they would tell me it was reserved for people with *real* problems, of which I had none. I just feel absolutely awful wasting away all of the time, energy, and money my family poured into me over the years when I feel depressed when I can't point to anything specific that's causing it. Makes me feel weak, like I should just be able to snap out of it, and when I don't, the guilt multiplies how bad I feel."
I don't want to kill myself. I just want to stop existing.,"I could never kill myself. I don't know if it's because I'm too afraid or because I care too much about my loved ones. I don't want to commit suicide, I just want to go to sleep forever. I don't want it to be anyone's fault when I stop living. I just want to pass away, I just don't want to have to do anything anymore, I don't want to live in this circle of feeling pain and feeling empty anymore. Why is my heart so motivated to keep beating? Why can't it be like me, or I like it?

EDIT: Thank you for all your responses, experiences and thoughts. I didn't expect so many people to feel the same way, and it's a good feeling knowing that I'm not alone with these thoughts."
"Mathematically, it isn't worth being alive.","If you live a banal life, you work for around 8 hours everyday. If you enter the time wasted getting to work (for me anyway) it's 2 more hours. It means that approximately 41% of your day is spent wasting your life away at a dead-end job. This isn't even including sleeping. If you sleep between 6 and 8 hours, it's 25% or 33% of you day gone too, leaving you with about 26% of free time everyday. In this time you need to shower, eat and go to the toilet so it's even less than that.

&#x200B;

I don't have any friends or lover. I don't really have anything I'm really passionate about so even the tiny fraction of daily free time I have is just spent trying to escape boredom.

I won't kill myself because I don't want to bother my family members, but man, living is just a gigantic pain in the ass. I don't even think I'm depressed anymore, I just don't see a point in living, it's too much effort for me. I just want to wither away."
Dad died. No family left. Slowly drowning in bills and debt. Now I'm the sole provider for a household and I'm about to have a complete mental breakdown [29/M],"I really need some help.

Last year my Dad died from a spontaneous heart attack at the age of 66.  Zero warning.  One minute we're just talking about seeing a movie the next weekend, and the next morning the coroner woke me up pounding on the door saying he dropped dead in his truck two blocks from the house on the way to work.

Ironically, he was in great shape and we worked out every weekend.  He didn't smoke or drink and his doctor said he had the fitness of someone half his age.  He was the pinnacle of health at that age, and this happens somehow.

He was my only family and I'd been living with him for a few years after graduating college.  I'm one of those ""probably borderline autistic, zero social life"" kind of weirdos, who was in a position where his Dad told me I could just live with him, work my job, and spend free time working on my passion, which was writing soundtrack music.

In an instant my whole world - the only person who ever mattered - was ripped away from me.  The tiny life insurance dried up in a year after settling the estate and his debts and the funeral, and I'm sitting here in my office right now just about ready to scream uncontrollably.

There are so many bills, so so many bills, and my job can barely cover them.  My fiancee has been out of work for two years due to an injury and I'm supporting both of us, while trying to maintain the house, with no friends or other family to speak of, and it's a battle I'm slowly losing every day.

I don't have any time for myself any more.  I don't have time to exercise, don't have time to clean, don't have time to make music, don't have time to go back to school to get another degree that hopefully pays better than the first because I'm just at the end of my rope.

And above all else I miss my dad, every single day.

The one ""saving grace"" is that I also inherited his retirement account, which ironically he was never able to even touch.  And now I can't touch it until I'm 65 either, and I don't think I'll make it that far.  I honestly worry about being homeless, about having my whole life wasted because I'm so alone with this burden of a room filling with water and I can only take out one tiny bucket at a time.

And I feel locked within my own body and totally unable to do anything.  Some days I go to sleep and honestly hope I never wake up.

I hate this.  I hate everything.  I hate myself and this whole situation and all the people who were so mean to me my whole life, only to end up in a happy place with my Dad and then to have him taken away with no warning, no explanation, and no way to stop.

Every day of my life I want to cry, to breathe, to take a break from all this stress and sadness, and yet I have to get up and drag myself to this office because otherwise my fiancee and I will not be able to survive.

I need a break from all of this, but I can't, because my entire existence is tied to me working and trying to keep my head above water.

I don't know what to do.

**Edit:**  Hey everybody, I just wanted to say thank you for all your insight and thoughtful words.  I ended up going to bed yesterday after a bit of dialogue on this topic and had absolutely no idea this topic would explode the way it has.

I'm going to try to reply to as many people as possible but honestly feel a bit overwhelmed (in a positive way, of course - I've never had so many people actually caring about me).  Just please know that I've read everything you've posted and if I don't get back to you immediately, I genuinely appreciate all of your thoughts and kindness."
Does anyone else have a spotty memory?,"I can't remember who I ran into today. I can't remember three days ago. I can hardly remember anything. If I focus I can bring up certain memories, but it's difficult. I feel like my brain isn't working right."
I just realized there are days when I don't talk to anybody,"Is anybody else in a similar position? I mean, there are days when I just wake up, get food by myself, go to class, study, go to sleep, and the cycle repeats. Days when I don't even say a simple ""Hello"" to even one person. It's not a matter of ignoring people, it's just simply hard for me to connect to the world. "
Today a woman on the train looked at me and smiled and it honestly made my day.,"I know it sounds stupid but it made me happy. I was feeling very sad and you could probably see it on my face. The woman smiled at me and it cheered me up because I was dying inside. Sometimes the little things matter. 

Edit: I wish she knew that she saved my life today because I was close to ending it. Thank you stranger. "
Do you ever just stare at your computer screen and think of how pointless life is?,
I've burnt black a pan full of beans and corn. Fighting the smoke and fire was the best fun I've had in months and I feel totally satisfied.,"After throwing the flaming pan out of the window straight onto the street I've been thinking and developing strategies how to get rid of the smoke and that horrible smell. It's awesome. I'm making herbal mixtures and boiling scent candles in water now. I feel like a shaman.

Anybody else tired everyday no matter how much sleep you get?,

Worst. Advice. Ever. For. Dealing. With. Depression.,
Storms are comforting,I prefer a rainy day over a sunny day. 
the only reason i'm alive is to consume media,"the only thing i ever have to look forward to is playing the next game or seeing the next movie or waiting until the next episode of whatever the fuck

my need for fiction stems from the hope that i can find something to lose myself in for a few hours. maybe a few days.

i don't want to wake up in this world any more"
"Did anybody else have a complete breakdown with crying, shivering, sobbing etc after realizing that you missed your life completely and wasted it?","Been a month or so earlier. It lasted for a week max. It felt like a spear piercing my soul. I've never cried so much. I couldn't even go outside anymore without sunglasses. I often stayed up entire nights.

I wonder if that was mid-life crisis? I'm mid 30."
Does anybody stay up late to have sort of a “second day” that you control,"Every night I stay up as late as I can muster because I know that the second I sleep I have to wake up to the same wash rinse repeat life. I live with 3 other roommates, and once they all fall asleep, and it’s just me, I finally can feel a glimpse of happiness. Whatever I do can’t and won’t hurt anybody (to an extent), so if I were to just die right then and there, no one could stop me. The scariest part is I feel relieved just thinking about it. No matter how hard I try to convince myself not to, the thought just keeps coming back, and it’s gone to the point where the thoughts just don’t stop, and any day at this point might be my last. I’ve attempted suicide but to no use. One of my roommates almost caught me, but he took a right into the bathroom before he saw me attempting to find a knife to slit my wrist. At times I wish he had caught me so I could have someone to talk to, but everything is temporary, so why bother him with needless worry. I have a will ready, my money in an account to divide equally to both family and charity, and next to no wills to live. At first I made all of these things Incase I were to die, but now I realize I made it for when I end myself. I’ve talked to therapist after therapist, but to no avail, pills that don’t work, and friends that just can’t deal with me. The only reason I have roommates is to pay rent so I could afford college. Just writing this makes me relise that whatever this world is, we are all just seconds in the grand scheme of time. If I were to die, all the regret and sorrow cause by me would mean nothing, so if i do end my life, i don’t really feel remorse with anybody I affected. Why worry about me and my death? People die everyday, so don’t single me out because I “touched so many people”. Just get rid of me and move on. Well, that’s all I really have to say, have a good night. Don’t let yourself get as fucked up as me, please enjoy your time here to as much  as you can, cause even though a second is short, sometimes a second is all you need."
Anybody else just spend all day sitting around thinking up conversations that'll never actually happen?,"Like, playing through what you and someone else would say in the event of some unlikely circumstance?

Me neither, haha..."
I took my medicine everyday this week.,"I realized my prescription that has three refills was written on September 9th, 2016. That means in 11 months I took two months worth of medicine.

I love putting the sticker up and seeing how happy it makes her."
I wish depression was all like ‘aesthetic’ like it is on tumblr but what it really is is locking yourself in ur room for days and not eating at all or taking a bath at all. You kinda just stare at the ceiling feeling void wondering why cant u enjoy your life like everyone else,
Battling depression is a skill. Here are some tips that worked for me.,"After battling depression over the last year, I have come to discover some tips that have improved the overall quality of my life. The first, and most important discovery, was a change in the way I perceived happiness. Before my bout with depression, I assumed that happiness was my natural state of mind and that being happy is just inherent. Happiness was my baseline, I didn’t have to do anything, and I just was content. Of course, this all changed once the darkness came creeping in, and eventually my baseline emotional state was grey. Here’s what I discovered; being happy takes effort. Being happy is a skill and needs to be worked on. Thinking that you can magically become happy, or not depressed, without changing any aspect of your life is absurd. Once I got my mind around this concept, I worked on my emotional wellbeing every day. It’s a lot like weight lifting. It takes a lot of effort, it isn’t easy, and it takes a while before you see results. However, it is completely worth it in the end. 
Not everyone will derive joy from the same activities that are pleasant for me, but I will share my experience in the hopes that it helps you out. Here are the simple things I added to my life that helped lift the apathy, sadness and empty dullness I was stuck in: 

1)	**Talking about it.** I got in touch with a counselor and talked about it. We literally just sat in a room and chatted back and forth about my feelings for an hour a week. After a few weeks it really started to help. I was also fortunate to have a very loving and caring SO that put up with me while I battled through the darker times. 

2)	**Putting away the booze.** I don’t think I had a problem with booze, but it wasn’t improving the quality of my life, so I stopped drinking. Made a difference. 

3)	**Exercising. Seriously.** It might sounds cliché, but holy shit does this ever help out. Lifting weights and doing hard cardio was amazing for my mental health. While you are busting your ass in the gym or at home, you leave your problems for a brief amount of time and focus on completing tasks at hand. Lift that fucking weight 7 more times, that’s all I have to do, just lift it. The physical pain and concentration to just do simple body movements, matched the pain I was feeling inside and I was finally able to match my mind and body. Being exhausted physically felt great, and it released endorphins that gave me a much needed boost for hours after a workout. It also helped with my energy levels throughout the day, I was able to feel better and more energetic, which translated into happiness over time. Walk around the block, go for a run, do a few pushups in your room, just do it, get out of breath, push yourself for no reason, feel your body, get in the moment.

4)	**Gardening.** I never planted shit before. On a whim I bought some peat pellets, some hot pepper seeds and a few plastic containers – about a $15 investment. Best money I’ve ever spent. The process of germinating seeds, watering plants, taking care of them, and seeing weekly progress is fantastic. I read up on gardening, visited some subreddits and picked up a new hobby. I live in a tiny apartment in the middle of the city, but I have a window with sunlight and that’s all you need. Having nature around you will make you feel better, get a plant. Grow something. Take care of it, and it will take care of you. Try it out. 

5)	**Meditation.** I still suck at it, but it works. Every morning before work I take 5 minutes for myself. I just sit on the floor in my living room, look out the window and breathe. 20 deep breaths, focusing on the act of breathing. In, out, in, out. Simple. I added stretching into the mix. Stretch, breathe. 5 minutes, not a lot of time, not a lot of effort, but the mental clarity achieved is great. Stop reading this right now, take a deep breath, as deep as you can, and breathe it out. Do it again 2 more times. Try it, right now.

6)	**Vitamins and water.** Omega 3 (fish oil), Vitamin B, Multivitamin, Vitamin D. Take them. Especially the Omega 3 and Vitamin B. After only a couple days of supplementing my nutrition with extra vitamins I noticed a difference in my mood. Drink lots of water. More than you are currently drinking now. It’s not hard, go fill up a glass and drink some water. Plenty of articles out there on the link between proper nutrition levels, hydration and mental health. 

7)	**Daily log and journal.** The world isn’t out to get you, people aren’t out to get you, your problems are not impossible to deal with, but they do need to be addressed. This was hard for me to learn. Pick 1 daily goal. That’s it. What do you want to accomplish today? What completed task would take a little weight off your shoulders? Need to make a phone call? Need to pay a bill? Need to wash your sheets? Once task, one goal, per day. Write it down, that’s important. Write down your goal, and write down if you completed your goal at the end of the day. You might not reach your goal every day, but you need to try. The feeling from accomplishing tasks is great, even the small one, just recognize what needs to be done, make a goal, and try. Do it right now, open up notepad or get a pen and paper, and write down the date and what you’d like to get done today. Big or small. Just try. 

8)	**Small improvements.** Do something small that enhances your hygiene and/or appearance. Get a haircut, trim/shave, paint your nails, shower, wash your face, cut your toenails, brush your teeth, whatever. Do something easy that makes your appearance slightly better. Use some mouthwash; make your breath smell a little better. Doesn’t matter what you do, just make a tiny adjustment, a tiny improvement. Lots of tiny improvements over time make a big difference. Take care of your body, and it will influence your mental state. Look better, feel better, be better. Small, tiny incremental improvements. You will get a boost from completing the task, and overtime this adds up. 

9)	**Understand that it is a journey.** It’s hard. For you, and for me, happiness is not baseline. Our normal, everyday feelings are not happy. That’s ok. You can work towards a better life. Some of the shit that I mentioned above takes 5 minutes. The activities aren’t hard, most are enjoyable, what’s hard is bringing yourself to commit to them. Just fucking try it, please. Pick a couple and try it out. You’re taking a small step to taking back being in charge of your mental wellbeing. Yeah you didn’t choose to be depressed, I know, and probably feel like you have no control over your current state. You can help turn the tides. I went from daily suicidal thoughts, to being able to crack a smile here and there. You owe it to yourself to try. I think you can do it. You’re awesome.  

EDIT: Speaka_Engrish brought up a great point - Just to tag on to number 8, keep your room clean! Make your bed, wash the dishes, don't let little problems pile up; take care of them sooner and eventually it becomes second nature. A clean room is analogous to a clean mind.

EDIT 2: AndNowIKnowWhy made another great suggestion - Find a creative thing you like and maybe are even good at. ""Making"" something can become very meditative and self-asserting. Whether it's drawing or doing something with fabrics, wood, clay, metal, styropor, papermaché, threads or whatnot, it is an alternative form of meditation for people who are not into more common forms of it. 

Just don't do it to create something perfect, but rather to just create for the fun of it. It can be very stimulating and I like to create useful stuff for my household. Just googling the words ""easy diy"" and hit the image search will provide you with tons of ideas of which might be for you. also r/crafts, r/diy and all the other subs linked there might be an inspiration to find the right choice of material for you.

Lonely Scumbag Brain,
Immediately after having a good time with friends I’m sad.,"I can go somewhere with a group of friends, like the mall for example. When at the mall I have a great time, smiling, laughing etc. But then on the car ride home and the rest of the night I just feel sad. I don’t know why but one minute I’m super happy and having fun but the next I’m depressed as all hell and questioning why I’m alive. Am I the only one like this?"
"Not necessarily suicidal, but feel like it would be so much better to just not exist?","Who else feels like this? Where you don't really want to kill yourself, but if you could go back and never be born, you'd jump on the chance..."
Do you ever feel so empty and sad most of the time even while you’re having fun?,Its like there is something holding you back from even enjoying yourself and honestly my insecurities keep messing with me to the point im only focusing on them instead and i have this constant thought that everyone is not genuine with me and its just a lie or the fact that they feel bad for me 
My doctor was crying,About 15 months ago l found a psychiatrist here in michigan. She has multiple couches in her office and gives one hour sessions. She is a throwback as she manages meds and gives therapy at the same time. This is very rare nowadays. She also works on assignment and only accepts medicaires payment as payment in full. Today l was pouring my ❤ out to her and she started crying. I couldnt believe it. She really really cares. This gives me hope in humanity and hope in the medical profession.😀 Just thought ld share.
Some people never have to deal with depression,"It just blows my mind, Ive been depressed since I was about 8, and I feel like I have never been truly happy, and I never will be truly happy. It’s even hard to realize that other people are happy, it seems like we are all just drifting, with no idea what comes next, so in the end what we do doesn’t matter."
I'm genuinely not interested in anything anymore. All my free time is spent feeling immense boredom while trying to want to do something.,"All my free time now is spent being bored and being hyper aware of being bored. Everything I was interested in, I can't muster up the desire to want to do it. Books I wanted to read seem like a chore to read even a paragraph. Podcasts and audiobooks I used to listen to feel like someone reading a textbook. TV shows and movies I could binge over and over again get turned off in 5 minutes, and whenever I try and find something new to watch it feels like anything I see sounds overwhelmingly dull. There's nothing to me anymore. I'm basically just a void."
I just spent the past 15 minutes sobbing in the bathroom at work because it finally hit me that I have no friends,"It’s not their fault, it’s mine. I had tons of friends in high school, we hung out almost every day. I was always over at someone’s house, saving sleepovers, playing games. 

After high school I kept in touch with a few but you separate and move on somewhat right? Made two friends in university, I dropped out after my first semester and just started working, everyday. I was and still am too ashamed to see some people because while they’ve gone on to do good things and good schools and good jobs I’m doing nothing with my life. I’m fatter, stopped caring about my looks, boring, working a dead end job. Every-time someone asked to hangout I said I was already working. Eventually people stop messaging. Eventually people stop caring. 

I just finished up my shift and was scrolling through Instagram after getting changed. I’m alone at work and I’m just waiting for my wet mop patch to dry so I’m just standing around in the bathroom being lazy and waiting. Someone’s picture scrolls by of their birthday celebration, it’s in black and white, they’ve got big silver balloons behind them with their age, they’re dressed up, they’ve got a little tiara on their head, she looks happy and she’s tagged her friends who she’s out with. I knew her in school, not really friends and I’ve seen tons of pictures like that before loads of times, especially on Instagram.  For some reason it just struck me, being happy out with friends, someone’s taking their picture, celebrating their birthday, they’ve got a little tiara and they look like a friggan princess. My birthdays coming up and I just realized no one will ever do that for me. I haven’t been ‘out with the girls’ like that in almost 5 years. No ones going to take my picture, get me balloons, let me wear a stupid little tiara and sing me happy birthday. 

It’s so stupid, I don’t NEED those things, I feel like a spoiled child but I just feel so alone. It made me burst out crying, and I can’t stop crying even writing this because I crave friendship but I don’t even know where to look anymore. And if someone were to come along and offer me their friendship, I wouldn’t even know what to do anymore. 

I feel so stupid. I have a loving boyfriend who would do anything for me and is my best friend but we see each other every day and sometimes you just need something a little different than the same person all the time. Sometimes I feel so selfish and needy for thinking that 😖

Update/Edit: Thank you to all that commented, I didn’t think my midnight ramblings would get this popular and now waking up to it and rereading it, I feel better having vented and crying it out. Some of you gave deep insight on your own lives and what friendship means to you or how you’ve lived without friendship as well. I really appreciate that and I hope everyone here finds their version of happiness, regardless if friendship is in their future or not. I have two hangouts scheduled for the end of this month and May so if those go well I’m going to try and push myself to get back in touch with more people. While I do like my alone time, I also realize that maybe my friends who did keep trying to reach out to me maybe still do care, maybe they still want to see me and ask how my life is and I should take that chance to open up to people again. 

Thank you for listening, your stories and your advice ❤️"
I swear to god my depression made me dumber then a 5 year old,I'm a straight vegetable. Fucking kill me. It makes it so hard to function at work and school 
"Spending the entire day keeping yourself busy and active feeling alright, then the first moment you get to yourself the empty feeling comes back.",
Anyone else feel lonely around happy people?,"I know this might sound backwards, but when I'm around relatives or friends who are having fun or sharing their grief, I feel even more lonely than when I am actually alone. It's like I am unable to take part in whatever they are feeling and feel left alone. I usually end up distancing myself from them by sitting slightly apart and it makes me feel miserable. 

It is perverse how you can be with people but feel lonelier than ever. "
I just want to sleep all the time,"I'm tired of my life. I do nothing all day, always procrastinating. I want to forget all my problems and to sleep all the time. To be comfortable in my bed and to have good dreams."
Anyone else avoid their problems by sleeping?,"Whenever a wave of depression comes over me I have the urge to just lay down on my bed, cover up in blankets and cry myself to sleep regardless of what time of day it is. For instance I'll be sitting at my computer middle of the afternoon just fucking around with some games and my mind will drift to a depressed place and I'll just go to sleep to escape those thoughts... Doing this fucks my sleep schedule pretty badly which makes it hard to try to get other positive stuff going on in my life.

Anyone else do this or just me?"
Is anyone else stuck in limbo; not motivated enough to kill yourself but also not committed enough to life to want to improve your circumstances?,"I don't know what to do with myself these days. I spend my time as this muted version of a person and as unbearable as it is to merely exist, I don't have the energy/hope/motivation to end things OR to even make the changes necessary to get myself to a better place. 

I'm basically just running on empty, kind of just waiting for my body to weaken and my mental state to deteriorate enough to maybe kill me off naturally. I definitely struggle to feel like anything I do is worth anything (even to me let alone in the grand scheme of things) and I feel like I'm nearing closer and closer to the end with each passing day. Is anyone else in the same boat? Stuck in this in-between place? If so, how do you continue on day to day when you have no hope?"
I finally took a shower and sobbed in there for an hour.,"It felt so fucking good crying my eyes out. Even though I barely made a sound because my dad would shout at me as a kid every time I cried and made a sound, it felt nice expressing my emotions and feelings. And finally showering after having zero will to do anything of the sort was real nice too. Highly recommend."
"When you realize that a gf does not ""fix"" ur depression","I always thought that if I ever have a gf she would fill the emptiness inside me. Well certainly she doesn't. She really loves me and tells me that I matter, but I just feel like that I deserve to feel this pain. I don't deserve to be happy. No. I have to feel bad. 

Well.. whatever. Thanks to the one person reading this. Have a great day."
Telling someone they can't be sad because others have it worse is like saying someone can't be happy because others have it better,"I just saw this saying on tumblr and it made me think of the amount of times I see people get told they can't feel sad because others are starving and such. Also as someone who gets told this by their family it almost made me cry

Oh and sorry if someone else already has"
Depression feels like the movie groundhogs day and I can’t figure out the right combination to make it end.,"I wake up and pound caffeine and cigarettes, fueling up for 8 hours of faking it. Then I go home and drink to release it all. Rinse and repeat."
Thinking like this is the only reason I haven't done it yet.,
Do you ever get the feeling that if you tell someone you are depressed they don’t believe you?,This is hard for me to tell anyone because every time the talk about depression comes up I get told why should you be depressed. I don’t know what to do and I honestly just want to shut myself away from it all some times but there are others around me that will get affected by the way I start to act. I don’t even know if I should be posting things up as I n is the internet can be a bad place sometimes....  
"Any one else have random burst of ""happiness"" only to come crashing down a few minutes later?","The longer they are they worse you feel when you get back to your usual self.
Edit: Wow it feels great to know that I'm not alone. I wish you all the best during this times."
"A friend linked me to this picture, it made me feel better and I hope it will make you feel better too. :)",
"Waking up from a dream that is so good to a life that is falling apart is a cruel, painful way to start the day.",
It's this sort of thing that makes it worse.,
Tonight I broke. I can't deal with loneliness anymore.,"Hi Reddit, I hope you're being okay tonight. 

I'm not. I'm gonna sound really pessimistic, I apologize for that. I'm a very positive person. I always smile, I always try to cheer up everyone. Right now I'm doing everything I advice people not to do. 

I'm going through a rough patch, but I always keep people things will get better. I usually believe so. I try and keep busy, I don't want to let depression keep me down. But tonight I broke. Tonight I can't keep going. 

I'm a 24 going on 25 Female. I'm both extroverted and introverted. I love people and taking care of them. I love making people happy. I love my family and I spoil them everytime I can. I pay most stuff for them whenever it's possible. I just like it when people are happy. My life was doing okay until recently. Everything went downhill. My boyfriend cheated on me with a girl he left me for. His friends followed him because, well, they were his friends to begin with.

A while later, while coping with it, I found out my male best friend was jealous of him and had hacked into my laptop to spy on my conversations. He'd been doing so for a while, and never bothered to tell me. 

Then an old friend of mine, male also, told me he had to stop talking to me because he had a new girlfriend that was aware that he had feelings for me and asked him to choose between me and her. 

I graduated college a while after that, celebrated alone with my family and started job hunting. I still didn't find anything. I'm not doing anything all day. I live on the money I saved. I went back to my parents' house to live with them because well... I'd broken up with my bf. 

And yet I always remained optimistic, as much as possible. I didn't want to dwell on those thoughts but loneliness was really hard to cope with. I mediated, exercised, but at the end of the day I didn't have anyone to text or to hang out with, and I'm not the best at finding ways to find new ways of meeting people. I hope finding a job will help, but I can't find anything. Yet I keep smiling, everyday. People tell me I'm brave and strong, and I want to believe them. 

But I still cry. My heart feels empty. I'd like to believe I'm better off alone and that I don't need anyone but I do. I miss my friends, I'm sick of people leaving me. I hate spending this summer all alone. I'd love to solo travel, but I can't really afford it and to be honest, I'm a bit scared. I wouldn't know where to start, and how to organize a budget. 

Guys, I don't feel depressed because I want to die. I feel depressed because I want to live so much, and I feel like I'm cursed. Everytime I made a friend in my life, I lost them, and I'm all alone. I don't talk to anyone about my little obsessions, about my favorite movies. I tried turning to my family for that. My brother and I have always been really close and I've always had his back. Last year, I paid him his dream trip. Tonight, after a week of staying on his computer with his friends, he told me he cared more about them and his girlfriend than he did me. He told me that he knew it wasn't fair, but he wouldn't change. It felt so unfair. I always helped him, I was always there for him, and hearing him willingly turning his back on me felt like too much. 

So tonight, I broke. I just burst into tears. I feel so alone, and it feels really unfair. I try to bring positivity in my life everyday, I take care of the people I love. All I expect in return is respect and a bit of support. I don't know what to do. I'm sick of being alone. I'm sick of being abandoned by everyone, I'm sick of having to pick myself up every single time to end up being hurt more. I'm not as strong and positive as people think I am. I'm simply human, and tonight I can't pick myself up anymore. I desperately need a hug, or someone, or anything. I have nobody to call, nobody to turn to, and as much as I'd like to be independent, I'm not. I've always strived to be the best of friend, and I'm sad I don't have anyone to share this with. 

I miss my old life. I feel desperate tonight. I feel broken and hopeless. I feel so lonely. 
I feel so lonely. 
I'm sorry for being overdramatic. I know it's not the end of the world. But tonight, for me, it's too much to bear. It's late, but my face is all puffy and red and I can't stop crying. 

I'm sorry for writing so much. I really needed this off my chest, even if noone ever reads it. Maybe tomorrow I'll be back to my ""normal"" self. Tonight I just needed to say that I'm not okay and that I'm desperately lonely. Friendship is one of the best things in life, and I miss it terribly. I want to have people to go on adventures with, people I laugh to the point my stomach hurts, people whose shoulder I can cry on without fearing judgement, people that'll have my back as I'll have theirs. I just don't wanna be alone anymore. I've been alone for too long already. 

Thank you again. I'm sorry, I might have killed the mood tonight. 

Edit : I genuinely didn't expect this many reactions to my post. I woke up this morning feeling like my face had been hit by a truck from all the crying and I didn't think of checking reddit because I thought it'd sunken down in oblivion already. You guys definitely restored my faith in humanity and I wish I could all take you out to get whatever it is you love eating/drinking best. (If you guys ever are in Paris...) 

I'd never written something that desperate about myself, since I thought that burying the bad emotions within would eventually make them die out. I'm not 100% okay of course, but I think I'm ready to be back on track of the positivity path and I am so happy to read that my post helped some of you. You're all welcome in my inbox anytime, for anything. I'll be happy to reply.

From the bottom of my heart, thank you. I'm so grateful so many people read it and took the time to write some nice words to cheer me up. You're all amazing people.

Edit 2: A little background of how this came about.

I was in a slump for a whole month recently, I stopped going to work, I stopped contacting my family and friends, I went in and out of hospitals for cutting myself. Since I live alone, and my nearest friend was almost an hour away, I avoided everyone in fear of burdening them to come and look for me. But few close friends still came over and helped me to get back to reality and helped me to manage myself again, and I'm slowly getting better now. During my slump a lot of my casual normal friends were asking and somehow accusing me of making excuses to just run away and avoid my responsibilities. So I came forward, texted the group chat and explain about whatever happened to me and what I felt. I mentioned that I wasn't expecting anyone to understand, I just wanted to explain myself so they would stop making accusations. Then a friend texted that to the group chat, and since last night the whole text was left at that. I didn't know what to respond, so I just went to sleep feeling blank and a bit lost. My close friends told me to just ignore because if the person don't want to be around, there are others who would be glad to help me as much as I need.

Somehow I'm kinda okay with it now, after reading all your comments. But I still wonder:

1) do you actually tell people about your depression?
2) at what point that you decided to tell then about it?
3) if you didn't tell anyone, what makes you decide that way?"

I can't accept being a slave for 40-50 hours per week.,"I just can't do it.

The way I'm going, I know eventually I'm gonna reach my breaking point and blow my brains out.

It's not acceptable to be to just sell away my entire life to some company, working toward someone else's dream at the expense of my own. I would start a business except...what the hell is my business gonna do? Plus, the vast majority of those all fail anyway.

Society has basically been set up so you have two choices: Slavery or death. Every day I feel closer to picking the latter.

"Last April, I gave myself permission to commit suicide, but only after I spent a year *really* trying to get better....","In this one year I moved 3 times, including in with my parents, was ""funemployed"", had 39 out of 40 job applications rejected, moved across the country, went to meetups religiously and befriended everyone I could, tried (and miserably failed at) online dating, medicated, therapized, exercised, got into a car accident, meditated, dated myself, and sometimes cried so hard that I had bruises under my eyes. 


I'm not even close to where I want to be, but fuck it, I'm going to give it another year.

My partner of 5 years dumped me. I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I lost my job. Haven't talked to anyone or been out of the house in weeks. Yesterday a good friend died from suicide. It's too much.,"A lot has happened in a very short amount of time. When shit hits it really hits hard.

This Christmas I got dumped by my SO of 5 years. Two months prior to the breakup he started being very mean and mentally abusive. I have abandonment issues due to childhood trauma, and he made sure to push every trigger. He was  my best friend. The only one I really trusted. And now he's gone.

After the breakup I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I'm in therapy and on meds now, which helps a bit. But it's still so bad that I had to quit my job. I just couldn't go back there. I haven't spoken to anyone, except sent a few texts, since new years. I don't go out of the house except to go to therapy. I'm too afraid. I've shut myself in and everyone else out. My friends send me texts now and then. I know they care, but I just don't have the strengt to answer them.

Yesterday I got texts telling me that a good friend, the kindest guy I ever knew, had died from suicide. I feel so guilty. How could I not have known? What is I hadn't shut him (and everyone else) out. What if I could have talked him out if it? 

With depression comes thoughts of hopelessness, despair, feelings of not being good enough, being worthless. A failure. I've felt all those things. But right now I don't just feel it. It IS me. I don't feel like a failure, I am a failure. 

There are so many 'what if's'. What if I could have saved the relationship. What if I could have saved my connection with my friends. What if I had tried harder. What if I had pushed myself and went back to work. What if I could have saved my friend.

I'm so scared of being alone, yet I can't bring myself to talk to friends. Right now I feel utterly and horribly alone.

What if. Just what if.

Edit: 
I never imagined getting this type of support. From the bottom of my heart; thank you. Thank you for the kind words, the uplifting comments, the stories of your own hardships.

I've always been introverted and never had a lot of friends. I used to play a lot of video games, but even on  online games I play alone. Depending on someone, even in a game, scares me a lot. So I've never been part of a community. But right now, I feel like I've been in the wrong all this time. I feel like I might find something here. A friend, comfort, or someone to discuss the weather with. 
When I am stronger I'd like to be a helpful part of this community. I'd like to pay you back, or at least pay it forward.

I'm doing ok. I try not to think. That's why I haven't written sooner. I couldn't bare to look at my phone. I read, watch HBO, read, HBO, read, HBO. I can't let myself think.

I still have suicidal feelings even if my life is going well and I don't want to die. I can barely get out of bed sometimes even though I want too. I've lost a lot of my intelligence. I guess it's like being aware of my depression and what it does but fighting it and still losing. It's too exhausting. The symptoms just don't go away not even with lifestyle changes, therapy, or meds. It's like being hijacked. "
"I lost my job, my dog, my best friend and my boyfriend within three months.","Hello everyone,

I think I'm reaching my breaking point.

About half a year ago I was doing okay. I lost so much in just three months I'm still stunned about it. First I got out of job, I will spare you the details. I thought I'd be okay, because I thought I could find something else soon enough. But then my dog got very ill. I stayed home to take care of him, but he died a few weeks later. I was completely heartbroken. He was my childhood dog, the one I grew up with, and since I had already lost another dog two years ago I was clinging onto him.

I miss him so much, but it didn't end here. Barely a week later, I'm having this huge fight with my male best friend (I'm a woman) because I found out he's been hacking into my computer and had access to all my personal info and more importantly my conversations. He confessed on spying on my conversations with my boyfriend and that he'd been doing so for six months because he was jealous of our relationship. I was heartbroken again because this guy had been my best friend for so long and I would have trusted him with my life so this definitely felt like betrayal. I decided not to talk to him anymore.

But as if it weren't enough yet, no later than a few weeks later, my boyfriend asks me if I would like ""opening our relationship"" cause you know, there's this girl that's really hot and funny and he'd love to bang her too. When I told him that it made me uncomfortable and that I thought polyamory wasn't my thing, he left me and now he's in a relationship with her. Since I was the one that joined his group of friends, obviously they kept hanging out with him.

I'm heartbroken. I'm lonely. I'm spending summer home cause well, the trip we wanted to make together was cancelled. I'm out of job, my best friend is dead, my other best friend is creepy and my previous boyfriend is a jerk. Obviously, I'm probably better off without people like that in my life, but loneliness is killing me. I never was the best at making new friends even though I love people and finally having some stability in my relationships was really refreshing for a chance.

Now I feel more lonely than I ever was. I try to talk to new people and try dating apps just to try and ""put myself out there"", but most of the time I just feel myself numb to everything. I haven't been able to find another job, I feel like a loser and my family is getting really pissed at me for crying so easily. I totally understand them, but I don't know what to do anymore.Some days I just want to curl up and stop breathing, some other days I just wish for a new genuine friend to just hug me. My life was comfortable enough for me to feel content and happy, and everything collapsed so quickly that I still can't believe it sometimes.

I'm sorry this is so long. I really needed to vent. Thank you, I hope you have a nice day."

Suicide is *hard*.

There's a reason everyone, including me, wants to die but doesn't actually want to kill themselves. If suicide were as easy as pushing a button, I wouldn't be making this post right now.

But you have to get the materials, you have to make a plan. Even more difficult, you actually have to *do* it. And of course, you don't want to fuck it up, because things get even worse if you do.

"How I feel whenever people say ""things will get better""",
"""Don't fool me. You don't have depression""","This... thing...

A couple of hours ago i confided to my mom about my condition. Linking it to my tendency to hide details and lie to her and p much everyone else i deem mentally dangerous. What happened chilled me so hard, enough to have my tears stop from falling

It was a mild noon. I was cooped up with her in our bedroom (a family bedroom shared by everyone. It's a third world thing) and was on the verge of breaking apart. She had just learned of the debts I was trying to pay in secret without the knowledge of her or anyone within the household. I was trying to explain things but she wouldn't budge, uttering words like ""im disappointed in you"" again and again and again like a broken god damn record.

I had my last card. Tell her the truth, of what's going on. I gathered the courage to get up and tell her everything. ""Mom. I think i need professional help"". My voice quivered, tears started welling up. I knew i had to tell this sooner or later or it'll eat away at me like acid. ""Mom. please. I need help"" as i burst into tears. Imagine that... a 19 year old f***ing boy crying in front of his mother. Pathetic right?

That's exactly what she thought. She immediately told me to stop crying as she finds it p distasteful. I tried stopping the tears but to no avail. I told her everything. When it got to my suicide confession, what she said next just stopped me in my tracks.

""And?""

That's all she had said. She even refused to go near me during the whole ordeal, with an obvious look of disbelief, curiosity and mocking on her face. I continued to plea for help. Amusement replaced curiosity and soon enough she spoke the following words:

""You don't fool me. You don't have depression""

I stopped. I was horrified, disgusted, angry, and helpless. I thought she would understand what's what. Instead...

She blamed ME for being depressed. She told me i wasn't taking care of myself well enough and that I wasn't paying any shred of attention to whatever she says. I have, for the love of god, taken care of myself well enough to not have any minor AND major health problems. She refused to acknowledge that I have done everything by the god damn book, i am physically well, and its my mind that's breaking apart.

She then proceeded to tell me her story of how things werent all sunshines and rainbows back in her college days. Where she had no friends when she started and all that bullcrap. At the end of the day, I AM in the wrong.

Academics have played a huge part in my downward spiral. The pressure to graduate on time despite the subjects looking grimmer than ever has punched my soul hard to a pulp. I have yet to propose mom for a different approach to this spartan practice but i doubt it'll do anything significant, if it does anything at all...

I don't... know what to do. I don't want to bother my best friend with this no longer as she has a life to live, and her own problems to deal with. I don't want to burden anyone anymore. 

Help.... i'm seriously looking at the void as a better alternative than living through this hell for the next few years or so

Just This,
Living in Japan has been absolute hell but everyone basically tells me to just shut up about it...,"So I've been living in Japan since May of last year. I was hired as an english teacher. It seemed like a dream come true because I've loved Japanese culture for as long as I can remember. I packed my bags, said goodbye to my parents, and left the US. For the record, I'm black.

At first, everything seemed ideal. However, I began to notice people would stare at me a lot when I commuted to work. People would actively avoid sitting near me too. My students seem to only want to talk about the US and US politics like Trump so I often struggle to control my classroom. People, including my students, call me ""Beyonce"" which I find insulting. 

I was dating one of my neighbors for a brief time only to find out he was basically bragging to his co-workers that he ""bagged a black cunt"". He seemed like a nice man but he was using me. I felt like a piece of trash.

Some teenaged girls on the train looked in my direction and commented ""kimochiwarui"" which means ""nasty"". It made me break down and cry. 

I've tried to relay these sentiments online but people keep telling me that I'm wrong, that Japan isn't racist or xenophobic at all, and I need to ""check my privilege"". I'm not kidding. People are turning the tables, and accusing me of being the prejudiced one towards the Japanese.

At this point, I might quit and move back to the US once the term ends. It depresses me though. I wanted to start a new life here, and I wanted to explore a new culture that I always admired. Now I just...feel betrayed, and depressed. I can't feel anything other than immense sadness lately. Don't know what else I can do."
Depression killed my personality,"I can't think. I can't talk. I have no thoughts that go on in my head. My mind is just blank. I can't think of anything to say to anyone, even those that are also depressed. They try to escape by talking and laughing, but I am incapable. I can't think of anything to say. The only thoughts that go on in my head are repeats of what happened today or some song that I heard. My head is constantly foggy. I'm so foggy I almost feel like I'm dreaming. I am a brain dead vegetable.

"I used to think depression was just ""all in your head"". Now that I actually have it, I want to apologize.","So I used to be those people who, if you were depressed, would tell you that it's ""all in your head"" or -insert cliche suggestion/advice-. I wasn't mean about it. I just didn't believe in it.

Well, fast forward a few years, at 20 years old I got diagnosed with Rheumatoid Arthritis. 7 months later, it spread all over my body, affecting my hands and feet the most. On top of that, I am also active duty. I played piano, I kick boxed, I hiked, I was active. And all of that was stripped away in the matter of months.

Because of that, and everything just kind of spiraled out of my control (I'm a bit of a control freak) I suddenly realized one day, there are very little things that make me happy. I feel empty. I tried everything to get back to my old cheery self. Then, I didn't want to try at all. The world got a a shade of gray, my steps were meaningless, food had no taste, everything I did was just to past time, no purpose. 

2 years later I was diagnosed as depressed. 
So to everyone out there with depression, no matter how severe or how it began, I am sorry. It sucks. Literally. It's like a dementor following you around 24/7. But please stay strong. I know you might not want to. I don't want to. But I hope there's light at the end of every tunnel.

I've lost 4 Marines to depression and almsost lost a 5th. None saw combat. I need help understanding.,"Hi. 

I just had my 4th funeral in 7 years for yet another Marine. A few days ago another one called me with a gun to his head and i talked him down.

These 5 Marines, as far as i can tell suffer/suffered from depression. Pretty much every one of them was intelligent (like way too smart for the Marine Corps) and each of them stood out as ""the funny one"". To say very few people understood they were struggling would be an understatement. 

The Marine Corps has done a lot to try and help suicidal Marines, but all our training videos depict some ""clearly distressed"" person telegraphing an intent to harm themselves. In reality none of these people let on the depth of their suffering and only one made an attempt to seek help.

What I'm asking:

As someone who has never suffered depression (Ive been ""depressed"" but that was from external factors like a job not working out or a girl leaving me. I consider that normal human emotion), how do I identify Marines under my care thst may be suffering and need help.

They are NOT giving the outward signs in the stupid ""Lance Corporal Decker video"" we watch once a year.

Thanks.

Edit: been at work all day then went to visit a former Marine that dealt with some serious issues in his day but is doing well now. Mulled over a lot of this with him, then checked back in here and saw all these wonderful responses.

I have read every one, some several times. I have a lot to consider and learn, but thank you for helping me find some direction.

One thing i didn't mention is my role in all this. Im not sone big wig commander with tools at my disposal.  Im a newly promoted Sergeant and a squad leader with just a handful of guys under me. The one we just burried was not in my platoon, but i knew him enough to be deeply saddened by his loss. The other three were guys i was close to back in training, but i was not currently stationed with them when it happened. In fact i found out about all three of them on Facebook. 

This recent one, and the one that called me with suicidal thoughts, have made me want to be much more aware of the mental health of those around me. The scary thing to me is, even with hindsight, i wouldn't have picked these five guys out of the lot as having ANY kind of issues, let alone suicidal tendencies. 

I have also noticed, maybe because of my nature or leadership style, that im the one people tend come to with problems. I make it known that im here for that purpose, and people take me up on it. So I guess now i want to make sure i can spot when someone needs more help than they may be openly asking for. I will be more vigilant in my assessments of the needs of those under my watch.

Thank you all for the detailed and informed replies.

This is the first time I felt that I'm not alone, even if we are all just Internet strangers, thank you, thank you all so much, I don't think I ever received so much attention and support from anyone like that before.

I don't know how exactly how to start this, this is the first time I open up about my depression randomly online and reading through all the other posts in this sub made me feel like opening up. Not even my family knows I'm depressive since I was 12, because I always covered it up with the good old ""nah I'm fine, just feeling a little letdown"". I had my first kiss and long-term relationship when I was 15, and for five years I've kept going up and down in my mood, but never felt what people call ""true happiness"". After those five years, one of the people I trusted the most, backstabbed me and convinced my to-be fiancée to leave me for him. I live in a third-world country, he lives in Canada, and of course she didn't think twice and took the proposal. They've been married since then, not that I care anymore, I'm better off alone so that I at least don't bother anyone else. Similar stories happened with my two next long-term relationships. There were days where I would do everything I could and muster up willpower to at least seem happy, but they always ended up seeing through it and, well, I myself could never keep up my act. I always thought that I was depressive because I didn't had someone by my side, but now I realize that this has nothing to do with that. To this day I still don't know what made me change into this. As each day passes I drink, toke and smoke more and more in hopes of not waking up the other day. I don't even cry anymore, I just feel numb and empty. But I always wake up in desperation of the thought that, once again, I'm alive, and that I'll have to go to work and deal with another day of the same repetitiveness. It's been 4 years since this routine started, and I basically just work so I can pay my rent and feed my addictions. I have no hope, and I really don't understand what's the purpose of being alive if our existence makes literally no difference in this universe. We exist because we exist. We didn't choose to be born, and if we choose to off ourselves, we are considered weak, coward individuals. If we raise our hands in expectation of help, it's always the same ""hey, life is good and short, you should cherish it and do the best you can, be happy, this sadness of yours is bad for you and everyone around you"". Because yeah, it surely is that simple to ""be happy"". I don't want to be here anymore, because I already know that it will only get worse from here. This came up a little garbled and messed-up because I can't really think correctly or bother to let myself think more about the past. Life is short, probably for those who live happy lives, but this feels like a drag and I sincerely don't want to be here anymore. Already tried offing myself many times to no avail, and ended up strained with my parents for a while because of that. Too bad we can't get guns here where I live, because I'd happily put a bullet in my own head if I could."
I'm not gonna make it past 2019,"""New year, new me"" yeah nope. I already know this year is gonna fucking suck. As if 2018 wasn't bad enough already. My ""friends"" are all out getting drunk and having fun tonight while I'm stuck in my room mustering up a will to live and they don't even have the audacity to reply to my texts and invite me out with them. I can't see 2019 getting any better. I hope all of you are having better NYE's than I am.."

When I immediately get downvoted after pouring my heart out....,"Makes me think twice about ever sharing on this sub again. I was just trying to stay positive in the face of my depression....Is that so wrong?

Anyone else feel overwhelmed by little tasks?,"Like, showering. It seems like such a chore when I’m in a depressive episode. It seems like I’m gonna forget something. There’s been times when I’ve forgotten to shave one leg or I’ll be too tired to wash my face. 
Plus I have to brush and floss. Take my night meds. Brush my hair. Set our clothes for the next day.
All small tasks but they seem so overwhelming. 
Anyone else?"
Today I sat on a hill and watched the sunset with my dog,"and for the first time in 4 years I felt happy.  Overwhelmingly. It was beautiful. Small victories.

edit: thank you for all the wonderful comments! this community is so supportive. i wish my arms were long enough to hug you all.

Depression made me an idiot.,"When I was a child, everyone said I was intelligent, I had reading speed a lot above the average, and my grades were never different from A's. I was happy, even though I was being bullied every single day.

When I got into highschool, as my depression got worse, my grades started slipping. I don't remember a time when I studied without a distraction. I didn't want to study and when I studied, I did it last minute. I didn't even talk and became a mess in class, still am.

I just remember how I was in middle school and say 'where is that happy child?' I don't recognize myself anymore. "
"DAE feel like they want everyone to know they are depressed, but wants no one to know at the same time?","I had the option to tell my parents know I was depressed, but i could not bring myself to say it. But at the same time, when they criticise me, I just want to shout 'it's because i'm depressed!'"
Why I'm leaving /r/depression,"I joined this sub to gain a better understanding of depression and how to support people with it. I joined for my girlfriend. I mostly lurked. I read, gathered information and tips on how to help, and to know what is good to say and what to definitely avoid saying.

It's been 5 months without any symptoms for her. If it comes back, I'll be back, but I'm hoping I don't have to. This sub has given me great insight into something I can't truly understand.

Thank you. I hope you have the same success my girlfriend (now finacée) and I have had."
Let's break the mental health stigma (throwaway account) - upvotes for visibility and awareness on an issue noone wants to talk about. So share your story.,"I am mentally ill and I am not a bad person because of it. I am not useless. I am worth more then a bed in a hospital and a prescription. I am capable. I am worth getting a job. Getting a degree. Falling in love and starting a family - no matter what society and the media may try and tell me.

Please share your story - 

A moment where you saw someone being harassed for being mentally ill and how you stepped it

A moment you were discriminated or a friend/family member/loved one was discriminated

Actions you and/or your community are making to break the stigma.

Questions you may have about mental illness that you were always just too embarassed to ask

After being on reddit for a long while... I really think you guys and girls will help make a difference - if anyone could it's us reddit!!!!!! I posted on r/depression because there are the most redditors profoundly suffering here - ive been getting help and giving advice on this subreddit for quite some time. I knew you guys would be the place to post this. 

EDIT: over 600 upvotes! cant believe it!  (i'm ignoring down votes. cause seriously. we're thinking positive here) these stories are inspiring and the non-judgmental atmosphere is so appreciated. a lot of people have been courageous in sharing their stories and helping others - thank you so much! keep them coming they're inspiring :)

My father just told me that I chose to be depressed because I’m lazy,"I feel like shit now. I hate my family so much it hurts. I stopped seeing doctor and taking medicines because my brother and sister laughed at me and called me “crazy”. My mother tells all her friends and our relatives that I’m useless and lazy. 

My father came to have a talk with me just now. I explained to him that depression is just like any other physical illness. He told me that I’m not sick and everything is my choice, that I am lazy and I chose to be depressed when I can be “normal”. 


EDIT: I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR THE SUPPORTIVE COMMENTS AND MESSAGES.  ❤️ (I might not be able to reply to all but thanks for taking the time) Also, I’m surprised at some ignorant comments that I’ve received from some.  If you don’t understand depression and if you can’t be nice about it, please don’t comment (and delete after that)? I’m here to rant and look for support, not looking for comments that made me feel worse. But MAJORITY OF PEOPLE ARE REALLY NICE AND SWEET SO THANK YOU ❤️ If anyone needs someone to talk to, you can always message me :)  "

Anyone else find the idea of working 40+ hours a week until you retire fucking awful?,"I might be getting a job soon that goes from 8-4:30, Mon-Fri. All I can think about is how I will be spending a huge chunk of my day doing work for someone else. I'll have a few hours in the evening, but then it's early to bed so I can be up again by 6:30.

How do people do this and be okay with it? I honestly can't find the point to even living when 8.5 hours of every day is spent doing something I hate. You get the weekends, but they pass by so quickly and even then you usually have shit to do so you don't get to relax. 

Not sure why pretty much everyone doesn't feel the same way."

Anyone else feel so nostalgic for the past when things were okay that it actually physically hurts?,even though i know i'm glossing over the bad memories....at least there were good ones as well
"""I liked you better when you weren't depressed so... can you just stop being depressed?""","Dylan, My old best friend. About half a year ago Dylan brought up something that has me so mad now that I look back on it. He said and I quote ""You know what...? I liked you better when you weren't depressed but then you all of a sudden changed to this no life depressed loser and you make me look bad so can you just like stop being depressed?"" All I responded with was ""Dylan, I can't just stop being depressed wtf"" and yeah I have to deal with him arguing with me and telling me ""Are you gonna kill yourself or what? Stop being dramatic and backing out and just do it!!"" Let me also add that he spreads shit about about me. This is Dylan, my old friend. I stopped being his friend recently because I realised having no friends is better than having basically an abusive friend."
"My dad just turned off the wifi because he thinks my ""problem"" is being addicted to video games",I hate my video games. They are all boring and always make me so angry. I keep playing because I'm afraid of the thoughts that come when I don't.  He told me to find something more productive to do and the only useful thing I can think of is hanging myself.
"My roommate just told me that I ""just need to be more positive"" and that if I ""just changed my perspective"" I'd be happier. She doesn't believe in mental illness.","Enough said.
"
"Does anyone else feel like their setting (bedroom, apartment, office, etc) enables their depression just by existing?","This is a really hard concept to put into words, which is why the post title might sound a little unusual. But I hope someone understands. Also applies to feelings of anxiety.

I feel like the circumstances of where I live... The furniture layout, the lighting, the decorations, all that stuff... Just makes my depression worse somehow. Like I'll get home from work or from being out and just feel depressed because of my setting.

It's probably because most of the time my depression is at its worst is when I'm sitting at home doing nothing, and the only thing I have to take in is my setting. So naturally, those associations are going to get made.

It makes me want to move or buy new furniture or at least rearrange some things. I feel like this is the only reason that going for a walk helps, because the moment I get back home I feel the same way. It's most intense when I sleep.

This post doesn't feel like it makes sense, but hopefully it resonates with some people who might be able to expand on it or maybe offer some solutions."
My mom died yesterday.,"I am so numb. She was EVERYTHING to me. The only person I trusted implictly. The only person I thought truly understood me. Now I just feel lost and afraid.

Depression isn't the only mental illness I have, but it's the one most present right now."
Woke up. Again.,"I woke up and immediately thought, “This shit? Again?”

I threw the covers off and got up to take a piss. Last night I watched a Humphrey Bogart film, “the Big Sleep.” So Noir was on my mind. I started narrating my walk to the toilet down the hall. “The dipshit lumbered down the corridor.”

It made me smile.

So I kept narrating my actions as I made breakfast. Out loud. Including such gems as:

“The detective crawled back under the covers”

“The peanut butter was crunchy, but that’s the way he liked it”

“Jelly on the sheets? Time to take out the motherfuckin laundry”


It snapped my sad spell. Maybe imagining myself as a character gave me distance and perspective."
Is anyone else just... waiting?,"Waiting in traffic
Waiting to go home
Waiting to go to bed
Waiting for the weekend
Waiting for friends to call that never do
Waiting to feel anything other than numb
Waiting, day after day, for a better tomorrow that never comes
Waiting until it’s all finally over

I feel like I’m somehow not alive. And at the same time I don’t feel anything at all.

Thanksgiving is agony for a depressed person,"Everybody talks about everything that they're thankful for.

Still I can’t fight this. I’m an insanely strong person because I’ve seen so much and still have so much positivity. This kills me because I act so much natural in front of people but deep down, I’m fucked up.
A lot of people open up to me about their problems, they seem to act on my advice too.
I fake everything in my life. I fake every happy emotion. 
I also do a lot of cardio, eat healthy but this depression is eating me up. "
"""I'm fine, I'm just tired""",I feel like these are the only words in my vocabulary lately.
Anyone else get sad on their birthday?,"My birthday is about to end, and I’m sad. Not because it’s over, I feel like it’s something that I should have enjoyed and been happy about, but I’m just not capable of that anymore. So I think I’m sad because my birthday doesn’t feel the same way it did when I was a kid. 

It also doesn’t help that I didn’t really do anything to celebrate, having parties just makes me feel pathetic. I’m the only one over the age of 6 in my family who doesn’t have any friends to invite to a birthday party. My siblings who are both much younger than I am don’t even have family parties anymore, but that’s my only option. And then I never have the energy to socialize, so I end up feeling left out at my own party. So I didn’t have a party at all, and that makes me sad too. I just can’t win. 

At least it’s another year closer to inevitable death! "

I'm that friend. the one that cheers people up. people come to me when they're depressed. but now i'm depressed and i have no one to talk to,"It's 4pm. I skipped school today and I don't have the strength to get out of bed. I'm studying at an amazing, private art school that costs 8000 euros a year. I got accepted in second year right when I got out of highschool, which usually never happens. They told me they were ""impressed"" by my skills and by my ""artistic sensibility"" for someone my age. I'm the youngest guy in my class. Yet, I can't bring myself to go to school. It probably has something to with the fact that I'm failing at it.

I have social anxiety. It's not easy to go to school every day when I can so clearly see it in their eyes. ""What the fuck is that guy doing here? He's awkward and unfunny and can't draw shit. He's not even invested in his work."" They're right. I feel like I don't belong here. I've been incredibly bad at everything I've done since the year has started. Every homework. Every test. No exceptions.

I didn't go to an art school because I was good at it. No. I did it because I'm bad at literally everything else. My creativity is the only likeable trait about me. I'm awkward, selfish, lazy, clumsy - but when I create something I like, it's like the universe is telling me ""hey, maybe you're not so worthless after all. Maybe you can make the difference in this dying, overpopulated planet"". And it feels good. It makes me feel alive. The thing is, since I started studying here, everything I've made has been incredibly shitty, like a painful reminder that I'm not so special. A kick in the balls, telling me that this is what happens when you actually believe people who tell you ""wow! this is really good! you have talent!"" just because you're slightly above average. But that's not enough.

I know it's stupid. It's such a dumb reason to be depressed. I can't help it. My creativity and my ""art skills"" are the only thing I've ever liked about myself, and here I am realizing how shitty they are. I know I should get my shit together and work on it. Improve it. But I can't. i just fucking can't

My friends keep coming to me when they're sad. i'm that one friend. i'm good at cheering people up. i'm good at listening, telling them some crappy im14andthisisdeep advice and hugging them. i'll never stop doing it and i'm never bothered by it. but it hurts. i can't share this negativity with them because they already have much more important things to take care of, and they're already depressed so they definitely don't need it. so i keep it to myself. that's what i've always done. but it hurts. and i'm tired.

i'm sorry. i just reread this and it's a mess. i think i just needed to post it somewhere online. even if no one reads it, it's fine. at least i let it all out. it feels a little better already"
My parrot died in last 30 minutes,"I just have no one to tell right now. She's laying there breathless. Right in the house. Right in my house. Some minutes ago she still was alive and I could give some care and words. Now what. Death. Why do I always lose.

This parrot was bought by my brother. By my brother who's fucking dead to suicide for almost 7 months. How much more I can take of this shit.

Thanks for reading."
Today my mom came to my school and ate lunch with me.,"We have open campus for lunch (highschool) and i have zero friends. I’ve atw by myself probably 4-7 times in the last 2 weeks. Its gotten to the point where my mom came and ate lunch with me, because she feels bad.

Edit: feel bad that i got a little karma from this:(

Edit 2: rip inbox

Edit 3: thanks for all the lovely words:)"
I cleaned my room!,Under the bed too! I even dusted the fan!I've been having a relatively difficult few weeks but I feel so much better now that I'm sleeping somewhere that's not filthy. 
I have to wonder... How the flying fuck do people with depression even get into relationships?,"Even in this sub alone it's mindblowing to me how one has a partner. How do you find one, let alone maintain it, while constantly wanting to blow your brains out? Are these the same people as me? Are these the same ones who go through suicidal thoughts and spend weeks at a time unable to perform even the most basic functions? How do I find people willing to look past my self-destructive tendencies like other depressed people have? I honestly want to understand how it's even possible to find a significant other while in such a state of mind. Am I just a boring unattractive fuck? That's probably it, right? Holy fucking christ...

Edit: So after browsing the comments, it seems most commentors are already in relationships or have been in one (again, how!?). Many people say they got lucky and their SO found them (what the fuck???). The majority, even with depression, still consider a relationship a normal everyday part of their adult life. I repeat, how the ever loving fuck do you find these people? Meanwhile, I'm stuck feeling like a goddamn teenager wondering what even a kiss feels like. An _extremely small_ percentage of comments seem to be in the same position as me. In any case, this was eye-opening to me. Imagine finding out, or rather confirming, you're broken even among the broken people. Maybe I'll get a brain aneurysm. Cherish your significant others. Cherish that feeling called 'love'. Because I sure as fucking hell can't."
One of the worst things about depression is that what you should do is the exact opposite of what you want to do.,"Have to get out of bed? Nah, don't feeling like it.

Get up and take a shower? Fuck that shit.

Clean my room? I'll do it tomorrow.

Apply for a job? No one will hire me anyways.

Go on a walk to get some sunlight and fresh air? Too tired.

It works the other way too, naturally. All the shit you want to do is stuff you shouldn't do.

Sit around all day and play video games? Shouldn't do that.

Stuff my face full of burgers and sodas because food is one of the only things that makes me feel good? Bad idea.

Stay at home and sulk instead of going out to do something with actual human beings? Not wise.

I feel like it's just a part of human nature to enjoy things we're not supposed to do but I feel like this is exacerbated in cases of depression. Every single freakin' fuckin' thing you feel like doing is a bad idea and every single thing you really with all your heart don't want to do can help. It's like my mind doesn't even want to get better. It's amazing how we deceive and sabotage ourselves.
"
Just feels like every day is a filler episode.,Nothing is changing. I just feel tired. I don't feel alive. All I want to know is how to start living instead of just existing.
"Found out my ""friends"" have a second secret friend group.","I've been depressed my whole life. I won't get into the reasoning here, because it isn't really relevant. At 26 years old, I've almost never been happy.

That all changed a few months ago when I started a new job. I finally got my shit together, started making money, and even made a few friends!

As it turns out, my friend group has a second friend group. It's literally the same people, minus myself, plus one other person. They have a chat group, they go to dinners, they watch movies, etc. I found out by accident, and they are clearly hesitent and secretive about their activities outside work when I am nearby. They must know how I would feel about it. I'm sure if one of them was excluded, they would feel the same way.

This is all bad enough, but what's worse is that a new guy just started at work. I feel like he and myself got along quite well. I would help him learn things, we've eaten lunch a few times. Well, as it turns out, he was recently added to the secret second chat group that excludes myself. 

I can't stop thinking about it. I thought I finally had some friends, but I obviously care far more about them than they care about me. For the first time in months I am drifting back into depression and suicidal thoughts. 

I don't know what to do. If I say something, then they will add me to their group out of pity, and that is almost worse than being excluded altogether. I should have known that happiness was too good to be true. 

Edit: Thank you all so much for your comments (and DMs)! There are so many that it would probably take me a full day to properly respond the each of them, but I have read through all of them. It seems like a huge number of us have gone through similar experiences at some point in our lives. It isn't fun, but at least we suffer together. What I really needed was a place to vent, and this was clearly the place to do it. "
I wish my friends and family would stop caring so I can kill myself with no consequences,
Anyone else depressed but still functional?,"Like you get through the day, you complete all your tasks, spend your lunches with classmates/coworkers. Finish your projects but you feel so hollow, blank and sad. After a full day of fake smiles and fighting off the voices reminding you of how close you are to breaking down, you're too tired to cry or show any emotions. So you just go to bed and repeat the next day?"
"Every friend I know have their own clique to do stuff together, and I’m here, just in my room, doing nothing. I feel left out","I have friends, but I also don’t have friends.

I’m a friendly guy and sociable enough to make handful of friends, but I don’t know why, even though we got so much in common, I feel they only recognize me as a hi-bye friend. I’m close to them, but not close enough to be in their boundaries. It’s like I’m not the friend that’s “okay” enough to be asked to go out.

And so, I am alone.

Every time I see an instagram story of my friends eating on “happening” places, or just taking fresh air while casually strolling downtown, my heart just aches. It’s not that I hate them for not inviting me (it’s their choice), it’s because I don’t have *any* group of friends that I can invite (or be invited) to do something like that. Every friend that is close enough to me have their own group of friends to have fun every weekend, and I surely shouldn’t barge in to theirs.

Deep down, I *need* something like those, some happiness to clear my mind off from college. But I don’t have *that* kind of friends. And that kind of friends probably doesn’t even consider me as the people they should invite for these kind of stuff."
Who else feels like they're just wasting their life?,I just sit on laptop/phone all day and basically kill time. Rinse and repeat. There was a time when I was actually productive and excited about life and the possibilities it has to offer. Now it kills me to hear people say I have so much potential when all I do contributes absolutely nothing to myself or the world around me :(

Does anyone else feel like a fake and empty human?,"I the only real hobbies I have are based around my obsession with the way I look: yoga and the gym, because I hate my body. Other than that I have no real interests. I used to have hobbies: I used to really like hiking and cooking. Now I just want to lie in bed and do nothing all of the time, especially since when I do go out and do activities, I feel nothing. It makes me feel like a fake, empty person and makes making friends hard, because I just seem empty and boring. Is this a symptom of depression? I have been diagnosed with anxiety and depression. Sometimes I worry that I have bipolar disorder, that I'm a psychopath or that I have some other personality disorder. When I'm around new people I feel I have to lie or at least enhance the truth to make myself look like this interesting person that actually has some hobbies. Does anyone else feel this way?

Edit: Does anyone also feel like it's a never-ending cycle? Like, because you're depressed you act a bit weird/off around other people, and because you act a bit weird/off around other people you feel depressed?"
Does anyone else feel numb and indifferent instead of just sad?,.
"I want to \ isolate myself from people but when I do, I'm suffocated in my loneliness","You guys ever just get sick of everyone? You can't do something right or they nitpick or get mad at you for trivial things and you just want to be left alone? Then you finally have that time alone and you just crumble under the weight of it all? All I wanted today was to be alone with my own thoughts and now that I am, I just feel worse. I get all wrapped up in my head and it makes everything feel worse.

I'm just tired of it all. "
My brother said that the reason I am clinically depressed is because I am an atheist,"He straight up said that I “chose” to be depressed because I chose not to believe in god. As if the fact that I’ve had horrifically traumatic shit happen to me since I was a small child has nothing to do with the fact that I have crippling depression and am suicidal every single day.

🙃

And knowing that he thinks that of me really fucking sucks becuase I thought he was the only person in my family I could count on. My mom is extremely abusive to me, my dad is not in my life and I haven’t seen him in 12 years, and mt other family members couldn’t give less of a shit about me.

I’ve never felt so alone in my life. I feel like I have no one I can rely on and I have a hard time trusting other people."
Does anyone else feel depressed but then get angry because they think they're making it up in their head and then get more depressed in an infinite loop,
The worst part of college is looking around and seeing all of the happy productive people working to build great lives for themselves.,Then looking at yourself and just laughing in your head at the prospect of doing the same.
Does it bother anyone else that our whole lives are based off how hard we can work?,And being depressed kinda puts you in last place. 
If I don't instigate every single conversation then I basically don't exist and I have no one to talk to.,"I feel like a ghost, and that nothing is real. No one ever tries to reach out and get to know me, or even simply say hello from time to time. I try to take part in conversation but I'm ignored mostly. I really want to die most of the time."
"I miss you, old me.","I miss having the energy. I miss having commitment and seriousness towards academics. I miss my craving for reading books. I miss having the energy to socialise and make friends. I miss feeling.

Old me, I have lost you to depression. Depression ruined my entire life."
I wish someone would touch me,"I cry most days because I just wish someone wanted to be with me, I don't want to have sex, I just want to be able to hold someones hand and fall asleep next to them. I hate being alone, i hate being alive"

"I realize I don't want to die, I just want to start living",
Fuck everyone who tells you college will be the best years of your life,I don’t think I’ll ever have a worse time than these past three years have been. They don’t tell you that if you don’t find your people off the bat you’re pretty much by yourself for the rest of it. At least it introduced me to weed and alcohol so I can abuse those to help me get through it. 
It's friday. everyone is out having fun with their friends and i'm sitting in my room contemplating suicide.,"i've got nothing else to say...

Edit: I took a drive around my area for like an hour and played soft music like ""Hallelujah"" and songs like that. I feel a little better. Thank you for the kind words."
It's weird how quickly you can go from a good place to rock bottom,"A few years ago I was in a pretty dark place, going through a deep depression and struggling to be a normal functioning human being. I wasn't taking care of myself and spent most of my day playing video games or watching youtube videos. I slowly started to pick myself back up, got a job, started going back to school, got a better job, started rewarding my hard work and recovery process with a new PC and cute clothes. I started feeling better about my appearance and lost a little bit of weight I put on due to my depression. I was doing so good and my recovery was going so well.

I quit my job last October thinking I would have a better opportunity at another place of work, but it ended up being so much worse. I stupidly quit my new job so that I wouldn't force myself into so much stress knowing I'm very mentally vulnerable to negative thinking. However, since then I haven't been able to find a job and have gotten to the point where I've stopped looking. I'm back to not taking care of myself and back to playing video games/watching youtube videos all day. 

I just think it's so.... idk the word.... maybe weird? crazy? that you can go from doing so well with getting better to slipping back into a deep depression in the blink of an eye. "
"I wish I could donate my life to someone who'd want it and would make better use of it than I will. Like organ donation, but for existence itself.","Alternatively, I wish someone else could jump in and take the driver's seat of my body, and I could just passively watch from behind my eyes.  Hell, passively going through the motions of living is what I already do, but it's just so exhausting.  I don't have the energy or drive or wherewithal to make living into anything more than a chore, but apparently other people do."
"Anyone ever have the feeling that you don't want to be dead, but you don't really want to be alive either?","It's not great, I've been feeling this way for a few days.. Just wanted to vent a little."

I Met My Teenage Crush in the Supermarket Today,"I met my teenage crush in the supermarket today. I was with my 14 year old son and pushing a wagon full of groceries when I spotted her on line waiting for the cashier to tally up her items. I wasn't sure it was her, so I ventured her name. ""Debbie?"" I said and gave her a small smile. She turned around and looked at me. After a moment's hesitation, her face broke into a huge smile, ""Oh my God, hi how are you?"" Her voice had that same soft, musical quality it had when I first fell in love with her all those years ago, and her smile was just as radiant. 

It was 1983 and I was 18. My dad had died very suddenly two years earlier and my mother had decided to check out of parenthood. I still lived at home but she no longer considered me her child - I was a freeloader who wasn't carrying my weight. It was a very bad time for me. To get away from her for a little while, I had taken a ride with my good friend and his parents out to New Jersey to visit his cousins who had just bought a new home there. We got into the house, which was quite large and beautiful. As we walked around, Debbie bounded from one of the bedrooms. ""Hi!"" she said to me enthusiastically and with an broad, open, friendly smile. She was 16, beautiful, tall and with light brown hair. Unlike every girl I had known to that point, she had no airs at all, no attitude - just an open, friendly, warm greeting that was completely genuine. She had just met me and was already happy to see me. 

I was in love. It wasn't a horny teenage thing - this girl had made me feel happy with just a greeting. She showed us around the house, pointing out the features with her open, airy, friendly way. I felt like I was on a cloud - all of the heaviness of my hard life seemed to have vanished just by my being in the same room with her.

All too soon, the visit ended. Debbie said it would be ok if I wrote to her (no e-mail or texting then). I remember sitting in my friend's parents Ford on the drive home. I was feeling a mixture of giddiness and sadness - of having met her and having to leave her.

The feeling didn't go away in the weeks that followed. I found my thoughts preoccupied with Debbie and her lilting voice and her kind face. My mother and older brother found out from my friend's parents that I had made a ""friend"" with Debbie. I confessed to them that I was in love with her. At first, they were amused. But when my ""symptoms"" didn't abate, they grew in equal parts irritated and annoyed. I was lovesick - thoughts of Debbie were the only things that lifted me out of the depression of my daily life. I couldn't eat or sleep. 

Finally, my mother got angry enough to destroy my little island of happiness. She told me point-blank. ""Stop thinking about her. You'll never have her. Her parents want somebody fancy for her, like a doctor or some rich guy. You're nothing. We're poor people. They'll never want you."" But despite being told this in one form or another many times, my love for her persisted. I wrote her and she wrote back. I bought her a book for her 17th birthday. She spent a few days at my friend's house while her parents were abroad, and I took her out to pizza and a movie. We walked and talked and she smiled a lot at me with her kind eyes. Even now, over 30 years later, I think back on that evening and I feel light and airy. 

Alas, time passed. Debbie went away to college, far away. I attended my local college but I never stopped thinking of her. Our correspondences grew less frequent and less comprehensive. I went on to law school. I began to despair that maybe my mother was right, that I wasn't good enough for her. Her parents knew of my crush on Debbie. My friend's parents told me one day that the subject of my desire for her had come up in a family conversation. Her parents' attitude was ""he's a nice boy but we're looking for something different for her.""

And that was that. My crush turned into a shattered heart. As the years passed, I recalled Debbie fondly and with a leap of my heart. In 1993, I learned that she had gotten engaged to a medical student, a brilliant guy from a wealthy family. And so my mother had been right all along.

And now I'm 51 years old, overweight and graying and still carrying the bitterness in my heart from having lived in my shattered home, and having my heart broken that time and a few times by other girls later on. But today I met Debbie in the supermarket. She's 49 now, her light brown hair starting to gray and little left of her 16 year old figure. But her voice was just as sweet and lilting and her smile was just as bright and open. Even today, after all these years, my heart started to lighten even as she spoke to me about the wedding she had just made for her eldest daughter. I started to feel that same love for her, although now it was mixed in with sadness and regret over the passed years and what might have been in a different reality.

It really is true - once you love someone, they live in your heart forever.

Does anyone else have this feeling that they're never going to find someone who loves them?,"I really, really cannot think of a reason why anyone would love me over any one else in the world. "
does anyone only feel happy when they are distracted?,"i have moments when i forget about things. moments when i am able to laugh and smile only because i am distracted. usually this occurs during school, with acquaintances. 

i experience these frequently but they don’t provide any emotional consolidation. i just end up remembering how shitty i am and going through a huge mood shift out in public. 

how about you guys? sometimes i am able to get caught up in a moment and forget, how about you?

Anyone just feel like a burden?,Does anyone else just feel like a burden? I feel like my entire life I’ve just relied on other people. I hate feeling like I need to rely on others just to get by. I’m well loved but I feel like my friends and family would be a lot better off if I were never around. I wish I could dissapear but it would hurt too many other people. I feel so alone even though I’m not. Why is there such a stigma against suicide? I wish I were alone.
Maybe I like being sad.,"When I'm not depressed 

I feel lost.

When I'm not hating myself 

I feel numb.

And I'd rather feel hurt 

than feel nothing.

What do I really have to be depressed over?

I'm not starving 

I have people who care about me

parents who love me.

All of my problems lead back to me.

Because

I'm worthless. I'm pathetic.

I'm narcissistic in the worst sense 

because when I'm not hating myself

I feel like I'm better than everyone.

But I know I'm not 

because I know I'm pathetic.

How can narcissism and depression mix like that?

How can I not feel like I'm insane?

Do I even deserve to think I'm going insane 

when there are people out there

who are genuinely struggling to know what's real

and what isn't?

All of my problems stem from myself.

I am a problem. 

I am THE problem. 

I am MY problem.

I don't want to die

but I want to die.

I want to die and end whatever this is 

because I can't take it.

I'm not strong.

Don't let them look at me 

like I'm someone of great strength

just because I live with this.

I'm weak.

I'm so weak I can't even reach out and ask for help.

I know I have too much pride

yet I do nothing to help it.

It's like I want to fail.

Like I know I'm doomed to fail and I'm sabotaging myself.

I hate this.

I hate myself and I hate everything.

I don't deserve anything.

I can't work towards anything 

because I'm so god damn depressed 

I'm scared I won't be able to fake normalcy anymore.

I don't want to keep pretending.

I'm exhausted.

This wasn't meant to be a poem, it's just how my thoughts were working mid-meltdown."
Don’t you hate it when you’re passively suicidal and not actively?,"Because you know you’re not gonna do it, and it sucks to want to be dead and not being able to. When you’re active, you’re like “Hooray! It’s almost over!”"
Does anybody else actually have a pretty decent life but still feel unhappy and like you just don’t really want to be here?,"I have a supportive family that loves me, a great career path, a relatively low stress life, a wonderful partner, and I can succeed at most things if I try hard enough but I still  feel unhappy regardless. I’m not really sure why. Does anyone else feel this way? "
I was just humiliated in a local cafe in front of a room full of customers for being depressed.,"I struggle with severe depression which can attack me just like that and cripple any social skills I might have. Today is one of those days. I went to get my lunch (I'm poor btw) I ordered chips. First the woman takes the piss out of how I talk and goes ""what's up with you!?"" When I didn't enjoy that pisstake so rather than explain my entire life of depression and people like her being cunty I just said that I'm a bit miserable in a tone that most people would get that I don't want to go onto it. This had the opposite effect of the ladies having a real laugh at my expense and that I should just cheer up. Wow! I'm cured I said the most sarcastic/angry tone I could muster, they just kept laughing and sent my colleague over to tell me to cheer up. I really enjoy getting laughed a d stared at for something beyond my control. So now I'm at work feeling worthless and pathetic."
I should get an award each time I get out of bed,The mental and physical bullshit I have to go through to do this and not get kicked out of school is just fucking outstanding
All the symptoms they don't tell you about...,"I always search up certain symptoms to understand where certain feelings/thoughts are coming from, but they never pop up. Here's a thread for the seriously disgusting, unknown ones that you feel embarrassed talking to your therapist about. I'll start.

1. I want to have a chronic illness (like cancer) so that I don't have to commit suicide, although I will if I am absolutely done.

2. Sometimes I randomly cry, for no reason at night.

3. I often feel homicidal and it sickens me.

4. I feel comfortable in my depression, I feel comfortable being sad, I feel comfortable NOT going outside. It's like a really sick morbid embrace. It makes me cry how much I don't want to get better; I just feel like I'm meant to die, like it would do the world a favour if I don't get better and I just die.

5. Sometimes I feel like depression is the only thing that's been there for me, since all my friends and family have given up on me. And that the least I can do for it, after helping me by standing by me so much all this while, is to finally kill myself.

Share yours, as horrible as they may be. Not talking about it makes you feel more alone."
Being suicidal without wanting to die,"It’s so hard to explain this headspace to people who aren’t depressed. I think about suicide every day, but I don’t *want* to die. I’m not harming myself, nor do I have plans to. I am completely safe! It’s just this thought I can’t get out of my head. I think about it daily. If anything’s bad happens my brain always jumps to “if you killed yourself you wouldn’t have to deal with this”. At first I thought that was normal, just thinking about suicide all of the time. I’ve realized that it’s not a “normal” thought, and it’s definitely not benefitting my mental health. How do I manage these thoughts? What has helped you to “rewire” that part of your brain? Thank you "
I have nobody to talk to,"I don't want to initiate a conversation just to feel rejected. I don't want to carry on a conversation just for them to realize how shitty I am. I don't want to pay for a therapist or counselor just to end up being dishonest with them. I don't want to talk to anyone online because that isn't nearly the same.

I don't even want to post this because I'm either gonna feel miserable when I get no upvotes/comments or feel superficial for feeling good when I get upvotes/comments. I'm so desperate for any kind of emotional intimacy but I'm too much of an fuck-up to do anything about it."
The side effects for my depression medication just gave me the biggest laugh I've had in a long time.,"So I'm looking up some side effects on the meds I'm taking and I laughed way too hard at this.

"Scumbag brain: 30 mins exercise & 1 hour's work is 'too much,' but it's fine staying up til 5am googling stupid shit","Like if you can get the card game from Witcher 3 as a standalone app (you can't, it took me 3 hours of searching to work that out). Yet tomorrow, i'll want to try and motivate myself to do just an hour's seo work, or a short jog and some hand weights, and my motivation just deflates at the thought of all that effort.

It's one of the stupidest traps, that you can't do shit if it is at all important, and yet if it isn't important, you don't want to 'waste' your time on it. And you end up doing fuck all anyway. 

E: To clarify: It's not simply procrastination. It's a weird glitch in my motivation where my brain anticipates an activity that will probably only take 10 minutes to an hour, but write it off due to feeling I won't have enough energy/time to do it successfully, so it'd be a waste of time. But instead of doing something productive instead, i'll then *actually* waste the time that it would have taken me to do the thing (by just checking my phone or whatever). 

And yet I do not encounter the same motivational 'lock' when picking up my phone to type a reddit post, or experiment with settlement layouts in fallout 4. Inconsequential activities that are *actually* wasting my time seem to slip past the 'waste of time' demotivator, at least until i've spent way too long on them and then feel bad. 

I don't know if i'm explaining this right, it's just a weird logic glitch i've been thinking about. You know, instead of working :("

Only to go to bed and wake up feeling just as bad if not worse, totally demotivated. 

I had plans yesterday to make today a special outing. I was going to see a movie by my self and then hit the bar for the first time to grab a drink. I woke up feeling like shit as usually and just slept to 12pm. I got nothing done and just thought about suicide all day, trying not to cry. "

"Life is too much effort and too expensive, and the worst part is I’m not even enjoying it","Life is way too much effort and too expensive. I'm tired of having to do all this shit just to maintain a half-decent life. I'm tired of having to feed myself to stave off hunger, eating right so I don't let myself get fat, exercising to try to maintain my health and make sure my body doesn't break down even though if I'm still alive by age 50 chances are I'll probably get cancer anyways. I'm tired of working an 8-6 meaningless corporate job just to pay a bunch of bills and rent that takes up 40% of my monthly paycheck even before factoring bills for a 300 sq ft apartment in a boring city whose only upside is the proximity to NYC (which honestly isn't even THAT close, still). There is no end point in sight. I've lost every passion I've had in life. I don't want to work; I can't see anything that I would enjoy doing for at least 50 hrs of the week for the rest of my life at this point, but I have no other choice if I don't want to become homeless and starve.  

The worst part of it is despite all this shit I have to do and upkeep, I'M NOT EVEN ENJOYING LIFE. I do everything ""right"" - I eat well, I make decent money to at least be financially independent from my parents, I exercise every day, I have hobbies, I have a small handful of friends. But I still find life meaningless and hopeless and such a pain in the ass. I can't shake my feelings of emptiness. The small nuggets of fleeting inconsistent happiness are not worth the daily annoying struggles that add up to a mountain over time. I wish my parents had never had me, or that some other sperm had won the race. I feel guilty for feeling this way since my parents sacrificed so much for a kid who is depressed and just wants to die lmao (then again, it wasn't my choice). Can’t catch the bus either, since I don’t want to hurt their feelings, and I’m deathly afraid of failing and leaving myself permanently crippled (if I’m gonna be miserable, I’d rather be miserable and physically capable vs miserable and maimed).  

I feel like life is a stupid cycle of most jobs being meaningless and MAYBE tolerable if you're lucky, so people turn to other people/their relationships and friendships for happiness/meaning. Although to be honest, people can be disappointing as well which can hurt way more than a bad day at work. Plus it's shit hard to make friends the older you get, and most of your friends are gonna drift away as they get married and have kids, and then you're stuck disappointed and alone again until you bring a kid into the world in a struggle to find meaning in this universe just for them to go through the same damn cycle. And all this makes me depressed in a cosmic way.

I feel very numb during this whole process. The topic of these ""conversations"" revolve around feeling worthless in every aspect. It feels like life is against me. I'm average in every way (looks, intelligence, skills). I feel like I will never amount to anything.

Kissed the girl of my dreams,"Just kissed the girl of which I thought was waaaay out of my league. I've really missed the feeling of happiness. FUCK YOU DEPRESSION

EDIT 1: Ok im going to present my story which isnt very special. I know her from a friends birthdayparty where we had a long talk about life and stuff. She was beautiful and I really liked her from the very beginning. As I mentioned I was 100% sure that she was way out of my league and I didnt even bother trying to flirt. I didnt want to go to (god bless I did) because I had a really shitty day. While being at the party I took some time of because I had a little down and she joined me and we began to chat. After the party me and a friend wanted to hang out and I didnt know that she was there as well. Soon my friend had to left and we were alone so we just talked casually. Afterwards I told her that I really enjoyed being with her and she answered with "" I truly did as well"" so I typed: "" When will be the next time?"" While writing that I kinda shitted myself because im such a coward. I sure to be denied but she said: ""Why not tomorrow?"" I was like wauw wtf and said ""Sure!"". Next day we decided to watch the naked gun and really enjoyed the movie. As she was about to leave I just grabbed all what was left of my pride and just went for it. Turned out that she is a very good kisser and I'm going to meet her again next week. If i wouldve not gone for it i wouldve hated myself as i do always when i back off while tryin to approach a girl. Thanks for all the comments and upvotes did not expect this big of an audience at all. Sorry for the bad english :D

Does anyone else think they truly can't be saved?,"I'm starting to think I just, just I can't be saved, ya know? There's no light at the end of my tunnel, no happy ending. I'm starting to think I am destined to kill myself, that I'm destined to die by my own hand. How could I not, everyone else has such a perfect life, they have their friends and lovers and all that shit, me, I only have one real friend, a few acquaintances, many people that look down on me, and everyone else is a stranger. I see them looking so happy, enjoying their youth, and it reinforces my belief that I am simply destined to die by my own hand. Slowly resigning to my fate."
Art makes me happy and sad at the same time. Here's a picture I painted yesterday.,"I have been very depressed and it feels like my life is a black hole lately. I love to paint, take pictures and draw, but having no self discipline or no will to start, and do not believe in myself it is hard to start something. I tried yesterday and made this painting. :) http://imgur.com/4LmFOn7"
No one wished me happy birthday today,"I thought I had friends. I don't have any friends. I have acquaintances at best. I didn't really understand that until today. I turned 16 today and only close family wished me happy birthday. I went to a nice dinner at a fancy restaurant and that was the extent of my birthday. I waited all day for just a single friend to text me ""hey happy birthday!"" Just some simple acknowledgement would have made my day. But life's never that easy, you don't get what you want. Even if it's a simple birthday wish.  "
I made myself breakfast.,"I want you guys to know that I made myself breakfast...or dinner, or whatever. The point is I got up and made myself food. Two eggs, two pieces of sausage, and a piece of bread. I tore up the bread into pieces so that I could (once the eggs were done), break the yolk over the bread you know? And then cut up the sausage with my fork and mix it all together.

It was fucking delicious.

Now I have a tall glass of orange juice that is tasty as fuck too. 

I'm proud of myself. Considering how depressed and up and down I've been...I went in the fucking kitchen, washed a pan, washed a cup, a bowl, a fork, and a spatula. I feel like a fucking champion for doing that. 

Fuck yeah.

Anyway, carry on."
Does anyone else sometimes feel that almost every decision they made was the wrong one.,"Lots of times I'll find myself ruminating about situations where I could have spoken up or said something differently. And usually what I come up with in my mind is/sounds 100 percent better than what I actually did. And then of course I'm stuck feeling depressed in the end, sometimes wishing for a time machine or a portal to the past to appear just so I could redo those things."
I don't want to participate in life,"I've struggled with depression in the past where I felt like my life was worthless. Recently I've been having this really weird feeling where it just feels like life is too boring to even bother participating. 

I just see life as a big waste of time. I dont want to go to school just to get some job to pay off my student loans, then to buy a house and spend the rest of my adulthood paying it off then to retire and sit around waiting to die. 

I wish there was another way to live in our society. I wish I could just wake up and see where the day takes me instead of having to wake up and repeat the same damn thing over and over again.

I dont wanna die but it feels like it would be way less stressful to be dead then to live out my life trying to pay off stuff that I didn't really want in the first place. 

I'm not even sure what to do anymore "
"Please, please don't ""could-be-worse"" anyone.","It invalidates the suffering that person is going through, makes them feel selfish for not being a starving child of the subcontinent, and, frankly, it's lazy.

My favourite personal experience with this one was when the cancer I got wasn't as bad as my brother's cancer (really) so my family could-be-worse'd me and I was essentially disallowed from being upset. 

My mum has apologsed after, how random, some grief training she had as a volunteer at the hospital.

All suffering is valid. Goddammit.

ETA - You guys are all so lovely. I might have a cry. The good cry."
"I've spent $172,000 and 7 years to become a lawyer and I'd rather pump gas for $8 an hour. (rant)","....not that there is anything wrong with pumping gas.

I really can't take the adversarial nature of this profession.  It erodes what little humanity I have left.  I can't stop working as an attorney because I have to pay my student loans.  I'm completely miserable.  I'm not suicidal, but I have often thought of how I can't be discharged of my student debt unless I die.  And that seems like the only logical solution for me to do what I want (which is not be an attorney).  People think I'm an attorney and it's all la-ti-da and all this shit, but it fucking sucks people.  Your clients are constantly upset if you don't win their case 100%.  Other attorneys are constantly scheming you to find some back-door way to fuck you (and your client) over.  If you're thinking about being an attorney, think long and hard (that's what she said).  I'm trapped.  I'm miserable.  I can't leave the state because then I can't work.  I can't quit because I have to repay the $172k in student loans.  Fuck this profession. Only other attorneys truly understand what I'm talking about - and it's still taboo to open up about mental health because when you're screened before becoming an attorney they flat out ask you if you have mental health issues.  It's also a fast-track to a disciplinary hearing.  

It's time to change this bullshit narrative.  It's time for other professionals to be open.  I'm tired of this facade.  "
"I don't like being alive anymore, and I can't kill myself because my mother is still alive. Fuck this planet. Fuck following misprinted lies. Fuck participating in banal hobbies. It's all fake and everyone numbs themselves into believing the rat race of society is the only way to live.",Fuck all of this.
I sleep to avoid the pain of being awake,And when I can't sleep I just want to die
This is my goodbye.,"Hi, I'm a long-time lurker here.  I just wanted to say that today is my last day here.  I do not belong in this subreddit any longer.  

What I'm saying is, I do not feel depressed any more.  I've felt this way for several months, but I couldn't be too sure.  However, today was my last day with my therapist, and it was perfect timing.  

I have not been on medication, I've only been in therapy since April 2013.  This was the first time I ever left my therapist outside of moving away (I grew up moving an average of once per 2-3 years) and I think it was the right decision.  

I do not feel brought down by problems in my life, or let my anxiety get the better of me.  I see doors instead of walls.  I see friends instead of enemies.  I see love instead of hatred or fear.  

The world has become beautiful again.  And I truly believe it will stay that way for a long time.

Thank you for listening :)  

Edit:  I came back here and wow, hi again.  I feel so warmed by all of the responses you guys have given.  One commenter asked how I got to this place.  My answer is consistent therapy, and finding a strong support group, mostly friends and my family.  I've been in and out of therapy since I was 12 years old after my first suicide attempt.  Honestly, I had to really make a conscious effort in my life to improve it.  Maybe I'm lucky, maybe this won't last for long, but basically what I did was find out what things exactly in my life were bringing me down.  What did I hate being a part of?  For me, that was religion.  Some people live happy, fulfilling lives by serving God or other deities, but I am not one of them.  In doing so, I found autonomy in my life choices.  I no longer feel guilty over certain aspects, such as my thoughts on sexuality, or perfection.  

But again, these are my own realizations.  Many of you have stated a hope to be in my position, and from they way I've been feeling and living my life, I hope for you to do so as well.  Once again, thank you very much for the well wishes and congratulations all around.  ((hugs))"
DAE keep themselves awake at night even when they're super tired because they don't want the next day to begin?,Lately I've been staying up until I eventually crash out of sleepiness because I dread starting a new day. Sometimes I stay up all night dreading going through another fucking day in life.
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH,thanks for listening
Apparently there's a limit on how depressed a depressed person is allowed to feel.,"Almost every time /r/depression gets mentioned in other subs (such as [this askreddit thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/2wri29/which_subreddit_would_you_like_to_shake_some/cotkc4w?context=3)), people say how this place is ""toxic"" and that people here would rather talk about how depressed they are rather than ways to get better.

Think about that. They're literally condemning us for not being optimistic enough.

They claim they take depression seriously and how 'difficult it can be to face', but if you are so depressed that you're consumed by apathy and hopelessness, then they stop pretending to care and tell you to stop feeling sorry for yourself and to ""go do something about it"". It's like they think venting and looking for emotional validation and support is the worst thing a depressed person can do. *Obviously* being told a hundred times to exercise, go to a therapist, and meditate is the most helpful. *I was doubtful the first 99 times, but that last one sure changed my life!*

The worst part is that a lot of the time it's people who used to have depression saying these things. You know, those with the ""if I can do it, so can you!"" mentality-- similar to ex-smokers and ex-fat people in that regard.

It just seems like the more depressed you are, the less people want to help. And if they *do* try to help, they get angry if their advice and platitudes aren't met with anything other than gratitude and positivity. That's why I wonder if I should even bother opening up to my friends and family; knowing them, they'd do the exact same thing.

Sorry for the long rant. Perhaps a positive ending to counteract all that toxic nonsense: *Ahem*, I love all you guys so much! We got this as long as we believe in ourselves! WOO :DDD. ^^okay ^^let ^^me ^^throw ^^up ^^now"
Anyone else get knocked down really easily?,"Does anyone else get knocked down so easily by seemingly small things or instances because it just adds to the bigger issue that lingers in the mind? I have an issue with self-esteem, self-doubt, and just having a default mood that's negative. Small issues come up that any regular, resilient person would be able to brush off, but I can't because it just puts that thought in my head that goes ""see? This is confirmation that you're a worthless piece of shit,"" and so it offsets my mood so deeply that anyone observing me would wonder why it bothers me so much, because all they see is a small issue that can be easily get over, not the deeper problem at hand.
Fuck, man. Fuck."
The saying 'a permanent solution to a temporary problem' loses it's meaning after you had the problem for your whole life,
"My fate rests in this title. This title decides if you're going to click on the post or walk away. It decides if I'm going to go to sleep tonight crying or reassured.. Hey there. 16 years old and depressed, how are you?","Did my title catch your attention enough? Good. Because I have no idea what to write here. Only time I need to use a subreddit like this is when I'm really freaked out, and when I'm upset like this I can't think straight and write some awesome cool post for you, sorry. 

Edit: wow! I had no idea this would blow up like it did. The reason why I made a title that demanded such attention was because I saw all these other posts flying by with 1 or 0 comments on them. Thank you for all the responses. I'm going to be writing an update post which will be titled something along the lines of [""My Fate Rests in this Title: UPDATE""](https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/5rq7la/my_fate_rests_in_this_title_update/?st=1Z141Z3&sh=7366df76) creative..

Mom just told me that depression isn’t real and to kill myself.,"merry christmas

i told my family about what ive been going through this past semester and my mom just told me to stop being a bitch and that depression isn’t real. She said if I were actually depressed I should just kill myself because im obviously making shit up. My grades werent the greatest this semester and thats apparently all I am to my family.

idk where else i could post this and just needed to get it out of my mind."
I wish I was as depressed as the first time I thought I was depressed.,
Just found this sub. This is pretty much how I'm feeling right now. I couldn't decide if this belonged here or in r/anxiety,
nobody wished me a happy birthday :(,"i turn 17 today, and i only got a “happy birthday” from my family. i kind of knew all my “friends” were fake, but it just sucks to celebrate alone. "
"Ever wondered whether you're not sick, but just a shitty person?","Depression is an illness, but how do I know I'm not just a shitty person pretending to be depressed. I do shitty stuff, I knowingly make wrong decisions and hurt people and I don't change. Sounds like a pretty shitty person to me."
A friend texted me after a nightmare,"I woke up this morning to a text from my friend, saying she had a nightmare. Apparently I had terminal cancer and three weeks to live. She must have still been sleepy because she wanted to make sure I didn't actually have cancer. It's such a little thing, but it made me really happy to know someone would miss me if I was gone."
Life feels like a job I want to quit,Title 
Do you find yourself day dreaming of what you could be/could’ve been a lot,"Ever since i was growing up especially since highschool i’ve found myself more and more day dreaming or thinking about what I could be or could’ve been. And this has been an ongoing thing for me even when I wasn’t super depressed. 

Like i’d get my first girlfriend and she’d be away on a camp our school ran. Then i’d think of what we would do during camp and obsess over it as if I missed the boat on something big. I have trouble moving forward for some reason. Did i have some form of depression back then or some form of self hatred? 

My depression is in full effect lately and all I can do is day dream in my bed. I dont really know what to think. "

TFW your depression and anxiety is so bad that you need to leave work but your boss doesn't believe that mental health is a legitimate reason so you lie and fake being sick and are still not allowed to leave.,Someday I'll work for people that treat me like a human being. Maybe?
Its so hard to see all my friends succeeding while I fail,"Studying computer science has always been my dream since I was young. I'm 23 years old, never had a girlfriend. I don't have social skills, I tried everything.

Today I had my first exam of 4th semester and I failed. I couldn't answer a thing. And there are 4 more to come. I know I will fail some of them too. And it's not like I didnt learn. I'm probably just too stupid. Meanwhile all my friends succeed, get good grades, have girlfriends. It's killing me. I'm about to cry. Theres no reason left to live when I drop out. "
I fucking hate myself,Just wanted to let that out. 
My mom found and went through my diary.,"Not sure why she thought it would be okay to do that. but. she did. My diary was filled to almost the end with my depression and complaints about how she wanted me to act normal and be normal and how she continuously told me that my life isn't bad and i'm just making up the severe depression that i was diagnosed with while in the hospital. To top it off, Not long ago I went through a pregnancy scare and was brainstorming ideas. I had a few names down.

Earlier today she tossed my journal on the counter and loudly told me that everyone in the house had read my diary, laughed about it, and began to laugh at me and the names I had picked out. She told me that I need to stop feeling sorry for myself and that the diary was fair game because it wasn't hidden. Well. No it wasn't hidden, but it was among the books in my bookshelf and did not look like a book at all. My name was in the cover and everybody decided that once again, my stuff was fair game to them. Proving once again that no matter what I do to try and get my feelings out my mom will find out and laugh at me again. So. I feel like shit and have just been locked in my room since hearing everyone outside my door calling me lazy. yay.

Edit:

It's been three month since this has happened and, as I write, I'm sitting in a different state, living with my father, working a job I absolutely love with a girlfriend who has assisted me in this big change. My mother still messages me on the daily trying to guilt me and i'm doing my best to ignore every attempt. Things are going to be okay, I'm going to be okay. No other way but up now! "
"I haven't been able to focus or concentrate since I became majorly depressed, but today I studied for the first time in six months! :)","I've been depressed for years, in the last six months it became severe, and I tried to kill myself. I haven't been able to concentrate or focus since. Today is the first day I've done any kind of schoolwork for half a year. I wrote a [whole page of notes](http://imgur.com/a/PwTZx) and studied for half an hour. It doesn't seem like a lot, but it's a huge win for me, and I wanted to share it with people who understand. I'm 16, and I dropped out of school last year because I couldn't do anything. Now I'm finally getting back on track :)"
I fantasize about someone else killing me because suicide isn’t acceptable,"I constantly fantasize about being caught in the cross fire of a shooting or accidentally being hit by a car. I often hope that I will be the target of a random murder. All this because suicide isn’t socially acceptable, and this way I don’t have to do it myself. My plan used to be to slit my wrists, but apparently when you slit them you have to cut quite deep past layers of fat to the bone. I don’t think I could handle that, but I want to leave this world so fucking badly. I saw a post that asked if you felt you were destined for suicide, and that really resonated with me. I’ve repeatedly told my (horrified) parents over the years that they should not be surprised if I commit suicide. I am nearly 100% sure that I will die before 30 (currently 20F), and I’ve known this since I was about 13.

EDIT: wow, i’m honestly so relieved that i am not alone in this. the fact that you all are alive with me and also struggling with the same thing actually really helps. thanks so much to everyone who commented. we’re all gonna make it."
Anyone else not talk about themselves to people fearing that you'll sound like you just want attention?,
nondepressed people don't realize how lucky they are,I Wonder what it's like to not have to deal with depression. People don't realize how lucky they are. like I wonder what it must be like to live your entire life and year after year feel mostly content with your mood and life. It must be nice. I have to deal with depression every single fucking day of my life. Life is hard enough with a mental illness why is it so unfair why can't I be lucky for once. I hate dealing with this I can't do it. They don't realize how lucky they are. They don't realize how much pain a person can be in every day because of depression. 
"I decided to describe what it's like to have depression, with pictures.",
I bought paint today.,"I've grown increasingly depressed and anxious over the past couple of months and today it was unbearable. I was go to go home tonight and kill myself. Lots of self hatred and worthlessness was in my soul today and I decided it was finally time. On my way home from work I was driving past a local craft store and thought back to how happy I used to be when I was younger and would mess around on a canvas. I haven't painted for 7 years. I decided to stop and take a look around for old times sake. They were having a 50% off sale on all paint supplies so I bought a set of watercolours, a canvas, and a few brushes and headed home. I just finished painting for 2 hours instead of planning out how I was finally going to go. I don't feel incredibly happy or anything but I don't feel like dying tonight. Can't vouch for tomorrow but in this moment I am okay with being alive for another night.

Update: Sorry I posted this and then crashed for the night. I fucking love all of you and can't begin to explain how much you mean to me. Random internet people, isn't that wild? Thanks for taking the time to read my post and leaving such wonderful comments. "
I’m not cut out for the real world,It’s too confusing. I’m too dumb. I make mistakes all the time.

I KNOW I NEED TO MOVE ON I KNOW SHES NOT COMING BACK INTO MY LIFE. I LOST EVERY GOOD OPPORTUNITY TO YOU DEPRESSION. FUCK YOU. I FUCKING HATE EVERY INCH OF YOU AND ME. NO MATTER HOW MANY TIMES I MANAGE TO BEAT YOU YOU JUST COME RIGHT THE FUCK BACK. YOU RUIN EVERYTHING I EVER TOUCH. IVE LOST EVERYTHING I CARED ABOUT TO YOU.

I DONT WANT LIFE AFTER DEATH. I JUST WANT TO STOP EXISTING.
I just want to go back to the time before the world broke my spirit.,"Sometimes it's difficult to realize how much you've deteriorated until you take a look back several years. 10 years ago I was a fresh college student and while the beginning was very difficult (dealing with my mother's sudden suicide was extremely hard), after about a year things were starting to look up.

It wasn't even so much hanging out with friends or going to parties, as I was very introverted and didn't do any of that. I was also depressed back then, but it was much less severe (dysthymia). I still had hope, I still had some brightness and optimism left in me. I still had things to look forward to, and I could still enjoy my life to some degree. Life in general just felt better.

All that's gone now. The world has chewed me up, spat me out and now I feel like a cynical bitter old man. I feel dead inside, I can't enjoy anything like I used to. All that hope is gone and replaced with loneliness, defeat, chronic pain and the looming threat of becoming homeless.

I just want to go back to those college days. God it really hurts sometimes."
"Anyone else really feel like they need to talk, but don't actually know what to say?",I just feel really upset and I have this nagging feeling to talk to someone but my thoughts are all over and I just can't get myself to since I don't even know what I'd say. I hate all this

I want to die but I don't want to kill myself.,"I know this probably isn't an uncommon feeling. But I want to die but I don't feel suicidal (if that's even possible). Like I would never go out of my way to physically harm myself or purposely kill myself. But like I wouldn't be upset if the universe decided to end my life. Like the idea of getting in my car and getting into a fatal car crash is actually comforting. But the idea of dying by my own hands makes me feel sick.  

Like if I could close my eyes and never wake up that would be a dream come true.  But I would never take pills (or do anything else) to purposely make that that happen. 

I just feel so numb to life.  I feel like I've been numb to life since I was 10. Like I don't know if I've felt genuinely happy in years. Like nothing excites me. I just don't see the point in anything. I don't see the point in living. 

I've gotten help in the past and gave it my best shot because I didn't want to live life like this. I don't want to live life like this. But part of me feels like there is no other way for me to live life. I don't have much I am passionate about. I have a heard time forming attachment to people and things (except my cat). I love my family and my SO very much but sometimes I feel like they could disappear out of my lives forever and I wouldn't feel a thing. And that scares me. Like my grandfather passed away and I didn't feel a thing and I loved him very much. My godfather too. Like I felt sad but not how I should feel. I felt robotic. Like it was a fake sad.  And I have a hard time missing them. I know I should miss them but it's hard to miss them. I just don't know. 

I know I need help but i want help but it's hard to believe that life could be different at all. "
Xpost from r/4chan (This really hit home to me),
Loneliness is probably the worst things I’ve experienced,"That’s it really I wouldn’t wish it on anyone, I just wish I had people to check up on me or try to do something. I hate being alone."
It kinda makes me sad that most of the people on this subreddit are amazing people,"Nearly every post I've made under my accounts have always gotten really heartfelt replies that I couldn't hope to get from anyone that I've met irl.

I want my dad to lose his job. I want to be bullied. I want to lose a limb. I just want something to fuck me up so I can get the fucking courage to kill myself instead of sitting at home wishing that I was dead. I JUST WANT MORE BAD THINGS TO HAPPEN.

I'm sorry I cancel our plans. I just don't have the energy to pretend to be ok on someday when you want to hang out. And I don't want you to worry since it has been a long time since we've met up. I'm afraid that if I go out with you that I'll break down and you won't want me anymore. Thank you for inviting me though, I do appreciate it."
Asked a girl out.,"Asked a girl out from one of my classes. I sit next to her and talked with her sometimes before class. She said no, but I’m still a little proud that I didn’t chicken out. 

I feel like I made her feel gross by asking her, but I don’t know. I can’t tell which if its a genuine feeling or a false one from my depression.  I always feel like a creep when I do things like this. I can’t tell if these feelings are justified or my mind lying to me. "

I realized how daydreaming has ruined my life and I was roleplaying multiple personalities in my mind for 10 years,"I realized a few days ago that I was suffering from maladaptive daydreaming for the last 10 years.For those who don’t know about [Maladaptive daydreaming](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0ahUKEwiynrjw2MLLAhXQwY4KHZNAChkQFggbMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMaladaptive_daydreaming&usg=AFQjCNH7SXZedX3BicLpcZmzNWN4mTrJQg&bvm=bv.116636494,d.c2E&cad=rja)


Physically I was living one life and mentally I was living 3-4 versions of myself.This may sound ridiculous but it is true. All my life,I thought I had no dreams,aims,goals,aspirations or whatever.I was lackadaisical about most of the things in life.


During 8th grade, I started daydreaming.At that time I thought it was probably the best use I can make of my mind.I can be anyone I want.I can do anything I want.I can do this by just imagining stuff.For hours I dreamt about things that I wanted.At that time I wanted to be a footballer.


I would imagine playing for my favourite football club,playing for my country.All of those scenarios I made up my mind.I became lazier.The girl I had a crush on, I would imagine spending time with her.The same thing continued for 2-3 years. As I took admission in an average college,I started to imagine that I am in a top,well known college. Returning home after college, I resume my daydreaming again.


There was a point when I thought sleeping is a better option.I had 4-5 dreams per session of sleep. My life had become so boring that I used to sleep for about 20 hours so that I could have something interesting atleast in my dreams.The daydreaming was not going to end.
I had 3-4 versions of myself which I roleplayed in my mind.


1 a football player 

2.An ordinary citizen with a good job and a SO 

3.This roleplay was used by me for NSFW purposes.


After college,being indecisive as ever,these versions started influencing me. I spent more time daydreaming.After I failed to crack an exam required for higher education,I started daydreaming about successfully cracking that exam and taking admission to a new college. All the failures in my life were overshadowed by daydreaming.Maybe this is why I am jobless,with no life at all.I was as depressed as one can get. I tried to quit this habit of daydreaming.


All the characters that I created in my fantasies spoke with me all the time. I try to avoid them as much as I can, but they have become a part of me.


As of now I have’nt daydreamed for a day and this probably is the longest I’ve gone.Thank you for reading this and no I don’t have suicidal thoughts"
Depression.exe,"You have no idea why you've caught it. It closes all programs as soon as they open. You get a snippet of hope as you see the program opening in the taskbar, only to be immediately let down as it closes itself. 

You're left staring into a desktop background it has made just for you: dark and hopeless and sad. 

You avoid even turning on your computer, opting to just stay in sleep mode for most of the day.

You feel ashamed of being the only one who can't seem to shake this virus and avoid anyone seeing your shame.

To strangers or friends you act like its functioning fine, pretending to relate to their small talk. You are perpetually isolated.

To the few you do tell about the problem, you find them laughing it off, telling you to reboot or just open a new program - as if you haven't tried that already. 

The frustration is intense. A handful promise it will disappear on its own. Another few recommend antivirus software that you struggle to buy, let alone activate successfully. 

You feel desperate and alone, and seriously consider shutting down once and for all.

But the promise that maybe one day programs will open, maybe some miracle will occur, leaves you staring into the desktop abyss, numb and alone, writing clunky horrible metaphors on the back of your hand."

Anyone else really want to die but don't want to commit suicide?,"Like, you'd be cool with dying in your sleep, getting hit by a train, etc. But taking a bottle of pills or blowing your brains out just isn't appealing for whatever reason?

"Check-In Post, with some info about contacting the moderators","Welcome to /r/depression's check-in post - a place to take a moment and share what is going on and how you are doing. If you have an accomplishment you want to talk about (these shouldn't be standalone posts in the sub as they violate the ""role model"" rule, but are welcome here), or are having a tough time but prefer not to make your own post, this is a place you can share.

Hey everyone.  Sorry about letting the previous check-in post get archived. 

But I got messages in my personal inbox about the previous post expiring, and that isn't the best practice for several reasons.  It's not exactly appropriate (like going to someone's house, uninvited, instead of their office) and makes extra work for us (because we then have to keep the rest of the mod team in the loop).  Most importantly, there is no guarantee that any individual moderator will read their personal messages in a timely fashion or even be online at any given time, so it can delay action on your questions or concerns.  

The only way you should contact the moderators of any subreddit (unless explicitly advised otherwise) is via modmail, i.e. the ""message the moderators"" links you see in the community info in the sidebars.  If you're using an app or client that doesn't offer you an option to message the moderators, you can always send a modmail by putting the name of the subreddit, e.g. /r/depression, in the To box.  

We know that reddit does a pretty terrible job of making it obvious that modmail is a thing, especially for mobile users, so we don't blame anyone who doesn't know about modmail.  But we want you to be aware since it will help you if you ever have an issue where you need us, especially if you need us urgently.

Struggling with losing my intelligence to depression.,"I was debating with someone over a historical topic and I'm really frustrated. I'm absolutely sure that I'm right, but I can't organize my thoughts or present my case in a way that makes any sense. I try to research, but as I read one sentence I forget everything that came before it. This was taught to me in middle school, and I now I can't understand any of it."
Does anyone else want to stay in bed all day?,"Not doing anything really and not sleeping, just lay there while staring at the ceiling/wall in front of me. All the while thinking how worthless I am, how much I have to do, and how the world and everyone in it would be better off if I were dead.

Have a good Saturday everyone."
The education system is fucking dehumanizing.,"I think a lot of my depression is contributed to this shitty education system. It doesn’t reward being your own individual self with your own talent, doesn’t reward creativity and innovation. It’s too old fashioned, in the past being good at following orders was what will get you through life so that you can become a factory worker, but nowadays being good at just following orders will get you nowhere. Being told what to do, doing it in only one “correct” way, every single week 5 days a week. It does shit to your brain really, it’s a system meant for robots, not human beings. And the importance on grades. Guess what, if you don’t reach this certain number, your a worthless piece of trash that will never amount to anything. It’s so fucking.. stupid. No wonder depression is at its peak in this century."
I wish life had a reset button,"Then I could start all over again, and not fuck everything up and become the worthless loser I am now

Does anyone else catch themselves turning on the fake happy when talking to others?,I feel a bit melodramatic because I know plenty of people are so depressed that they can't get out of bed or function. But as someone who has managed to keep an academic life going in spite of being increasingly depressed I've noticed how distant I am from my feelings in my interactions with others. I go home to my room where all I can think about is how I hate myself and how I'll never be happy but when I'm around others I've become very good at putting on the happy face and being friendly. I think about how dark my thoughts get sometimes in comparison to how lighthearted I pretend to be around others. A lot of people would  be shocked if I told them I was depressed. And the worst part of it all is you begin to feel like you don't know yourself anymore. The extremes of you pretending to be happy and how you actually feel become so surreal that you lose yourself. It's the loneliest feeling in the world to have everyone think you're happy and successful when you're actually miserable.
"Sometimes i just want to spend a day or two, laying on my cold dark room, alone, no interaction with anyone, no phone, no internet, no tv, no music, no nothing, just me and my mind, oh and crying, a lot of crying.","I just want to go into nothingness, go into the bottom, just myself. I may let it all out and spend all the time crying. 

I may will talk to God too on that loneliness (if He is exist), just complaining, talk bad things, just wondering, ""Why am I like this? Why this is happening? Why can't I be fixed? Why can't I be happy? Why everyone is? Why you left me here rotting?"" "

I told one of my friends that I was sexually abused by a women as a child. He laughed... I guess it's that how the world works because males are meant to enjoy sex. Love how the world placed labels and brainwashed us to picture how the world is meant to work,

I've come to realise that im extremely sensitive. I get depressed really easily. A word or phrase told about me can make me depressed for like hours. depression is seriously killing me.,"Edit: thank you very much for all your support. I didnt expect anyone to care tbh. Anyways, I will try to see things differently(though its gonna take a long time) "
Depression has turned me into an asshole.,"I used to be a nice person. Like, the kind who would go out of their way to help others and do good deeds. I would be extra kind to everyone because I didn’t want to hurt anyone’s feelings...

Now, I give zero shits. I don’t care about anyone’s feelings. Happy people piss me off and I’m not afraid to show it. I have no social life and I am okay with that. I don’t need anyone or anything to make me happy because I can never be happy. Oh well."

Lost my mom.,"At 12:50pm on Monday 10, March, 2019, my mom passed away.

I do not have the words to express how empty and alone I feel. I cannot believe that I will never see or hear again. The world keeps moving. I am having trouble finding meaning in any of this. She was not ready to die and I believe that only when she knew she was in trouble she accepted what was going to happen. 

I am stuck with the memories of her suffering in that hospital bed; memories I feel will haunt me for the rest of my life. I never expected her not to make it, so the suffering seemed acceptable. I miss her so much. Even though I have siblings, I always felt it was my job to look after her. I feel that I have failed in this task. I have so much guilt. I wish I could have done more. 

Mommy I miss you and will love you forever. Please forgive me for letting you down. I live in the hope that one day I will be with you again. I do not know if love can help you where you are, but if it can, you have all of mine. Love you Mom.

Edit - Update: Today, 18-MAR-2019, was the funeral. I didn't know what to say for her so I essentially read my post. Now begins a new chapter in my life. 

For everyone that expressed their sympathy or kind words, thank you so much. It helped. To those that also lost someone, thank you for sharing and I am so sorry for your loss."
Overdosed on pills. Woke up in the hospital.,"*POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING* please be safe

Last night, I was taking a few pills to get a good trip, to feel good, then as the night progressed; the feelings of anxiety about suicide washed away and so, I took more pills. 

Soon later I began to have muscle spasms. Walked to the kitchen to prep myself something to eat, thinking it might call it down. Only 'til eventually it got so bad I couldn't stand up and collapsed three times. The third time it happened I thought ""*fuck it, I'll just lie down here, this is how it ends*"".. No regret, or anxiety.

This is where four hours later I woke up in hospital with my big brother sitting next to me, as he had done since I was brought in. Way up 'til I left. He never left my side. Which is surprising because we aren't exactly close.

Three hours later, I left and arrived home to a crying mom and heartbroken dad. They didn't think they'd see me again and my OD was completely out of the blue for them, since I never mentioned anything was wrong.

-*How I was found*- Everyone heard the thuds of me collapsing in the kitchen. Brother inspected the sound and found me seizing, throthing at the mouth. Immediately called 999. Dad rushed downstairs and mam was screaming. 

-*After Thoughts*- In what seemed like my last moments of life, I was surprisingly happy like, care free. As all the disappointment and worry washed away from me as death came closer. Waking up was honestly.. disappointing. Like, ""no, why am I still here"". Embracing my family and working through what's been troubling me helped, but I still can't just feel disappointed. I'm not sure if I'm happy to be here.

EDIT: Not condoning suicide, nor encouraging it. After seeing how sad I made my family, facing the possibility of my death, has reinforced me to never try it again. This is merely how I feel now and will without a doubt change in the future. No one in the middle of a hurricane is happy. That's exactly what this moment in my life is. A hurricane I need to ride out. In later years I'll be happy I was unsuccessful.

2 Edit: Wow... Went to sleep with a couple replies. Woke up to over 40. Jeez. Did not expect this big of a response from the sub. I read here a lot, comment sometimes, post never. Thank you for everyone who's taken the time to read my little mello-dramatic story and the ones who've left a comment. "
Does anyone else wonder about what their potential if they weren't depressed?," Early on as a kid, I was a really bright student (I know this doesn't mean much because I was in elementary school). I would get perfect As on all of my assignments/homework and I didn't even try at all. My depression began after changing school districts and moving around a few times during the 3rd grade. That year was hell as a kid. I changed schools 3 times, had no friends, and had my first suicide attempt during recess (I might be saving this one for a different post). I devoloped some bad habits and was notoriously lazy. I would dodge all of my homework/schoolwork by sleeping in, playing video games and reading books. In terms of my social life, my friends were fake as hell to me but I stuck with them for 8 fucking years because I was too scared to make any new friends.

I didn't mention before but my social anxiety was and still is worse than my depression. I can get my mind off of how depressed I am but I'm terrified of opening up and talking to people. I could have had several relationships in school and could have improved my social life if I wasn't such a bitch. I did almost nothing in high school because I was to depressed to see a point. Worst part is, my Dad sacrificied A LOT to put me ahead in life but I am behind. I could have been ahead of my peers with the oppurtunities and situation that I was in but instead, I am a HS dropout with no friends, no experience in the real world with minimal social skills. My potential was there in the past but I am too behind to function in society. I just want to roll over and die"
Anybody else painfully aware of the fact that nobody really likes them?,It's like some of us aren't even human beings. 
People always told me I was smart and had so much potential.,"And here I am, completely wasting it.

I spend 8 hours a day doing mundane, soulless work. Then I go home and work on fun projects, like writing and drawing, not because they're going to take me anywhere, but just so I can tell myself I'm trying.

I'm not trying. I'm exhausted from trying. I don't know what I want to do with my life and thinking about it just makes me feel like garbage. Everything I enjoy doing, if I imagine myself doing it for a living I see it being miserable and a huge mistake.
I don't have enough time or energy to put effort into everything I enjoy, so one by one I'm going to drop each and every one until I have nothing.

But I'm smart, so I'll ""figure it out."""
I got a girlfriend today,I just felt like telling someone since noone else seems to care.
"Well, I just ran a mile. Now this may seem like no achievement to most people, but considering I have been too depressed to exercise for months, it's a big achievement in my eyes. Fuck off, depression. ",
I have no friends and am alone in my room every day :(,"I feel so sad, no one talks to me and I always end up talking to creeps just to have someone to speak to. The only friends I have are from tv shows or youtube. Also having a heavy period and feel like total shit. No one has spoken to me all day and when I made the effort it wasnt returned"
It's amazing how quick I can go from 100 to 0. Depression is one patient motherfucker.,Fucking Christ.
Anyone else's depression triggered by the smallest thing?,"For example, I was at a ""Friendsgiving"" with my closest buddies and everything was going well for 3-4 hours.  Everyone was laughing, telling stories, jokes, genuinely having a good time.  Then I make one bad joke and everyone gives me the pity laugh, it gets quiet, and someone says ""sorry, that was just a bad joke"".  I know that I wasn't being made fun of or anything, but after that incident I just couldn't bring myself to talk or participate.  An hour later I found an excuse to leave even though the day wasn't even halfway over, we were planning on chilling throughout the night.    
    
Anyone else experience this?"
Suicide not selfish. Think twice before opening your mouth.,"So, yesterday I had a post talking about people saying suicide is selfish. Just like the title suggests, think twice before opening your mouth. I honestly believe when people spread their ignorence around this topic it will do the greatest harm. There is a stigma around any mental health issues and because of this people needing help won't reach out. They will feel the guilt and feel blamed. Before you say anything to someone who is hurting deep down you should do some research.  IT COULD SAVE THEIR LIFE. Someone sent me this quote and I couldn't agree more with it.


 David Foster Wallace once said:

""The so-called ‘psychotically depressed’ person who tries to kill herself doesn't do so out of quote ‘hopelessness’ or any abstract conviction that life's assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill herself the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise. Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire's flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It's not desiring the fall; it's terror of the flames. Yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling."""
Am I the only one that does this?,
"I’m a stay at home mom, and I don’t like my kids anymore.","As the title says I stay home with my kids. It’s not really physically exhausting. I know that my husband, who works in the oils fields, has a much harder job than I do. He is gone two weeks at a time and home for a week. When he does work he works long 16 hour days. So I try not to vent to him too much because, damn his job is hard. 

I have three kids: 6, 5, and 3. The six year old goes to school during the day and the other two are home with me. I also nanny a little girl before she goes to day care for about an hour and a half and I pick her up and have her for around an hour. Honestly my kids really aren’t bad. Sure they fight with each other occasionally and they spill things and make messes, but nothing out of the ordinary for kids. 

I am so mentally spent though. My day starts at 5:30 in the morning and goes until about nine at night. There is always someone needing something all the time. I never have a minute to think about anything for myself. I am always either cooking a meal, cleaning up after the meal, cleaning the house in general, breaking up fights, or wiping someone’s ass. I can’t even go into the bathroom by myself without somebody bursting in because one looked at another in a weird way. 

I am so tired. I have found myself slowly retreating to my room more and more. The dishes are starting to pile up and I don’t know when the last time I mopped the floor was. This morning at 3 my three year old came in to tell me she peed her bed. I put a pull up on her before she went to sleep and for some reason she decided she needed to take it off and ended up soaking her mattress. As I’m in there cleaning up her mess my six year old tells me he peed his bed. He hasn’t peed his bed in years. Why on earth it happened tonight I don’t know. So now I have to clean that up too. 

After I was done I laid in my bed and just cried. I’m so tired. I know it was my choice to have children. I know it’s not their fault and they are just being kids. I want to go back to work. I want to talk to adults. I want friends again :( I try so hard not to take anything out on them. But sometimes I snap and I feel so guilty. So I feed them turn on cartoons and go to my room. I feel like such a terrible mother. I love them. I really do,but I’m exhausted. I have had this feeling of dread looming over me for quite sometime now and I have done a pretty good job of keeping it at bay, but I don’t think I can anymore. I know one day they won’t need me as much anymore and I’ll probably regret feeling this way but I can’t shake it. 


Replying to all of you lovely people:

The outpouring of love and support has me in tears. Day care out here is phenomenal. It’s 155 a week for just one child so two would be 310 and that 1240 a month. I wouldn’t be able to get a job to cover that as amazing as that sounds.

I do although love the idea of getting a membership to the ymca. With summer approaching I am dreading what I am going to do with all three of them home. Going to the y seems like it would be a good choice for me and them. They could have an activity to do during th day while I have time to do what I want. 

I feel better knowing I’m not alone in the way that I feel. I consider myself to be a very physical person meaning that I love being touched or hugged but when it’s three kids constantly hanging on you it can be a lot.

I do try very hard not to take my emotions out on the kids which is why I go to my room, even if it is only five minutes before someone is knocking on the door. 

Thank you so much for all of your kind words. I did speak to my husband and of course he was very understanding and interested in getting something together for me to get out of the house more. If I may, he really is the most perfect man. "
2 days ago I got a new girlfriend and she said the most amazing thing to me. [success story],"So I met a girl about a month and half ago and we hit it off really well. apparently I did something right because she doesn't like dating. She's never had a boyfriend and she pretty much turned down everyone who has asked in the past. But she said yes to being my girlfriend.

But the most amazing part is what she said the other day. I told her in full confidence that I'm worried about letting people close because my depression and anxiety hurt people before. I told her everything. My suicidal thoughts. My self harm. My depressive episodes. And she just looked at me and said, ""Well I knew all that going in and I still said yes."" 

That was one of the most beautiful things I've heard in a while. Gave me the first genuine smile I've had in over a year.

EDIT: WOW! Holy shit, I go away for a day and this blew up! Thank you all so much. I hope all of you find success as well. X)

EDIT 2: Okay! I think I've responded to everyone! I hope all is well with you my friends!"
"The guy who made ""I just commited suicide..."" 30 days ago","Hello /r/drepression, 
my name is Lukas,
some of you may have read the post i made 30 days ago. I tried to take my own life and documented in this subreddit. after i went through different hospitals and had the worst and most painful night of my life i am recovered health-wise. I made this post to tell those who were actually worried that i am alright. I could some ""It gets better""-bullshit here, but i am a terrible liar. I still want to die but i've learned that there are people whose happiness is worth more than my pain in living. I am in a psychiartric hospital in a stationary therapy and i would like to apollogise for being so discouraging in this subreddit. i am sorry. 

I wish you the best and ofc happiness since happiness is the most valueable thing for all of us. 

Thanks for your attention,
Lukas

Has depression made anyone else boring af,"I've become such a boring and stupid person thanks to depression. I can't read or learn or remember things anymore, I don't have any hobbies. And quite frankly I have nothing to say to anyone anymore. They can start talking to me but I won't give anything much besides ""Mhm. Okay"". I used to be so much more interesting, I used to always crack jokes and clown around. But now, I'm as bland as raw tofu. Before I could make people laugh and genuinely want to be around me, but now they just look at me in awkward panic as they feel our conversation dying."
"Showerthought: ""Open up"" is common depression advice, while ""cut out all the negative people"" is common social advice.",
Does anyone else not see a future for themselves?,Like I just don’t see a future in store for me. I have nothing positive going for me. Nobody understands me or why I do the things I do. I feel like I’m all alone and no amount of therapy can help me. I’m really at a crossroads where I don’t care if I fail or succeed. Or even live or die. What is the point of life.... I just don’t get it. 
Ever wonder if you're making it all up?,"I've never been abused, harassed, bullied, assaulted, or otherwise traumatized. Growing up, I had a pretty good life. My dad was a dick, but not abusive to me. Now I'm going to college and sitting at home playing video games all day while my mom pays for all my expenses. I don't have any *real* problems like most people. I have no legitimate reason to be depressed.

My depression isn't *actually* all that bad. I've never *actually* tried to kill myself - the closest I've gotten is pressing against a window in a tall building and then breaking down and crying. I can still laugh at memes and enjoy gaming. I still can get up out of bed most mornings.

Yet for some reason, I tell my mom that my depression is ""really bad"". I tell myself that I've ""almost killed myself twice"". I tell Reddit that I ""can't take it anymore"".

Maybe I'm not *actually* depressed at all. Maybe I'm just using it as a selfish excuse to not do a reasonable amount of homework, or get a job, or do any of the responsibilities a normal person does. Maybe my ""depression"" and ""ADD"" is all just an excuse to be selfish and lazy. Maybe my ""near suicide attempts"" and ""social anxiety"" are just a ruse to get upvotes and compliments on Reddit. What kind of person does that? What kind of person fakes having to endure real pain just to have an easy life leeching on others?"
Who else feels like society as a whole does not take depression seriously?,"Depression is something that, fortunately, not too many people suffer from. Unfortunately, that means that those who suffer from it are in the minority. This makes it a rarity that you'll come across someone who understands what you're going through when you tell them you have severe depression. 

Too often you'll get people who tell you to get over it, or you'll feel better if you smile. My brain feels like a holke I'm trapped in. I try to smile and be positive but keep getting sucked into despair by stupid triggers in my environment and myself (My impatience, when something or one is going slower than I like or just thinking about certain family members. When I'm triggered I have to struggle for about the next hour to get out of the pit of despair I fall inro.

That shows you depression is more than a mood to just get over. Depression and other mental disorders like anxiety and bipolar are disorders which little is known about and no one will talk about. I want this to change. I want to have an open discussion about how society sees mental illness. The only rule is no one insult anyone else in this discussion."
Anyone else feel like they don't deserve a partner?,Sometimes I think about the baggage I carry with me and feel sorry for whoever gets stuck with a guy like me.
"Breaking down in tears at 2am because I'm finally realising I'm not built for this world, and never will be","For 4 years I've been completely aimless and worthless.

Fuck I'm pathetic."
"Almost 30, alone, no career, no friends, no girlfriend, no life experiences. Going to end it soon.","Normal people with careers, partners and life experience have more than I have ever had. I went to university and tried to do things right but nothing ever worked out for me.

It feels like I'm not allowed to have what others take for granted. I have social anxiety and depression. i've never touched a woman romantically or had a career. I'm going to hang myself with my belt. I can't go on living like this."
Depression has stolen any bit of personality that I used to have,"I've stopped feeling like I have any personality. Only friends who I've known for a very long time know that I'm a real person, but whenever I meet new people, I feel like I'm that friend-of-a-friend who people meet and then say ""Wow, so-and-so's friend really had no personality, did they?"" 

I'm so fucking exhausted and anxious most of the time, I can't hold a conversation. I just sit around and let everyone else do the talking with each other. I don't feel like a real person when I'm around anyone other than my two older friends because they're the only ones who know that I actually do have some sort of personality lying around somewhere. 

If I do meet anyone with interests similar to mine, my anxiety keeps me from starting a conversation with them.
I'm so tired of all of this. I miss being able to function like a normal person. (If I ever was able to, to begin with)

Edit: It feels so good to see that there are other people going through this and to see others talking to each other and trying to help each other out in the comments. "
Pokemon GO is making me want to try running for exercise.,"Let's be clear: I fucking hate running. I don't mind sports and I enjoy team sports but it's been donkey years since I last properly exercised. My depression and anxiety also got worse over the years but correlation != causation. 

The last couple of days I've been outside walking around the streets catching Pokemon. I'm surprised by how *nice* it feels to be out in the sun getting some physical activity even if it's just walking.

I've also just landed myself a cool new job and I REALLY want to make it work. I'm already on medication and getting psychotherapy organised for myself but I've also started considering incorporating some actual exercise into my life. I absolutely would not have considered it if I hadn't been playing Pokemon GO. I'd much rather hide at home and play video games forever.

Today I went to the mall to buy some cheapo exercise pants (those stretchy thick yoga leggings) and shoes. I didn't want to drop $200 on a pair of Nikes just yet so I got a [$20 pair of running shoes](http://www.kmart.com.au/product/delilah-running-joggers/891009) instead. I think they look pretty damn sweet. :D I've been wearing heaps of black clothes (reflective of my mood lol) so a pop of bright colours would be good for a change I reckon.

Tomorrow I'm going to try and run/walk ~4km. More walking I think, to do some reconnaissance around the city and find a good running route. I'm actually looking forward to it. I also hope to hatch a couple of Pokemon eggs while I'm at it. :3 

I know I shouldn't put too much pressure on myself and *be patient with the recovery process* but I hope to keep this momentum up for as long as possible.

"Stephen Colbert, in an interview out of character, said something that I think is important for anyone with depression","...or even just sadness in general. He talks here about the grief of losing his father and two brothers in a plane crash when he was ten [(source)](http://www.playboy.com/playground/view/playboy-interview-stephen-colbert?page=3):

> The interesting thing about grief, I think, is that it is its own size. It is not the size of you. It is its own size. And grief comes to you. You know what I mean? I’ve always liked that phrase He was visited by grief, because that’s really what it is. Grief is its own thing. It’s not like it’s in me and I’m going to deal with it. It’s a thing, and you have to be okay with its presence. If you try to ignore it, it will be like a wolf at your door.

In the past I would always think of my self loathing as a symptom of something wrong with me. That is, I thought it was in me and I have to deal with it. And my repeated failures to deal with it just made me feel worse.

It's far more straightforward to want to attack the negative feelings I've held close for most my life. Get rid of the negativity. But the strategy that has actually worked best for me was to find happiness independent of my depression. And little by little, positive things took more and more focus, until the negative was no longer dominant. Relevant, yes, but not dominant.

Anyway, these are just thoughts I had that I thought might help others. Hopefully it helps."
Can I just stop existing now?,"I doubt anyone will acknowledge this post but whatever. 

I've never truly lived life, I've been wasting away for as long as I've been alive. I've isolated myself from basically everyone besides my family. I barely even socialize online anymore. Every day is the fucking same. Either I'm hopelessly depressed or slightly less depressed and foolishly thinking things can get better, but if someone else could see my whole ""life"" they would laugh at that thought. Everyone knows me as being ""quiet"", but say I'm ""nice"" and ""a good kid"", but I'm sure they actually think I'm a fucking retarded nobody. I'll never change no matter what I do because it's in my nature to be the way I am; I'm doomed to be an antisocial loner for the rest of my life. I want to stop existing but I don't want to kill myself. What  I'd give to just go to sleep and never wake up again...pathetic to be sure.

EDIT: I just want to express my thanks to everyone in this thread. I really didn't expect much posting this, thinking it would be like just another cry for help that would go unheard. The overall response it received is honestly overwhelming to me. I truly appreciate all the views, upvotes, and replies from people who cared enough to take the time to do so, and to everyone who is in a similar situation to mine, I hope we all get through this!"
"“The loneliest moment in someone’s life is when they are watching their whole world fall apart, and all they can do is stare blankly.”","Slowly and surely depression seems to find its way into my life, it keeps stealing everything and in the end I'll have nothing left. 

I can't imagine a future for myself, and I don't know how many days I can keep going, I don't mean to be dramatic really... I just am worried, afraid and feel mentally crippled. "
DAE hate going on social media during holiday's becuase all you see is people having parties and stuff. Meanwhile your sitting at home and doing nothing as usual,
Just drew this diagram about helping a friend with depression. Accurate?,http://imgur.com/MpbHbTe
I can't picture my future. Anyone else?,"I've had depression for quite some time now. I find it extremely hard to get motivation to do really anything. But that was usually just it most the time. I was just sitting here when random as fuck a thought popped into my head, ""can I picture my future? Can I see myself somehow doing a job related to my studies at all? Can I see myself settling down with someone?"" I thought about it and I tried hard, but couldn't think of anything. For some reason this just made me so depressed, like no sadness I've ever felt before, I sat in my room crying silently for probably 10 min. I started trying to find people or posts with similar issues and found a few posts but they were older. Thought I'd post here and ask if anyone feels the same or if anyone has and has any advice. I just felt like I had to get this out somehow like I have no one to talk to about this stuff really. "
"A friend of mine killed himself a year ago, nobody understood exactly why. I think I'm starting to understand.","I understand this is an extremely morbid title and perhaps I'm wrong, maybe I am truly just projecting my experience on to him. But something clicked in my mind as of late.

My friend was an extremely outgoing person. He was loved by everyone he met, always a smile on his face. He cared about everybody and most importantly he cared about himself. He had the biggest ego out of anyone I knew, always talking about how he's the #1 this or #1 that.

I remember talking to him about being more attractive, especially to girls. He gave me advice about going to the gym, how to make your personality better. Basically how to have a positive attitude like his own.

Then, in September of last year, he jumped off the balcony of his apartment which was on the 30-something floor.

This shocked everyone. I honestly thought it was a joke when my friends told me the first time. They had to repeat themselves multiple times to register it in my head.

This guy. The guy who was basically my role model and close friend just died... By his own hands. It made no sense.

Why? Why would he do this? He seemed happy, he was going to school to do what he loved it made no sense.

The morning he did it, he sent an email to my friend. It was worded poorly, I'm sure his brain was not fully functioning at that point. He said his goodbyes, that he was sorry, that he was being selfish. All that stuff.

But he wrote something that I didn't really put into consideration at all and that was the fact that he said he truly wasn't sad. That he was simply done.

I didn't get it at all, I mean I did to an extent but I couldn't understand how a guy like him would just say ""Fuck it"" and end it all like that.

But then recently I've been going through a ton of personal growth. I'm seeing the world through new eyes and honestly through a lens I feel like he was looking through too. Because I have been striving to become the best person I can, to become number one, to have a great personality, to improve myself to the best I can.

And like I said, something connected.

The fact that I'm doing all of this shit. All of this work. For what? Why? The more I improve myself, the shittier everything seems. I work so hard just to suffer through a shit job, or a shit class or a shit relationship, a shitty everything. I have to maintain a fake as fuck frame, pretending everything is so cool and great when in reality I'm stressed, probably sick in some form and not to mention over all just lonely.

And that's just the thing.

It's being lonely. Maybe he wasn't lonely, maybe he was just truly done. But I feel like that's the thing that pushed him over. And it's not a silly ""Boo-hoo I have nobody to talk to"" or a ""Friends aren't talking to me at this moment"" kind of lonely. It's the kind of crippling loneliness that comes from realizing that nothing matters. That nobody matters. YOU don't matter, she doesn't matter, he doesn't matter, nothing matters. Nobody owes you anything. 

And at first this thought process was freeing.

Wow! Nothing matters? Nice! Of course this didn't mean I went around punching people or breaking laws, but it opened my eyes up to how I could become someone better. That because nothing really matters, I shouldn't worry about things as much. That there's no reason to stress over what I say, what I do, how I act. Just to loosen up and have fun.

This was great. My ego went through the roof adopting this nihilistic point of view. And not in a necessarily negative way, I just felt GOOD to be ME. Which was surprising and addictive... But eventually lead to me feeling like this.

Once I started working on me, me and more of me I started looking around. I stopped putting people on a pedestal and realized that people fucking suck. I very might as well be one of those super sucky people, but from my point of view I'm somewhat decent.

I realized how empty and shallow people are. That people basically go for looks or a loud/obnoxious personality. And I understand many people step all over the whole defending of being a ""nice guy"" sort of thing, but stepping out of those lines and becoming a somewhat obnoxious guy that only cares about himself and his looks just sucks.

I become one of those people I view as empty and I hate it. But it terrifies me to step down and go back into a position where I was constantly being stepped on and literally abused. This is creating a tear in my personality and life, making things ridiculously difficult.

And this is where I feel like he gave up. And I can't blame him. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place. I'm told to just ""be my self"" but when I am I'm ignored and used. When I put on a persona, walk around doing some act I feel empty...

What the hell am I supposed to even do?

Adding this on top of the stresses of growing up, watching my friends suffer because they're too poor to even afford food on some days. Seeing that the planet is going to shit, the government is being ran by people that don't give a shit about the average person, that people are (as a whole) are simply vain and predictable.

It just sucks. It seems so nice to just be rid of it.

I'm not planning to end it, I'm just venting. I have so much more to say but I've already written an essay. I miss my friend so much and wouldn't ever do that to my friends.

But like I've seen so many times on this sub, ""I don't want to kill myself, but I'd love to stop existing"".

Thanks if you read all this, it's quite a lot. It's also pretty early where I am. I have a flight in a few hours and wanted to get this off my chest. I hope life is treating all of you well."
Anyone get “stuck” for a few hours doing nothing because a task seems huge?,"I’ve been sitting on my bed browsing my phone since 5pm. It’s 3 in the morning now. I’ve got a presentation and a test tomorrow but since I have no clue how to prepare for them (or I just don’t have the mental strength or will to do so), I’ve been just sitting here, wasting my life away. I can’t sleep because I know that I’ll be screwed when I wake up, but I don’t know what to do right now. I’m actually so fucking dead. Only gonna get about 5 hours of sleep and haven’t prepared crap. I just want to get out of this funk. 

Edit: I made this post last night in a state of depression and hopelessness, and as a way to vent out my frustrations with myself. I fully intended to delete it after a day or two but I’m pleasantly surprised that this post has resonated with so many of you.  It really just goes to show that, despite how it certain it may seem, you truly are never alone. "
Does anyone else feel like their attention span has been ruined by depression?,"As my depression has worsened over the past year, I've noticed a few things:

I can't read a book anymore, because I can't commit to sitting down and enjoying it; I've put off reading for so long that now it feels more like a nagging obligation than a pleasure.

I can't read online articles, or even longer Reddit comment threads anymore, my eyes start reading and just lose interest and trail off, barely even skimming the page.



I have to force myself to write Reddit comments with any substance.

I've stopped studying Chinese, even just the flashcards are too taxing for me.

I don't want to play any video games anymore.

I have an ever-growing list of new music on Spotify to listen to.

I have downloaded movies that I tell myself ""I'll watch eventually.""

I can't do even the most ridiculously simple shit on my long-standing, still intact to-do list, like filing away screenshots I've taken or reading Reddit comments I've saved ""to read later."" 

I just don't care about anything that requires even minimal thought or effort anymore.


"
sick of people saying “aw I’m here for you” yet im alone every single day,
Can't wait to get in bed at night as soon as I open my eyes in the morning.,All I want to do is sleep.
"""It's a new year, things will be better."" The next day: ""I want to die.""",Title
I drew a picture,"I've been creeping on this subreddit for a while and i've made comments, but had to delete them due to the wrong people possibly seeing them. But I present to you my first post here, A picture I made on photoshop of what depression feels like http://i.imgur.com/rzYuTtT.png"
"Wake up play video games. contemplate suicide, sleep, repeat","My life is just that on repeat, and i can’t muster the courage to end my life anyways, i will do it sooner or later"
The one upside of being depressed,"I've recently noticed something that has, strangely enough, somehow helped me a bit with my depression.

See, I've started not ""sweating the small stuff."" For example; stuck in traffic? It's okay. Spilled my coffee? Oh, well. My co-worker is annoying? Doesn't phase me. 
My thought process is like this: when I wake up and feel like dying, at least the spilled coffee gives me something to do in the mean time. Or standing in a queue forces me to be more in the present and not as much in my head. Since I came to realise this, I've noticed an increase in my general mood, or at least I've become better at coping with going outside, shopping etc."
Does anyone else feel worse just seeing people who have passions?,"Everyday in high school I see people who can be engaged in certain classes and discussions out of what seems like interest.  Sometimes I see or hear about a student who went above and beyond on something. Or, at the very least, I notice people who can do work and study for tests reasonably ahead of time. Every time I see one of these things I feel jealous, sad, and sometimes almost resentful that I can't share this feeling of passion about a subject or school in general. As a student trying to go through an advanced curriculum, I feel especially out of place. My only ""passions"" are playing video games and browsing the internet, which is more of an escape habit than something I get excited about. Even video games become a chore some days. Everyone else seems to have found their way, or at least an area they're interested in, whereas I look at various subjects and don't feel remotely interested in any of them. College is coming next year, and I have no idea what I'm going to do, or if I even have the motivation to make it through. It's been difficult enough pretending like I care in high school. Any kind of work is just a massive mental chore to get through. If it weren't for my massive anxiety and fear of falling out, I probably wouldn't get anything done."
do you ever have conversations with yourself?,i can't be the only one.
"I’m currently in the school bathroom eating my lunch, i can’t take this anymore.","school wouldn’t be so bad if lunch wasn’t 50 minutes long. This has been my routine from the first week of school last year ever since my parents decided to move and fuck up my whole life. i’m grade 11, i cant stand to do this for two more years. I’d rather just die. I’m ugly and incapable of making friends, what the fuck is wrong with me."
I'm only alive because I refuse to let my family suffer,"Fuck sometimes the only thing keeping me in this world is the fact that if I left my parents, siblings, friends, extended family would all mourn me. The course I'm studying has an insane workload which I've began to struggle with. I've lost enjoyment in something I once loved. I went from  being interested in what I was learning and getting 90+ on exams to going into exams with no study and getting below 50. I just want it to stop. I want the stress to stop. I want the pressure to stop. I want the thoughts to stop. I want it to stop. I'm sorry to whoever reads this but I need to get it out. I just drove home and spent the entire time hoping for a drunk driver to crash into me so that way I wouldn't be seen as taking the cowards road out. Fuck I'm crying again.

I'm sorry."
Do you ever wish that you would die from an accident so you wouldn’t have to do it yourself?,"This is going to sound very selfish, but almost every day I wish I could die from an accident because I don’t want to do the deed myself. For example, I took some over-the-counter medicine last night since I was feeling really sick, and I was hoping it would give me an allergic reaction that would kill me. 

Over the summer, I was walking around my hometown late at night (one of the most violent cities in the US) and hoped that I would get shot by someone. 

This all sounds really messed up even when I think about it, because these scenarios that I think of could potentially harm others involved in these fictional situations. 

I’ve never told anyone about this, since I’m afraid I will seem like a major asshole... but can anyone relate to this? "
"After 16 years of crippling anxiety and depression, I finally sought help. I am shocked...","I am 30. I have been suffering from near debilitating depression/anxiety for more than half my life. I finally sought help. It took some work to find someone nearby that would accept my insurance and could get me in reasonably soon. I was so relieved. Maybe there was still some hope for a better future.


When I finally saw the therapist, she said we should avoid medication. She taught me breathing exercises, told me to get active, and think positive. Are you fucking serious? I should just ""be happy""? Do you know how many times I have heard that shit? I did not expect this from a therapist. I wanted REAL help. I am just baffled. I feel like the last flame of hope was just extinguished."
Does anyone ‘turn off’ their depression when there’s friends around?,"I don’t do it on purpose, sometimes I just don’t notice that I’m being perky around my friends, almost as if my subconscious turns my depression to its lowest. But when I’m alone or I’m at home, I go full-on depressed. It doesn’t feel like I’m pretending to be happy around them, they just automatically get my energy up, and at the same time I feel I’ll look like I crave attention if I’m not the person that they know. So I just go on my day.

Edit: Even though I could never answer all of your comments because im busy throughout the day, just know that I’ve read all of your comments and each of them hold a special place in my heart. Thank you for sharing your experiences. "
Anyone else just get destroyed when they see someone succeeding in getting/doing something you want to but can't?,"Yeah, me right now."
Millions of sperm cells but it had to be me,
Does anyone try and avoid looking at their own reflection in mirrors,
"Does anyone else get super nostalgic and think back to happier moments and times and wish they could travel back, on a consistent basis?","I find myself randomly recalling old events and people from my past from happier times and I just wish I could go back so bad sometimes. Is this my brain on autocorrect, straying me from depression and anxiety?"
"Probably my mind tricking me, but I feel being depressed has made me see how the world really is and become truly self-aware","Like I feel like I'm just too self-aware. And aware of how others feel about me. I feel like I'm kind of a social chameleon, able to shift into whatever I think people want me to be. To some I'm a funny guy. To some I'm someone who will listen to them and not judge. For some someone to talk to about TV shows. For some someone to laugh at. I make jokes about being depressed, the kind of ones you see in memes all the time. People laugh, thinking I'm just joking, but deep down its all true and I'm just making a joke out of it. I've done it for so long admitting I am actually really depressed would seem insincere. 

But I know it's getting worse. But admitting to people seems so daunting that it's impossible, you know? I've joked about it with my friends for so long that they'd think I'm just exaggerating or something. My family would be fucking shocked and blame themselves, which is the last thing I want. All my acquaintances who see me as a nice, friendly and approachable guy would think I have some kind of dark side or whatever, you know? I know exactly how everyone would react to knowing I'm depressed, so I know I can't just come out and admit it without fucking things up.

But I can just feel it getting worse, you know? I used to be so smart, have goals, wanted to make something of myself and leave a mark on the world. I've started thinking the world is a shitty place and nothing's gonna ever change that, and while there's some beauty, there's always some shit that comes with it. Nothing ever truly works out for anyone. You can see it in people, most everyone. It's like in their eyes man. You see people everyday just like me, joking about depression or whatever. So many damn people, depressed. Almost everyone seems to be to some degree. I started thinking recently it's not even necessarily just mental illness; the illness itself is a symptom of how shitty the whole world is now. People don't have hope anymore, they just grind away and cling to whatever good they can find. Family, love, friendship, whatever. But some never find it. It's like the autism spectrum; everyone is somewhere on the spectrum of being depressed, some just become so imbalanced they need help.

Anyway, I know deep down I'm probably so depressed I'm just seeing the worst in everything, but it all just feels so worthless. So many people live their whole lives unhappy. That's not just illness; I think sometimes the world is just a genuinely shitty place, and humans can be just as shitty too. We're all stuck trying to deal with it, to get by and assign some meaning to it, but when you see through that, it all just seems pointless. Why try man? All I try do in my day is do something for someone each day. Show some genuine kindness, or do a favour, anything. Just to help. That's what I've started to cling to; trying to be some kind of force for good. But most of the time nobody will even notice you're doing anything to help. Even trying to help is sometimes just not worth it. It just feels like everyone's wading through a pool of shit and are too busy trying to climb out to look around and help each other out the mess. It sucks."
My counselor came up with a great idea,She had me list reasons that I actually like myself instead of reasons that I hate myself. She suggested that I write them down on notecards and tape them around my apartment. I just wanted to share what I'd made so far with /r/depression. [You can find them here and I'll try to update them as I make more.](http://imgur.com/a/74u1O) I really recommend trying this for all of you.
I somehow managed to get a job!,
"Do you ever feel worthless when you compare yourself to ""normal"" people?","By ""normal"" people, I mean those who seem to function in society with ease; who can work full time, who can form relationships easily, etc. I try not to let societal conventions get to me but sometimes they do, especially now as I'm getting close to 30. The major thing that upsets me a lot is not being able to work regularly. I've been dealing with trauma and PTSD for some time now and it's been difficult to handle regular work. I freelance every now and then, but even that gets stressful for me. I found out today that a client I had been working for may actually be trying to replace me. I started to feel pretty worthless as a consequence, feeling like I really cannot cut it like others can -- a failure. These thoughts spiral out so intensely sometimes (like it did today) and, I end up with suicidal ideas/feelings of hopelessness for my situation. "
Depression is when you decide to sleep all day even though you have nightmares because at least the nightmares aren't real.,
I realised two things today. 1) I can't do this alone. 2) I am completely alone.,
Is anyone else apathetic about everything but also weirdly fragile?,"I've become so apathetic about things that should really matter in life. When I think about things like failing uni, losing relationships, messing up my future etc. all I feel is a kind of numbness. I truly can't bring myself to care. I used to be so anxious about these things all the time, I used to feel physically ill. But now I go through life feeling numb and grey. I can't be bothered getting help because I don't really care about getting better. 

But...the smallest thing can set off a full meltdown and suddenly I feel the weight of every failure on my back. Burn the last piece of toast and suddenly I'm hysterically crying about how I'm going to fail uni and ruin my future and I'm such a worthless idiot etc etc. 

I don't understand why I can't make myself care when I need to or in any meaningful way. At least when I'm anxious I am working hard and trying to make/keep friendships etc. "
Story of my life.,
DAE go to bed immersing themselves in fantasies of who they really wish they could be?,"I like to pretend I'm successful and timelessly beautiful with an adventurous life, the courage/willpower to do things I've always wanted to do, and a close group of friends a la How I Met Your Mother that I have ridiculous fun with and that genuinely care about my wellbeing like I care about theirs.

Gets me sleeping more happily than thinking about reality."
"""What if I'm not depressed? What if I'm just lazy?""","Thoughts like these creep into my mind every now and then, and they always make me feel more like shit than I was already. I feel like I should be proactive and try to fix myself, but I have no idea what to do or how to do it. Everything's just so difficult...

Not looking for advice, just wanted to share.

EDIT: Thanks for all the responses, guys! It's great to know I'm not alone."
A comic I found. Maybe you guys can relate as much as I did?,http://i.imgur.com/0HgBMKO.jpg 
Does anyone else just sort of feel sadness lurking in the back when they're happy?,"When I'm actually genuinely happy or enjoying myself, I still can't escape feeling so down. I can't help but catch myself and remember that it's only temporary, that I'm depressed and that this moment will end, and I'll be sad again just like it's always been. 

I was talking with my family a few days ago. They were playing board games, drinking, goofing around. I had my little niece in my lap, playing with my skirt. The Christmas decorations were still up. It was loud, but everyone was happy. I was happy. 

But I was still so sad. I still smiled as everyone talked but I just felt like crying. I don't know what was wrong with me. I was the happiest I was in a long time. I had every reason to smile but it wasn't real. I just felt like I was about to break down.

It's so stupid. I don't know why I'm like this. Why am I so screwed up? How do I tell my stupid mind to just be happy? It shouldn't be this hard. I don't want this. Just please let me be happy."
Does nighttime bring on a sense of loneliness for anyone else?,"I could have the perfect day, but at night my emotions just come to me while I sit inside in pain knowing that I’m alone"
"I love being alone, but loneliness kills me","Hey, long story short... in the last two weeks, I have lost all of my friends. Even the one of whom I've thought they were the best one. I don't find interest in anything. I don't enjoy doing things, I just do them, because it's my routine. Nothing more. No one wants to spend time with me, so I spend all my free time locked in my room while watching videos or playing pc games. All of my friends just suddenly let me go and no one cares about me. I don't care about myself either. At this point I really think everything would be better if I just stopped existing. I'd stop being a burden to my family, my friends, teachers, sport coach and overall all people who have met me. Talking about this helps me though, but my friend told me that I should stop talking about my problems, because it will only get worse. So now I just keep it in. Everything keeps falling apart and I have no idea how to fix it.... Thanks for listening to my rant, stranger browsing reddit, have a nice day.

Edit: thank you all for your kind messages and comments. I just woke up and this made my day so much better. thanks everyone for worrying and encouraging me. take care of yourselves :)"
Cuddles are underrated,"Sometimes you just need to lay your head down and have someone hold you, and let the good neurotransmitters release naturally. I feel like I'd be a lot less depressed if I had someone to hold me for a bit each day. "
Waking up is the worst.....,"soul crushing! Knowing you have to pull yourself trough another day without any desire to do anything, a day feels so looooooooong......

I feel like I've lost all of my 20s due to anxiety and depression,"Anyone feel like this? Nearing 30 and realizing that fear has controlled so much of your life?

Hope you all are doing well.. and if not, do vent with me."
Does anyone else feel like a background character?,"It’s like watching a TV show that follows my life, but I’m a character who’s just kind of... there. Like an extra. Like a trash can in the background of a scene. Like the person whose name is simply mentioned. Not seen or heard, just mentioned. If this character is removed from the show, who cares?

No one would really notice, and at most they’d say something like, ""Hey, where’s that one person?"" ""Who?"" ""The fucking weirdo."" ""No clue.""

And that’d be it. This conversation would probably be in the background, partially drowned out by other conversations that people would forget within a day or two. This character wouldn’t be mentioned again.

Then again, maybe the people who care are giving a shit in the background or off-camera. Maybe someone will actually notice that the character exists. Maybe they’ll notice if I go. Leave. Whether it’s just going who knows where for a week or forever. I won’t know if they’ll notice, though. They’re human beings, humans can be completely fucked up or pure angels. And I can’t read anybody’s mind. Maybe they notice and I don’t notice that they notice.

I guess what I’m trying to say is that logically, I know people care. But it just FEELS like I’m nothing. Actually, I don’t even feel like a nothing. Just a ‘no’. I’m just a no. I don’t know."
Anyone else yearn to be around other people but hate it at the same time?,"I don't know if I'm depressed. I'm in therapy, but I haven't been diagnosed. But the way that I feel on a daily basis crushes me. I'm so fucking lonely. There's a constant weight sitting on my chest..Always.

All I want to do is be around people because I **hate** being alone. But as soon as I'm around people, I just want them to go the fuck away.

I have people who care about me, but it doesn't feel like it. I feel completely alone all the time. I have not yet transitioned into being completely void of emotion, but I am enveloped in complete sadness and dread nearly all of the time. Even when doing things I like..Events coming up that I'm going to..My mood is at a 3 or a 4 consistently, and getting it over a 5, or being excited about *anything*, seems like a far off dream.

I'm really afraid of this. I am honestly terrified of how I feel. I have never felt this shitty in all my life and I am scared it's never going to get better. I used to be happy. What happened?

I am clawing at any human interaction that I can get, so that I can feel loved and care for and safe. And I'm sure those people exist, but it doesn't feel like it. I feel completely isolated. I don't know what to do."
How am I supposed to feel that i'm loved when i dont even love myself,
I high fived a girl I know/kind of have a crush on today,"It felt really nice, especially because I didn't initiate it. Hopefully it wasn't just an awkward wave. Sorry for taking your time, but that was probably the highlight of my day.

Edit: I probably should have done this sooner, but thank you all for your replies. Per some of the comments here, I'll try talking to her and getting to know her. Maybe she even likes me too(although I doubt it). I'll update inconsistently."

I got a tattoo over my self-harm scars today.,"I feel pretty good right now, guys. Just a little bit of info, I've been self harming since I was 10. For 7 years I've never worn short sleeves outside because I was afraid that someone would find out or judge me because of it.

Today, I'm finally ending this cycle of self harm. I've kept myself clean and resisted urges for 2 years, waiting for the day I could finally replace the scars with something I love: books. Specifically, a literary tattoo!

Here's a comparison photo (warning: may be triggering, contains scar photos): https://i.imgur.com/wObD7Hk.jpg It's only half done, but I felt like sharing anyway!

The lightbulb is inspired by Anthem by Ayn Rand, the moth by The Death of the Moth by Virginia Woolf, and some nice green roses to represent Oscar Wilde. All represents individuality, finality, and pride in being ""different"". These works and people kept me alive through the years.

Thanks for listening. I don't post often, only when I feel really, really bad. This time I'm glad to be posting something good. :) 

EDIT: here's a proper look at the tattoo: https://i.imgur.com/sZwYDHT.jpg"
"This happens to me from time to time, and is by far what I hate the most about suffering from depression",
After finding this sub reddit all I can say is this...,
does anyone else hate getting out of bed but also hate not getting out of bed?,"i hate that i'm wasting the day away tossing and turning under the sheets, but i also dread getting up and starting the day

someone please kill me thanks. it took too much effort to even type this"
last night I killed myself,"Last night, around 5pm, I'd just finished watching a few movies, 1 for a media class and 2 for... well just to watch a movie, Don Jon, The Tree Of Life and Her.

 After watching I sat outside watching the sunset whilst having a cigarette and I thought about The Tree Of Life. There's a scene where Sean Penn is walking through a desert and sees all his childhood friends and himself as a child, and I thought of just what I was looking at in front of me. The sun, the birds, the cobwebs in the corners of the rail and I thought.... what exactly is it that I am doing here? What impact am I making? Do I even really matter? 

I feel empty. A deep vast hole full of nothing, nothing at all.

I go upstairs, trudging along, zombie-like, my mind is blank, tears are rolling down my face. Why am I crying? I have no idea. I never cry. I just don't. But here I am, walking up my stairs, crying. I have no weed. I know that alcohol will only make it worse, like always, so I head to the medicine cabinet, craving something to make me feel again. To make me feel happy, to make me feel.... anything..... I find some Panadol (paracetamol) and just start taking them. I'm counting them in my hand. 1...2....3.....4..... it keeps going until they're all gone. I get to 22, the packet says 'maximum 4 caps a day', next to the parent's bathroom where I start looking through the draws. Looking.....loooking...looking.... I strike gold. Temazepam.

I know from my Psychology class exactly what Benzodiazepines are. I take the entire packet. 17, down the hatch. 17 10mg pills. I text my 3 best friends, I say my final words, tell them I love them and that everything I own is theirs and that I'll always be there for them, even if they can't see me, I'll be there. 


I turn off the lights in my room and feel myself drift into the darkness.

Drifting..... listlessly.....

Until I feel myself being shaken violently, I can see the lights on and my dad's face. He's yelling at me, telling me one of my friends was so worried that he rang him and told him everything. He sees the packets lying on my desk and, as a medical professional, goes pale.

I'm in my boxer shorts and he drags me out of my room and throws me in the car yelling at my mum to drive me to the hospital. 

The car trip feels like it lasts less than a second as I drift in and out of consciousness and my dad holds my in the back seat.

We reach the emergency room and my dad is telling the lady exactly what's happened and explaining exactly what to do, seeing as he's a medical professional and works at the hospital. They drag me off to a bed and I can see my parents sitting in the waiting room, crying, as I feel hands clipping cathodes all over my body, putting me in a gown and sticking an IV in my arm as I lapse into unconsciousness, picturing all my friends faces laughing with me. 

I vaguely remember various random moments when I came to consciousness occasionally, but otherwise I woke up later on. I looked down and saw wires out of me, a needle in my arm and sticky pads all over my torso. I felt normal. I felt fine. I felt disappointed. Disappointed that I'd stolen someone else's bed, someone who actually needed it, not some stupid kid. I didn't want to be saved. I looked around for something sharp, for anything, tried using the name-tags around my wrist to cut, but it wasn't any use, they'd taken them all away. 

A nurse came and told me that there would be a psychiatrist come and see me in a few hours, checked my blood pressure, oxygen levels and heart rate and told me brekky was in an hour or two and to just rest up.

I had a shower right before I spoke to the psychiatrist and I looked in the mirror and saw the entire left-side of my body covered in sticky pads and cathodes where they'd measured all my readings and I just.... broke down.... I was pathetic.... I lay on the ground of the hospital shower sobbing uncontrollably at the pathetic mess I am. Absolutely. Pathetic. And you know what? The night before just felt like a dream.... I was still just a pathetic mess. 


I spoke to the psychiatrists and told them absolutely everything and went out and met my crying parents who took me home.

I met my friends later, all of them in tears hugged me for hours.


I'm sorry this is so long I just feel I had to talk about what happened because I was.....well....dead......


EDIT: Thank you all so much for your comments and support, I hope that my story can help some of you to get out of the 'hole' we're in all and to talk to someone. Thank you all again so much, you have no idea how much your comments mean to me, truly, thank you."

"It sucks that being depressive as a teenager is considered ""normal"".","It sucks that being sad, having suicidal issues, hating everything or just being depressive in general makes you ""edgy"" (idk if it's the right term). When you are a teenager it seems like you can not have depression. You are just being like every teenagers. I think it is true, most of us have difficulties to control our emotions and we are going through a lot of changes. But know the difference between having a normal teenager period and being depressive. Idk if you make the difference between ""depressive"" and ""depressed"" in english. In my language we do: most of the teenagers can feel depressed, but when you deal with real depression you are depressive. I am ashamed to talk about my situation  and it is making it even harder because people will think i am depressed and making too much about it.

Edit: what i love about this sub is everyone understand each others. Thanks for your comments, it makes me feel less alone."
Do you ever picture yourself with someone and imagine all these scenarios and conversations u two could have?,"I do this all the time. If I'm crushing on someone, my mind will usually be filled with a bunch of sappy romantic plot lines, That Will Never Happen In Real Life lol "
I did it,"I got out of bed. I showered. I brushed my teeth. I got dressed.

It took a really long time, and I have nothing to do all day...but it feels fucking good.

Anyone else get just exhausted by pretending to be happy/normal?,"My fiancé and I are house hunting and we looked at 3 places today. I’m pretty good at putting on a polite and happy face/demeanor when we’re meeting people, but it drains the life out of me. Anyone else? "
I've lost every friend I've ever made and I don't even blame them,"This is more venting than anything since this probably won't be noticed compared to other posts.

I don't blame any friend, any close family member, or any coworker for forgetting about me. I've come to realize that I'm not a very interesting person to begin with. I'm not funny or entertaining, just ""that nice guy"". Would you want to be friends with a boring person? I probably wouldn't.

I no longer have any friends. This has happened my whole life, starting from middle school to the present, but today is where it hurt the most.

I started a new internship about 3 weeks ago and there's 3 new interns, one girl and two guys, I became friends with. I noticed that whenever we have group conversations or we're out getting lunch, I'm never really into the conversation, I'm just...there. And when I do speak, it's immediately forgotten and they continue the conversation. 

Today, there was a full-time employee that joined us today and he took us to the park for lunch. They all had great conversation together for about half an hour. Then I realized something, I hadn't said anything for the past 30 minutes and no one noticed.

When we were walking back to work i was walking in the back of the group and saw the 4 of them walking together, joking and laughing and then it hit me. I've been replaced, they forgot about me.

I saw [this comic](http://themetapicture.com/pic/images/2016/01/05/cool-friends-comic-sad-alone.jpg) that best illustrates what happened.

All I want is to be someone's 1st pick. I want someone to remember me.

My dad didn't die of a heart attack.,"When I was 7 my dad died in his sleep on a business trip. Well tonight, my mom finally revealed to me that he didn't die of a heart attack, he commited suicide. I'm devestated. I feel like I'm starting a whole new grieving process. I'm torn between being angry at him and being sad knowing how bad he was feeling. His doctor prescribed him paxil and told my mom it felt like ants were crawling under his skin so not knowing any better, he stopped taking the pills abruptly. I guess it got the best of him. Anyway this was just something I needed to put out there, thank you "
I hope my depression gets depression,I hope my depression gets depression and realizes how crippling depression is and decides to stop giving me depression. 
Is anybody else constantly tired?,"I know fatigue comes with depression but it seems like no matter how much sleep i get, i could pass out any second"
Anyone else on autopilot?,"Sorry if this is a bit jumbled. I got drunk to go to sleep and shockingly enough my brain had other plans.

Does anyone else feel like their body isn't theirs anymore? I feel like I'm watching from inside myself. Almost as though my eyes have sunk back into my head and I'm just looking out from the back seat.

It's kind of like a dream, or sleepwalking. I spend days or weeks in autopilot and can't really remember what I've done. I say and do things completely thoughtlessly. Sometimes I wonder if I should cut up my driver's license because I honestly can't recall driving from point A to point B.

I do things because I know I should do them. I say things because I know I should say them. I eat, drink and fuck because I know that's what's expected of me. But I feel absolutely nothing. It's weirdly effective, no one even suspects anything. But it's not me. It's not me doing it. And I don't feel anything for this life that's taking place in front of me. It might as well be happening to a stranger. None of it's mine, whoever this other person is took over a long time ago. I have rare moments where I feel like I'm in control, and usually when that happens I feel like my chest is going to burst open and I just cry until it's gone. But overall there's just this pervasive sense of control and order that just overrides every feeling and thought I have.

Sorry for the rant, I just couldn't explain it any better than that. This feels ridiculously self-indulgent. Logically I know that I'm me and I'm in control of my actions but 99% of the time it just doesn't feel that way. I guess I just wanted reassurance that other people experience this too."
"What the freaking hell, downvoters? Do you know what sub you're on? Do you even care about what these people are going through?","This is a depression subreddit. This is basically the home of long, sad, sometimes angry rants. This is where you're supposed to write that sort of thing and be understood. If you want to downvote sad things then go on a Sunshine Rainbow Sparkly Land subreddit where it's about being happy and not about being sad.

But here on /r/depression, you don't downvote sad things. Because everything here is sad. People are vulnerable here. Who knows, someone might see the downvotes and commit suicide because THAT is how much what people think of you matter to people here.

So next time you see something you don't like, THINK before you DOWNVOTE please. It hurts to see people hate on something very personal to you. It hurts to see people downvote a rant of pure emotion and loneliness. Recently, I wrote something from a VERY vulnerable mindset and it got multiple downvotes. It just kills me that not even an online DEPRESSION group is safe for people with depression.

It hurts me so, so much when I write something while crying alone in my room and it gets so many downvotes and nothing else, and it hurts when I see someone writing something, scared and alone, and it gets downvotes.

So please consider what people with depression are going through next time you see something you don't like."
"At 30 I have been depressed for over two decades, I just emailed a clinic that works with my workplace to provide counselling. I'm taking a positive step for the first time ever.","I just wanted to tell someone. I know it's lame, but I am very scared, nervous, excited, anxious, and proud. "
"Fuck the title, just read this, please.","I'm just breaking down. Over the course of the past month things have just been getting worse for me. Again. A week ago, I missed some classes due to my anxiety (I was having a breakdown at the time) and I missed some big lab for my chemistry class. Today I was told that I couldn't make it up because I ""already had a chance"" to make it up. That was on the second day I missed. The lab has a bunch of other assignments attached to it, all of which I'll be getting a 0 on. Knowing this would ruin my grades, I got upset, crushed the screen of the chromebook I was in front of, smashed the thing on a desk, and walked out of the building, all the way home, crying. If things keep going the way they have, I won't be able to function at all. I can't handle living in society anymore, but I don't want to resign myself to sitting at home letting someone else take care of me. I have goals for myself, and I can't achieve them if I'm crippled by my anxiety, depression, and anger. 

EDIT: I don't know if people just assumed I was in college or not, but I'd just like to clarify, I'm in high school. I'm not legally allowed to take a break from classes."

"When I screw up, I feel like shit. When I do something right, I feel nothing","It's like I'm putting my best effort in so I can just feel numb. I just can't process anything positive but when I mess up, it stays with me for days and every negative feeling just builds on the previous one.  "
depression has transformed me from a kid with a 4.8 gpa to a possible dropout,"im at home right now and I decided that I couldn't go to school because of my severe memory problems that I'm experiencing. I used to be a high school student that cared about everything up until a couple of weeks ago. my biggest problem is the fact that I cannot remember anything because my short-term memory is so fucking shitty now. I can't study, write essays, do anything and all my teachers probably look at me dumbfounded.

"Does anyone else feel like human interaction, the very thing that drives them to achieve anything in life, is also the bane of their existence?","I feel like the only reason to get out of bed and continue working is to prove to the world that I have enough strength and self-respect to do what it takes to pay my bills, but without anyone else to share my life with, what's the point?

Harassed about cut on wrist while playing Pokémon Go,"Tonight I was at the park playing Pokémon Go. I had just gotten off of work and thought it would be relaxing to walk around and catch some mons before I went home. While I was there, I decided to roll up the sleeves on my sweater because I was overheating. Underneath is a 7"" long vertical scar. Immediately afterward, I met a guy about four years younger than me. We talked a little bit and he started following me around the park. He seemed nice, so I had no problem with this. About ten minutes in, he made a joke about suicide. ""No big deal"", I thought, ""he probably hasn't noticed my scar."" As we continued, the jokes got more frequent. I began to get suspicious, but didn't want to be too reactant. After about an hour, we sat on a bench near two lured stops and he was making near constant sarcastic remarks about ""killing himself"" while intermittently looking at my scar and smirking. Two minutes later, his friend (new to me) sat down and joined in. I diffused the situation gracefully and got them to leave, but I went home and felt really low. All I was trying to do was enjoy some time out of the house and play my game and these idiots completely ruined my night. It was a huge trigger, but I've calmed down. Regardless, what would motivate a person to be so cruel when they are completely unprovoked?"
I wish I could give everyone in this reddit page a hug.,"Reading all your peoples posts, where u tried attempt suicide, or have parents that are abusive, or u get bullied etc. I wish I could just hug you all.

I’m 20M, I don’t have any friends, I don’t enjoy anything, I’m very unhappy, but I hide it deep inside and only cry really rarely. I’m constantly envious of others, and tell myself I shouldn’t be sorry for myself feeling bad, cause so many of u guys here have it so much worse. But yet I do. I don’t have a job either, I don’t go to uni like all other ppl my age. Reason is, I don’t know what I would enjoy. I do stuff to impress others, that’s something I’ve done my entire life on reflex. I tell myself “please don’t do x and y to impress someone, or compete with someone u envy. Do it cause YOU enjoy it”. Surprise... telling myself that doesn’t work. I’ve gone to therapy for 3-5 years on and off. But yea, I just wanted to tell you guys that I wish I could give you all a hug.

I gonna sleep now since it’s 3am. I stayed up playing the new world of Warcraft expansion, alone. But it wasn’t that fun, just played it cause I had nothing better to do. So I gonna sleep now, so if someone wanna talk Etc, I probably won’t respond till tomorrow.

Take care <3."

"One of the most annoying thing about mental illness is that people constantly act like you don't suffer from it, even when they know you do.","Because they don't see it, they assume it's gone/not real.

When you're depressed, and you have a bad day, they'll be like ""what's wrong ? what's happening ? are you mad ?"" even when they know you're suffering from depression, a disease that's literally known for making people feel like shit."

I have been reading my kid Charles Dickens to bore her to sleep.

Sadly, sadly, the sun rose; it rose upon no sadder sight than the man of good abilities and good emotions, incapable of their directed exercise, incapable of his own help and his own happiness, sensible of the blight on him, and resigning himself to let it eat him away.”

A day in the life with Major Depressive Disorder,
I did it...i actually did it...,"Last night I experienced another one of my episodes when I was in the shower. I must've spent over an hour crying. I couldn't take it anymore. I remember repeating the words ""I need help."" Unfortunately I didn't get much sleep last night. I laid in bed wide awake and eventually binged watch one of my favorite shows on Hulu until I eventually got sleepy, which was around daybreak. When i woke up I decided to call and seek some kind of help. I called my doc's office and they hooked me up with a therapist that's located in the same building. I actually felt like a heavy weight was lifted off of me. I'm going next Wed. I really hope this works. I'm kind of looking forward to it but at the same time I'm nervous as hell and for some reason feeling a bit embarrassed. I've been dealing with depression and anxiety since I was in middle school and I'm sick and tired of it. I want it to stop! I've watched mental illness ruin my family and I want to control mine but I'm too far gone like some people in my family. It's already ruined the first half of my life. I'm about to turn 31 in a few weeks. I'm just tired of dealing. I wish I never had it. I had several hobbies that I really enjoyed but thanks to depression I haven't had any interest in them for a long time. My depression has already ruined friendships, relationships, school and jobs. The last thing I want it to do is ruin my love for writing, music, art and traveling. If depression were a person I would kick it in the throat. I want it to die and never come back. I'm sorry for the rambling but I needed to get this off of my chest."
Anyone else feels like he or she is too tired to be alive,Does anyone else feel like he or she is too tired to be alive or it's just me. Like I feel like I have been living for a million years and I don't want to exist.
I don't want to be called smart ever again.,"All my life, I've been the smart child for whatever reason. I hear it to this day, even when I'm not doing well in school. Every time I hear someone utter ""you're too smart for-"" in response to me doing poorly on something or being worried about my future, it makes me feel like a fraud. It needs to stop, and it probably will once everyone learns I'm not walking for highschool graduation.

Edit: Because this post keeps getting misunderstood, it's not that I'm choosing not to walk. I'm seriously not going to be able to walk due to lack of credits. There's a chance I can, and I'm still trying to achieve that... but it feels all too out there to accomplish. This isn't me complaining about me being called smart. This is me dreading the disappointment I'm about to receive from everyone."
Pretty much how my depression treats me.,
Is anybody else so goddamn bored?,"All the options I have for any given day is either Netflix, YouTube, Reddit, porn, etc. Like how long can this shit stay entertaining, now I just fucken sit down and pass time. Fuck this life.

I just attempted suicide,"Latest update; If the majority wants me to go into detail in everything of my experience from that night on, the other side and such. Id be happy to, i need motivation and comfort to do so. 



Well ive never been on this website. I just googled my thoughts thorough and sorta winded up here. 
29 hours ago I ate 30 tablets which of brand I will not state due to security, i drank 10liters of beer, one bowl of hash and said bye. I met my childhood friend, he said I was more than welcome, he missed me, we'd have fun. I instantly thought I was trippin on some sort of marked dope. My long lost friend told me about times I forgot by far, in details, things that I miss. 
I felt like I was hanging out with him for weeks, when suddenly I saw an old woman which I clearly knew (not going further into details but she is well known by our family as a psychic). She told me to say loudly if I was happy at the moment, which I did.
We sat and spoke for what felt like a few hours, about everything.
Lastly she asked me if I wanted to be happy or feel blank. What's the point of the blank familiar feeling? I said
Life is blank, you always without exception fill the blanks.
In a rush so badly, i coughed blood on my floor leaving trails all the way up to the bathroom. I was not gonna leave, I was on the other side, it's nothing but the blanks you cannot fill inn because it's too late.

So later on, I woke up on the ER.
I felt alone earlier, I wish I was alone when I woke up, but I got huge amounts of love.

Gonna fill in thread as soon as I recover more, I made a promise to a long lost friend to remember it all.

-CPA
-2018 closing up, J-6D



TODAY - 12/23/17
Hello friends, I cant even start to express my graditude and support towards this whole situation. CPA is the wing of the hospital im in for the moment. 2018 is comming to us fast, the last thing I can remember thinking is ""this year is closing up, getting dark and done"" ""J-6D"" - Jail for 6 days, not literally but my mind is set somewhere so far from myself I see the rehabilitatin process being some sort of prison.

Again Id like to thank you all, the support on the all new site for me is immense and Id never see such an amount of it. Keep in mind that english is not my first language, I just see patterns in my head to how it should sound due to my autism. Lets start again, I've already fallen back twice. Adrenaline popped somewhere in my shoulder to get me back last time, not due to the fact Id wanna die. But I've gotten severe damage from the attempt which the doctor said would make life ""different"" For now Im doing okay, Im tired. Really really tired. I feel empty and for the moment completely alone. Doc put on Donnie Darko today, I watched the whole thing thinking about depression and family for some reason. I've seen it a gazillion times but that's the first step to ""different"" I guess, Im not familiar with the feelings I got at the moment and Im gonna keep posting daily (as far as my body and mind lets me). For the moment I can barely do it, fyi i would never even start typing on here today if it wasn't for all the support and heroism in mankind. You are all my glowing angels, thank you. -xx dxty 3m

"""Are You OK?""",
Eating alone at a restaurant surrounded by tons of people is actually pretty sad,And that’s exactly what I’m doing 
Today is the day I was supposed to die.,"June 24th is the day I had planned to kill myself. For months I have had this planned, down to the minute of the day. I had the gun in my hand and the note taped to the mirror, and I was ready to do this. I wasn't afraid, I wasn't anxious. I was ready. I was happy to be rid of this miserable disease we call life. 
It's funny how such a simple sentence can change your perspective on so much. 
""I can't do this without you.""

June 24th is the day I threw away my razor blades. June 24th is the day I put down the gun and I burned the note I had so neatly written.

June 24th is the day my life begins.

EDIT: wow... Thank you guys so much for your support. And thanks for the gold! Love you guys <3 "
Everything is just an interruption to me lying in bed and doing nothing.,
Anyone else realize how futile life is?,"We have a carefree childhood that eventually transitions into us working to save enough money so we can retire at a reasonable age and somewhat enjoy our last years ...

What fulfillment is there in that? Am I the only one who feels like we are glorified robots living out our days to its meaningless ends? It's like a ""system"" that is in place for us very few people possess the resources to deviate from it's influence. I barely have the motivation to get out of bed anymore."
"""We don't care if you're not living, just as long as you aren't dead.""","This is the kind of attitude I'm picking up from a lot of mental health workers. It doesn't matter if I'm in bed 24/7, as long as I don't hurt myself it's all good. 

The reality is, nobody really gives a shit about you (unless you have close friends and family, which I don't). The only reason they don't want you to do it is because you're worth more to the government alive and someone would have to clean you up. 

I hate life. "
hmm i wonder...,
Hopefully this brightens somebody's day,
