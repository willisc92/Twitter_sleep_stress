I blanked out on my own city?! Scared!,"
I was filling out a form and it asked for my city (I just moved here 2 months ago btw) and I couldn't remember the name for about...4 seconds...then it came to me.


I am scared...i shouldn't blank on my own city?! Is this bad?????????"
"Sophomore in high school, I don’t care about it anymore and I’m slipping.","For some background I’ve always been a good student. Always in mostly honors (in 6th grade I got kicked out of honors math but it was for the best) and teachers usually like me. But this quarter has just left me completely empty of giving a shit about school. I have a job, I’m in band and jazz band, and I I still like those but I hate school now. I’ve never had this much resentment towards it in my life and I just fucking hate it. I don’t know why or how this started but it’s causing me to slip. This quarter just ended and my lowest grades were C+, one in chemistry and one in my honors English class. My dad told me I need to figure out why I got F’s in certain assignments but I just don’t have the heart to tell him I barely worked on them. I don’t feel like I’m lazy because I’m constantly working, but I’m also not putting in the work. I feel so fucking inadequate, I have friends in way tougher classes that are upset that they have an A-. My parents never praise me for good grades, they only ever bring it up when I have less than adequate. What should I do? If I’m not already burnt out I think I might be getting there. "
Messed up at work and don't know how to tell my boss,"I was working on a software at work that requires us to put in comments whenever we change/save anything to keep an audit trail. A couple of weeks ago when I was writing in a comment, the software froze and I didn't notice and continued to type a couple of letters before I realized and stopped. When the software finally unfroze, it typed in some of the letters that I was typing when it was frozen (not all of the letters so what was written doesn't make any sense) and saved the comment and changes  on its own. I'm guessing, I must have pressed the Enter key as well while it was frozen.  When this happened, no one was around, it was the end of the work day and everyone had already left for the day.  I went home really stressed and did not bring it up to my supervisor the next day. I had made a mistake a couple of weeks before that and on top of this I just did not want to get in trouble.  I just wanted to avoid thinking about it. My mental health had been shit those few weeks due to the mistakes I've made at work and other stuff in my personal life.  I'm  new to the job and on top of the mistake from a couple of weeks ago, I just didn't want my supervisor to regret hiring me and my anxiety/stress levels are high as it is and I didn't want it to get any worse. I got really busy at work after that and I didn't get a chance to tell my supervisor.

 

Anyways, I'm now realizing I should've just said something when it happened. The software freezing could've happened to anyone. I dont want people to find out about my mistake through an auditor so I  want to tell my supervisor soon. I just dont know how to bring it up and what to say without looking like a big idiot. I'm stressed I'm going to get fired or in trouble for not saying anything.  Any advice on how to tell my supervisor?"
Can stress cause a tight/uncomfortable feeling in one side of the neck,"So recently I’ve been under stress from assignments and all that, and I feel a tightness and uncomfortable feeling on one side of my neck. Anyone else get this when they are stressed? Or maybe it’s anxiety? "
Sick for the 3rd time in 2 months,"I just keep getting sick and it’s causing a positive feedback loop of stress. I get sick, can’t get my work done, miss class, work my ass off to catch up, and in the process get sick again which makes me even more stressed. What’s odd is that I’ve started getting sick more after I started eating better and working out, which I thought would have the opposite effect. 

How can I break this cycle and reduce my stress? "
Let's deal with it!,
Should I tell my boss?,"I work on a team of 4, and we are extremely behind.  Our workload has tripled in the last year without adding additional headcount.  My coworker spends most of her day socializing and I am struggling to get my much heavier work load done.  She pretends she’s too busy to finish her work so others will help her and stays late so it appears she’s working hard.  My boss is in a different area so he doesn’t see it.  The stress of the workload is causing problems with my health.

My question is, is it reasonable to tell my boss what’s going on or does that make me seem like a troublemaker?"
I hate everything,I hate everyrhing becasue I dont care and I dislike you and everything in this BS world. I wish everybody can died. I DOnnt care about grammar error becasue it to stressful to fix it and life suck. BLAHA BALHA see you all in hell werido. I feel a little bit better now. 
Constant teary breakdowns,"Hi
I’m F47 with 3 kids, working full time in a stressful job which should really be a two person role
At Christmas time I had a major meltdown, a colleague sent me to the doc who said I needed two weeks off ASAP. 
I didn’t take them as no one would do my job and I knew my stress would be worse worrying about my clients
I pushed through and Im currently on annual leave
Just thinking about going back to work makes my stomach churn
I’ve been with this company nearly ten years but I feel broken
I’ve given them my all and often put my family second to the job
I know I need a new job but it’s not an option right now
Does anyone have coping mechanisms that are tried and true?
I need to not think about work 24/7
It’s killing me :(
Thanks for listening

overwhelmed by stress choosing new career path,"Im at a stand still currently due to overwhelming stress I feel at choosing a new career path. Now Im not fresh out of school or anything , Im 34 but I need a better job where I can hopefully buy a house etc.

Ive worked crap retail most of my life and its gotten worse rather than better. I tried moving up into management in the past and kept getting rejected . No matter how good I was it was never enough. Now after being at my current job for four years , doing my best since i also help look out for my grandmother. I dont live with her but I help her with bill payments , Dr visits etc.  I hate my job and its making me a miserable pile of crap , plus its a dead end. 

My own fault I know , for staying at a dead end job so long. And my coworker that has been working here like 8 months after coming back from leaving to work at another job , has been given a lead position. Ft and a lot more pay ,,,, I just wanted to walk out right then. I was so angry , but I cant i have bills , rent...

So im being pressured by my family to find a real career  , like...now. And I know what they are saying I know I need one. I want to have my own home etc. I have been trying to find something online that i could do where i dont have to move , since i look out for my grandmother. And where I wouldnt be away for long periods of time.

I look and look and look. And I just dont know what to do.I feel such pressure to find it I end up overwhelmed and Im not very useful in that state. I did find however that the unemployment office has financial assistance available to go to school for trades or a lot of other things. Where they will cover the cost of the schooling as long as you get a job asap right after you graduate.

So I thought of truck driving  , like local routes etc because i like to drive. But I get very stressed/angry in heavy traffic and people ,well they drive like their insane. Also thought of the Postal service as a mail carrier. But i just dont know. How do i calm down and make a choice? I have to make one I have to get out of my current job as soon as possible. "
mom waking up at night and having anxious feelings,"so my dad used to be an alcoholic when he was together with my mom. mom spent about 10 years always worrying and being very alert because dad was always out and drinking and he was also very violent to her.

&#x200B;

now, after about 8 years since the divorce, my mom keeps waking up at night. sometimes she smokes a cig because she feels anxious. it is a weird sensation for her she says. then he just calms herself down and tries to go to sleep again. We're guessing it's because of the long period of time of always being alert at night.

any thoughts my dudes?"
Overwhelmed and it’s causing chest pressure.,"Life is stressful. Obviously. I have been to several years of counseling as a child and I feel I have some pretty healthy coping mechanisms and communication skills. Lately though, life has been overwhelming. I am tired all the time and when conflicts happen between my SO and I I get physical chest pressure. I wouldn’t determine this as a pain but more like difficulty breathing normally. Advice? "
Can anxiety/stress cause these types of memory issues?,"
﻿ I am﻿﻿﻿﻿ getting confused during the day..like today for instance.﻿ I was in the bath and couldn't remember which faucet handle was cold/hot. I got it wrong and tested all the other faucets in my house, getting it wrong. I also checked my weight on those manual scales (which I use a lot) and the notch bit (that you use to determine whether to move the slider down or up) was down and I forgot if I had to move the slider up or down. I also was watching Family Feud and the question of ""what is something your mother let you do, that your wife won't"" and I kept confusing it with something your mom didn't let you do that your wife does.

I just walk away from everything,"I’m a senior in college and the one problem that I haven’t been able to solve since I was a freshman was how to deal with my stress. Whenever I get stressed my immediate response is to put whatever I’m doing down and walk away, sometime for days. This leads me to procrastinate on things and end up stressing myself out more, which leads to a lovely loop of none stop worrying. Has anyone been through anything similar and if you have are there any techniques that you can recommend?"

Lock jaw due to stress,"This may not be due to stress at all but when i visited my doctor he said i could be. I have been immensly stressed due to school and the future of my life. My anxiety even prevents my from even going out side to attend class which induces large amounts of stress. Bottom line i had been diagnosed with TMJ or lock jaw i get and occasionaly clicking out of my jaw and it forces me not to be able to open one side of my mouth making it very difficult to eat anything. I used to have it where it would last like an hour then my jaw would be fine. It has now been about a moth and i wake up almost every morning with this Tmj lock jaw and i haven't been given really any solution. I take ambien typically to sleep at night not sure if that affects its, but i was wondering if anyone else has had any similar experiences to TMJ"
I can't handle all this alone,"I'm seriously considering just running away from all of this, just packing my bags and leaving, but I have nowhere to go...

My mom died suddenly, leaving me and my brother as orphans struggling to get by, yes we are both adults, yes we're trying to get work, my brother was rejected for the most recent job he applied for and my anxiety and depression is making it really hard for me to leave the house... I try to find work online but everything is scams, or lies, or survey sites that pay less than a pittance. There are legitimate things, but no matter what I do or how hard I try nothing works for me, and I can't take it anymore.

I have been STRUGGLING to make money, we have rent to pay at the end of the month, we have to cancel our utilities and get new ones under a new account but we can't afford the service start fee, everyone keeps telling me to do this and to do that but NOTHING is actually helping me. ""Get a job"" is the prime example of advice I've heard which makes me want to scream, if it was that easy to get a job just by saying it, we'd both have a job already.

I'm an artist and a writer and I can't find work online in any of my fields, people won't commission me and I can't even sell some of my old things to make a little bit of money. I can't stop crying, I'm literally sitting here crying because if we become homeless, it's over, we have nowhere else to go... We have an aunt and grandma, but they aren't any better off than we are financially... I just, I'm so angry at my mother for leaving us, I'm so mad that she knew she was dying and she LIED to me and my brother.

I'm so furious that she died, left nothing, and left us to suffer in her wake. And I just don't know what to do anymore, I'm losing all hope that we're going to be okay, I can't even make enough money for food most of the time, how am I ever going to do this?

10 Things I Wish I Knew,"Hi everyone,

I'm part of an organization called **Wish I Knew,** which is focused on helping to reduce the levels of anxiety, depression and drop-out rates that plague first year students.

First year of university is always full of questions and anxiety for students. This article (link below) lists some of the things that I, too, wish that I had known in my first year!

We will be posting more similar content weekly on our Facebook Pages to help give you more realistic advice on university life and how to deal with all the overwhelming stress and emotions. We will share articles, videos, and our own original content as well! If you are attending a university in Fall 2019 and are interested in content like this, please follow our pages on Facebook by searching ""Accepted - ""university name"", Class of 2023"".

Wants and Needs,"Good morning to those in need,


     What does need mean? Is it the formal version of help or does it just phase the more selfish Verizon of want? When we find a want, we hold back our feeling to not seem greedy but there are things that we want which aren't selfish at all. We want a car so we can drive to our new job, we want to have kids someday so a family can grow, or we want to be better towards faith and God so we can bring love to the world. These wants are as powerful as anything that is wanted in the world.
    
    Now we flip the coin to need and break down its habitual tidings for better and worse. The more needs with posse, the more stress we harbor and that leads our minds and souls down a rabbit whole of disparateness. I need a better job, I need a home to stay in, I need to be more proactive in life. That is something that can change by your own doing and with alittle effort you can. Needs and wants, the two choices.
 

   What does all this mean tho? It means that everyone has needs and wants and that nothing is simple. Life is a tough nut to crack with a hard shell, the barriers to entry become tough in today's age. If someone has a need, or a want. Try your best to help, don't sacrifice your time if it's needed but to spare a moment and make someone else's life a little more at ease can change a person's world. Happy Friday!



Thanks, KW"
Can stress affect memory and focus?,"This is probably a dumb question, but I feel so dumb recently. I was the best in my grade at science, maths and extension science last year but now I'm in year 11. I make so many dumb mistakes. 

I did a formative, missing 5 of 27 marks on the dumbest of things. Most of the time about half of my work is wrong because of dumb mistakes. 

My memory is also worse, from the point that I could remember most things without studying them, now I forget how to do it within days without study.

This leads to more stress because I think I'm getting dumber and there might be something wrong with my brain (thanks health anxiety). I've been more stressed recently and was also more than usual stressed last year when it began. 

Is it common for these sorts of things to happen with stress?

2 or 3 tips?," Hey everyone, what are two or three things you wish you learned sooner about managing stress? "
Stress reactions,"I wanna tell my struggle and maybe get some advices. When i know i dont understand for example maths i cant tell anyone because i immediately feel stressed af and being stressed connects with crying and enormous headache for me. Everyone says um too sensitive but that is my reaction for stress i cant stop it. When someone says that they are disappointed in me or smh i wanna say something that would shut their mouth but it never happens because i get angry and stressed and cry. No one takes me serious anymore. People sometimes scream at others, curse more and i have to cry and I cant control it. Any advices how not to cry?"
Survey,"Hi everyone. I am a Final year college student and for the purpose of my Design project, I've prepared this survey.

As an upcoming Interior Architect and Designer, I took on this project and in my own way aim to bring about change in  
society. Please help me in my cause by answering this questionnaire which won't take more than 5 mins of yours, but would give me so much of help. Thanks a lot. God bless, may you have a good day!

Can stress cause back pain?,Have noticed since my anxiety is gone my back pain is completely gone. 
I need some tips on reliving stress,"I don't know why but I'm really stressed out lately. Well maybe I do but being stress is so hard on me because I know damn well I ruined relationships with the people around me. It just started recently and I think the cause of me being stress is how I don't have the usual motivation to do good in my study anymore in result, I got upset with the product which is mainly guilt.

"So, I ended up staying up super late because my neighbor didn't know how emergencies work.","So, I have this neighbor that calls me every time something happens. Any emergency I'm getting called. I don't have official emt training, i don't have the medical equipment at all other than for personal use, I do have some triage training from growing up poor and from the south, so there is that. I've got some RN training and I have a cool head under pressure because of a ridiculous amount of siblings.

I am playing FO4, just minding my own, and playing the nuka-world DLC because i've not played that one to death yet. and my phone that had been playing youtube videos is suddenly ringing. I pop my headset from the computer and into the phone. answering. because if it's a number i know, and they're calling, it's bloody important.

So, she is shouting over the carbon monoxide alarm telling me it's going off..... SMH.

""Get the baby, get the dog, and evacuate the house NOW. Come upstairs, call 911, and i'll call the gas company.""

Sure enough they're in the breezeway in front of my door, i make one of the guys sit down as he's showing signs of exposure.. (Dizziness, sudden headache, stumbling with words etc...) I check out the baby and my pregnant friend for immediate dangers, she's on the phone with the cops, i'm on the phone with the gas company, and noticed two of the neighbors hanging out on the balcony above us. I called up to them to gtfo, there's a gas leak in the building. They checked for neighbors, (only four occupied at that moment on our side of the building. problem is there are four apartments each on levels 1 and 2, and two units on the bottom. it's a weird setup. and that's just my half of the building. so, doubling that means 10 apartments evacuated.)

So, the only warm-ish, not raining night this week we end up hanging out outside with people we basically never talk to because we have different schedules and when we get home, we're done socializing for whatever day. I'm talking to a neighbor i've never seen the entire three years i've been here, and we're basically being pushed further and further back away from the building and across the main ""Street"" that goes through the center of the apartments to the back end.

Spent about an hour and a half total just waiting on everything to be cleared so we could have access to our homes. I took a guy to the back end of my apartment and showed him where the roofing guys messed up and put a leak into the heat/air vent and the exhaust from my gas water heater. Completely effed up my METAL pipes and rusted completely through without us knowing about it. So, turned out the gas company messed up my account and shut off my gas.. he came back in to re-light the pilot lights for the setups and found a second one next to ours, and i didn't check with the other gas employee but i'm going with the assumption that it won't be the last.

TLDR: Got evacuated because of a gas leak, i evacuated the upstairs neighbors, then the fire dept came out, the gas company took forever to get out here, and i'm always the first person called during an emergency. go figure."
How do I manage to keep up with my tight schedule and not break down?,"I´ve already had problems with stress before this, but I feel like I´m about to completely break down.  
So, my schedule for the next month is this:  


I´m working on a documentation for a project this week that I have to give in on monday  
Next week´s wednesday: I have my driving test reparations (I´ve failed the first time)  
Next week in school: I have to do three tests from maths, I have to do an oral exam from economics, and I´m having a programming test  
In two weeks, I have language part of my finals (I´m in electrical engineering high school)  


I feel like I can´t finish all of this in one go. I have 20 hours of school work, 4 hours for sleep and 1 for a pause during the day. I feel like my head is going to explode, I´m late on everything and honestly I wouldn´t care if a car hit me and put me in coma. I also have ADHD so that makes me work even slower since my focus is basically non-existent.

  
What do I do to not completely destroy myself?"
Tough project almost broke me. Don’t know where to go from here,"I’ve just finished a 15month long hell project. I won’t bore you with all the details but it was unrewarding, exhausting, humiliating and a constant mental struggle. 

I’ve now finished... very fortunate to have left after only 15months as most stay much longer. 

Anyway, I’ve got home, watched an easy movie and am now lying in bed, brain not able to calm down and so hyped up panicking about the project. I’m not there anymore. It’s not my problem. But I’m still as tense as I have been, just infinitely more aware that I shouldn’t be this riled up and stressed. 

What is a healthy way to calm down, wind down and mentally prepare myself for the next project?? 

I literally feel like I’ve been going non-stop full throttle for 15months. And now I want to just relax breathe and go ahhh like I’m sipping a cool can of Pepsi like the adverts. But can’t seem to do it. 

Tense. stressed. Mind buzzing and still very much feeling like I’ll be back in that office tomorrow.  

What can I do?!"
I hate my job and it’s making me miserable,"It’s always made me miserable, but the last month has been terrible. My bosses yell at and gaslight me and my team, so much so that my entire body goes into a panic when I step through the door at work. I’m always on edge, I’m fatigued, I’ve started a teeth grinding habit within the past couple of years, and it’s all bled into my personal life. I have a few job interviews lined up, but it’s hard to muster up positivity and put a smile on your face when you’re stuck someplace that constantly drags you down. 

Anyway, I’m sitting here crying when I should be getting ready for work, so any words of encouragement are appreciated. Thanks for reading."
How do I control my temper and stress?,
Stressing over the future,"Today I found out my best friend got into college! I am so excited and happy for her but for some reason her acceptance dropped a huge weight on me. I have not always been the best student and I struggle financially so getting my college applications in was hard for me but I managed to do it! Although still nervous and awaiting an acceptance or decline I had always thought that if I didn’t get in I would go to community college and my best friend was in this boat with me (as she was nervous as well). Now that she has heard back I am in this boat alone. And living in a state where university is the norm after high school and if you don’t go you are looked down on has brought me to question everything. Specifically my future. I always think about my future and I’ve always seen myself doing amazing things but now being the only one of my friends who seems to be left with the road to CC I feel like I am not enough anymore and my successful future is dwindling in my college applications. I’m not exactly sure what I’m trying to say on this but I feel my overarching point is that I have never felt more down on myself about going to a CC because I’ve always thought of it as a viable path. However, now with my friends all taking the road more traveled I feel alone and I feel like I have ruined my future for good and I’m slipping."
there’s too much on my plate,i have so much school work to make up from missing school for two weeks due to sickness and my grades fell off because of it and im also falling off physically... idk how long i can take the stress man it’s so much worse than i can convey through text... please tell me it’ll get better
So stressed from college/life: Long Rant,"This is going to be a mess...

First off I have clinical depression and anxiety. I’ve been diagnosed and been to several mental hospitals for a week or two at a time due to stress causing me to make irrational choices. I’ve been free of self harm and overdosing for 5 months but recently my tendencies have been getting worse and I’ve been feeling very suicidal and stressed. 
Currently taking 23 units in college. Each of my 5 classes give out a lot of homework and start at 7am-8PM meaning when I get home I have very little time for myself every day. Additionally, my parents whom are over seas ask to call and check my house every single day meaning I have to show that it’s clean and if it’s not I get punished. 
Because of so little time (and money) I rarely eat, going one meal a day at most. If I do spend money my mother can see my card transactions and will yell at me over spending money; if I don’t reply ASAP to my parents they get upset, swear at me, insult me and tell me I’m being disrespectful. Furthermore my sister is a TOTAL sloth, she makes so many messes and never cleans up after herself despite being 22, meaning I have to clean up after her. 
I’m stressed to the bone about getting straight A’s or a high GPA in college because my family forces it onto me. The higher my GPA the more money I can get meaning I can eat with friends or go outside or buy clothing or go see a movie. My parents also see me as the only money maker in the family, the one who with my doctorate will be able to get my family money. However, I haven’t even gotten my FAFSA money for college yet and I’ve been too stressed and avoiding everything important. I also lost my passport and $60 of fabric my boyfriend bought for me to make him a clothing item. Both of which I’ve been so scared to address and have looked endlessly for. 
I haven’t been able to draw or even play video games or watch a show or hang out with friends (only my boyfriend) since college started and it’s taking a toll. I’m seeing everyone improving in art while I haven’t even been able to draw once in two months, or even touch my laptop for a game or catch up on my favorite show. I also feel like I have no one to talk to, I have friends don’t get me wrong but I have such major trust issues and feel like people don’t like me because they never reach out to me first so I just don’t feel comfortable talking to them, more importantly I don’t want to burden anyone. 
There’s a lot going on with my boyfriend too, my depression has caused me to feel numb to a lot of emotions and I haven’t touched my medications in ages since I stopped without telling my doctor. He and I started off strong but I can see the effects of my frustration, stress and depression taking a toll on him. I also just don’t feel love for him, but I know I love him...
To cut it all short I just have no idea what to do anymore and have been crying every night. I want to get professional help again but the past 4 therapists I’ve had have been horrible and I can’t even afford it. I also have to see the doctor in 2 weeks because my kidney might be damaged due to overdosing on medication."
There is just too much on my plate to handle :”(,"I’m sorry if this is long and not typed very well, I’m on mobile and just need to get these thoughts out of my head.
The last few months have absolutely killed me (23F) and I see no end in sight. 2 months ago my boyfriend (25M) was in a really bad car accident. He broke the femoral neck of his femur in 2 places, his pelvis in 2 places, his collar bone, and messed up his knee pretty bad. He’s had surgeries to put plates and screws into them but he’s been out of work since and we have no clue when he will go back to work. The timing was absolutely great because we have to move by this Friday, I’ve been working my ass off to save money to move and i only work for dominos. I have all the money to find a place but I’ve been looking the last 2 months and haven’t found anything. I’ve spent $80 so far on application fees that I keep getting denied for. We are now 3 days away from having to move with no place to go to. I’ve exhausted all online, newspaper, and in person places and nothing has worked out. On top of this I’m dealing with a shoplifting charge from 4 years ago that I never took care of. They put me on probation and the amount I have to pay each month is ridiculous, just having to deal with the court and probation appointments have been really stressful and anxiety inducing, it also does not help with my depression. I have a 2 year old and I’m also going to school full time but with everything going on my grades are horrible and I’ve missed way too much school. I’m on financial probation so if I don’t finish out this semester i will lose my financial aid all together and will only be able to return to school if I pay out of pocket. I also have not been able to see my therapist in 5 months because my insurance was randomly cut off, I’ve been trying for months now to get it on, the last time I talked to them they said it should be on and they don’t know why it’s not and to just keep checking back in. I need the insurance to get my son checked out to put him in school because he currently stays with my grandpa who is the only person that can watch him but he’s really old and horribly mean, he constantly yells at him to shut up, calls him an asshole and other names, just for playing with his toys or being a normal 2 year old. This grandpa is the one that physically abused me and my siblings when we were little with constant verbal abuse. I don’t really know why I’m posting, I guess just looking for some support. I’m falling apart and there is just too much on my plate :”( "
Can't afford university,"University is about to start in a week and my student loan got declined because apparently I haven't held a residence class visa for 3 years (I've lived in this country 16 years with one but when you renew your passport it says your permanent residency starts on the date your passport is renewed). I called them and told them it was bullshit and they said I need to send my first passport that held my permanent residency (from when I was a baby).

This seems incredibly illogical because I was in a similar situation last year that required me to hold my residence class visa for atleast 3 years aswell and that had gotten approved. The only difference now is that my passport is renewed. 

The student loan process can take up to a month and there is simply no way that it will be approved within a week before the start date of the university (which is when the fees are due). 

I am now forced to pay out of pocket, which I can only afford for the first semester and that will deplete my entire savings account.

Furthermore, if my student loan doesn't get processed in time for the second semester, I'm forced to drop out and work. Which seems very likely if THIS is a hiccup in their system.

I know things could be worse but I am incredibly annoyed at how the company that offers the student loan service simply looked at the renewal date of my passport and declined. I would assume there are other ways to confirm how long I've held a permanent residency status other than a renewal date.

Thanks to anyone reading this far."
Experience effects after vacation,"I am not a stressful guy. But before the vacation was over, I started showing signs of insomnia-overthinking at night, the next night yawning repeatedly (one yawn about every 5 seconds) and a tension headache today. ☹️

What can I do"
"Burgled, uni work etc","I'm currently bogged down with uni work. Also, all of my stuff got burgled, things that I have been collecting since I was about 16 have all gone.

I dont even know...,"So. I'ma just hop right into it. Me and my sister have these stupid little arguments a lot. We are constantly nagging at each other for stupid things like for bot saying excuse me to ask them to move or something like that. But then there are other times when it's just a battle to make the other one lose there shit. I'm a pretty emotional kid, but I try to keep my stress and thoughts to myself, but sometimes I just boil over and have a flipping mental breakdown. I'm not very good with analogies, but I'm going to try. So there's one container that is filling up with stress. When that's full there's another container that all of that stuff goes into called an argument. When there's too many arguments, then some of that stuff goes into  a breakdown where I want to... Say things that I shouldn't. Right now I'm full of things I want to say, but I hate that I want to say them, I would hate it if I did say them, but I also hate that I don't say them, so I don't know how I'm supposed to vent on those things. It's just a viscous cycle. Any ideas?

PS while this post may not seem so serious due to the wording, it's actually a pretty hard thing for me to deal with, I just don't know how to express that."
"Me, my mom, and my dad are extremely stressed due to our douche of a landlord","First of all, I hope that my story belongs here. After all, it does have to do with stress and how it's been affecting my family and myself. If it actually doesn't belong here, if anyone would be kind enough to let know about a subreddit that this does belong under, I would greatly appreciate it. Okay, so this is actually my first ever post on reddit. And to be honest, I don't think my post is going to get read, but I still wanted to post this anyways. I'm just hope that I'm posting this to the correct subreddit...Buuutttt anyways here's my story about how our landlord has been causing major stress within my family. Also I'm sorry for any spelling or grammar mistakes...

&#x200B;

So I'm currently a senior in high school (which is stressful because I need a certain amount of credits to graduate) and of course I'm still living with my parents. And our landlord hasn't fixed anything in the house, even though my parents told him 3 times (2 verbal and 1 written - to which he signed it and was given a copy of it) about the things that need to be fixed. We even pulled the weeds in the front yard, put weed mats over the dirt, and then put rocks to make it look nice. And he didn't even take anything off of rent for that, when on the lease it didn't say that we had to do any of that. He even made us go get the rocks from the store and also buy some plants to make it look nice...We used our own money to make the yard look good....But going back to what the landlord hasn't fixed, here's a list of what hasn't been fixed along with what was wrong:

&#x200B;

\~the heater - if you want turn it off, you actually have to unplug the damn thing. And the next time you wanted to turn the heater back on, you have to plug it back in. Plus when you first turn the heater on, it'll make a smell. I'm not sure how to explain what it smells like, I guess it kind of smells like something burning or something like that. Like I said, I'm not sure.

\~the air conditioner - this broke about a year ago and actually did get fixed (after about a week of no AC). But in California, it's basically warm or hot, rarely is it freezing cold all day long. So, when the AC went out, it was freakin hot as hell. We ended up buying an AC unit to stick in the window. I think it costed about $200 or $300...I'm not sure. 

\~the plumbing - yes, the plumbing in this house is a joke. When I'm doing dishes, the left side of the sink will start backing up with water. So I turn on the garbage disposal to try to make the water go down. And it does go down, but then the right side if the sink (that doesn't have the garbage disposal) starts filling up with water that has black stuff floating in it, and it has a nasty smell (think of rotten eggs or spoiled milk)

\~the garage door - the big door that opens that allows you put your car into the garage. That's the one that broke. It has broken before, but the landlord didn't do anything about it. So my dad fixed it himself. BUT now it's broken again and my dad can't fix it this time. Whenever you press the button to open it, it starts to open, but then it dips in and makes a loud noise then closes itself. Basically the garage door, in a way, snapped/bent in a certain spot to where it doesn't want to open.

\~the ceiling - recently California has experienced a major rain storm (maybe heavy rainfall would be a better way to put it instead of rain storm..IDK) and we received a lot of rain. Which during the heavy rain, my mom noticed that there was a bubble in the ceiling...and of course it's a leak. We put a bucket there to catch the drops. And the landlord hasn't done anything to fix this. Luckily it's just one spot that leaks.

&#x200B;

That's the list of the things he hasn't fixed. But that's not where it ends. Lately, he's been harassing my dad for rent, even though my dad stated that he'll call when he has something. And yet he keeps calling and coming by. On top of that, he told my dad that we can't afford to be living in this house, or anywhere else, yadadada (I forgot what else he told my dad). Recently, one night, I was watching T.V. with my family and all of a sudden we heard loud banging on the door along with someone yelling ""I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE! WHERE IS MY MONEY!! STOP AVOIDING ME!!"" And some other stuff..Guess who it was. Yep. Our landlord. As our landlord was banging on the door, he actually tried to open the door to come inside. Luckily the door was locked, but he still tried opening the damn door! As this was happening, my dog was growling at the door, and I've never heard her growl like that....

To be honest, I've always thought if someone did end up breaking into my house, my dog would just be like 'ooooo new person!!! I'm gonna jump on them and give them kisses!!!!\~\~\~' I don't know why I believed she would act this way, but I did. Until that night, that's when I knew I was wrong about her. Well duh, obviously she would protect her family, but I couldn't help but think that...ANYWAYS MOVING ON!

The landlord recently gave us a 3 day notice to move out, and at the bottom of the notice it said that we have to pay for any damages....AKA all of the things I listed above. He can't charge us for the damages, considering we have a document stating that things need to be fixed but hasn't been fixed and he even signed it. We kept the original and gave him a copy. He's saying that we haven't mentioned anything about the things that need to be fixed. But we have proof that we have, so he can't charge us for those damages..right? 

Our landlord is also saying that he needs the rent money because he doesn't have enough money to pay the mortgage on the house. Which is a load of baloney considering my dad works with someone who knows our landlord personally. Apparently our landlord actually has a crap load of money. So then why is he so persistent in getting the rent money?

Because of all this, I have seen a side of my dad I thought I would never see. He's not the kind to break down crying, it's just not him. If he's stressed, he'll drink. That's it. End of story. So it's extremely rare that I do see him cry. But one night, my mom asked me what was wrong and when I didn't answer because I started crying (due to everything that's going on and I had been holding the tears back for a while now) that's when my dad broke down crying. He kept going on about how he's failed as a provider and he doesn't know what to do....This douche of a landlord caused my dad to break down crying AND caused my dad to start drinking more and more often

&#x200B;

On the bright side, me and my dad actually had a bonding moment that night. Me and him were a crying mess and hugging each other along with my older brother (who somehow hasn't been affected at all by what's going on...or that we know of..) We were in a group hug, and the only ones crying was me and my dad. I remember what my dad told me because..well because he rarely says things like this. My dad pushed my hair out of my face and looked me in the eyes and said: ""I never had a sister...so having a daughter is difficult cuz I don't know what to do most of the time...It was weird at first....but now I don't ever want to let you go...even when I'm dead..."" My dad rarely says these kind of things, he's the kind who shows love a certain way instead of the typical/normal way. For example, normally people would get mad if you gave them the middle finger. Well, in my house it's actually welcomed to do it to one another. It's our weird way of saying 'I love you'....My dad is actually waiting for the day I say to him ""F you dad"". But he wants me to say the actual F word. My brother has already done it, now I have to do it. So yeah my family is weird...ANYWAYS ONCE AGAIN MOVING ON!!!

&#x200B;

I'm afraid something is going to happen to my dad. Specifically, I'm afraid of him dying....And my dad has even said that the stress is gonna be reason why he dies...or because of drinking....Due to what's been going on with our landlord, my dad has started drinking again, but this time he's drinking more.....My mom is smoking more then usual also. I understand why though, it's because of the stress. As for me...well....

&#x200B;

I haven't really been eating anything the past 3 to 4 weeks. I basically eat a little snack here and there. Then when it comes to dinner, I'll either eat half of what my mom made or not have her make me anything and just find something else to eat. I can't eat a lot of meat or else my stomach will start hurting really bad, and it seems like my body won't let me eat a lot of food at all. When I do try to eat, I can only eat so much, before I get nauseated really bad. After I eat, I still feel hungry, almost like starving. It's hard to explain exactly what that feels like, but I guess it feels like your stomach is empty and when you do eat, it didn't help at all.... I ended up going to the doctor yesterday, and they're going to be doing a lot of tests on me, to figure out what's going on....AANNNDDD I've been thinking about doing a certain thing...but I don't want to let my family down and have them worried about me; which, would cause them to have more stress....but no one knows that I have this feeling...

You're probably asking what is this 'certain thing' I'm talking about...Cutting. I'm talking about cutting. I used to be a cutter, and it got bad....I have scars to prove it, but I was able to stop. Little fun fact about me cutting: my dad said I was a smart cutter, because I actually cleaned the pencil sharpener blade with rubbing alcohol before I made new cuts and I even cleaned those cuts with rubbing alcohol as well...so yeah...and before I get yelled at for using rubbing alcohol on cuts, the label says it can be used on wounds I made sure of it before using it on the cuts......

Anyway, I've been thinking about cutting again, but I haven't cut myself (on purpose) in about 1 to 2 years....The urge to do just one small cut is so tempting...….

Last little thing before I finish this post....Our landlord has told us that he's a responsible landlord and takes care of things, who fixes things when needed. Yeah, he actually said this. AANNNNDDDD he wants us out, so his daughters can move into this house. Little do they know things are crap in this house, but since they're his daughters, he'll probably fix everything in the house just for them. And he probably won't charge them rent at all, or charge them little to no rent.

Well, that's all I've wanted to say. To those who actually read this entire thing, thank you for taking your time to read my post. I know there's more interesting things to be reading, but you chose to read mine. I want to thank you for that. This probably sounds sappy and whatnot, but I legit mean it....

Also sorry for any mistakes. Normally, when typing on my laptop I make little or no mistakes but I noticed while typing this post, I kept making some mistakes....So yeah, once again thank you for reading!"
Terrible work stress causing my acneto stay and get worse,So I work at chick fil a and I have been for about 4 months. It is extremely stressful there all the time for me. It’s like no matter what I do I still end up stressing terribly and I can just feel my acne getting worse by the second. I’m on curology right now for my acne but honestly I don’t know if this is the right thing for me. Does anybody know of any ways to manage my stress. At this job I have to be on top of my game 24/7 and I cannot make any mistakes or our accuracy will go down and we will all get punished. I also go to school full time and I work there 30+ hours a week. The breathing techniques not really work for me too well. Is there something people think of to calm them down? I really need to work on this and get better at managing my stress.

I chose my project would be on stress and how it's processed by people of different backgrounds. Stress is something everyone can relate on. If you're someone who has struggled with severe stress during school your voice could help bring awareness to this issue. It has potential to bring light to many situations secondary students have to go through and your honest opinions are necessary for this. It's a survey that's on the long side but please participate in this survey. Thank you very much!!

Headaches and bodily pain from constant stress,"I’m a full time student and have been working part time jobs since I began last fall. I’m 26, no family or safety nets. I have another freelance job but it’s inconsistent and  money is incredibly tight.

Boss at my day job has been using me as a scapegoat and asking me to do a number of tasks outside my job description. I’m a cook, I wash dishes, I run food, and sometimes have to help the cashiers. Food quality is obviously suffering for this and I am scolded in front of my coworkers throughout the day. She will stand next to me and tell me how to stir a pot, told me I need to ask permission before putting anything in the oven— and I am a trained cook. Then she asks when I’m going to smile for her. I am looking for other jobs, but am not financially secure enough to quit before I do.

I try to see my boyfriend on the weekends, but work usually interrupts our time together. This week I was scolded so badly that I have felt ill since I got home— and this was days ago. Headache, anxiety, dread, and exhaustion. I was told I am on the road to being fired, and I have only worked here a month. I’ve been a cook before and have never been in a place with this kind of culture.

I’m just wondering how I can survive the stress while I look for another job. My life should be quite good right now, and this job should be very simple! Money and my boss are what drives my stress."

Panacea For Stress...,"&#x200B;

[Stress free Yogi](https://i.redd.it/7jbh9fs8ywh21.png)

 Our stress and tiredness make us unhappy, impatient and frustrated. Meditation can help us to understand our own mind.  We can learn how to transform our mind from negative to positive, from disturbed to peaceful, from unhappy to happy. As we breathe out we imagine that we are breathing away all disturbing thoughts and distractions in the form of black smokethat vanishes in space. As we breathe in we imagine that we are breathing in all the blessings and inspiration of the holy beings in the form of white light that enters our body and absorbs into our heart.  By training in meditation, we create an inner space and clarity that enables us to control our mind.

Heavy Exam Stress.,"I have a Maths and Biology test coming up on the same day, and I cannot handle the stress and it's making me lose focus while studying.

Edit: I'm also not good at Maths and I can't understand Algebra (which we did 3 topics on)"
My boyfriend is suicidal and I don't know what to do.,"My boyfriend has been dealing with anxiety and depression for the last few months, it began with him scraping his arm and it has now escalated to him wanting to cut and kill himself. I've been off of work for 15 days and Ill be going back in 4 days and I'm terrified to leave him home alone. He quit his job (we used to work together) because they were abusing him and causing him so much mental distress so I'm the only one working ATM and I of course need to be making money to pay bills. My dilemma is that we've gone to the hospital and he's now in with crisis (mental health center) but his appointment is only after I start work, and he's told me to please never leave him alone because he knows if he is alone is going to end it. So please if you've been in a similar situation I'd love to hear what you did. I live in Ontario and I know that EI is a thing but I've been told not to go on it because it's a huge hassle. So I'm really not sure what to do. "
"One week ago when I was walking with my dog, a helicopter exploded over our heads. I feel like I'm drowning because I don't want to be a burden and can't speak about this.","[Here is the video of the crash](https://www.cnnturk.com/video/turkiye/iste-helikopterin-dusme-ani)

Here is the story, I was walking with my dog and she got frightened by a helicopter passing by. I told her it was alright and we were about to go home. Two minutes later, she started to run towards our building and I couldn't understand the reason since I was listening to music, and I stopped her, looked behind and I saw the same helicopter over another building. There was some sort of gas coming out from it and it exploded while leaning to it's right side. 

I froze for two seconds until I saw some part of the tail coming through towards my face.

Thankfully I escaped with only an ankle twist (I ran half a block in three steps), but the helicopter crasher next to the childrens play ground. I made a guy call the ambulance and tried to tell people not to go near the crash. They didn't listen to me since I am a girl and I live in a third world country. 

We got back home eventually and I called the ambulance just to make sure they were on the way but I just couldn't speak conscious enough and apologised for takimg their time.

I learned that all of the soldiers died there. I can't sleep for a week now. I get a really small amount of sleep and it's full of nightmares and weird dreams. My boyfriend tells me I am calmer these days and I can't tell him that all I feel is pain and stress I can't be a burden to him. Everybody is acting normal but I just can't do that. My dog sees nightmares too, I feel like nobody is giving a shit about me.

Helicopter model is UH-1, a really old one that our country is using since the 70s and planning on getting rid of them at 2020."
I got accused of plagiarism at university for a maths assignment?,"Last week I received an email about plagiarism on my last maths assignment. It was an online subject that required students to check in online and view the tutors online whiteboard, each student is signed in with their student number. That at first caused me to have an anxiety attack at work but later on got over it  because I came to my senses that this was causing me unnecessary stress when I did not plagiarise. The email required me to have an interview with three people, tutor, unit coordinator and an observer (but I am not obliged to go, but I did anyways). The email notified me to bring the person I plagiarised off from.. but the thing is I actually don't know anyone let a lone plagiarised off someone?  I did call them up and said I did have a friend to GUIDE me with my maths assignment who does not do the subject at all, basically does a different course completely, same uni but different campus. So fast forward to the date of the interview I was pretty confident of clearing my innocent, I brought my friend in and they asked the guy next to be was the other plagiariser while exposing their name?  I blurted out who's that by accident. So during the interview they brought out my assignment and the other persons, only one question consisting ABC were exactly the same!!! HOW UNCANNY?? The thing is, that was only like 10% of the assignment. I do understand their point of view, out of a few hundred students me and this person had the exact same answers. So some of the answers were wrong but the plagiarised section they were asking me how I got the working out for these questions, my dumbass really did guess it but I was able to explain how I got it, the coordinators face was literally like this dumb bitch got an easy question wrong AND plagiarised it. But my explanation that literally disregarded it and just said HOW DID YOU MANAGE TO PLAGIARISE? I did say I got them off the lecture notes but I really have no idea how I have the same answers as the other person. 

 Anyways, during the interview, they were trying to throw my friend and I under the bus to admit to at least cheating, which we did not. All assessment at uni requires a signature to agreeing that all works is done by yourself only. They were trying to imply I was cheating because my friend with me looked over my assessment questions. They were trying to get him to agree basically that he did my assignment questions, thank god he kept saying I only GUIDED her with example questions just like the assignment you have given him (which he actually did only guided me because I am trash at maths). (They said if you did get a tutor for this assignment, that is cheating and that is a misconduct as it is not your own work). But seriously what the hell, I actually don't know anyone in this subject because it is all online (lol I barely attended the online lectures, it is summer break after all). After the interview they're just telling me to think about who I plagiarised off from, so this is just implying I'm already screwed because I have to see the dean if he will dismiss this matter. There are two guidelines I have to follow which is regardless brutal, if I did plagiarise (record, fines, etc)  and if I did not. If I did not I'm still not off the hook. Basically this is stressing me out badly for no reason, I can't prove my innocence. When I walked outside the room,  I think the person who I apparently plagiarised was there, I have never seen them before in my life. I'm just causing shitty outcome scenarios in my head like, what if the person said I did but I didn't? They school just wants to hear the answer they wanna hear??? I can't prove my innocence, how can they prove my plagiarism? The unit coordinator is the one who reported this but said he can't clear it, the dean has to?????? I just have to  wait for a dreading email what to do and more interview(s). I have two final exams left for summer and I just can't clear my head for this unnecessary problem (one of the the exams is this subject). I NEED TO STUDY."
"I've never learned anything from my mistakes,therefore,i always fuck up.I don't know how am i supposed to move on with my psychology.","I'm just a 19 year old male with serious(at least in my opinion) psychologic problems.My hair is rapidly fading away,i have so many bald spots(my whole family tree has no bald genes) for my age and the reason for that is stress.I often mess up-stumble while trying to speak whatever in my mind.I can't stand reading books although it's the easiest thing in the world.I often ruminate about stupid things(imagining involuntarily a lot made me a liar and -involuntarily again- always fell in love with the females on the street and imagine a momentary love moment with them).I always think(and be curious for no reason) about how people are achieving their goals or successfully do things right for the most of their time(etc. speaking fluently,holding on their goals,and my favorite;understanding the passage or book or whatever is written down in a single scan) .I can't stand my responsiblities and that's another minus(etc. playing games or doing anything but studying while i must to).But the biggest problem is,i have a really weak will.I revised my life and after that,i realized that I have never achieved a single important thing in my whole life.The funny thing is,i want to live somewhere near Stockholm and it's very clear that i'll never be able to achieve this dream.I need help and please,write something.I can't stand this body,this mind anymore."
I get angry to the point of violence over every problem that arises.,"Since the end of winter break my mental health has been deteriorating at an alarming pace. Im president of a student organization that is having trouble existing, my school work is piling up, proffessors are doing the opposite of working with me and my home life is getting worse. I'm moving out soon and I feel like I can't do anything anymore. Im stuck in my own anger and depression. Is there any way to fix this?"
Frustrating,Just slept in for a shift. I would woke up and started feeling nauseous and then just before leaving I was sick. I then passed out for a few more hours. Obviously my work is pissed. This shift was an unexpected last minute addition and obviously they think it was a skive and I've no idea how to prove what happened as they want me to bring a doctor's note and I haven't managed to get an appointment
Flu+College=Stress,"I’m in school right now, but I got the flu over the weekend. Decided to tough it out and go to class today, but at the end of the day, I felt so awful. Went to my professor for my 5 hour chemistry lab tomorrow not even asking to skip but just to work with a partner on the lab tomorrow so it would be just a litter easier on me, and he said “no, you’ll have to do it on your own.” I feel really disrespected and stressed by this because I am an A student in his class (and others), and he knew that I am really sick, and I’m trying my best. It’s not like I was asking to just skip the lab and not make it up, all I asked for was a partner to help me through it because I’m going to get tired, and I’m afraid my sick brain will miss something important along the way and mess up the experiment. I just feel so behind in the class after only one weekend of being sick, and I felt like I deserved a little more mercy than that after all the work I’ve put into his class. That’s my rant. If anyone has any advice or comforting words, I’d appreciate it. 


Update:
I ended up having to miss all of my classes today because I was so feverish that I couldn’t see straight. I emailed the lab professor basically begging to let me make up the lab, and eventually he relented, so I do get to make it up.

I have no idea what I’m doing anymore,"I have no clue what I want to do with my life. I a sophomore at a university majoring in molecular biology, but I don’t know if I can find a career that I am passionate about with that degree. I wanted to go into dental hygiene, but I don’t know for sure if I’d like it or if I’d even make it into a program. I’m just stressed about my future and don’t even know where to start looking to help myself figure it out.

How to relieve tension headaches ? They are very constant even with medication (18f),"Throughout this past year my stress level sky rocketed to a point where i used to stop in the middle of the street due to pain in my head (like someone hit me with a pan) i was prescribed some medication which made the pain go away for some time but now it developed to tension headaches (the stress band type) theyre taking place every single frickin day which is annoying af and my back is hurting more day by day

Do you have any recommendations (even maybe some over the counter drugs?) because i feel that my anxiety and stress are making me feel like an 80 year old "
burning skin??,"i know stress can make the body feel a lot of things, has anyone ever experienced what feels like their whole body is on fire? even if you’re cool to the touch. i know i’m getting sick right now, but i’ve noticed this happens on occasion when i’m extremely stressed as i am right now. "
Why can i never shut up [vent],"Bit of background: me and my partner have just moved, landlord of old house is being unhelpful and frankly rude with us.

On top of all this we are trying to navigate this all as our first time using a deposit scheme (which tbh I do t know much about) my partner is upset that I am trying to give the landlord all the options possible to give us what he needs to provide rather than waiting for the time limit. 

I feel like an a**hole for arguing with her over these things but my world view has always been to give people a chance.

What physical symptoms does your body exhibit when stressed?,"I find it difficult to determine if my body is experience stress or if it's the result of anxiety, or perhaps a combination of both.

A tad bit stressed/vent,I’ve been working at this fast food restaurant for 3 years now and I’m fed up finally. My family has been telling me for years I need to move on from this place but I didn’t because of the family I made there. Now I feel stuck. Trying to get into school but I’m not sure how without knowing where I’ll be working and how to still make better money than now. I’ve been told I need to treat myself as well but I feel extremely guilty when I do and I’m not sure why. I’m gaining a little bit more weight and I’ve already lost 60 pounds so I’m paranoid I’m going to gain it back. My mind is running a marathon to say the least 
Feeling overwhelmed,"I’m feeling the stress of being a senior in high school. Stressed because lots of school work and decisions to be made. So exhausted emotionally, mentally and physically. I’m blind and I’m depressed, anxious, angry, scared and just overwhelmed. I got a lot of things on my plate. I’m not graduating this year because of my blindness and mental disorders. I am gonna be placed in a behavioral emotional school/or/residential. Anyone know of any blind people with mental disorders that go to a behavioral/emotional school/or/residential in the United States? Thanks I appreciate it. "

[rant] Working more than 140 hours per cut off (15 days)," Goddam.

Some of you might think I'm some entitled millenial.

Some of you might even say I'm lucky I'm working somewhere that pays Overtime.

And partly, all of those are the reason why I'm still working here. The pay is great. I'm getting minimum of 30,000 PHP ($500) per month, OT included. $500 is a lot in my country.

But a little background;

I'm a Millenial. Less than one year in, I'm already stressed out.

I'm working on a well-known company in the Philippines

And they have added a new department, and we'll call this department Project Z.

My job is in finance, and as some of you might know, finance is one of those jobs that are never-ending. There is and always be a transaction.

When I started my job, I had a partner in doing everything.

Let's call this person Bitch.

Less than 2 months in, Bitch was upgraded; one of us left the job because this smart person didn't want to be a part of a job that has this kind of nature.

When Bitch was alone in the department doing this stuff, there were no transactions that were islands away.

By the time I was alone, it was ok. I could finish it in one day. Delays might happen but it only last 2 days.

3 months of me working there, they added one of the said transaction that are overseas. I was overwhelmed.

4 months, all the supposedly overseas transactions to be added are in our dept.

E-mails here and there; suddenly, the overtime that should've been optional became mandatory.

\[I'm not only doing E-mails. I communicate and is occupied with people in the first 6 hours of every morning.\]

I told one of the supervisor that I cannot do it alone. Supervisor said to just ""hold on"".

By the time December came, there was a reliever; for those who are literate on finance dept., December is the worst. Everything must be on the system or whateverthefuck they do.

So I was with someone by that time, but another one of us left the job. The said reliever was upgraded.

February and I'm alone doing 2 person's job.

80 non-OT hours, and per cut off, there are times I could reach 100+ hours of OT.

Reached 120 hours as well.

And as much as I say I can't do it alone, they are not adding manning.

I'm literally killing myself over this job.

I'm not working on weekends anymore so that they could be somehow alarmed.

Had a meeting, said that I must meet these impossible deadlines.

Deadline = to be finished daily, but the transaction of everyday: 100% sure that even if I have someone working with me, it's still not possible.

The said Bitch is always bitching about how I can't finish it in a span of a day. I just want to choke her to death.

I'm stressed. Daily.

My head is literally in heat at least once a day.

I hate my fucking job.

Everyone does, but seriously, I just think this is too much.

I need help.

I want to quit but I have no next job security.

I want to quit but I pity this project that it'll definitely fall apart without me (not that I'm great, but I'm necessary;)

I want to quit but the job pays well.

I want to quit bc of the toxic environment.

Help me.

I'm also thinking of getting money by reporting this to Department of Health or something; everyone in the department sleeps in at least twice or thrice a week.  Working more than 150 hours per cut off/15days, I don't really think it's good. There were some instances I reached 200 hours in 15 days (Sat/Sun included.)"

...and the stress set in.,"I usually do my best to avoided the thought of being stressed because then it makes it real... but fuck it’s hitting me like a bull.
I (M/24) am incredibly stressed out. I’m in the military, at my last base we had a storm that destroyed it.m, after that people broke into my house and stole things that have taken me and my wife years to acquire. There was a accident at our storage location and we lost over $8000 of belongings especially momentous from my kids childhood. Someone broke into my car and stole items out of it. 
Fast forward 2 months, I’ve gotten orders away from my last base and my wife’s (who is in the reserves) commander won’t release her from her unit so she’s still in that area and I’m alone in the new house/ new state. When i face time my wife and kids my kids cry and tell me they miss me. I don’t have a couch because it was stolen. Don’t have a tv, because it was stolen.  4 days after moving in guess what? Mother Nature decided to knock down the poser lines. It’s been 7 days that I’ve had no electricity. It’s 33 degrees in my house, i can see my breath....
The first day i lost power i drove to my brothers house and stayed there 3 days. Felt like i was intruding on him and his wife, finally got a text saying my power was back on, checked my app.. and it was! After getting stuck in the snow for 3 hours and finally got to my house at 2am i decided to take a shower after noticing my $300 worth of groceries were spoiled but i wanted chipotle. Got my food and decided o would eat after i get cleaned.. mid shower my power (again) turned off. Told myself it’ll turn back on in a couple hours. Then at least i could heat up my now cold food.
8 hours later no power, drove  1 1/2 hours back to my brother, to intrude some more on Valentine’s Day. When i walk through the threshold i get a text saying my power is on. Used a app in my phone to check and it sure enough was back on.  I left and forgot to turn down my heat and make sure all the switches were off in case the power turned back on....which it has. I also forgot my food, chipotle isn’t cheap...
Almost forgot to mention. I would love to workout to relieve some of this stress but due to my career i have arthritis in both my knees, a destroyed rotator cuff in my left shoulder, my right shoulder is starting to hurt because of reasons unknown, i think my eyes are going to shit because i have to get up to read things i would usually be able to read from where i originally was, and a little side note is i don’t have enough money to buy a couch to sit on so i got a $15 bean bag chair that hurts my back, that already likes to have random spasms. Also i can’t find my Ambein that was prescribed to me because i can’t sleep. Someone probably stole that too. All this while juggling the regular stress from the military.

At this point i just don’t care. I’ve given up. I’m way too stressed. My life has been shit for the past 5 months. Every corner has a big fuck me when i turn it.
I just want my family back.
I just want to be happy again.
Why god?..."
What can I do to minimis my stress and recover from it?,
How to cope when your partner is locked up in prison?,"Basically my boyfriend is locked up in Australia due to an organised crime gang stealing his identity and exporting substances using his details. We are currently fighting the justice system to prove his innocence however it is highly likely he will be going into a immigration detention centre. He is completely innocent and its driving me crazy as the legal system is so slow. I am struggling with extreme stress and I try to tell my friends how I feel but either they dont understand or they don't care because its not happening to them. 

My question to you is how do you cope with the stress of your loved one being locked up? Especially locked up abroad? And how do you deal with this level of stress without completely losing your marbles :(

(i skipped a year)  Its my final year in school , this exam will determine what i can do after school (college , work etc)
My father is very pressuring on me on the grades
I dont have enough time. What do i do? Its crushing "
I'm feeling very overwhelmed by my college classes.,"Before the semester started and I was registering classes/planning my schedule, I realized that I could have a schedule where I could have only one class on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The catch was five classes on Monday and four on Wednesday. I thought this would be fine at the time, but it has completely blown up in my face. 

Along with the fact that I have a very full schedule two days of the week, I belong to a club, am training for a new job, and my classes are very homework heavy. I was fine for the first few weeks, but something happened last Wednesday (week 5) where I just broke and shut down for the rest of the week. I didn't do any homework that I didn't absolutely have to do, and Sunday night as I was doing all the homework I should've done throughout the week, I felt like I was going to break down crying. I know I should've managed my work better, and I'm usually pretty good at that, but I just feel so exhausted now. I skipped all of my classes today (Monday) except one, because we were doing group work. I woke up for my nine am class and then immediately shut off my alarm and sunk back into bed, I just couldn't find it in myself to wake up. My boyfriend was worried because I had already missed two days of classes because I got my wisdom teeth out, and he knew that my professors are very strict about attendance and I shouldn't be skipping anymore, but luckily he didn't push it because there was no way I was getting out of bed this morning. I slept until noon. 

I have no motivation to go to my one class tomorrow. I have a doctor's appointment before-hand, and going to both just sounds dreadful. I have a mountain of homework I have to do tonight, but I can't handle the thought of doing it. 

I'm so tired and overwhelmed. I don't know how to get back into the groove I was before last Wednesday. I'm behind in a lot of work and am dreading the fact that I have to do stuff tomorrow and have my full day Wednesday.

How do regain my motivation to do things? "
Mental Stress ---> Physical symptoms?,"I am interested in anyone's advice. I apparently hold a lot of my stress in my jaw, clenching it even in my sleep and throughout the day. I honestly don't know a ""normal"" hold for my jaw without it crushing my teeth 24/7. Has anyone else had this issue and how did you resolve it? I've taken a muscle relaxer before and it has helped but I don't want to live on those every day. The only times I can remember waking up without a tension headache from doing it are when I take an anti-anxiety pill, again don't want to do that consistently either. "
How to deal with financial stress and debt?,"I can't get a job rn. Since my parents pay for most of my stuff it doesn't affect me directly, but it's still very stressful. I have this unhealthy obession with money wherr I always deny myself things like trips and nice clothes or going to the movies with friends bc I keep thinking about money, money, money, how much I will spend. I isolate myself this way and feel terrible about my life overall. I hate being poor and idk how to cope."

Lost my job denied uneployment. Stressed with trying to find something ASAP,"Sorry for the long post I really need to get this stuff out.

Last month after the holidays I was informed I had been laid off do to budget cuts. I applied to unemployment but only found out yesterday, after a full month of waiting, that I had been denied. 

I'm trying to appeal the case because I have reason to believe that the decision was unjust. The reason they gave for denying me was that I quit a job without getting another job, which ment I didn't have enough required hours. But the job I quit was so I could work at the job I got laid off from. Also prior to this in the same year I worked a third contract job that I have reason to believe the rep did not even look at or account for when processing my case.

Even if I try to appeal, and get approved (honestly I'm not very hopeful after how convoluted the first attempt was) it can take up to another month to go through. 

At this time I have nothing. My rent is paid for this month but I have no idea how I'll pay my bills or get through next month. Even if I get job soon it'll take some time for money to start coming in. 

I just graduated last summer for design. Since being laid off I've been trying to remake my portfolio and begin applying for jobs. I went into shock for 2 weeks and was so depressed I could barley move out of bed. The last 2 weeks I've slowly been working on my portfolio and I'm almost done. Finding out yesterday that I wasnt receiving unemployment was such a shock I made myself sick from crying and again couldn't leave my bed. 

I'm so terrified of all this that I can't think much of anything else. I know I have a few people who care about me and are willing to help as best they can. That I could live with my boyfriends family if needed (there are a few reasons I don't want to live there but most of it boils down to losing my independence and own space). But even then I feel so bad that I can't manage on my own. That so soon after graduating I'm in a finacial mess like this.

I'm trying my best to get my portfolio done but I'm finding it hard to focus with all this weighing on me. Even then I've been keeping an eye open for jobs and I haven't seen very many in my field. Which is concerning as Feburary is usually a major hiring month in my field."

My Home,"I have just recently moved out of my childhood home. Both my mother and I got an apartment together to escape my abusive father. It's me, her, and a couple who are our roommates. 

My mother decided recently she wanted to move back to the house we escaped from because she wants to "" take control"" of the house when my parents ultimately divorce. 

The problem is that our land owner will not allow just me and my roommates too stay on the lease since I don't have at least a year of rent experience. My mother has to cosign for me in order for us to keep the apartment but she refuses. She said that she would rather put in a thirty day notice for the entire apartment and everyone would have to find their own place to stay after that. 

I don't have a place to go. My childhood home is abusive and I wouldn't be allowed to stay there because of my bad relationship with my dad. I am scared, and I feel hopeless. Just wanted to vent my frustrations out. Thank you for reading. "
AHHHH Im so frustrated!,"I hate my brain so much.! Why, god. Why did you give me adhd AND autistim. I hate that i cant learn as fast as everyone else. It sucks being the only one who cant improve.

I dont want different treatment. To be coddled. I should be like everyone else. Its unfair! I hate being stupid. I want to succeed and make people proud.  Instead i the failure. It is so easy for everyone. Every time I get asked if i need help i have this mental break down. It makes me sick to need others when its a breeze for others. Ots like they're mocking me. Making fun of me, even thoigh i know they aren't.  Why was i born a mistake?

Thank you for your consideration!"
A little story of my stressful experiences,"Over the past few years I have been having depressed mood and thoughts that only began to grow stronger as time went on. In that time I had a girlfriend who I cared about very much for nearly 2 years. Long story short, she ended up cheating on me, and it was one of my least favorite experiences and it ended up giving me some bad trust issues. For a long time there was nothing but intrusive thoughts that made me want to stop thinking and living. 

After about 2 months I met someone new. She put a genuine smile on my face and allowed me to get out of bed with some sort of purpose. The problem ended up being that it shortly became a long distance relationship and it makes me worried and stressed when she can't be there with me even though I know there is nothing that can be done about it.( Her mother hates me and tries to limit our communication as much as possible) There is nothing I wouldn't do for her, so I plan to do whatever it takes to make her happy. 

 I have been preparing for my future and thinking of what I need to do. College is coming around the corner and I am very worried about all the debt that will be coming from there on out. I will end up needing 8 years of it for the profession that I want so I doubt that it will be affordable. I am taking AP classes that not only take up time during school but around an hour and a half of my free time at home. I have a job that I do not get enough hours to justify for gas and other expenses. I have recently been pulled over by a state trooper (for an exaggerated  reason that can't be argued in court) so that will set me back a few hundred dollars.

Aside from this information the only other thing causing my stress is myself and my thoughts. I am constantly baraging myself with thoughts of the future and how miserable it will probably end up being. I keep on believing that it will be a constant cycle of boring work, finances, basic needs in life, and time fillers for everyday life. It seems like it will be that for my future and I can't think of a good substitute for it. I can't think of a realistic future that I will enjoy.

What about my girlfriend? I want to be with her more than anything in the world, but she is across the country right now. I dream of traveling to go be with her but life gets in the way of it. 

There are probably a ton of little details that I could add, but this is all I have at the moment. If you have read this, I would really appreciate some sort of feedback of what I should do."
Stress response and reaction,"Hello, people. Recently I've observed my interesting stress responses and how I behave (or don't) in regards to that.
I've been dealing with that lately, maybe you know what's up with that and how to overcome it?
Lately I intended to do certain things or plainly start developing new habits. But whenever time comes to act on that intention, I notice that I get stuck in the mode of ""ughhh, I know I have to do that but I really really want to do something else"" and that urge is strong. Also, during that, stress and tension is present in my body.
I don't understand why, whenever I'm under such stressful reaction, I don't always continue on doing what I intended to but rather change my course of actions and do something instead that's easier or invokes no stress.

How can I overcome it? I don't want to always be steered by my stress responses and being ""paralyzed"" by that. What's up with that and what to do? "
I'm tired of all this. Someone just tell me what my problem is.," I'm writing to say that I'm tired of all this. I'm tired of being stuck in this mental condition for 4 months, worsening every day. I'm tired of people telling me, ""Go see a therapist"" or ""Just have patience."" I've decided I'm just going to write to show you just how chaotic my mind feels and then you can decide whether you'll be like the rest and tell me generic advice or if you'll actually help me and tell me what in the world my problem is.

I can't think straight. I feel like everything is fog. I kind of feel like my brain is really heavy. Everything feels so disorganised. I feel like I'll never get out of this state; ever. I have so many goals that I need to accomplish. Everything is so irritating. When people say stuff like, ""Remember to do this."" or ""Remember that whenever you do this you need to do this"" It just overwhelms me and makes my brain feel heavy and disorganised. I've tried implementing organisational systems like GTD (A system by David Allen) but it makes it even worse. It's really tough to explain. I have so many thoughts (I think) and I don't even know how to say them or what they actually are. I've been researching for months to find out what's wrong with me. The more I research the more overwhelmed and strange I feel. The way I feel is like any kind of small thing or stress I feel like screaming really loudly or like hitting something really hard. I am not able to see a therapist, so don't mention it it is out of the question.

Last year I really stressed myself out for a 13 year old. I used to wake at 5, clean until around 7, go to school, come back and continue cleaning and working until around 8pm at which I would stop and do my homework other self improvement until 11pm. I would then go to sleep and just repeat every weekday. On weekends I would just keep cleaning and working outside. I never have friends come over or anything like that. I also go to sleep too late and find it hard to go to sleep early.

I feel so depressed all the time and because I feel my brain feels so heavy and disorganised and stuff I can't process what the problem is. I feel like everybody is just like a skeleton and everybody is just going to die and how pointless everything is. I wish I could just view the world the way I used to when I was like 6 or 7 or 8. I used to love everyone and always have a warm feeling and I was always happy.

The closest thing I've found to describing what's happening to me is chronic stress which includes symptoms like feeling overwhelmed, feeling depressed, difficulty concentrating or an inability to do so, rapid disorganized thoughts, feeling helpless, irritability and headaches. I talked to one of my parents about it and they believe it is sleep deprivation/accumulated stress.

Somebody just please help me. I live so sadly, I can't explain it. Somebody please just tell me how to stop this."
My Mom,"This is like my 2nd post on Reddit. Not too familiar with everything. Have mercy.

I'm 17 in highschool and a friend of mines birthday is coming up. Recently she told me how she felt about me and wanted to a pursue a deeper relationship with me. We've been friends for about 3 years now. I never really saw her as a romantic interest or anything like that, but more of like ""one of the guys"". For this reason, I respectfully declined her and we're both cool about it and still friends. I bought her a hoodie and some makeup, things she's often mentioned that she likes. Thought nothing of it when the packages came, but my mom expressed that she wasn't really of fan of what I did. She said I'm giving my friend the wrong kind of message and that a guy has never done that sort of thing for her. I've tried explaining that it's a birthday gift, not a ""sorry that I shot you down, here's some trinkets to ease the emotional burden"" gift. My mom doesn't understand this though and she makes me feel guilty for what I did. I rarely speak to my mom and see her in general because she's always at work and usually gets home when I am already asleep. I see her on weekends, but when she is home I dread staying with her because she is always ordering me around or picking a fight with me or criticizing how I do things. Ever since middle school I've been developing a toxic relationship with my mother.

TL;DR My mom is super judgemental on everything I do and every decision I make and I can almost never agree with her on anything I dread being around her.

I understand I have a lot going on in this post. 

Regarding my female friend, is what I did wrong and insulting? Am I mocking her somehow by doing this? I'm not a people person so I'm not really sure if this is a dumb question or not. How do I begin mending my relationship with my mother, that is, if there is anything to mend at all? Maybe it's just teenage angst on my part."
Stress relief and general healthy ways of going about your day.,"Over the last few weeks and somewhat months, I have been trapped within a vicious cycle or emotions, stress, anxiety and constant contemplation on life. 
I generally struggle with basic daily functions without being interrupted with life thoughts and panicking about my future. These things are causing my overall health to deteriorate. The following things are being affected by the current situation:
- Lack of appetite.
- Low libido.
- Lack of self-confidence.
- Lack of enthusiasm and energy.
- No longer enjoying the things I love doing.
- Insomnia.
- Constant tiredness.
- General health and bodily functions (e.g. IBS)

The daily struggle has caused me to look into methods of combating and hopefully conquering this. I have thought about going to the gym and improving my health from a fitness standpoint however this is proving troubling due to lack of motivation no matter how much I force myself to go. 

Any suggestions that this community has for relaxation and stress-relief would be great. And if anyone who is having a similar problem currently would like to chat so a communal conclusion can be possible, I'm open for this also.

Best ways to deal with/avoid panic attacks???,"Not only is it exam week, but I’ve also been having some family issues, causing me to live alone at currently the age of 15. Because of this, I’ve been having constant panic attacks, and I literally can’t do anything under this stress and anxiety. I need some tricks to help me with this, as I need to pass my classes somehow. Any ideas?? "
To begin,"I'm gonna start my story with who ever reads this I'm doing this as a way to get through the pain. So I ask you to keep everything positive and thank you. The 9th of January started off as any other day, the wife and I wake up and our beautiful little girl wakes up too. She gets ready for work and I help I dont work anymore because I am 90% disabled through the V.A., but she works at a daycare and takes the little one with her and before she left she asked "" Can you clean up the apartment."" and I replied with "" Yea I can do that love you."" and she left. So I started cleaning up the toys and I became light headed so I sat down, now this has been happening to me for the last few months more and more. Then I became nauseous when I sat down so I stumbled to the bathroom and puked which then caused an asthma attack which caused an anxiety attack. So I call a veteran's hospital I go to and talk to a nurse she told me to go the an emergency room. I hang up and call my wife to tell her what's happening and she says ""dont go just go sit in the shower."" I replied with "" I'll try but I don't know if I can."" I then call my brother to see if he can come from his job to take me. He is a Lt. in the local volunteer fire Co. and has medical experience. He heard how I sounded and said he was gonna hang up and call for and ambulance for me, he did so and then called me back to tell me it was on its was and that he's was going to call my wife to tell her. After he hangs up with her I get a text from my wife again telling me not to go. At this point a police officer shows up and I ended up going unconscious on him to wake to EMS trying to get me to the ambulance. I am taken to the closes hospital. I have to put this into multiple parts so watch for the next post."

And i feel like the more I am with people  the more bad things i might say to them. And the more guitly i will feel. I just want to be alone sometimes, for long periods. Sometimes i wish i was just a bird or anything simple. I just dont want to be human sometimes, because there are so many things that come just by being a human. I dont think you might understand me at all. But i just wanted to share my situation. Since i dont lime to share my feelings with the people i know.

Can we adapt to stress & is it causing ill health?,"**Stress** is so common nowadays, and it is something none of us can avoid. Dan L. Lieberman discusses in his brilliant book *""The Story of the Human Body Evolution Health & Disease""* that numerous of our chronic health disorders such as particular forms of **Cancer, Heart Disease, Arthritis, Diabetes and Gout** can be attributed to mismatches between ourselves and our current environment - and it's how we are **not adapting to the Stress of everyday life**. 

Today you can learn what exactly the stress response is, how the body responds to stress and how you can use certain tools for ultimate stress management and more importantly how you can react better to stress.

Hobby Stress,"New to reddit soneone on r/tooafraidtoask reccomended this subreddit. 
SoI overthink a lot as it is but have kind've overcame it when it comes to anything actually important. I'm stuck now with stressing myself out over ny hobbies. For example I'm learning an instrument I like playing it its fun but I'll either set an unrealistic goal like learning something super complicated or convincing myself my playing is pointless unless I end up writing music and putting it out. Another would be reading. I feel like I waist my time if I'm not being productive in some way and that if I'm just chilling it's a waste of time so I end up turning hobbies like reading or excercise into work. It poisens relaxation time. Does anyone else have this, how did they deal with it?"

"Hey guys, I’m currently under stress and I need help. I taking this one hard college class, I study, do my work, and I got a 60 on one if my quizzes. This was in my mind all week. I don’t want to even go to class because of this. I worry too much.",
My problem: I have no faith in myself,"I have been the same since high school. I work really really hard for everything, because I am convinced that I won't be able to achieve anything if I put a normal amount of effort in. Throughout high school and college, school stressed me out like crazy. I would spend 10's of hours studying for tests instead of just 2-3 like my friends. It would always take me a really long time because a lot of times while studying I would get stressed and not be able to think clearly. My friends would praise me for being able to spend so much time studying and ""being focused"". In reality I was going crazy on the inside. My methods worked, got into an awesome university after high school and also have an amazing job right now. 

But despite all that I still struggle with believing in myself. I'm convinced I'm stupid and wont be able to solve problems on my own. This past month I really struggled to finish a project. It caused me SO much stress. I lost my appetite, and lost lots of weight because I was always feeling stressed/bad/sad that I wasn't able to finish the project at the pace I wanted and I wasn't able to solve bugs quickly. I know a lot of times the answer is right in front of me when working on code, but just like when I was studying, my mind gets clouded with stress and I can't think or do anything properly. I dread going to work and  I am not able to properly enjoy life outside of work either. My bf visited me this past week and I couldn't be happy he was there (even though I hadn't seen him in two months) because of the stress I had in my head.

How do I get myself to not be so emotionally tied to work? I can't keep being like this, I know it'll hinder me from being successful. I am currently trying to exercise in the mornings, and meditate for 5-10 minutes.

Anyone else have this problem? How did you deal with it?"
Hitting Head too Hard,"When ever I am Very Stressed.  I use my fist to bang on my head really hard until my head hurts very much. 
Even when I get horrible headaches,  I bang my head very hard to get rid of it,  but become very angry and still hit my head,  even with my fist or my palms of my hands until I go red. 
Yes I'm mentally ill and challenged. 
But I do this regularly. 
To me it is Normal. "
I do forty hours of work in a day,"I am a very organized yet adaptable person and I work myself to the bone. I study for three hours, workout for two, study a foreign language, go to my Judo practice, play an instrument and spend some time learning a certain skill (currently juggling) every single day. On the weekends when I don't have school I even spend a good amount of time socializing, I'm actually pretty well-off in terms of friends and relationships. If it weren't obvious from the subreddit I posted this on, I'm obviously very stressed. In the last few weeks I've been suffering from headaches and I relied on meds. When I finally went to see a doctor she said that I ""Do forty hours of work in a day"". As I also sleep for a minimum of 7 hours and maximum of 10 I don't think lack of sleep is my problem. I'm currently trying out meditation and listening to only classical music but it isn't helping as much as I thought it would, it is helping though. I need help to relax and I'm clueless to what to do. Any advice is welcome!"
Came to terms with stress,"Scored a 91/140 on a physical stress symptom test, this places me in the ""excessive"" range of symptoms.  

So, I found an empty notebook and wrote down my survey score and my specific symptoms (excessive sleeping, panic episodes, etc.) I then made a tab for each one and wrote down what happened today for each symptom- some were good news and some were bad. Made an overall goal for each symptom to eliminate a certain habit or to isolate a stressor, for example. Then I wrote down a smaller goal for the week to encourage the correct behavior or to experiment with my responses. Also added smiley faces for the good news to ""reward"" myself for doing good. Maybe I can get stickers and just condition myself to reduce stress for stickers? 

Not sure if it will work, but it's worth a try. It at least gives me documentation of my symptoms over time to talk specifically to a doctor about. They tend to take data about a problem better than some vague ""ehhh... this has been bothering me a bit.."" like what I tend to give them when they ask. "
i don't eat because of school stress,"I'm currently a sophomore in high school right now, and last semester I got so stressed from my schoolwork that it created an eating problem for me. In freshman year, I was totally fine but last semester it got really hard. I haven't eaten breakfast on a REGULAR basis since fourth grade, so not eating breakfast doesn't affect me. But then the schoolwork hit, and I started skipping lunch to study or finish stuff. Eventually, I got to the point where I wouldn't eat lunch for four out of the five weekdays. Most of my friends think I am anorexic now, but I'm not {im pretty dang happy with my body}, it's just school stress. I also have an unfortunate habit of not eating when I get stressed, so I started eating less and less dinner. Now my friends AND my parents think I'm anorexic which is fcking awful because everyone's treating me really weirdly. You're probably thinking, well that's not possible you can't go without eating. Basically my meals have been reduced to either a snack in the morning or a snack in the afternoon {snack basically equals sliced fruit} or sometimes neither. Instead, it comes out at like eleven at night when i finish my homework. I once ate fourteen oranges at eleven thirty at night while watching netflix after i finished my homework for reference. My new years resolution is to eat at normal times, but because all the above became a habit, i never really feel hungry until it hits late night. This is probably too long and boring for anyone to care, cause we're all just stressed here, but at least i get to vent and put all the shit in words u know. Any advice is great no advice is great too skrt skrt it's time to die"
Overcoming housefire trauma,"There was a neighborhood housefire a few months ago in my area and our house was a few feet away from getting burned down. Ever since, I get hyper alert whenever someone shouts or raises his/her voice because I get reminded of that day. I also palpitate whenever I hear an ambulance or a firetruck.


My main problem is, even if months have already passed, I’m still greatly stressed out by it. I always have thoughts that maybe a fire will happen again, especially at night, which will be worse. To add, after that neighborhood fire, there were two more minor fire incidents that happened nearby.


Last night, I went to bed early. There was no trigger but all of a sudden, my thoughts were racing, “There might be a fire!!” kept on repeating in my head. A neighbor started coughing (the house is close to each other), and I began to palpitate and get scared as if I’m waiting for something, I really don’t know.


How do I get over this? Or where do I start on addressing it? I hate feeling like this, even more so that I feel I’m the only one who got affected this much. I really hope someone will reply here, I really need the help. Thank you!"

Even as I type now I feel like there's hundreds of things I ought to be getting done right this second. Whenever I take a moment to breathe several other things I need to or should have gotten done need to get done. Even if I try knocking out the simpler or more important things first, things develop and I need to follow up. Can ANYONE suggest a way of dealing with this? I might actually spontaneously combust..."

Getting new things stresses me out.,"I know I shouldn’t complain because my dads are very generous, but every year, they give me at least one giant gift and a bunch of small gifts for my bday/the holidays (my bday is in early January, so it’s all at the same time). 

Just having to integrate STUFF into my space is stressful. I know that once I’ll find places for the things, it’ll be better, but then I probably won’t use the things for a while because of the associated stress.

 It took me over 6 months to set up the indoor standing air conditioner/heater they gave me last year and I didn’t even set it up; my friends did. 

My apartment is small and I’ve spent a good amount of time this year getting rid of things. Sometimes it’s hard for me to throw things out but once I get started it’s pretty easy and I get rid of a lot. It’s just getting there, especially when I am surrounded by a lot of new things that don’t have a designated space yet. 

Does anyone else kind of dislike getting a lot of *~stuff~*? "

Corporate world stress,"I (25F) have been working in my current job for about a year and a half. Feels like a lifetime already. Its in the field I’ve studied and worked in for almost 11 years but it’s my first real corporate job and sometimes I feel like it sucks the life out of me. I’m on an accelerated track in management and I’ve been promoted 3 times in my time here. Sounds great, and sometimes it is, but mostly I feel insecure and frazzled bc I find myself in constant states of transition into new roles and new teams. The lack of stability has worn on me overtime. 

The pressure is so high and I feel like I’m under a microscope living up to high expectations from many different people. The money is great and I live very comfortably at this time in my life. Sometimes it is also feels very fulfilling bc I feel important but I really dislike that my self-worth is tied into my success at work and I feel stuck in it because of the money. 

If I left, I don’t know what I’d do with myself or where I’d go. My professional experience is suited for this world. So how would I start over? And with bills and student loans, the thought of leaving and struggling financially gives me so much anxiety. I feel like I’d let a lot of people down and myself for succumbing to the pressure and failing..

Idk if this is the right place to post or what I’m looking for.. I just wake up every morning dreading going to work and am laying in bed restless for what tomorrow brings. I’m so tired, mentally and physically, that on my days off I just lay around trying to stay distracted from it all. Just needed to get this off my chest. I don’t think I’m cut out for this world but I have no idea what I’d do instead. I feel like a pressure cooker of stress just bubbling to the surface over and over. "

None of my family put any of this shit on me and i would never tell them how school is making me feel, i kinda just think i put it on myself tbh, no idea why, but i feel like it’s the only way to motivate myself. Would much appreciate if someone’s up for a chat!

"College is the best, but mostly the worst, thing that’s ever happened to me","Hi all. I’m a college sophomore about to start my second semester on Monday, and I just can’t handle the stress anymore. I have really good grades, but I just don’t know if it’s worth what’s happened to my body and mind because of stress. I wake up every morning violently sick to my stomach because I have another day of stress ahead, and I can barely eat or sleep anymore. I want so badly to learn and be able to help other people by using what I know, but I just feel like the expectations and standards that I’m being held to are more than anyone who at least slightly cares about grades can bear, especially if that person is anxious by nature. I reached my lowest point last semester and contemplated suicide several times, but never seriously. The workload I’ve been given has taken over my entire life, but I don’t want to quit because I can’t help others the way I would like to without this college degree. The only reason I’m posting on here is because I just don’t know what to do anymore. I just need a reason to keep going and some advice on how to destress and stop feeling overwhelmed. "
Just needed to vent,"So these last few months have been sort of tough for me.  I basically just wanted to vent to get all of this off of my chest before I go insane. 

My little sister was paralyzed in a car accident this summer so we have had to deal with that change. But luckily she has been staying positive so I have been trying too.  She is learning to live with it and so are we.  This was an initial source of depression and anxiety because she is a teenager but I have found that I can’t change things and I can only offer love and support. But it did add stress upon the family mostly from the driver that caused her and her friends to veer from the road and hit a ditch. 

So it basically began when I found out that someone did my taxes wrong so I owe the IRS $300 which isn’t much but it is still annoying when you barely make above minimum wage. My ex roommate infested my old house with roaches before he left. When My fiancé and I moved (it was his friend so that was the only reason he was allowed to stay in the old house) we found out that our desk had been infested since it was next to the roach infested PlayStation he had that began the whole infestation so now the new house is infested. And now I have to pay an exterminator to get rid of them. My mom let us rent this new house from her but didn’t tell us about the numerous problems with the wiring and plumbing so we have found why our washing machine had died and our tub is constantly backed up. And this is after we had to fix the air conditioner that was leaking into our back closet and had been for years until it finally died during the summer right as my husky was giving birth to puppies. I had to pay to get that fixed even though I thought that was something a landlord would fix. My fiancé accidentally ran over my pet cat before Christmas and that was a thing.... I have depression and now I have found out that I have asthma after having an asthma attack for two days that I thought was just a panic attack.  And finally my car has died and I am not sure how to fix it.  

Sorry. It’s just been a rough past year so I am hoping 2019 will start looking better. Any stress relief tips or help or advice in general would be appreciated. "
The Fear of Failing.,"I'm currently studying at the Univerisity of Texas at Dallas for Computer Science and my first semester there, I royally fucked up. I got caught up in drug abuse trying to alleviate my depression; as a result, towards the end of the semester, I dropped from a 3.5ish+ GPA to a 2.4ish+ GPA. I'm hoping to reach out to other students/alumni from any other university who have faced similar obstacles and to hear their story as to how they overcame the adversity.

I look to stress myself,"Hi all,

I want to get your opinion on something.

&#x200B;

I always had a stressful life, during the past 10 years i have always worked in fast pace environments / jobs, dealt with toxic people and i have always survived. Now i am in a really stress-free environment, but for some reason i am looking to create stress for myself. I start to worry about things that does not even matter. My latest obsession is my teeth / gum. I started to check them very regularly, meaning, maybe 20-30 times a day. I had my teeth checked twice in last month and i am going to see another doctor next week. I dont get satisfied when they say everything is okay, just because i see or at least think that my gum is recessing. What will happen if they do? Nothing! Besides the possibility to loose a tooth, which can be replaced with some amount of money, i can't get myself not thinking about it.

&#x200B;

Is there anyone that can give me a piece of mind on this? I am someone who does not usually stress for things that can be bought by money and yet i am literally obsessed with my teeth. Anyone been in same situation?"

Last week, i passed someone on the left then they did not signal and merged on top of me. I swerved and saved it but i still got shit for it. ..from people who don't have cdl or drive trucks.
I can't:  eat, drink, talk, make gestures, use phone, speed, take a turn too fast, hit the brakes too hard or not wear the seatbelt. Anything i do is wrong.
 What's worse is coworkers and 10's of thousands of my coworkers do not have cameras in their trucks. /big global company/
 It is destroying a career that was once absolutely manageable. 
-stress, eh?"
Built Up Stress,"I'm having issues with my stress management!

&#x200B;

I currently went to have a chat with a therapist about my problems and my main issue ended up being how I deal with stress. My dad was pretty strict when it came to dissopline when we were kids and I can see parts of him in me - and I don't like it.... My dad was amazing most of the time, but when he lost his cool it was rough. I remember one time I was being a little shit at home, so he ended up getting me by the throat against the wall and telling me I was a little shit (I pissed myself), I was about 11. 

&#x200B;

Fast-forward 18 years and I can see my stress/ anger effecting my relationship and my 4 year relationship is almost at an end....

&#x200B;

What happens with me is when something small happens like: I bump my thigh into the corner of a table or I stub my toe on something, I have this anger inside of me which makes me want to destroy that object! 

&#x200B;

It happens with people too. 

&#x200B;

If someone I can't stand is telling me to do something I know how to do or is just fucking me off I feel this flame inside my chest build up and it ALL comes out of my mouth! 

&#x200B;

I understand this is a natural occurrence for most people but I see people around me having the same small or big issues and they deal with it amazing compared to me. I want to be like this; call, collective - not angry and violent.

&#x200B;

My therapist told me to buy a stress ring or wrist band, but wondering if anyone has similar issues and any solutions.

Thanks "
My life so far (this is a long one),"So even though I'm only 13, I have a lot to share. Now please don't leave just because you think I'm immature because I'm 13. I've had to grow up fast. My life hasn't been as bad as other people's, but then again it's a lot worse than a lot of others as well. Anyways I'll just start.

So I was born in North Carolina, but lives in South Carolina (lived right by the border and the closest hospital was in NC). I had a good life there from what I could remember. We had a nice house nice neighbors, an awesome dog (important later), and two loving parents. Everything was amazing. But then dad got a job offer up in Wisconsin. Now me back then didn't really understand that we would never see the place again so I didn't really care. I was four when we left.

Now my dad went to Wisconsin to get an apartment and everything, but me, my mom, and my siblings went to Minnesota to live with my grandparents who lived in a small trailer on a farm. I loved it. It was amazing. They had 2 dogs (Tuesday and Tom), that Molly got to play with. (Molly is our dog.) There was never any shortage of things we could do. Many of my fondest memories came from there. I never had to use any electronics or anything. We stayed there for about 150 days, when we heard from Dad that he got everything ready. I was sad that we had to leave, but excited that we got to see dad and the apartment. I was 5 when we left.

Unfortunately the apartment couldn't have dogs, so we had to leave Molly with my grandparents for awhile. Once again, because I was a kid I only saw the upsides, and didn't understand why my parents were yelling all the time. I looked forward to every summer, where we would go back and visit the farm. I got to see Molly, and Tuesday. Unfortunately one of the neighbors mistook Tom as the dog who killed their chickens, and took him away. I was sad, but once again, I just didn't understand why, or what happened to him.

Occasionally through the year me my siblings, and my dad would go see his side of the family. There was my aunt let's call her R who had two kids, I'll call them L and W, and there was my uncle, let's call him T who also had 2 kids, let's call them C, and I. After awhile, when we were at our apartment out parents called us in. We all came in and they told us that T had been murdered. It was the first time I delete with death, besides when my brother's Guinea pig died in SC. I cried a lot knowing that I would never see him again. I was 6.

I went to school right when I turned 7. I liked it. I made some friends, one of which was named Adam. He was my best friend for the next few years. Kindergarten was kind of a blur. After which we switched schools. And guess what. So did Adam. We were pals again. We went to this tiny school (I believe it was Catholic) I was the oldest one there aside from my brothers who were in 4th, and 5th. It was all one room. I also have some fun memories of that place. Halfway through the year, Adam moved to a different school for reasons I don't know. But a couple days later, we were going to leave as well. I never was able to figure out why, besides the fact that the pastor had done something. I can't help thinking that they were connected. So we went to this bigger school (still Catholic) and guess what. Adam was there again! But, he seemed different. He was hanging out with this other kid named Nick. Nick the dick. He always chose him over me and I hated it. I felt horrible. But then summer came. I was 8.

That's when I heard that we were moving again. But not with our dad. I didn't understand it at that time, when we picked my older sister up from school, she kept on yelling asking if it was a divorce. Divorce. I had never heard that word, and I wish that I could go back and tell young me that that word would change my life. But I can't. So I was just in the back seat of the van, wondering what that word meant. My mom said no, and that they were just separating for now. I went to a new school and had to make new friends again. Adam was gone. I had a new teacher that I absolutely despised,but I'll spare you the details. after 2nd grade, I was 9.

That summer we weren't able to go to our grandparents house because they were buying a new house. I was sad, because I loved that house. But in also hearing this, we got Molly back in our new apartment. My other even older sister let's call her H, took Tuesday as well. In the process of them buying the house, my grandma got sick. She was in the hospital for awhile, and right when my grandpa purchased the house (more of a duplex) my grandma fell, and unfortunately died. It hit me like a tank. But it especially hurt my mom. Her mom had died. But what was even worse was that my grandpa had only bought the house was for my grandma. So he had sold the the trailer for nothing. All of my memories of that place we're gone, and turned into a field of corn. The only time I ever got to see the new house was when we went to my grandmother's funeral, and then, he sold it to go live at IHOP (international house of prayer) 

3rd grade was different. I had a new teacher (one teacher per 2 grade levels) and I was excited. Not much happened in 3rd grade. Everything was good. We lived at this neighborhood which had a bunch of 4 apartment house buildings. (Not complexes, they were more modern-ish, and looked more like huge houses. We had ok neighbors, but one came out in particular. You may remember him as Nick the dick. He still went to the old school, but he was our neighbor. I tried to be friends with him but I couldn't. He was just ugghh. He was horrible. luckily he moved out about a year later. My dad still lived in let's call the town, Mville. Every weekend he would take us to Mville, and we'd sleep over. I liked it, but then again, I was only 9. After 4th grade, I heard that we were moving. Again. Only this time it was to minnesota.i was sad. After Nick had moved out, a woman named Nicki moved in. She had a dog she called teddy. Teddy was amazing. The summers there were amazing. I couldn't have asked for anything more than a summer in that town. I once again had a lot of good memories of that place. But once again, dad wasn't coming with us. right before we were about to leave, dad issued my mom divorce papers. That word again. We stayed 2 more days  then left. We left when I was 10.

When I was eleven, I started 5th grade I had to make friends all over again. It was my first time in public school. I made some friends, but not much happened that year, except for when Robert kneed my in the gut, because Alex over heard me joking around with Corbin and jokingly saying he looked like santa (Don't ask). Anyways after that year, things started to get interesting. My dad got an apartment in our town because he wanted to be closer to us. Every weekend I would go to his place and stay the night, that is if he wasn't back I. Wisconsin working at his other job. It sucked. I loved staying with my mom. I was happy that I got to stay with him more, but sad that I got to stay with Mom less. I was torn. While all of this was happening my sister's relationship with my dad was rolling down hill. I don't know why but my dad would always take stuff out on her. He never abused anyone, but he yells. A lot. I just think that he's changed from the past 10 years. 

Near the end of summer, my mom called me down. She told me that dad and her were going to try and reconcile. I didn't know what to feel. My other siblings didn't know either. My siblings that were moved out didn't like the idea. (I have a lot of siblings.) My dad then moved in. But before all of that, my grandmother's cancer came back. She was stuck in a hospital for a long time. She died later. A few months later, my grandpa suddenly died in his sleep. It was determined that he had cancer as well. Both of them were on my dad's side. I didn't cry for either. I was sad, but I just couldn't. I thought I was weird. 

Half way into 6th grade, my dad moved in. Right away, he began trying to make changes. He would constantly get mad if something wasn't the way he liked. He needed everything to be organized. I hated it. It only lasted a few weeks, until my mom gave him divorce papers. He still lives in our apartment in my sister's room on the bottom bunk. He's still making changes. In the beginning of 6th grade I made a decision that I was going to grow out my hair and donate it to kids wigs, which makes wigs for kids with cancer. My dad didn't like the idea. He used to buzz cut our hair. When it got long enough he was constantly telling me to tie it back, but whenever I did, I would get bullied at school, plus I didn't like it in a ponytail. Throughout 6th grade I was bullied. Mostly for my long hair. I hated 6th grade, for that reason, and other reasons which I will spare you the details for.

Towards the end of 6th grade, Molly began hacking up this white stuff. We thought it was just a cough, but it wouldn't go away. My mom took her to the vet. In the last day of 6th grade, we went home early, which I was glad for because I hated everyone, that day, including my ""friends"", but was sad because my mom said it was to spend time with Molly. We had begun needing to put pads underneath her, because she couldn't go outside to pee. She was constantly throwing up as well. We thought she had another year, but she didn't. She had a tumor pushing up against her lung. We put her down the next day. This time, I cried. I had known her my whole life, and she was always around. I cried for her, but I also cried for my grandmas, grandpa, and Tim, because I knew that I probably wouldn't get another chance to cry for them. I was twelve.

Throughout the summer things weren't very great. My dad decided to run for a public office position, and of course, lost, but he was gone quite a bit, trying to campaign in Wisconsin. I didn't like that I liked that he was gone. I was sad and all, but I was finally able to do my own thing. He did that for most of the summer. This year, I'm still bullied for long hair, (nearly long enough to cut) and my dad is still in our apartment. He still bugs me about my hair, and still yells. We are struggling with money, and my parents still argue a lot. They still try to hide our problems from me, and the family, but we know. And to the very few who read this, and may be able to relate, I'm sorry. I'm sorry that there are others who have to go through this kind of stuff. Just know that your not alone.

Well that was long. I'm sorry for making it that long, but yeah. There are many other things that have happened, and are happening, but I just got down the basics. Thank you."
Breathing again,"I have good days and horrible days. Well, today started out really great and breathing was fine, staying focused at work until the down time. I sat down, temperature in the room was hot and dry. I started to focus on the way my mouth felt, dry. I drank water and it was ok for a couple minutes. In those minutes, I’m saying to myself “ok, good! Just dried out”. Well, a couple minutes later, I’m dried out again, told myself “am I breathing”? Started to freak out. Heart rate got going quick, so I get up and walk around. Got a little dizzy and just super worked up. Take deep breaths it helps for the moment. Mind is still triggered on my mouth being dried out. 

Time to go home... in the car with a buddy who gives me rides home. It’s cold, so in my mind... “ahhh yeah! Cold fresh air!”. He turns on the heater. It takes a couple minutes for my mind to realize the change. I start to focus on the change in the way my mouth feels. From a cold sensation in which I feel the air come in, to dried out and my mind saying I’m not breathing. Try to work through it on the way home but couldn’t. Breathing techniques didn’t work because of the hyper focus on dried out mouth. Rushed to roll the window down as I’m starting to panic and it came down just a tad. Buddy Chuck doesn’t realize my freak out because I’m use to this and didn’t really make a big scene but boy, I’m all worked up at this point. Something about me rolling it down and getting just a taste of fresh air to remind me I’m breathing, takes away the delusion of not having air. 

Stress is hard to go through. The mind set during the time, like “I’m going to die”. Is the WORST EVER! After the melt down and battle of the mind, all I can say is I’m alive and shall keep looking forward to the future and not be stuck and settle for nothing. All because my mind is saying “I don’t believe I’ll survive”. Like I really know anything about the body. 
I do believe I need to practice better ways of focusing my attention to prevent these from happening. ALSO living a life that my mind knows that I should. Meaning, live by my convictions because if not, you will ALWAYS have those thoughts in your heart and mind that create an unsettling rollercoaster of emotions. 

My name is Rich Miranda and this is a taste of my life, for the last 8 years. "

"Stress and studies. Important Help, please","I'm just trying to get good grades. I'm not the kind of student who doesn't study and get good grade neither the one that succeed because I study. The thing is that I study almost every day, redo my homework practising math and everything, so why, from all these kinds of people, am I the one who get meh and bad grades. Someone help me, I'm tired of this. I'm tired of working my ass off for those bad grades. My issue is related to stress, because I have a fear of no success, I'm so afraid to not succeed even when I do everything right. Help "
Work causing me anxiety and hindering sleep?,"So I'm a line cook at a pretty popular, moderately classy restaurant. It's my first job in a kitchen after culinary school and I'm well aware that, having only done it for 6 months, this will probably fade. I don't pretend to know everything, because frankly I'm 100% a novice and an amateur. But I do have a level of confidence in my skills. Anyway, onto the point. This industry is notoriously stressful and hard on the people who make a living from it, especially the ones who do it as a career and not just a job. It puts an enormous amount of strain on you physically, and tenfold emotionally. It's actually quite hard to adequately describe just how much of a beating you take daily. Don't mistake this as me complaining because I love what I do. But the stress has been taking its toll on me of late. I'll get home from work completely exhausted but unable to get comfortable. I'll not be able to sit still as I'll be so incredibly anxious. And when I finally start to drift off, my mind will wander and I'll think of work, of being on the line, getting tickets, and I'll jump in a startle, thinking I'm behind or that I have orders to make. It'll happen continuously, over and over until I finally fall asleep. Have any of you experienced something similar, or know of any ways to deal with it? "
Wow! My stress caused...,My stress caused severe body aches. I almost feel like I can’t move. 
What activities do you do to help you deal with negative emotions/stress?,"I’ve already heard exercising which I do I play video games I listen to music and none of it seems to fully do the job for me.

The only stressor,"It leads to more fucking stressors. 


I'm in a complicated ass relationship. When I'm not talking to her I feel like ""ahh I love this bitch we went through so much together n we had good times, getting to know new people is long I'd rather just be back"". When I talk to her, we disagree a lot. Her views are different n it's like she's trying to feel rebellious n ""free"" by disagreeing. Then I get home and I get pissed off cos I don't know where to go from here.....in terms of everything....which leads to more stress. Right now, all I can feel is ""fuck this"" which stresses me out too cos I should probably be doing some productive shit. I'm not doing well. I started smoking hash again after 9 months THC-free. I've got PMO to deal with. Got antisocial behaviours when I'm outside of home. This is all long"
Best ways of coping with stress,"I just started work experience at a garage near me and i had an awful time. I embarrassed myself countless times and idk what I'm doing a lot of the time so I just stand there and look like an idiot. I got home from work and went to sleep instantly because I felt terrible. I woke up and started talking to my mom and I started bawling because of how hard it is and how I know no one or what I'm doing at all and I really can't hold conversations. And now I'm here writing this and I feel as if I going to vomit because I must go back for another 4 days and I don't think I've the will power to. I'm going to try convince my mom to talk the next two or three days off saying I've a fever or something because I genuinely can't handle it. But if that doesn't work, does anyone know any methods to deal with the stress???"

Call center stress,"Hi folks of reddit. I'm reaching out today cause of stress in my work place. Background is probably in order. Im 25, worked in call centers all my life. My current role has been a 5 year stint. I work 36 hrs a weeks in a three day stretch. So 12 hr days basically. In my off time I run my own business i started this year and its growing but I can't live off it yet. Probably wont be able to for another year. I enjoy my business and i enjoy working cause I can see work getting done (start a task focus get it done and repeat but it means that I have a work load there is alot to get done but I can actually finish things.) I am struggling with my call center job. I need to be able to handle 1 more year and I'll be self employed. But walking into the building fills me with dread. Regardless of how hard you work there is never signs of appreciation or your work load changing. Working hard just means you get more shoved on your plate. And this is the first job I've had that actually triggers anxiety issues. I need tips trick or advise to help me survive 1 more year. Thank you for all your help."
How to handle financial stress ?,
"Is this anxiety, depression, am I bipolar or is it all three? Could it just be stress?","(22F) Sometimes like today I get in this mood to where I don’t want to do anything. Like everything is getting to me at once so I’ll just lay in bed and cry about what I feel is nothing.. I feel like I’m just stressed but when it comes to planned events I end up canceling them just because I fear the interaction I’ll have to have during the event. The reason I say I believe it’s stress is because there’s too much and too little going on with me right now that I think it’s affecting not only my mental health but also my physical health. By that I mean my period hasn’t came but I keep getting negative pt’s and my last period was like 3 months ago so there’s that stressing me out but also I’m thinking it’s pcos because I have most of the symptoms just haven’t seen my doc to be diagnosed. It sucks because my husband and I have had baby fever for like a year now.  Also the house my husband and I are currently staying in is bound to burn down any second bc it’s a very very old metal trailer. I sold my vehicle so we could move or just to get this trailer out and put a new one here but nothings seems to be going our way right now and we’ve been struggling with this trailer for the past 3 years. We can’t rent anywhere bc we have a 45 lb pit bull in our family and he not the nicest pup and we don’t have any previous rent experience. I quit my job in September and I’ve only ever known housekeeping so I don’t have any other experience but I also don’t want to go back into housekeeping. I know most of the people who actually read this may think I’m just lazy and let me tell you.. you’re not wrong but man all this stuff has really been getting to me and I’m thankful I’m not in a tougher spot than I already am... I just want to know if I’m just stressed and how I can relieve it.. I also think I’m bipolar bc sometimes I just change moods so quickly but I’m a quiet person so people don’t understand I don’t want to keep on rambling but I feel like I’m starting to not make any sense... this is why I don’t reach out for help bc I don’t know how to explain how I feel and why... there’s so much more to know about my current situation.

I cringe at the thought of re reading this.. if I do I’ll probably just delete it."

Tryouts,"I'm a senior at my high school, and I haven't played soccer for around 2 years. I'm thinking of getting back at it, trying out in the spring and using the winter months to train at the gym and at indoor soccer arenas.

I'm stressed that I won't end up making the senior team (as a senior) and will be put on the junior team. Is being put on the junior team as a high school senior that bad? I'm stressed that I might be looked down upon. "
Work isn’t working,"I left a job after four years for a new challenge with a new employer. I’ve been with the new one two months and absolutely nothing they told me has come to fruition. In fact, everything I hoped *wasn’t* true was actually true. Needed to find a new job. 

Found a good company to interview for. Went for round one on Tuesday afternoon. They wanted round two at 8am this morning. Got the offer this afternoon but the start date is 21 December, and I have to give one weeks notice. So I had to ensure my references were in place AND resign today and resist the “would you consider staying?” line of questioning, all whilst trying to appear like nothing was up in general. 

All two weeks before Xmas. "

How do you deal with stress based eating?,"Whenever i am stressed(and recently pretty often + depression) - i tend to eat a lot. I always want to snack on something. Salty. Sweet. I know i am not hungry, because i don't feel like passing out and i know what and how much i ate during the day.
But i still want to eat something.
How do you deal with it?"
School Stress,"Hello everyone! I’m currently in my last year of high school and I’m having a hard time dealing with it. I live in Eastern Europe and in my country we have those big exams at the end of high school that are supposed to evaluate all the knowledge you’ve gained since grade 1. Two exams are mandatory - one in literature and the other one, you can choose the subject yourself.

For my second one I chose physics and I’m pretty confident with that. However, literature has always been a huge burden on mine and I find it extremely difficult to prepare for that exam. I am beyond angered constantly that I have to deal with that subject - I do understand that literature increases your knowledge about the world and teaches you how to support your arguments, but the emphasis that is given on that exam by my teacher and parents is too big and I can’t do anything but hate the guts out of it.

Now, me being the perfect student, raised by perfectionist parents, I can’t even think about having low grades on that exam. I study in a “highly respected” school, where teachers can be pure evil to you. I also have to prepare for my university entrance exams and work on a project of mine, which stress me out even more. At the end of the day, I feel so drained out and like I’ve achieved nothing, even though I have spent the whole day in school and preparing for exams.

I’ve started feeling physically unwell. I used to work out a lot but now I don’t have the energy to go out of my bed. My blood pressure is very low and I’ve gained weight. I’ve given up to emotional eating one too many times.

I wanna shine for prom. I want to look my best at the end of the school year and feel my best when real life hits me. But I’m scared that school will drain me out too much.

This is more of a rant post because I know the only way to fix the situation is by resting more. I just can’t let myself rest. My mind is constantly busy with my work. 

Anyways, any help or advice or simple encouragement would be appreciated.

If you made it that far, thank you for taking the time to read about my problems. "

Spent 2 hours drawing a little girl in a charcoal portrait and now have to redo the whole thing!,"Sigh, I’m just annoyed. It’s my first time doing commissions for people outside of family - I have given portrait gifts, and have had family members request things (and pay me) for gifts for other people, and they’ve always been well-received - but a family member of a friend requested this large picture of 2 kids and 3 pets. 

I’ve been trying to work on it between work (which leaves me so exhausted some days I just come home and sleep), other projects, regular responsibilities, and my depression that likes to pop up and have me waste hours being sad, angry, or numb but doing nothing.... 

Anyway, I got about halfway through the piece after drinking a big soda to stay up late and work on it. Over 2 fucking hours I worked on the little girl and one of the dogs. I sent a progress report pic to the customer and last night she had some minor criticisms but nothing too bad. 

This morning she messaged me and was like “I don’t know about this. She doesn’t look like in the photo”. So I offered to redraw her but said that since in the original photo the girl is making a bit of a weird face, it might look a little awkward in the drawing (which is one of the reasons it might not look like her as much). She hadn’t messaged me back yet either. I’m gonna assume it’s a yes. 

I Can understand where she’s coming from, and I Will redo it. It’s just annoying to spend several hours on something and then be told to do it again. I will of course. I just need to complain about it first. 

________________________

Update: Made adjustments, but she still wasn't happy with them. She asked if another picture would be easier and I was like ""Look, it's not that the reference picture has to be easier; my art style is not photo-realistic, it has a certain style to it, you can see that and my skill level in the examples I posted. If you want a photo-realistic style, than you're not gonna find it with my art. I'm sorry."" (Not exactly word-for-word but you get the gist). She agreed that it wasn't gonna work out than. It kind of hurts because it feels like I'm not good enough, but I know that logically that's not it... I just hope the feeling passes. 

Thanks *dinosaurcookie*, you really helped me; you're the reason I'm not gonna make myself crazy trying again, if she's not gonna be satisfied with anything. "

They’re so nice I don’t know what to do,"I’m extremely stressed with school. It seems pathetic I know but I get so many tedious, hour long assignments that I don’t have enough time to do. I used to cry around a couple times a week about homework and assessments etc and I thought that was bad. I’m crying every night now which I know isn’t helpful but I can’t help it. I’m so stressed that I can’t sleep. 
For the past few nights my mum’s been coming up to my room and telling me not to stress as she doesn’t care how I do as long as I do my best. It’s so sweet of her and my dad’s the same. They’re so understanding but my brother did really well in his GCSE’s and is doing well in his A-levels that it’s a bit of pressure. I’m not doing bad. I’m kind of smart (well I’m not stupid) but I feel like I could be failing at the same time. 
Idk whether I’m being over dramatic but I can’t control it and it’s getting out of hand. Does anyone have any advice before I have a full on mental breakdown x"
How does stress affect productivity?,
Stress Lock-Up,"I should be doing my projects. I should be getting stuff done before I go on my vacation day this week. But... I'm so stressed and uncertain about this that I'm locking up, so to speak.

I cannot force myself to start. I need help, but I don't know who I can ask for help. I need to try and get this done, but I can't start.

My job sucks. My boss sucks, the hours suck, and my stress and anxiety have gotten worse since I've started working here. I don't know what to do. I know I should suck it up and just start, but... I'm struggling.

Stress in school,"I need help with coping with stress in school. We get, on average, 1-2 hours of homework. Just to say, i'm in junior high. When I attempt to do homework; I get a raging headache and when I do bad or don't know something; I cry on the spot, or at least  shed a few tears. I don't want to take medications or talk to some people because most of my friends would say it's a joke. Sometimes, I can't get more than 2-3 hours of sleep because of this. Hope you could help me. If you think this is a solution. Nope, I can't switch schools because then I would ""throw away my future."" I do get good grades though and our grading system is a lot more strict. Is there anything I could do to get through this?"
Tips for dealing with Existential Depression?,"I have OCD, and for the past four months I’ve really been struggling with pervasive existential thoughts, especially when trying to fall asleep. This has made these past couple months thoroughly stressful, and I don’t really know what to do to alleviate it. It just feels like I’ll be having good days, and then I’ll get home and try to sleep and my brain will tell me everything is meaningless, because we’re all gonna die someday and everything we do will eventually disappear.
Sorry for the text block, I just felt I needed to explain myself.
If anyone has tips on how to alleviate some of this, they would be much appreciated."
"In the past 11 days, I’ve committed to buying a house using 70% of my savings, work has been a nightmare because of Christmas prep, I found out my dad has cancer, and my cat died.

Animal based therapies to help cope with stress,"Has anybody here used animals as a stress therapy? By this, I don't mean getting a service animal like a cat or a dog, I'm talking more like volunteering at local animal shelters for example, dog walking, that sort of thing :)  


I ask because I am contributing to this [https://healthnotepad.com/natural-ways-to-reduce-stress/](https://healthnotepad.com/natural-ways-to-reduce-stress/) and wonder if anyone has any testimonies about how animals have helped them in the past.

College is so stressful,"I thought I loved art. As soon as I took my first two college courses for drawing and painting; I did good the first half of the semester. Though after that I lost all motivation. I started skipping class because I would wake up and feel so depressed that I didn’t want to even get out of bed. I can’t even draw a doodle for myself and be happy about it. I have three days to come up with work for the student exhibition, which is mandatory to enter a piece and be there. I started talking to a student life counselor, shortly after he had to leave because he had been volunteering there for the max amount of hours he could. I only have a med doctor and I can’t start my therapy until the 10th of December, which is after the end of the semester. I don’t know what to do I don’t know at all.

Wondering if I’ve finally developed a stress-induced stomach ulcer,"(Yes I know that stress usually isn’t the only cause of those, but if it happened to me mother at one point, I’m not discounting the possibility) 

Persistent stomach cramps for the last several days has had me concerned that I’m allergic to the meds I took for an infection (some lower abdominal pain Is a listed side effect, but that doesn’t quite fit the bill with what I’m experiencing). They’re not painful, but they’re constant, and are upper - between my chest and bellybutton. 

I’ve been under so much stress lately I don’t really know where to begin because to be honest it All Just Keeps Piling Up. 
———
(Rant begin) 
Today was a day full of it - trying to get car insurance quotes for a car that I bought but can’t drive yet (bought it to practice with; never really had the time to practice driving in high school or college, and nobody in my family, except the one sister that lives far away, ever liked or wanted to help me practice), my mother and other sister harping on me to do it because my sister wants to be able to drive us into work (she just started at my job, I used to just walk there everyday but she says it’s too far for her (25 minutes) So we’ve been ubering but it’s too expensive to do everyday). Like ok, I understand the urgency but I also have a laptop that I just bought an $80 replacement battery for that Still is fighting me to turn on so I have to take it Back to the shop or ship it out to be fixed so I can’t really Afford insurance right now anyway. But whatever then! 

And I need my laptop because all of my programs are on there so I can work on my portfolio - art, animation, etc - so that I can hopefully, one day actually work in the field I went to school for! 

Plus I took this course recently to learn how to do a specific job and I’m supposed to email the instructors at some point so they can help me tailor my resume to those specific requirements. It’s been over a week since the course and I haven’t had the damn time, or really the means to with my laptop messed up, to email them. 

Plus the regular stress from my job (that I’ll Be honest, I Really Don’t Like), affording Christmas presents, and I need to throw a few hundred dollars towards my dog’s vet because we owe them money but she needs to be taken in again, and they won’t see her with the bill pile-up and NO ONE ELSE IN MY HOUSE EVEN CONSIDERS THIS. OH YEAH YOU ALL LOVE THE DOG (this is mainly my one sister I’m annoyed with) BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL ‘TAKING CARE OF’... 

[Bonus rant]
Can’t really blame my mother for the dog bills (except for them being such a low priority that they’ve accumulated this much - most if not all is from before I had my job, and was still in school) but my think-she-knows-better-than-you sister always Says she’ll do (this) for our dog or will help with (that) but a lot of times never follows through. But I’m the one where if she’s barking to go out at 3am: I’m the one that’s yelled for. If she threw something up: I’m the one that’s called to clean it. If she barks non-stop at company over: she’s put in my room with me. I’m the only one that walks her (with the exception of a handful of times where I wasn’t there and she wasn’t going in our yard for some reason; but even so a Handful of times). I take care of this dog and yet “oh iT’s EVeYBoDiEs dOg”. If I ever have enough money to pay off those vet bills than she’s MY dog! 
[bonus rant over]

There’s more - mainly family drama, and I also don’t know where I’m going to be living in a year or 2 down the line when we’ll eventually have to sell this house because we can’t afford the taxes. I have several options and none of them are good. But I really don’t feel like typing out another long explanation-rant.... 
(Rant end) 
———

So yeah, it’s really just EVERYTHING piling up. I feel like I’m loosing my mind. And my anxiety has been having a field day the last couple of weeks. 

An actual ulcer would just be icing on the cake at this point.

Feel cotton-headed after working for long hours. First time with full control of my life. Scared of what to do.,"Howdy everyone,

So a couple of things.  My narcissistic and abusive parents cut me out, and it is the first time I have full control over my life.  As a result, I am overworking myself to try and catch up with my peers.  I am starting to have memory issues and I feel as if my cranium is stuffed full of cotton and sometimes light feels like it is burning my eyes.

Will more strenuous exercise improve my stress?,"The benefits of living just one train stop away from work is that it forces you to walk at least 1 hour everyday.

"Stress, Anxiety, Depression, Medical condition? Help!","Just wondering how much of this is in my head, common, etc. I have probably been battling anxiety since I was 15 or so, with flares every few years. As I got older, the gaps got broader, but the effects and power of the lows got worse as well. I've been sitting in a low for a while now and wondering how much of what I am experiencing has been experienced by someone else. 
Here's where I am at:

* Chest Pain, typically left side, sometimes under or in the armpit, sometimes a stab straight middle

* Stomach pain, digestive pain and discomfort. Like I swallowed glass, yet poops themselves are fine

* Headaches, primarily tension - like a belt being tightened nonstop

* Dizziness, but very light, almost like being a bit off-balanced
forgetfulness, sometimes simple things like ""where did I put my glasses"", sometimes more scary things like ""are there marbles in my mouth? Why can't I get words out?!?!"" 

* Muscle pain, all over the place. Primarily my arms and chest, sometimes my thighs as well

* Feeling of weakness

* Tingling in legs

* Almost a shortness of breath, like I am out of breath just sitting on the couch, let alone running up the stairs

* Bounding heartbeat - I can see my pulse sometimes in my arms, in my chest, or in my hands while holding something. When I exert myself, my heart feels like it is going to explode

* Anger, sadness, frustration, helplessness - I classify these as side-effects, because they are happening because of the above
Things like the headaches, stomach pain, ringing in the ears are old - they come and go all the time - but the racing and heavy heartbeats, the breathlessness are all new - and scaring the shit out of me. 

I've had a tonne of work done; seen a cardiologist and my GP. So far everything seems normal. It's just that nothing feels normal. 
Just looking for thoughts, opinions, etc. Thanks everyone. "
How I Stress About What People Think Like a Politician Before the Vote,"Hi  guys! For as long as I can remember, **I've struggled with stressing over what people think.** It wasn't as big a deal before, since I mostly hung around close friends, co-workers etc. But since I moved to Austin (and met a ton of new people), I routinely stress about what people think of me.

And because of that, I tend to hide parts of myself: what I'm passionate about, what I think about topics, even parts of my faith. It all depends on who I'm around. But I'm always thinking

""What if they don't like that?""

""What if they think I'm weird?""

So then I hide parts of myself. But **every single time** I do that, I regret it afterward. I get this stinging feeling -- like a part of myself is being chipped away. I suppose that's because, well, it IS being chipped away. And those new relationships seem kinda fake.

**Can you relate to this? I'd love to hear about it in the comments..**

Anyway, a little while ago I learned something very important about emotions. 

*Our emotions are driven by extreme desires.* 

And if we understand our emotions, we'll have a weapon to overcome them and be our best self. The story below is about one of my struggles with stress and a strategy I use to have (some) success in overcoming it. I hope it helps you guys too.

I cant even get us out of a couch surfing type living situation. I'm waiting on call backs for apartments I know will decline us anyway. I'm stressed because I have exhausted any ideas I had of getting us our own place. I know i could work a second job but then my kid would be alone. Wtf am I going to do?

Stress in university because I’m struggling to create meaningful friendships,"I feel like a failure.
I feel like secretly no one likes me.

People are organising who they are going to live with next year and now I’m stuck because I have no one. I’m still trying to talk to more people and deepen my existing friendships but my mind tells me things like “you look needy” “they don’t like you”.

I’m starting to feel genuinely unhappy 😪

The only thing that keeps me going is just remembering that everything will work out okay, and I have a song I listen to when I’m stressed.

I’m in my first year btw 

Also I hate when I’m interacting with people I seem happy and confident but deep down I’m sad"
I hope someone can help me please!,"Hello, I am going through an extreme amount of stress/anxiety/bad luck sinse September . It would take me an hour to list everything. :(

Here is how my life is now... 

I know some  things that would help but some days I can't leave my house (just another trigger)

I would love to go out and walk. Kind of hard when I'm crying Alot....I've tried just can't go.i get little panic attacks. It has greatly helped in the past. 

Doc keeps telling me to take Adavin. Yes I have taken them, they calm me down for a few hours then wake up to stress... Took one today didn't help... Can't figure that one out... 

Talk therapy was told a month or two.. Now I'm told end of January and she says she never told me month or two. Yup thanks for kicking me while I'm done! 

Pysicatrist increased my Lyrica (for anxiety) 
Not helping yet. (only been a week) He told me I worry too much ( I know that) I'm not good at being alone (yup thanks for the info) and everyone has losses. Also I've tried so many antidepressants that just cause terrible reactions. 

All my so called friends ignore me or are ""busy"" I was Always there for them. Now I'm reaching out to people I haven't talked to in years. I'm getting sick of hearing if you need me call me. When I need them they aren't around = more stress. 

Only thing that helps is talking to distress lines. They calm me down then boom! Anxiety is back. About an hour later. I have NOONE to talk too. = stress

I've taken dbt/cbt classes. Yes I've tried grounding techniques and get frustrated after a bunch don't work.

Cannot Afford a pyscologist. Not working sinse September.  And $100-$200 an hour is crazy! It may not even work. 

Journaling use to work but now all i  write about how I hate my life. It mostly stresses me out even more. 

Just found out yesterday mom might have cancer. Have to wait a month or so for biopsy then wait for results. We Thought we would get results yesterday. I'm very impatient. I couldn't even go there and it broke my heart. 
Mom is the only person I have. I cannot let her know how bad I really am, she does not need to see me like this. She's stressed out too! And thought of loosing her is way too much to handle. I'm trying to think positive. But keep hearing the word mass.... 

Meditation/deep breathing is okay but right now I can't even focus. Trust me I've tried. 

Holding ice cubes do not help. 

Usually putting on some vicks vabout rub helps. I know sounds silly but does help and chewing gum too. 

If anyone has any suggestions, I really appreciate it. I don't care how silly there are. They may help! Thank you so much! 





"
Just your average rant,"So my school is having the second play of the year, I made it into the last one but I was just ensemble and this time I wanted a better role. I auditioned and right after I did the song required I stupidly asked is that it, the director and choreographer laughed and I took it as a bad sign so I apologized and told the I was nervous and anxious and now that I think about it that was a stupid thing to do too, they told me I had come a long way since last auditions and not to worry. I worried. I was stressed that I messed up and up until just recently I didn’t know what to expect from the audition. They posted the callback list and as soon as I saw it I was disappointed. I am called back as a few secondary characters in a play with plenty leads and these character have one line each and sometimes no lines at all so I’m basically ensemble again. To top that off I got called back as the same four characters that like 13 girls are going to compete for and one of them is a new girl in school that this was her first audition. I’m a bit jealous and I know I shouldn’t be but I’m not jealous that the new girl got in, it’s a mix of jealousy and disappointment and dissatisfaction in myself. Plus these two guys that I might have a slight crush on are called back for main characters that kiss the leads in the play so I’m a bit mad about that too. Sorry for ranting so much and I might sound like a bitch but I just need some place to rant and this felt like the best place for it since I’m so stressed and mad at myself about this."
"New job, fear of being the new person making stupid mistakes","I started a new job recently (now working two jobs) and I am feeling weirdly anxious and stressed about it. I didn't have this feeling for my other job when I first started. I just feel really anxious the night before work and feel like I'm the new person who might make a stupid mistake and annoy everyone. I'm guessing it's because I feel less confident in this area than I do in my other job, but I don't know how to get over it. I just hate being the new person and am having trouble sleeping each night because I can't stop thinking about all the things that might go wrong at work tomorrow. And most of all, I can't stop stressing about what my co-workers think of me. Any tips to get over these types of fears?"
Help,"I have an English exam in 2 days and I can’t bring my self to write essays due to being so stressed. I have done plenty of exams before but this time I’m so stressed because it’s the most important exam and I can feel the stress circulating all thru my body especially my heart rate and I also feel like dry vomiting, help :("
Please help.,"Okay, so I’m starting to feel extremely stressed recently and would like a way to cope with it. 

Basically a few months ago my friend started feeling depressed and contemplating suicide and despite how often I tell him to seek help he says he emailed therapists and they all refused to help him. He uses him being suicide to get things to go his way as well ( once when he ran out of money to buy food he asked me to buy it, I said I only had enough for me so he guilt tripped me about being depressed). He has done it to lots of people and says every night that he is going to kill himself but then never does anything. Not even self harm. 

This also affects my family life as I come home everyday feeling stressed and this causes conflict in my family. (I still live with my mum and she works hard and travels a lot so she is also stressed) so I try to bottle it in to not give her more stress but then it eventually comes out in the form of arguments, because we both try to bottle in our emotions, so we end up falling out and both feeling very upset.

Please can someone help me find a way to cope with all of this, it would mean a lot to me."
Stress Wakes Me Up In The Middle of The Night,"I’m a first year mature college student, with a 1.5 year old son, whose father is the most manipulative, least contributory co-parent I’ve met.

My car just decided that braking is a no-go, and now I have to get my son to and from daycare using the terribly outdated transit system (it’s located in the weirdest area that’s a 15 minute drive from my house, but about 45-60 mins bus ride and three transfers, and the only way to make these transfers successfully is through the grace of God). My engine light is on, and my starter works maybe 73% of the time. I have a project and two papers due, which is fine except I’m so busy stressing about money, and my car, and having to take my ex to court that when I sit down to work on them, I stare blankly at the screen trying to do my breathing exercises. I cannot sleep. I cannot get to sleep, and when I finally do, my son wakes up so I tend to him, and then I JUST LAY THERE. Trying to figure it out. How can I manage this, how can I afford that, what is the solution, will I be alright? The only thing keeping me from the edge is my son, I will not be my mother and damage him with my poor mental state. "
I need a little help,I’ve been feeling super stressed and emotional since August. My boyfriend moved to a different city for a job and is super busy all the time which causes me to feel neglected because I feel he makes time for everyone but me sometimes. I am a senior in undergrad and applying to graduate schools and feel that I’m not good enough to get in. On top of that I have my classes and various stuff for those. I’ve tried talking to my boyfriend and parents but no one gets it and I don’t know where to turn next. These feelings have been messing with my relationships and health and if anyone could offer some advice I’d greatly appreciate anything. 
Extremely stressed,"I have never been so stressed. I was on scholarship to play college basketball at a junior college and I blew out my knee before the season started. Rehabbed with optimism for a whole year, only to injure it again. Now my dreams are crushed, i have zero ability to focus on school work (dropped out), and face the fear of injuring my knees again.  I’m so stressed out about my fucking knees that I can’t even live my life.  I never thought an injury would throw me off like this. Now I’m back at home being taken care of by my parents (god bless them) as I prepare for my third knee surgery.  I know my life will get back on track eventually but I am going to have to go through another full year of rehabilitation.  Not to mention I have no job or career ideas. "
What else do they want from me? (Vent),"It's really just standard-issue big corporation stuff. My direct manager slaps together the scheduling for our dept. at the last minute because she's overworked, and she's overworked because it's cheaper to make her do enough work for 2/3 people than to just open up an assistant position. I'm not getting enough sleep. I'm going off my medication because I can't make the appointments I need; my weekly schedule is a complete dice roll. I've talked to my direct manager, I've talked to the managers above her, I've talked extensively to Human Resources. I've been making it clear that I'm reaching my breaking point since mid-September, but all I get back is the same hemming and hawing about ""we're trying, we're under-staffed, we're really trying, promise it'll get better soon."" I called off today - and I almost never do that - because I spent all night stress crying, and knowing it's only going to get 20x worse because of the holidays.  


The manager I talked to immediately chastised me for not trying to reach out to them before my stress got to this point, and tried to guilt me into coming in anyway. I've talked to everybody that I'm 'supposed' to like a good little employee, I've been so visibly stressed out and near-tears that other managers have been doing the reaching out *for* me, what else could they possibly want???

Everyday after lunch I get diarrhea and stomach pains and aches. I don’t know what causes this or how to combat it either,"Sometimes I’m also too to ask the teacher to use the bathroom, because I’m afraid she’d say no and maybe the other kids in the class will think I have to poop or have raging diarrhea which would embarrass me and stuff. I just don’t know if stress is causing diarrhea and stomach pains because I feel like it is. Or it could be what I’m eating but I’m not sure. "

"crap, crap, crap, crap.","first off, first world problems I know.  


I really wanted to start a family I am old and shits not going to work right soon. I stopped going to college cause I bought a house and make to much for any Aid and no way in hell am I going to pull another school loan on top of a current one, a car payment and now a house payment. So just got letter saying I got accepted into the program iv been trying to get into. Only problem is..i have two quarters to finishes like 21 credits and I have no money, I work full time and best of all I booked a vacation this summer which is the last week of school when finals are due to go to Yellowstone with my slowly fading grandmother. Okay so..I guess I just wont ever have kids and Ill take out another loan and then do all this work and reschedule the finals I need and piss my teachers off. Because no way in hell can I do all of this while pregnant and by the time I graduate ill be to old to have kids, I am already to old be to trying but everyone keeps telling me its fine and to top it off I am going to be a single mother because my husband doesn't want anything to do with kids which is fine ...whatever. Nothings right, there is no right timing. I give up. UUUUHHHHHG. "
Help with Skin Problems from Stress/Anxiety,"Hey everyone, I'm new to this community so apologies if this has been discussed before.

For the past year or so, I've had what is either eczema or psoriasis on my scalp, finger, eyelid, and lip. I'm vegan and gluten free, and eat quite well usually. I went to a naturopath today and she said that my high levels of stress are causing me to be unable to properly digest food, resulting in leaky gut and my skin problems. I also have pretty bad anxiety, especially after being sexually assaulted a few years ago.

At work, I overthink and set high standards for myself. I also feel pressure from my family, who expect me to be more successful than they are (even though they are quite well off).

I'm seeing a counsellor soon to address the sexual assault trauma, but is there anything else I can do to relieve stress or cope better? I want to be able to not get so anxious at work and become less self-critical. Has anyone had any success and are able to share their techniques?"

I hate my life,"I remember I only had two more months of high school left  and my psycho  special ed teacher  had  bias against me  she called her super attended on me because I did a follow Direction When I stay in my bedroom and I look out at the window and it's past afternoon and it's sunny and beautiful outside, I feel terrible and think shit I gotta do something, it's such a beautiful and perfect day and I'm wasting it, I won't have this gold opportunity forever. Then because I'm feeling guilty I try to go out and do something, but then I'm all alone, start to feel like shit, low self-esteem, nothing really happens or change, and then I think, ""oh well, now I just wanna go home"", and so I go back home, repeat over and over, day after day, and each day hoping that I'll figure out how to break this cycle.Hello I graduate high school a year ago and I was in special education all I can say is a teacher that I had was very very rude and very racist to they have no respect for any white students disabled students and I live in a small neighborhood and they didn't give me support or any advice to help me to continue my education my special ed teacher was an asshole I'm sorry to say this but he was the biggest fuckface ever ever since I graduate in my life has been shit I'm 22 years old and, staying home with my dad and mom and I was in special education for a long time since I was a kid and 6 years being in high school the teachers are very rude and they have no respect at all the very nasty to non-white students I was treated like a fucking animal when I was in special education all we ever did and I'm going to be honest with you all we ever did was second grade reading level and they refused to help me to catch up my grades by the time I graduate high school I was still doing second grade reading books the school that the only care about the athlete I gets so mad when I start to talk about.

"Acknowledge the building stressors in your life. As you age, there will be more and more stress. Learn about this before it's too late...!!","I am in my early 30's. I just had a birthday of a significant number to me. I had a crisis. I'm still recovering from it. 

Life is getting more and more and more stressful. I've had the same job for 6 years, and it's increasing, too, and my workload is starting to get to me. I've lost the ability to relax so it's hard to distract myself in the evenings. We recently moved into a bigger house with roommates, so there's more responsibility there. 

You might notice that your functioning breaks down. It becomes harder to do things that were once mindless and ordinary. Might even be hard to eat. That's ""Burn Out"". It's a terrible place to be, and it just gets worse. 

If you have a mental disorder like me, then stress will hit you harder (""I'm working to collect all of them!"" is what I joke to my friends in a ""maybe-I'm-being-serious"" kind of way...).

If you have a mental disorder like me, it'll be hard to regulate stress. Your mind wants to go at its own pace, and there's a pace forced upon you that your mind doesn't like to follow. But in order to survive you must follow it.

You need to find your own pace, and go at that pace as much as freaking possible. 

I've realized, on that birthday mentioned above, that it's damn hard to re-discover your own pace when you've become so used to existing in overwhelming stress.

... we become zombies on auto-pilot to prevent stress from affecting us at every moment. We lose connection with life, existing merely as creatures of survival. This can change, but it is also very hard.

Therapy helps. Medication can help. Routine helps – create whatever patterns you can that re-instill a passion for life. Patterns and routines make you feel in control – you are in control, but control is hard to work up to. I'm working up to it. I feel weak but I'm so damn strong for making it this far, and so are you. 

&#x200B;

So ... don't let stress win. Find your pace. Instill a peace in routine. Slowly work your way up that mountain (like a mountain climber with no gear) and find resting points where you can release your hold and simply rest. Stop and take deep breaths randomly throughout the day. Break the fourth wall and look around you and realize you're in life in that very moment. The destination is not that thing you're doing this evening or this weekend, but that very moment. Whether it's in a line, at work, in traffic, talking to an annoying old acquaintance on the phone, or whatever. That's the moment. Some moments feel better than others, but your mind is capable of making meaningful moments no matter what you're doing. Embrace that truth. Life can be worth it!"
Last school year,"I´m in final school year of electrical engineering and I´m doing a practical project so that I won´t have to repeat a ton of things for practical finals (which include the practical side of electrical enginnering and programming). The thing is, my teacher gave me the materials for the project way too late, and now I have to submit it next week, which stresses me the fuck out because I have about 4 days left to finish AN ENTIRE PROJECT (from the schemes to part list). And on top of that, I have to learn literature and slovak language for oral exams (which I have, by a coincidence, also next week) and I have to finish reading a book so I can make a review of it (it´s not optional, everybody was given a book in my class), WHICH ALSO HAS DEADLINE SET FOR THE NEXT WEEK.  


I´m stressing this entire fall break, I´ve been learning for 5 days for about 8-10 hours a day, and I haven´t finished nothing, even after making a schedule (breaks every 45 minutes, dedicating one day to one thing).  


When I feel stressed, I feel like I´m about to throw up (or I´m about to cry) and I get anxious to the point of total mental breakdown. I have ADHD and stress gets to me really easily, because I can´t keep my attention in place.   


Any ideas on what to do in this situation?   


PS: I am 50/50 INFP/INTP-T (50/50 dominant and inferior functions), that might have something to do with it but I´m not quite sure about it."

Is it normal to feel stressed about the prospect of being depressed?,"So basically I struggle with depression. A lot of times it comes over rational reasons but often times for trivial things. Right now I feel more or less happy.. but I find myself getting really anxious and worried about future depression and it's really stressing me out. Is this normal? If so, how do I manage it?"
Rambling about my stress,"I quit my job as a teller about two months ago and I’ve a lot of time to focus on myself and get back to working out and figuring out my school plans for the next semester. the last two weeks I’ve been feeling really out of it and constantly stressed and sad. I have been diagnosed with anxiety, depression and ptsd. So I just think it’s something that triggered it so I get back to my routine. In the last week I’ve had two interviews set up for government jobs and I’m super excited about it but all I can think about is all the thing I’ll have to keep doing on top of work. I love with my bf but he doesn’t help me out much so I’ve been constantly worrying about it. It’s weird idk "
I don't know what to do to be happy.,"I'm stressed beyond my means and I don't know where to even start trying to find some relief. 

We'll start with my job. I don't dislike the work, really. But, I feel constantly at odds with those around me. I work in an small office of 4-9 people, depending on the time of day. This office is in northern Florida where the good-old-boy mentality and conservative values are the norm. I don't relate to, understand or subscribe to any of this. They generally operate on the standard of one-upping everyone around them, I guess, as a way of being accepted by everyone else. I HATE this. I don't feel the need to compete constantly on a personal level with everyone else. When I do, I feel like I receive even more resistance because I'm somehow a new challenge or something. When I don't, I'm treated like I'm unimportant and inconsequential. Now, I'd be happy to avoid all of this altogether, but there's litterally nowhere to go to get away from it. It's a family business (the boss being my brother, but I won't get into the stress that that creates) so, I feel some responsibility to the company and I make better money than I would working anywhere else as my experience outside of this company is limited to restaurant work. I dread work everyday and constantly think of what I could do to make it more enjoyable or of a way our, but nothing seems realistic. 

Continuing on the theme of my environment, I don't have any friends. My wife is the only person that I can connect with and the only person that seems to want me around. Lately though, I'm constantly depressed and it's taking a toll on her and our relationship. I do a lot of the decision making and re-focusing of our energies away from the negatives onto more productive things and lately I have been having a really hard time doing these things.

I genuinely don't know how to make new friends. I don't drink or enjoy spending time out in loud or crowded places. I'm beyond bored by sports and detest hunting/fishing (these comprise 99% of the popular past-times of the south). I enjoy books and movies, but i rarely find that I like the same books or movies as others and it's almost never for the same reasons. 

Basically, my friendly relationships are with my wifes sisters and their S.O.'s and the only time we get together is when we make a point to go to them. No one wants to come to me. 

I feel extremely alone and overspent. I just want someone to WANT to TALK to me. Someone excited to invite me over. Someone interested in the things that I have to say....

I don't know what to do and I feel like I'm about to snap."
[Academic] Instrumental and Background Music Versus No Music On Stressed And Non-Stressed Participants (Ages 18-60),"Hey guys, if some people can take this survey about stress and music, that would be greatly appreciated!

This research came from my interest in studying while listening to meditation music. It decreases my stress levels and so I am curious if others are affected the same way. Instrumental and Background music has been chosen as what participants in the music condition will be listening to. Stress levels will be tested to see if performance scores are increased when listening to the instrumental and background music. This will enable me to have a clearer understanding of how certain types of music affect mental states allowing us to perform better.

*Please participate in my psychology study for my Advanced Research Methods class as soon as you can as I am looking for 100 participants. It is a quick 10-15 minute survey.*

Deep rooted self esteem issue at work causing stress,"So when I first started at my job - I had a shaky foundation that set the stage for everything else. 

I inherited clients from another more senior consultant and the handover was done incorrectly. It happened too soon before I had been properly trained which resulted in me making mistakes that made the client see me as the incompetent new and young person.

Those things are holding me back from
Operating at my full potential because I know I operate out of fear. I doubt and second guess myself a lot. I hesitate and fear picking up the phone. Fear coming off as too aggressive or too pushy or not sending the right person and Err On the side of not being aggressive enough. I’m afraid to take control as I fear ruining relationships etc. 

Last year i still did surprisingly well despite all this and even earned a rookie of the year title and won a trip. This year, my existing client base has gone a bit quiet and need to acquire new accounts and the fear and self doubt has reared its ugly head. If I don’t sign up new clients I won’t make money and if I don’t make money my job may be on the line and thats stressful.

I know I’m fully capable of doing this if only the self doubt and dwelling on past experiences would go away. But since my foundation was so shaky - I wonder - is It repairable? Should I ask to be re-trained until I’m confident in my ability? What is the best action to take so that I feel fully confident in what I’m doing and not operate out of fear?"
I don't know what to do anymore,"Hello fellow redditors, 

&#x200B;

I have kinda reached my peak here in terms of brain fuckery and I am just looking for advice. I understand there are hundreds of posts dedicated to this, I just really need to vent to someone about this really, and if anyone has any words of advice it would be appreciated. 

&#x200B;

I am a senior at a university, and the stress is definitely packing on and directly affecting academics and my work. There are so many things to do and work on every day but I manage to get less than the bare minimum complete if at all.  I feel the main contributor is recently (a month ago) being prescribed zoloft for generalized anxiety, depression, and some ocd tendencies. 

&#x200B;

This semester I am only taking four intensive, time consuming classes, and I have roughly 10 hours of work a week which is mostly done remotely. I also dog walk for some extra cash to afford food. The problem is I have been way too lax, and unfocused, generally taking way too long for basic assignments or just not finishing them, which evolves into not submitting them. With my work, I used to be able to put it first and get things done even between my classes, sometimes working over 10 hours a week as I'm given new projects. Lately, I have barely gotten any work done outside of my meeting day.  I believe it is the zoloft messing with me, maybe it was the anxiety that was fueling me to actually get things done. I feel like I just keep digging a hole for myself, and its my fault I'm in there. With work I get emails about updates to projects and I usually these days don't reply, and submit what I have worked on minutes prior to my meetings. Which always results in a pissed off boss really. Then I feel even worse and my ocd comes back telling me that I'm a horrible person and everyone hates me. Its a weird tick, I don't know how to describe it. 

&#x200B;

I've done meditation, I'm in a defense taekwondo  class currently ( I was physically abused so I'm pretty messed up in a lot of ways), I'm the secretary of a club on campus and try to do art things like inktober this month (haven't really been able to stick with it and instead of stress relief, became a chore). When working and doing homework I usually listen to binaural beats and chillhop together to try and boost concentration. I just somehow find myself staring at a blank screen, and getting distracted by anything and everything, and I'm just so tired all the time, like i can feel my breathing being much slower and calmer which is great, but as a result it feels like I in general am so slow. Drinking caffeine just makes me feel like I'm moving even slower somehow, my anxiety and ocd come back a little bit, and a cup of coffee only helps for about an hour. I feel like this entire post is just all over the place. Definitely goes to show the state I'm in. I used to be such a great student, able to handle 17+ credits with a 3.7gpa studying and working hard all the time.  I just want to get back to that point. Now, I get back home at 5pm exhausted, clean and make food, take care of my pup, before I know it its 8pm and I didn't even start work that needs to be done. 

&#x200B;

My life just needs a major revamp and evaluation. Maybe I need someone to help me schedule and prioritize what I need to do everyday. I don't know. I know theres a way out of the hole, its just getting to that point. 

&#x200B;

TLDR; Student recently on zoloft is having trouble focusing on work and studies, drastically affecting life, income, and academics. "
Meditation/Relaxation/Focus techniques or apps ?,"Hi everyone, I used to be great at managing stress and cope with work and University duties. But now that I'm in the last phase for my undergrad thesis and working  part time internship (which increased the workload a few weeks ago) now I'm unable to manage with the same ease all my stress and I feel in constant migraine and anxious, which keeps me from working and studying properly which then turns into more stress. It has developed into a gastric ulcer along with some vision problems and sleeping disorders.

If you have some advice or techniques, apps, for relaxing/focusing/meditation I would appreciate the help

Thank you!"
Ability to deal with stress depleted.,"Am I the only one who feels like due to my prolonged exposure to stress I’ve used up all the stress coping chemical I’ve been allotted for life and I’ve used it up too soon? Now, on a daily basis I’m usually one inconvenience away from breaking down in tears or snapping at someone. Something as simple as dropping my car keys and having to bend down to pick them up can trigger a migraine that lasts for hours. I’m sure it seems ridiculous but it’s how things are. "

Now I don't speed at all, I'm pathological in constantly checking my speed, and that's just on normal roads, but on routes with average speed cameras it's worse, but I still can't shake the fear. It's weird because when I'm driving my car it's not even a concern. When Ive been out with the other drivers they don't seem to care. The speed limit, in their eyes, appears to be optional. The fear of doing something wrong is getting to the point of me now looking for another job just so I don't have to worry about it anymore.
Could this be just down to the stress of losing a job and starting a new one, Octobers not been a good month for me stress wise, or is this just gonna keep on going until I find something else. I enjoy this job, the freedom of not being in an office, seeing a bit more of the world, and being pretty much left to my own devices is what I've always wanted, but I can't keep feeling this stressed out at the end of everyday.

Pressure in Head,"Couple of days ago I was at the ER. I felt my heart beat faster, was lightheaded, short of breath and had high BP. Doctor said I had normal test results and said it might have been due to stress. After that ive been feeling a bit better, but now I have this constant Tensions headache, I think, where I keep on feeling pressure in either the top of my head or the back of it. Have any of you felt this before ? If yes what is it called ? And is there anyway to treat this or remove the headache ?
Thank you"
Using any apps to help you cope with everyday stress?,"Cheers everyone,

&#x200B;

I wanted to ask if anyone is using any apps that help you manage everyday stress? Moеivation apps, meditation, time management apps - anything that makes it easier to focus. You see - we are about to launch a self-development app, and helping to cope with stress in our hectic world is one of its priorities. So I will be really thankful if you could answer several questions:

\- What apps are you using? Do they actually help with stress issues?

\- What do you like and dislike about those apps?

\- Are they paid of free?"
If my digestive issues are caused by chronic stress can it be fully reverted?,"Lets say that my constant digestion issues are caused by chronic stress. I’ve had it for multiple years, so would it be able to fully revert back. Or would the years of digestion issues have caused a permanent issue with the intestines signals and movement or something. Or maybe would it have caused some permanent affect on the immune system and how it relates to the intestine?"
Any tips about dealing with stress for an angsty teen?,"I'm a 16 year old Male and I am just constantly stressed when I am alone(which happens often). I stress about little things but mostly its been about a bad breakup I had a while back. Sometimes the stress gets so bad that I'm kept awake at night, like last night for instance. Any tips for dealing with stress? Anything is greatly appreciated!"
Stress because of my face,"(Sorry for my English) I have a really bad self esteem because I have no confidence around people. I have a port wine stain birthmark on my face and I think I also have repulsive/annoying/serious looking face.
Whenever I meet people they always treat me seriously and give me the stare. I feel insecure and awkward to be around people because I always feel self conscious about my face. I have no idea what did I do to deserve those treatments. When I talk to people they see me as an asshole and they treat me like that. They are either cold or serious all the time when talking to me. It pisses me off so much. 
I am a quiet person and I only talk when people are initiating the talking and most of the time I am silent. I don’t smile often tho, is this why people becomes cold to me? I have no fucking idea. I have little brother and sister and they both have nice friends and their friends treat them normal. Why can’t I be like my siblings? Why do they always treat me like I am a bad bad person when I did nothing wrong?
I have this face since I was born and I have no idea how having friends feel like because I had no friends since I was 7 years old, now I am 22.  
Because of people stares and their treatments, I became a shut in recluse and I didn’t go out because home is the only place where I can feel safe and secure. I also got bullied a lot at grade school all the way to high school. 
I just want to feel normal. Is this something to much to ask for? Do I really have a bitchy Face??
This is my face photos: http://lonelinessfighter.wordpress.com/this-is-anadite-from-reddit/

I lost my hope to live as a normal human being. I am tired living as a recluse loser for more than 15 years (from 1st grade to high school and in college too)
Help me please everyone. You can judge my photo and please be honest. Give me your comments and help because I have no fucking idea how can I live like normal person without feeling insecure and being treated like a mean person.
TL;DR: do I have a bitch face? What should I do? I want friends so bad because I’ve never had one. I am jealous to other people who have friends.

Stress from Hurricane Recovery,"&#x200B;

Hey everyone, 

Being that Hurricane Florence just occurred less than a month ago, my  personal experience with Hurricane Florence consisted of having my  maternal extended family evacuated from Craven County and coming to stay  with my family in Wilson, having to have family members be rescued from  their home due to a severe flash flood, and dealing with the shock and  emotions of loss once returning. On top of that, two of my family  members have been displaced and all of them are still in the stages of  recovery. This is the first natural disaster that has left a major  impact on my family as far as trying to find resources and dealing with  insurance adjusters and etc. Has anyone else been through something of  the sort?"
Idk what i should do and needed advice (very long read),"So first and foremost, this is a throwaway account. 

So I'll get right to it; my parents are on the verge of losing their house and possible divorce next year. This is all stemming from my dads hoarding issue. So you might say ""JuSt CaLl A tHeRaPiSt"" — Wrong! (Thats my breaking point step). I honestly don't want to seem too intrusive/forceful. I know by the end of it well all be in family counseling. 

So we've been dealing with his issue for decades (I'm 24). It was manageable or more so non-classifiable because its not acute interest like buttons or newspapers. Back then it was just stuff to help be frugal and/or a hobbyist in engineering (granted that's what he retired from now). His real hobby is hunting, fishing, etc. He'll grab a few trash like objects and turn them into a quick fix or a (very) useable tool. My guess is more of a survival instinct.

Fast forward to my HS graduation. I'm descending into college. I'm 18 and I'll be leaving home for the first time. At this point, you can see that my dad like to ""collect"" things but it not like our house looks like and episode of Hoarders (yet). 

Fast forward 18 months, I'm transferring to a college closer to home. Between traveling and not being able to find a job in the barely populated, conservative, town I was in, it was in the best interest. Also a key point, I changed my major from Veterinarian Bio to general Psychology since my hometown college didn't have vet bio. 

I come home and not much has changed. My dad has pack a few corners (not a lot of stuff, just a box or two here and there), but my mothers demeanor and tone and changed. It's was very unsettling mostly because I'm closer to my parents than my sibling (my only brother is 12 yrs OLDER than me and wants nothing to do with the household. A whole separate issue I can tell upon request).

My mother tells me that she has come under fire from the city about the accumulation in the backyard (also by this point the basement has looks more like nature trails in terms of home to maneuver). It went from multiple warnings and phone calls to fines amounting to $1400 (three times with increases each penalty; Total to date In fines = $5900). Also a lean has been put on the house because the Electric and Heating company put in a notice/complaint to the city about the basement when coming to read the meters.

Fast Forward to current year. My mother and I are doing everything we can to clean up the house before winter comes again (this is a northern state, US). I feel not only at odds but completely conflicted emotionally towards my father. It's has gotten to the point where I have walked in on my mother crying to herself about how she got into this situation. More than once I have heard her questioning her religion; ""why aren't my prayers being answered"". 

All the while we offer solutions for him to get rid of his stuff be its like he doesn't want to listen. My dad will sometimes completely ignore and disregard what is being said. I've even tried sitting him down and not only expressing my concerns about their well being but also my feeling on how I feel as his son. He went on rant (not aggressive) about how he worked all 50 something year's for the stuff he has and how everyone want to just thrown it away. And at that point I feeling like a gave up (it being 6 yrs to this day since I've graduated High school and grasped an idea). 

I currently want nothing from him. I still love my father and would do for him as he is still my dad but I don't trust him at all!! I did not mention the fact that he'll go through the garbage to see what me and my mother thrown out. I have also made a list of some of my friends trash pick up days so he can't get to some of the stuff. 

I'm just tired of feeling like he doesn't care. Like he doesn't care about what happens to my mother, our home, their safety, or even how I feel about any of that!! 

Edit: A list of thing that is now junked up or a contribution to such:
-Basement (serpents path and I currently go to the laundromat because the dryrr broke and we can't just wheel a new one down there or call in a fixer)
-Attic (currently working on and coming along great! :D)
-backyard (I might attach a picture)
-3 storage units (yes, 3 separate 'rent-a-storage' units amounting to $390/mnth or $4680/yr)
-His sister's 2 car Garage that he FILLED (This is funny because he possible lost all that due to her eviction. No sympathy)
-His own 2 car garage that ""you'll need a shovel to make a path"" (that is a quote from my mother when I came back from college. We go through presidents more often than he opens it)

Stress and lump in throat (globus),"Hey guys,

I recently started a new job about 4 months ago and ever since I've had this globus sensation whenever I started feeling a little stressed out. It started with the new job and has continued ever since. It's pretty much a daily occurrence now and I hate it! When my stress goes down the globus sensation goes away, when it comes back up it returns.

 About a month or two ago I saw my doctor about going on an anti anxiety med for general anxiety disorder (GAD) and was put on Lexapro. I've never taken an SSRI before, but I find it has helped me tremendously with my other anxiety symptoms. However, the globus still remains and I'm at my wits here about how to stop this sensation.

Has anyone here experienced this? Is there a way to treat this?

Thanks!"
College Stress,"This semester is supposed to be my last semester. I took four classes over the summer semester so I could graduate early. My summer semester didn't even come close to being stressful, I literally left the summer semester feeling great. All my stress started this semester, I don't know if its from nerves because I'm about to graduate or if its from this one professor. 

This professor I am taking for one class this semester is new, this is his first semester at my university. He basically started the class two weeks late because he was out of the country. He doesn't go over stuff in class at all, he goes over his papers (this is an empirical paper writing class).  He demands a lot from the students for this class, which I understand. Yet the part that keeps getting me stressed out is that I keep submitting paper ideas to him and he shoots them down. This past week we had our midterm, two weeks ago we went over what the midterm was going to be on in class. Two days before the midterm he emails the class and changes the parameters for what the midterm will be on. (Two weeks ago he said it would be 75 questions multiple choice, he changed it to 25 questions multiple choice and we had to answer 5 short answer questions and fill in a chart). Come the day of the midterm the whole class is worried about passing, some people are talking about sending a letter to the dean on how bad of a professor he is. The average for the class for the mid term was a 59%.

This class has me so stressed out that I feel like I am going to fail it regardless of what I do, that is how my friends in the class feel as well. The stress is also affecting my ability to do work for my other classes, I literally don't want to do any work at all.

I don't want to fail, I cannot afford fail. I have a nice job lined up for when I graduate, but if I fail it won't be open again for another year. 

How can I deal with this type of stress?

Constantly Sick,"So I'm a college student with a part time job at a high end restaurant. College is stressful enough, on top of working in fine dining. I've been throwing up constantly, at least once a day. I can't afford to keep seeing doctor after doctor but the anti nausea meds aren't working. I'm taking 3 a day. I also can't afford to stop working and I'm already done to 4 shifts a week.

I'm so tired of being sick and it's to the detriment of my school work. How does one begin to even handle this? I see a psychiatrist in a few days but what can I do in the meantime?"
I find myself getting stressed when people around me are stressed. How do I deal with this?,"I just started a new job. Always a stressful thing to do. I don't think I'm coping with it entirely well. A lot of the problem is that everyone in this office is highly stressed and it makes me stressed as well. I can't really escape it. If I lay out all my work it's not really a high volume or of a stressful nature, so I should be fine. But for some reason I'm in a haze of anxiety. 

And right now I'm sitting on the couch watching football. A very relaxing thing to do and my partner sitting next to me is trying to renew the car insurance and is being all stressed out about it, huffing and puffing. I can feel the agitation and anxieties building in myself.. Kinda ruining my evening.

How can I make this better? "
"Moving across country, cant think, need advice.","In a couple of days I will be moving from the south to the north east coast.

The problem is I am stressing  out so much it's like I am in a fog. I cant pack, cant think, I just sleep and watch TV.  It's like my body is numb and energy less. I have to use will power just to make myself food, and pack. 

Help any advice  or what I can do to snap out of it? It's a big change and it's like my body  is working against  me"
man i messed up but time will heal,pretty much this is my summary of me and sorry for the long post! ......im a 21 guy that does bodybuilding and i do a bunch of stuff lol. But for the stress i have is this....i got really bad credit like under 500 from things i shake my head to like a voluntary repo to things i couldn't pay cause of having no money from switching temp jobs. good thing the debt is under 3000 dollars. my cars i had transmission problems and engine knocks but i been saving but ill have a 2500 down payment like in 3 weeks but i stress no one will take my down payment on a truck since my credit is bombed. also another thing that i stress is my relationship....i recently moved back to KY with my mom from GA and i had i girlfriend there and i miss her a lot and i had to leave her cause i been forced to move to this super small town in KY. i had some much opportunities (bodybuilding and football etc)  in Georgia but i couldn't stay cause i couldn't find a stable job to get a place on my own and stay. i had interviews in GA but i never got a call back and i been with bad temp agencys where they promised me the job but let me go in the end. Im a great worker i never had problems at all. pretty much i need patience but its starting to hurt me every day. what should i do to relax and stay focused?? any feedback i get i will appreciate it a lot.

"Today I got into an argument with a drunk woman on Facebook involving a misunderstood joke, and bees. WTH Even Is My Life???","I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried. I just... what Even life??  

If you're curious enough I'll explain it, but the basic gist is that I made a joke about someone buying a bunch of beehives at my job 

(No, we do not specialize in that, and no I am not going to say Where I work, since the only reason I can complain about/somewhat talk about my job is because I don't name it. If you think you know... please keep it to yourself lol) 

Anyway. I made a joke about it, and one of the people on my Facebook (related to other family but not to me) started going on a tirade about bees and how horrible it was that I was making jokes about it (their declining population I'm assuming); which btw I was NOT. 
And not through One post but like 6. Just non-stop commenting. And her one adult daughter also commented about the bees and their situation; not exactly fueling it, but not helping it either?? Other people were also replying to her like ""uhhh, it's a joke?"" So I know it's not just me, but anyway...

I had been contemplating leaving work early because I arrived soaked (from a sudden downpour) and miserable, but when I saw those comments during break, I kid you not, I stayed the rest of shift and spent like 2 hours forming a counter-argument in my head, ready to blast back at the earliest opportunity.

I wrote this Very Lengthy reply explaining the joke and how it actually had NOTHING to do with the bees. The beehives just represented the tools needed for an obscure job, and that you could replace it with another, similar obscure-job tool, like scuba tanks, and it would be the exact same joke! Plus more, but this is already long. 

Her youngest daughter actually messaged me after I replied and was like ""I am so sorry on her behalf, she's drunk, and I'm trying to explain it to her but she's not getting it,"" so that's how I know she was drunk. Idk what was up with her older daughter though; she did apologize after I posted the explanation at least. 

But seriously, just what? WTF was all of that? Just, why?? 

(Fun fact though, my one coworker, who asked me why I stayed since he knew I'd been planning to leave, found my reason for staying way funnier than the original joke, or even the ridiculous situation that resulted from it.) "
Signs Your Teen Is Stressed Out Of Their Freaking Mind,"It’s the 21st century and the planet earth is a crazy place to live in especially for a teenager.

Why should teens have any reason to be stressed?

Adolescence is a very stressful time for a lot of kids. A study by the John Hopkins University School of Medicine, helps to better understand why mental illness is predominant among young adults.

They worked with young mice who exhibited the genes of mental illness. When they exposed the young mice to stress, they were able to trigger the signs and symptoms associated with mental illness.

Akira Sawa, MD, Phd, a psychiatry professor at John Hopkins Medical Center says, “Having the genes for mental illness puts the mice at risk, but it is not enough to cause mental illness. When you add stress to the equation, at an age when the mouse brain is most similar to the human adolescent brain, the mental illness is triggered.”

This mental illness that is shown in the mice is now seen predominantly in the teens of this century.

In this article you see some of the signs to help you know when your child is stressed out.

"My best friend is stressed, trying to help","So my best friend (practically my brother for over a decade) is beyond stressed right now. He's working a job he use to love but is burnt out on at the moment (fast food store manager so vacation isn't an option right now), his commute is about an hour each way, he's  working opposite shifts as his wife so he's barely seeing her. His kids live 4 hours away and he's barely seeing them. He's just beyond stressed.

I live 3 hours away so I want to send him a care package but not really sure what to put in it. I'd do candles or bath soaks generally, but I've never known him to be into those kind of ""girly"" relaxers. He's huge into music, but sending CDs is so obsolete with Spotify being a thing. I thought about sending a gift card to a restaurant so he and the wife could go out, but I almost think it might upset him more if they can't use it for awhile because of scheduling.

How to avoid stress? My life is crazy,"So here's what's going on:

1) I'm a full-time graduate student teaching a full college course by myself. (45ish work/study hours per week)

2) Because the stipend from the teaching is not enough to pay for really anything, I work in foodservice (35 hours a week)

3) Because I am trying to get into a certain PhD program, I need experience in a particular field, so I have another job (9 hours per week)

4) My bread and butter job, the foodservice job, just became unstable. If it falls through, my goose is cooked, I'm screwed. I don't know what to do. 

&#x200B;

I have time to sleep 5-6 hours per night on a good night. I haven't slept more than 4-5 hours for more than a fortnight because I'm so busy. I really...I don't know what to do. The stress of the sudden job instability is just getting to me in a bad way.

I also have a toxic home life that I'm stuck in while I'm in grad school which also does not help with this. 

Does anyone have any tips for calming TF down and not being so prone to panic-stressing?

I've tried Xanax--it messes with my ability to grad student. I'm also afraid to take other medication because I've heard from other grad students that it makes them foggy, less coherent. 

I don't have time to for a counselor--literally. I need a way to manage this myself. "

No energy on weekends and it's getting pretty bad. What can I do or change?,"// I originally put this in another sub but I wasn't getting any responses so I decided to give this one a shot.

I've been at school now for a little under a month for this school year, but every weekend thus far has consisted of me having no energy, ignoring my responsibilities, lying in bed face down all day, and then doing everything last minute. It's like I shut off and pretend I don't exist. I am aware of my responsibilities, but I have absolutely no energy or spirit to tend to them. Old thoughts also leak into my head and make things all that worse. Although I procrastinate during the week, things are nowhere nearly this serious.

Since I'm towards the end of my high school education, I understand how extremely important this year is for my future, but I just don't know how to change my mindset. The past year has been draining emotionally (rejected by who I was into), socially (sometimes I don't feel comfortable in my group), academically (no energy/drive and thus poor marks) and so I'm not sure if I conditioned myself with some type of behavioral response.

I'm not sure if this is the best way to explain or deal with my situation, but I thought that a good first step would be to try to reach out and get some advice on here. I am currently not at a place where I can discuss this with my parents in depth, and my friends know that I occasionally get really affected by something but they have no idea that it's this bad."
Mental Abuse bc of my Mom,"i don’t know what to do anymore, my family is going through reallly tough times right now, you can’t imagine. and some way even though we’re all hurting, my mom still finds a way to mess with me. i don’t have any mental illnesses and my mom has none either ( not diagnosed maybe ). She continues to tell me things that i have seen or done that aren’t true. she’s telling me these things that are not true and trying to make me think they are and if i don’t she yells at me in front of my sister and curses at me as i’m crying in front of her because i can’t take it anymore. She tells me i don’t support my llittle sister and that i don’t love her ( she’s 10) and how i don’t show her affection. Except i do all those things, me and my sister are extremely close and especially now because of stuff. she said that because i didn’t show enthusiasm for her 8:30 am soccer game i have to go to. Another thing is that she thinks i met my dads “gf” which i didn’t even know he had, if he even does. she’s telling me i’m not telling her because i’m on his side and i should go live with them and she’ll take my sister and leave. i’m 15, i don’t want to be anywhere near my dad bc of the shit he’s done and this has been going on for 4 years now. she also claims i give her an attitude anytime i do something. today i took the pair of shorts to fold and she looked at me and said “ are you really gonna grab them like that? your a fucking asshole. your giving me an attitude after all this shit? you’ll be in fucking trouble” and i said no i didn’t. then she goes, “ yes u fucking are, your father is setting you up for this, your still trying to protect him. don’t you dare say ur giving me an attitude”. and every time i said i didn’t she would tell me to shut the hell up and to say it one more time. i would tell that i’m not and why would i, then she would chase me around the couch with her hand raised. she then tells me i’m self centered and i’m a fuck up and i’m fucking my sister up. And once everything has been said 10 mins later she acts like she did none of it. she asks me if i want tea and to watch tv with her. this all probably sounds so confusing but it’s mentally making me lose it. i cant do this anymore, i can’t balance school and my personal issues and family issues and her altogether. what do i do??   plz?

I dont know what to do,"I have this thing when im extremely stressed my mentality is just on a string, and it can snap at any monent
So today i snapped in class, and my tears just keep running down, like i wasnt crying because im sad im just crying cause im so tensed and then whenever i cry when im stressed i just look down and my body just start shaking intensely especially my leg and its hard for me to breathe.
My friend tried to hug me and consult me but at that moment i just dont want to be around anyone or anyone to see me or see anyone but at the same time i cant move out of my seat .. anyone knows how to fix this because I cant be having this kind of reaction during class or during important presentation because I want to learn ...

First interview ever in 8 hours,"I haven't been sleeping much at all and still need to sleep (it is 1 am and the interview is at 9). The interview is to be an hour, all behavioral. I have no experience, nor do I have any prep for this cause they offered me this interview this morning. I still need to think of answers but I am dead tired. The horror of what is to come is eating me alive. Alive but dead. TBD, S. To be dead, soon."
Short-term solutions to bad home situations,"Hi, this is my first time on this sub. I've been extremely stressed in general lately (friends moving away, schoolwork, my job, etc) but I was kind of, in some weird way, managing it fine. I wasn't unhappy. I still had fun. 

&#x200B;

But now I'm being hit like a bus with all these things. I have two big exams this week and last night there was a big family emergency that kept me up and was very emotionally stressful. The things going on in my life have caused me to fall a bit behind in school, and I was so upset after last night that I skipped half my classes today. I know I'm probably overestimating how stressed I really am, but if I continue like this, I feel like I'm going to have a stress-induced episode of psychosis. 

&#x200B;

Things at home are still terrible and I can't ask for extensions on assignments/exams this late. I can't afford therapy. Does anyone have any short-term stress-relieving techniques that can just get me through these next few days? I think I need something a little more intense than a breathing routine to help me through this."
Eating and stress,"I'm going through something really stressful right now that won't be over for at least a month, and could get worse or better in that time. I don't know yet. 

Normally when I'm stressed out I overeat. But this is different. This is stressful enough that I don't have an appetite, which is really rare for me and I don't know how to handle it. I can feel that I need to eat, but I am not hungry, and most food disgusts me so much right now I can't bring myself to force it down. 

I know loss of appetite is a pretty common response for some people when stressed. If it happens to you, how do you deal with it? I'm guessing I would feel better if I ate something. "
Post disaster stress help request,"My wife and I live in New Bern NC a town impacted heavily by hurricane Florence. We live in a 2 bedroom 1.5 bath home with our 2 dogs, a cat and a rabbit. We are in our late 50's and lived a quiet life prior to the storm. 2 weeks ago 11 of my wife's family members and 6 dogs came to ride out the storm at our home. Unfortunately 8 of them now have no home to go back to, nor do their 5 dogs.

They range in age from a 75 year old in very poor health to a 5 year old who is autistic. Some of the family members are very considerate of others while a few are high energy manic personalities that make the situation worse.  My wife came from a large family and handles this better than I do.

I am thankful that our home was unscathed and that our jobs allowed us to return to work this week. But I am stressing out so bad my stomach is a wreck and I have head aches everyday. We make enough to pay our bills with little left over but the storm has wiped out our grocery budget. I know my power bill will sour with 13 showers and 3 loads of laundry being done daily.

Looking for ways to deal with this stress as it will continue at least for the next few months...

Relaxing guided meditation,
"The worst thing about stress is that I don't even remember what I like to do, so I can't relax by doing it.","I have about fifteen different pieces of paper (well, .doc files) that about five people are expecting from me ASAP. I've been trying so hard to sort it out, but yesterday I came to realize that I actually *can't* unless I get my heart rate just a little bit lower.

But anything I try to do to relax myself - talking with friends, my girlfriend, video games, hobbies - is torn up instantly by my brain, telling me I need to do the things I ""need"" to do. What am I supposed to do, when I have to relax but relaxing just stresses me out more."
Overthinking a situation,"Hey Reddit,

Just to put my current situation into a little more context, I'm currently living away from home, at university and I've just started my final year.

I'm constantly finding myself in the same situation over and over where I'm overthinking about a certain assignment/piece of work/being single/my future after university (finding myself a good, secure job with good income). This seems to get me down in the dumps quite a lot, sometimes I get so lost in this trail of thought that it counters my productivity. 

I'm also finding it really hard to direct myself away from these negative feelings most of the time, I just feel like I'm always stuck in a loop. 
 
My question is how do people handle this? I currently find time management a big issue, this is where all the work related stress comes from. I've just moved into a new place where I'm living with positive, motivated people but this only helps me around 70% of the time, the other 30% I'm left twiddling my thumbs and starting the cycle all over again. I want to make myself the best person that I can be, get good grades at university without the pain and trauma that comes with over thinking a situation.

Does anyone have any experience with this and could possibly help me out? Thanks."

How to manage the physical affects of stress?,"Hey r/Stress. So I've come to the conclusion that the symptoms (eye twitching, intense migraines, and dizziness) I'm experiencing are a result of stress, which is a result of me starting school this week without financial aid, and a starting a new job at the same time. Okay, nbd. But how do I get rid of said symptoms? Is there anything I can do? Or do I just ride it out an ""try to not be so stressed""? "
Don't tell me I can.,"This is single-handedly the most stressful time I've been in my whole life. I wasn't planning on writing this, I just randomly got the idea. I guess my mind is so desperately looking for ways not to actually do what it has to do and think about what it really should be thinking about that it got so excited over signing up to reddit, on a random Sunday night, sitting in my best friend's kitchen, listening to Jadal's leader singer blurting about how he is scared of commitment - on replay for the past 4 hours - and reading the notifications I keep getting from a group chat that my friends made to plan an international video call tonight. I was supposed to part of that video, I said yes when they asked me if I can do it. That was last Wednesday, though. I guess you can know your plans and meetings ahead, but you can never anticipate your rendez-vous with a stress or a depression episode. Even if you anticipate it, I don't think it's possible to correctly estimate the intensity, to estimate exactly how you will be feeling. I feel like crap. That's what I have been saying since I woke up today. I feel like crap, inside out, I look even 7 levels worse. * sighs * There is a metaphor about how you'd feel like an audience at your own play, sitting in the front row passively watching your life pass by? But you are not completely passive, you get to actually get affected, deliver emotional reactions such as anger, pain, etc... Yet, it's like you are invisible, or maybe you are trapped inside Sandy's bubble of glass, you try to shout but no voice is coming out. All you can do is cry. Tears have been my answer to "" How are you? "" today, because damn it that is how I am! It hurts. And I don't want to talk about it but I need to talk about but it hurts to talk about it and it hurts even more not to. I tried everything, to distract myself, to change my mood.. I mean, everything that I can. In a better world, I would probably go for a swim. Nothing helps like the sea. They say swimming actually makes you feel better because once you get into the water you get to feel how impossibly broad and boundless the sea is and how small and insignificant your problems are, a drop in the ocean. I've never swum in the ocean though. I live by the Mediterranean, which is good for me because oceans scare me. Sharks scare me. Drowning scares me. Not finishing my thesis scares me. I think that's not what scaring me though, not the thought of not finishing but being stuck. I am stuck and I can't unstuck myself. In a better world, I would have gone for a run. But I don't run, except from my responsibilities. In a better world, I would have gone to the gym, sweated it out, took a cold shower, had a healthy meal and resored my brain chemicals to be at my most productive state and wrote the whole damn thing. In a better world, I would have met my thesis-fellows and went to a fancy library that offers free WiFi, sat in a quiet corner and started working, sipping on our Frappuccinos. In this world, I tried everything in my reach, I moved across the country for this, I moved away from all the stress-promoting things/ people in my life and surrounded myself by the best support system anyone can ask for. There is even a dog in the house who keeps giving me serotonin and oxytocin. But it's not working now is it? Look at me! I am just here sitting, writing lyrics all over my body, ignoring the dozens messages of people checking on me, worrying about me, supporting me, encouraging me.. and I am just like 'nah'. I mean, you can't tell me something I haven't heard before. You can't tell me something I haven't already told myself. And don't get me wrong, I am very grateful for all my friends, and some of my family but it's not working. I feel like that is not what I need to hear. I don't know. But don't tell someone who's drowning "" you are strong, I know you can swim "". I don't know what you should tell them, I don't know what you should tell me but don't tell me I can. Tell me you understand, tell me you get me, tell me you feel my pain or something. Just don't tell me what you learned in the movies and the t.v. shows that should be said in situations like these because that's bullshit. * sighs * On another note, just look at me! I wouldn't write a word for hours, my hand was freezing, my mind was blocked.. but when I decided to write about something else, I couldn't stop :D That's how insane it is. That's how crazy my mind is driving me. You know what is it that I can do? I can write a 5 page academic essay on why I shouldn't finish this damn thesis but I can't write one more sentence on what the findings of the study revealed. So don't tell me I can. Because right now just thinking about it makes me feel sick to my stomach. And I don't know what to do. So, here I am.. just watching, as the song starts again.. "
I’m freakin out man,"Hey Reddit, I just searched for this sub so that I could vent a little. I’m pretty stressed right now about my finances and I’d just like to type mindlessly for a few minutes. I have a very steady and regular income with no fear of losing my job any time soon. I love what I do, and it pays... better than anything I’ve ever done before it. Due to the nature of things, I have to schedule vacations a year out, and being relatively young and naive, I decided it would be a good idea to schedule time off in July for my birthday and to visit my family in Kansas City area, and then again August to see my family in Alaska. Each trip was a week long. Some of you may already see the error of my ways. 

I was semi-prepared for the vacation in July, but it wasn’t until after the trip that I realized the flight for my wife and I to Alaska was going to be about double what I was expecting. Needless to say, I was financially unprepared for the trip but already committed, tickets in hand. The trip itself was a dream, and I loved every minute of it. Near the end of my trip, I realized just how unprepared I was, when I woke up and had $45 in my bank account. I still needed to drive home after my flight(in order to save about $300, I drove 6 hours to the cheapest airport around me. Cost of gas was about $70 round trip, for a total savings of about $225... it was worth it to me). Due to this and the fact I still had some bills to pay, I headed over to /r/Borrow and took out a loan(which I have since paid back). That covered me until I got paid.... until yesterday when I realized I was yet again behind, causing me to take another loan out(less than before so I guess I am technically ahead?). 

I sent out a check for my mortgage and it bounced, I’m a month behind on bills, and I’m practically living at biolife(plasma donation) right now trying to make ends meet. I transferred $35 into my bank account from my biolife cards so my mortgage check would go through. I’m at my wits end and don’t see a solution in sight. I’m stressed beyond belief. 

Please don’t comment on here telling me I’m a shithead for not managing my finances well... I know that and next month after I get paid, I’m doing absolutely nothing extra. Shit I might live on ramen this month if I have to. I need help dealing with this stress and really could use some help. Anything."

I can’t stop clenching my jaw!!,"Hello,

Bear with me as this is my first post. 

I have suffered from stress for the past few weeks. I have had a lot of different symptoms but the jaw clenching is the worst!

I have tried pain killers, anti-inflammatories, and massaging my jaw but nothing seems to help for more than a couple of minutes. 

I don’t seem to do it in my sleep - only during the day. And I feel relaxed when it happens so can’t seem to understand why I’m doing it.

If anybody has any advice that would be great, thank you 😊"

I feel so overwhelmed with college,"I'm a senior and  I'm starting to go through the college application process and I just feel so overwhelmed. I haven't even finished my college list, started ny essays or supplemental or filed my FAFSA. Not to mention I'm doing EA so I have a sooner deadline. I haven't visited any colleges and me ecs are so bad. God I just want this to be over with. This stress is keeping me up at night and I really need help with this. Any advice is appreciated "
I can't sleep at night anymore,"So I've always had a stressful life even as a kid but lately it seems to be really building up more and more. I already have a lot of mental instabilities and stress just makes it all worse. I've noticed that every time I get more bad news like a bill I can't pay or work cutting my hours ext I find it harder and harder to sleep. It takes me a very long time laying in bed with my eyes closed before I finally get to sleep and when I do, I wake up every hour or so. The most I've seem to get at once is about 3 hours of 'solid' sleep without waking. 

Because of this I've been more exhausted and unmotivated to DO anything productive in my life or at work. It really takes a lot for me to be active and a productive member of society anymore. I drink a lot of coffee and energy drinks just because I have no energy. > yes I've tried detoxing from my caffeine intake and it didn't help my sleeping any<  I've tried taking sleep aids like Melanin and ZzzQuil and even sleepy tea but nothing really works.  "
Does anyone else do this?,"I'm not sure if this is related to stress. But I notice that when I am really focused on something or during stress-related events, I hold onto things really tightly with my hands. For example, if I am on the phone by the end of the phone call I realise I've been holding the phone with excessive force and my fingers are hurting by the end of it without even realising. Another example is when I'm concentrating on a task I'll be grabbing a piece of my clothing (that I'm wearing, so sort of hugging body or putting my hand on my lap) with my left hand for example and forming a fist around it really tightly and won't even realise I'm doing it until I need to use my left hand.

"""Hurry Sickness"" – How have I not known about this term!? This type of sickness has plagued me for the past 3+ years","I've had increasing amounts of stress as expectations placed upon me, life responsibilities, work responsibilities have increased more and more. 

[Hurry Sickness (Google Search)](https://www.google.com/search?q=hurry+sickness)

It became impossible to 'relax'! I'd fill up all my empty time with things to do. Yet I'd complain that I was too stressed to do anything else. 

It's a disease... it's toxic. And I didn't know I had this sickness until this week. 

I am sharing this with you so that you might understand what's going on. 

Doing ""more and more and more"" and being able to multitask 15 things at once... it's NOT a trophy. It's a sign of a sickness.

It's just a shame how oppressive society has become, that its members are encouraged to take on loads of responsibilities to the point of chronic burn-out and redline. "

I Feel So Overwhelmed,"A few weeks ago I started my junior year of high school. I chose AP classes which I am failing 3 of right now. The only way I get work done is if the deadline is the next day. I have a job with a schedule that changes every week. For some reason I got a 6 week old kitten that constantly needs attention. I have to babysit my sister and my autistic brother every day that I'm not working. I honestly want to just drop out, work my job, and live in my car.

High school...,"Didn't go to school today 'cause I'm not sure about continuing it... I'm at senior high school now and I gotta decide how I shape my future with the course I choose... I originally picked STEM(about engineering and science I think?), but for some stupid reason I dropped out and went to a completely different school and picked ICT(about ""programming"" and computers). But, as I ""experience"" it, I'm not so sure now 'cause of the people, the ""unnecessary""(well to me at least...) subjects I have to learn, and the fact that I'm actually failing 'cause of mental issues I have(depression and autism). I just don't know anymore... I feel like a loser for not taking the harsh life of high school, I mean just imagine college.

interesting technique to avoid stress,"Hello guys, Have you ever practiced a meditation? I've been practicing this one [http://dimensionalconsciousnessacademy.com](http://dimensionalconsciousnessacademy.com/) for 3-4 years with a lot of positive results. I think it's quite different from all the meditation that you can find in the web, but still for me it is amazing, this meditation changed my life (i dont have anxiety attacks anymore, i feel more confident with myself and i actually enjoy my life a lot more since i introduced this practice in my life). If you tried a lot of different things to avoid your stress and your anxiety or whatever other problem you might have but it didn't work out, i definitely suggest to try it, it is completely free. 

I hope you have a nice day!"

I do deep breathing in the car and mediate at home, but it doesn't work immediately. 

I try to adopt a 'no hurries, no worries' attitude, but it seems like it's easier said than done. I don't really want to take any supplements, but I've heard ashwaganda helps your body adapt to stress better.

Fucked up ordering at my cafe.,"I work at a cafe at University, and we just opened for business for this school year. It is my first time taking over such a large-sales location, after having been pulled from the smallest-sales location on the other side of campus due to my higher than average ratings in customer service skills.

Naturally, coming from a smaller scale operation, you get comfortable with a smaller menu, smaller workforce, smaller numbers, etc. I busted my ass trying to make sure we were ready and equipped for opening by ordering heavily. And we were ready! Our first day was great...

The problem lies with the fact that while using the par-sheets (numbers that we should maintain for product between calling in orders to our food providers) from the previous ""perfect"" manager's order guides has left me SEVERELY limited on our best selling ingredient, with no hope of lasting until my next conceivable order day. 

This was even after I had ordered heavily prior to opening (doubling his pars, etc.) to compensate for heavy-opening traffic. Now, I DO have avenues and contingency plans set in place to get myself ""by"" until I can rectify this. However, here I am at 3AM-4AM reaching out for help because of the crushing amount of stress I am feeling, robbing me of the precious sleep I need to survive my 12-hour shift tomorrow.

It doesn't help that I have begun to question what my purpose in life even is anymore. All of my younger friends are more successful than I am. They are married, have houses, and have all sorts of closeness and happiness going on for them. I felt like this was the one thing I could do, that I could have, and here I have potentially fucked it all up and will be facing such scrutiny and embarrassment as a result, after the regional manager of the company I am contracted through said he had high hopes for me.

I just want to curl up and die. This is what my life feels like now. I goofed off in school and now this is my reward: Crushing stress, low pay, crap benefits, and a mountain of student loan debt that will eventually, literally kill me off.

I can't break free from this and I do not know what to do about anything. Please help. Or just wish me the best. I feel so cut off and alone."
Stressed due to not being able to cope at work,I have been working for almost 1 year. I just had a 1 to 1 with my manager saying my performance needs improvement due to me kept repeating the same mistakes even after being told. This is because of me not being able to absorb a lot of information at 1 go and being not observant enough. My team leader is dropping hints at me that im not suitable for this team. I wanted to improve but im not doing it fast enough and my personal mental life issues is also making me being unable to give my all in my work.Please help..... i dont want to lose my job.
Uncontrollable Stress Levels,"So I have been working the same sale's job for roughly five years now. I became the general manager last year, but I still sell, only now with roughly 10x the responsibilities added on top of that. 

Roughly every day I get 4-10 texts/E-mails from corporate, can't take a vacation without getting my phone blown up, I have to deal with so many everyday issues, employees leaving and having to hire new workers and then start the entire training process over again. Honestly, it just seems like everyday there is something that goes wrong, but because of my anxiety and stress I have the store in the best place it has been at in years because I have the need to get things done and accomplished or else it will be even worse. 

&#x200B;

The constant stress and anxiety I have is overwhelming. However, a big problem lately that I never had before has been the customers. Unless a regular I enjoy comes in, I dread EVERYONE. Every single new person I talk to when I hear the little bell ring that someone has walked in, I absolutely hate it and don't even want to talk to them. This is probably due to my new added responsibilities that must be done on top of this, but also because I have seen the absolute worst of people over the past 5 years. I have been yelled at, have parent's kids rampage through the store making it look like a mess, very rude people, I have just had it with these people and I can't stand working with most of them. 

&#x200B;

To anyone wondering I work in the fitness industry and run a roughly $800,000 a year store all myself, and I think overall just everything is getting to me. 

&#x200B;

On top of that, the money I make is enough to keep me here. I am only 23 and I am making roughly $60,000 working about 40-50 hours a week. I know I am fortunate for this, I just don't know if I should see a doctor as I see my signs of this getting worse and worse as time progresses. 

&#x200B;

Do I see a Dr.? Do I see out a new job? I am just so unsure what to do because I am so young but my mental health has not been here. I have never really used reddit before, nor have I been here so sorry if this post may go against the norm here or whatever I just really need someone's advice. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR

\>Working in sales 5 years, became general manager a year ago.

\>The new workload is overwhelming on its own, on top of having to deal with customers.

\>Even with the store doing better than ever because of me I cannot stand the stress/anxiety I deal with.

\>I have seen the worst of people possible of my years here. Rude, entitled, arrogant, mean, hurtful.

\>I make roughly 60k working 40-50 hours a week. I am fortunate for this, but it doesn't take away the fact of my mental health failing. The money has kept me here for sure.

\>Do i see a dr.? Do I quit? I would honestly just like some feedback from individuals with similar experiences or whatever you may offer. "

Does anyone clean to feel less stressed?,"I dont belive I can be the only one.

If I feel super stressed Ill clean my house. Sometimes do some crazy ass deep cleaning. I now have a routine everyday I do and if I dont do all the chores I feel stressed. I make my bed, clean the floors, water plants ect. I honestly feel so much better in a clean house then one that is not kept clean. If my beds not made or dishes in the sink, I feel so overwhelmed??? Idk. I love cleaning only because it makes me mentally feel good? Some days I pick a special cleaning job. Like plucking weeds, cleaning out a closet, re organizing the kitchen drawers. Anyone else stress clean? Does it help with your stress levels?"
Help with managing chronic stress,"I currently deal with depression and anxiety, and a lot of it is stress-related, to the point where I don't know if the depression causes stress or if the stress causes depression. I could really use some tips on how to manage my stress (cortisol) levels and keep an uplifted mood."
"waiting on blood test results, literally sick with anxiety :(","I have important blood work results coming back any day now.  the results I recieve will either change my life completely or put me right back where I started, not knowing what's wrong with me. really, there is no good news coming. either my blood tests come back positive, and my outcome is basically terminal, or they will come back negative and I will have to continue suffering without knowing why. I will have to do more tests. more needles and tubes. ugh. I don't want the results to come back positive but I don't want them to be negative cause I am so sick of all the testing I have been going through. my doctor's have been searching for months and months and we just can't figure it out. all the searching could be over any day now, or I could be right back at ground 0. I can't deal with the stress. I hate just knowing that any day now I am going to get a life changing call . it's too much. it's exhausting. I just need the phone call to come so I can get it over with. "

So I'm looking for some way to just chill out so we dont end up breaking up or killing it other at some point lol. Being with someone 24/7 (plus 2 kids on top of that) for 7 years straight can really take a toll on you lol"
Losing my house but I’m going to be okay,"Dear kind souls of Reddit, 

I am furious and under a huge amount of stress right now , but I am going to be okay. I would appreciate some words of wisdom and good vibes going my way. 

I bought a mobile home on its own lot in 2016. I got the home inspected prior to purchasing it and I got house insurance and title insurance. After I moved in, I began to have problems with the water line freezing and breaking every winter.  I have spent around $4,000 in repairs over the past two years and I think I have finally solved the problem. My sewer stopped working properly in March of this year and I have had to dismantle most of the sewer underneath the house to solve the problem.  The plumber and I put a camera down and we found an unknown blockage somewhere close to the street. I ended up having to dig up my driveway, break the sewer and put the camera through....only to find that the sewer is clean. The sewer cleaner said that it was probably frozen and he has been to my house to thaw the sewer when the previous owners owned it. In order to fix the broken pipe, the plumber is going to have to dig down underneath the mobile home to connect to the iron sewer that is under there, and in order to do this, I will have to completely remove my house, fix the sewer, and then put my house back on my property. The total bill for this will be around $10,000 and it is at the point where I am ready to just get a new house. I will be living paycheck to paycheck in a new house, but I don’t really have many options. 

I would not have bought this house if I had known all of the problems that came with it and insurance won’t cover any of this. I have proof that the previous owners knew about the water line freezing, but I have no proof that they knew anything about the sewer freezing. I haven’t been able to sleep properly for several months, I am under so much stress, and I am furious. I have been living in a hotel since March while I am still stuck paying a mortgage on property tax on a house that I can’t live in. 

Why does the world work this way?"
What's the Cost of Stress?," As we move further and faster into the 21st Century each of us in our modern technological society faces an ever-increasing number of challenges, demands and possible traumas. You and I now experience in our day to day lives a nearly overwhelming array of emotional, physical and  
chemical stresses.  


These stresses place heavy demands on our bodies, minds and spirit. The mental and emotional challenges of school, work, and earning a living, the stresses of marriage and family life, a move from one's home or hometown, even national and international news and events, all create stress and take their toll on our bodies and nervous system. Physical stresses such as automobile accidents, injuries in sports or at work, even sitting for long periods of time at a desk as well as poor postural habits and sleep patterns directly effect our spine and nervous system even if we don't feel their effects immediately. Other less recognizable stresses come in the form of  
toxins from pesticides, preservatives, car fumes, drugs, alcohol and smoke.  Even electromagnetic frequencies from cell phones, computers, television and microwaves have harmful effects on the nervous system's capacity to function properly.  


As conscious individuals who wish to experience optimal health and well-being we must now ask ourselves: What is the cost on our bodies of taking on more and more stress without an effective means of clearing these stresses from our nervous system?  


The cost may be much greater than we might first imagine.  


Whenever any [stress](http://www.akwa.be/blog-prive-sauna-akwa/wat-is-stress/) whether emotional, physical or chemical exceeds the body's capacity to adapt and recover what results is an interference, obstruction or misalignment in the spine and nervous system. Since it is the nervous system that controls and coordinates every other system in our bodies--the reproductive, digestive, glandular, circulatory, and immune systems---any excess of stress poses a serious threat to our mental and physical health.  


Science now tells us that these obstructions to our neural and spinal network are perhaps the most serious and widespread threat to an individuals capacity to fulfill his or her genetic potential. Whenever there is adverse tension on the nerves, all the tissues and organs to which these nerves connect are also under abnormal tension. As the tone and integrity of this  
delicate energy-information network gets distorted, the body's innate intelligence cannot properly communicate with the body parts affected. It is like a radio signal that has been scrambled or blocked, or a computer-virus or transmission-glitch in a communications network, only the communications network we are speaking of is your body-mind and the possible effects much  
more dangerous and harmful.  


In fact, to whatever degree our nervous system's ability to exchange energy and information is diminished there is a corresponding diminishment in the necessary flow of life-force throughout the body. When the flow of life-force is interrupted it is often recognized by the appearance of  
conditions such as fatigue, anxiety, irritability and depression or in physical symptoms ranging from sleep difficulties and sexual dysfunction to headaches, muscle tension and chronic pain. When the life-force diminishment becomes persistent or severe it results in pathologies which can effect any tissue, organ or regulatory system in the body and may eventually lead to the onset of serious disease or life-threatening illness.  


Given the far-reaching and harmful effects of stresses on our body, especially upon our spine and nervous system, we can begin to understand the fundamental importance of a clear, uninterrupted nervous system. Healing and wholeness systems such as yoga, tai chi, osteopathic medicine and  
chiropractic have not only recognized the primary role of the spine and nervous system but have developed their approaches around this deep recognition. Having realized how important a clear and well-functioning nervous system is to overall health a number of healing modalities have  
emerged in recent decades which directly address the need of freeing the body of its deep-seated interference patterns. The discoveries that are now surfacing from a variety of scientific sources confirm what ancient healing systems have known for centuries: as the spine and nervous system is cleared of its stresses and obstructions it begins to function at a higher and more integrated level. As this process takes place, all aspects of the body from the cellular level to the organ tissue to the posture of the spine improve dramatically. With the spine and nervous system clear, the mind and body relax. This state of ease allows a person to be more in touch with their true self and thus experience more freedom, self-empowerment and abundance in their life.  


Given the remarkable challenges and stresses that now characterize our modern technological life and knowing the cost these stresses inflict on our bodies, we can now understand why a regular and effective program of clearing our nervous systems of these stresses is not only important but absolutely necessary. This is especially the case if we consider how the free and abundant flow of life-force is not only the foundation of optimal health but also the very means by which we realize our full potential for growth, creativity and joy.

How has chronic stress affected your physical health?,"I've had sort of a rough year, and I've been having random symptoms that come and go but although not too severe. It's just annoying. I'm wondering if someone else has weird issues with their body due to chronic stress?"
I can't cope,I lost my Gran and now I'm living in my own and I've never been so scared in all my life.
I Just Want to Run Away for a little While,
You don't deserve this,"I believe everyone deserves their own way to happiness

but people always point the figure at you, making you look like a freak.

You're not living the typical standard life. So people tend to oppose who you are.

go to the doctor, go see a psychologist. You're sick, you are weak.

Maybe the best remedy you ever needed was self care.

I've been home bound due stomach problems, and I've been JUDGED and JUDGED.

Why are you losing weight? you look pale. I feel like a freak. Some days I just don't want to be alive.

People come into my life promising me so many things. Love, affection, jobs. Then they turn away.

It's my fault, I should have known better. Nobody owes me anything.

But you owe it to yourself to be with people who care about YOU even at your lowest.

Look how people turn away from you when you are constantly sick, and you wish you thought it was a joke.

But it's not, it's my current reality. People will not stay when you are unhealthy, eventually they will dispose of you at some facility. Because they cannot be there for you much longer. Stress will stay as long as you want it to stay. Eventually it becomes a conditional problem that you are use to. "
How to relieve stress in a stressful environment?,"How do you guys de-stress when everything is stressful? Currently I live with family and it seems like when I'm at home, I'm constantly sensory overload. I do have anxiety and depression and I've been taking morning workout classes at my college while I pursue my degree and I seem to be a lot better while on campus ( i even tend to spend more time there to avoid going back home).  Not really look for any particular advice, just curious what you guys do when you're feeling stress, maybe I can try different things to see if anything clicks. Thanks!"
Deadlines,I’m a programmer and I have two projects I’m working on I promised my fans deadline now I’m struggling with the one one of the people helping with it keeps changing things and add more when the limit is full what should I do its stressing me out
Looking for ways to relieve stress that don’t involve sipping tea or meditation. That stuff just makes me more tense. I used to work out quite a bit but due to a bad back I have been told to avoid high impact physical activity. Suggestions are GREATLY appreciated!,
Stress,"In times of stress, I feel like I go in tunnel vision mode and focus on what the stress is (ie. school). It becomes really problematic because I tend to ignore other things and unintentionally affect people in my life and even my well-being. I also tend to overthink and lack rational thinking in these times. 

I feel like one of these days I'm going to create a mess so big that I wouldn't know how to clean it up. 

Any tips?"
How can I improve my stress threshold?,"I get stressed very easily and very quickly. Loud noises are particular stressors, eg. Someone vacuuming or playing drums. 

I had a particularly stressful event occur today and my Apple Watch alerted me that my heart rate was at 198bpm. My resting heart rate is around 55bpm and often drops down to the 40s so this really scared me. 

Is there a way I can increase my ‘tolerance’ and threshold so that I am not getting stressed so easily? I run everyday and the exercise certainly helps my overall mood but I don’t feel it helps how easily I get stressed. "
Some days,There are sometimes things get too much I wish I wasn't born.
Positive vibes,Can anyone send positive vibes to people who are stressed out?
What should I do about chronic stress,"Hi, I'm 20 years old and kind of accepting that I've got chronic stress issues. I'm not sure how to deal with it exactly, and it's been 3 months. I remember seeing a doctor a while ago and talked about what caused my stress/breakdown last semester and he said it was acute stress. I didn't really know what that meant at the time, but overall I felt like it was an unhelpful experience because all of his advice (exercise, things like that) and wisdom didn't really help me or I knew would not work because I had already tried. I even tried antidepressants because I thought it could have been something I needed, but that did not help. I'd say for the past 2 years of my life I've done a great job at handling acute stress. That was the only type of stress I knew. Chronic stress, however, is something that I don't understand. It's new to me, and requires a greater amount of life changes and mental perspective. It feels inhuman almost to have chronic stress.

It is admittedly frustrating because I feel too young for it; I'm at an age where I should continue to develop myself with my hobbies and stuff. But instead every day is typically a rollercoaster. My ability to concentrate/focus has been incredibly diminished, and I find the idea of getting back in to school stressful. I am an engineering major, but if math stresses me out I'm just not sure if I can keep it in my life. On the flip side, I want to be doing those things because I liked the challenge. The stress is like a token that just keeps flipping and makes things confusing. I doubly worry because I start to think I have mental health issues, and the fact is that stress CAN open up mental health issues. I find that when the stress gets to a breaking point, which has only happened once in my life, I shut down and withdraw and make what changes feel necessary instead of opening up in to some sort of mania or whatever but fuck man how am I supposed to know what to expect if it keeps going. There are things which cause me stress that I don't think are supposed to cause me that much stress, but they simply do because it's chronic I guess. I don't know if I""m supposed to push on and work on my problems in ""the storm"" or withdraw and bide my time.

I also seem to suffer from anhedonia, an inability to feel pleasure. If I isolate myself from anything stressful (school, work, etc.) it is possible to feel some pleasure, albeit a small amount. I've been trying to tackle the problem by getting back in to the things that used to give me pleasure (weightlifting was a big one) and then taking on the more stressful things (school and work), but the stressful things seem to outdo any pleasure effects. What really kills me is that my sleep suffers; if I could get 8 hours a night, I would be able to push through without worrying, but for the past 3 nights I've gotten probably 5-6 hours of sleep. I haven't even started school yet, and I don't really work THAT much. So now I'm sitting here typing this post and worrying about stress again. I truthfully don't know what to do, or what in particular causes my chronic stress. I want to live life like normally so I can combat depression and things like that, but then the stress keeps me up. I am seeing a counselor, and hopefully a therapist soon, but I am in the early stages of that.

Is this something that can be medicated? Can you ""medicate"" stress away? Or does it boil down to lifestyle changes? I've done a pretty damn good job of having a healthy lifestyle for the past couple years, which is another frustrating thing. I don't drink, smoke, but admittedly I think about sex too much and I'd say that is my vice at the moment. It was also a source of stress for me that contributed to this chronic stress in some way. That said, I don't pursue sex in an unhealthy way but I might be a little more flirty or resort to jackin it to try and fill some sort of void that I'm missing. I eat pretty healthily, not a fan of soda or junk food, I see food more as calories and less for pleasure. Other than that, I loved weightlifting and for a good while was able to do both cardio and heavy lifting. Now, however, I feel like that contributes to my stress a little bit because I know I don't sleep enough to be able to lift weights and recover without it causing too much stress. I want to bulk up a bit, and get back to more intense/heavier lifting, but I'm not sure if that's even healthy for me in my given state. At the same time, I get stressed out after a week or two if I'm NOT doing that. Lol again with the flipping a token thing.

I don't really like being around my friends or people as much when I'm like this, not because I am in a ""bad mood"" but because I know I can't simply vibe with them. I'll be too worried about feeling stressed out to actually enjoy it. This is why I think I really like counseling because it's just a place for you to go to talk about your problems with someone.

My only solace has been learning how to play my guitar, but that's not what I intend to do with the rest of my life, and it doesn't always take the stress away. Sometimes I just get tired of playing it.

What are my options? I'm 20 years old, live at home with my dad, so I don't have much responsibility thankfully. I've done quite a bit with my life that I'm happy about, so I feel like I was doing what I wanted, so it's tough thinking about how to change. All the things I've been doing have helped me grow as a person and alleviate that sort of depression you get when you're just not doing anything with yourself. But again now when I start doing those things I experience a lot of stress and have to come to a stop, thus depression can come back... I kind of yearn for when things didn't feel this stressful; the first two years of college feel like they could have been ages ago, and man I thought THAT was a challenge because during that time I was just finding myself. Looking back on it though it was just easy to live in the present and deal with stress as it came, not battling it every waking hour. I understand things about mindfulness, meditation, making the right choices, etc., but man that doesn't explain why I can't get enough sleep."
"Potentially going to the dentist soon, absolutely petrified.","Hi everyone,

I have an extreme fear of the dentist. Every time I sit in that dentist chair, my heart's beating at a million miles an hour, praying that he doesn't tell me I have a cavity. This has led to me not going in 3 1/2 years. The last time I went I was 15, 2 years after the time before that. Luckily I didn't have a cavity then. I know symptoms of a cavity are often pain and/or sensitivity but I don't have that and my teeth aren't significantly discoloured either. That being said, I do have some tartar buildup and mild gingivitis so I should probably go. I've never had a cavity in my life and I really don't want one now. The concept of drilling through my teeth is just too much to bear."
Help Me,"Hey everyone. So I’m 18 years old and I’m an EMT in Denver, Colorado. I have usually been good at managing my stress (my mom passed away when I was 16), but lately a lot of things have been getting to me. I start college on August 20th, and the fact that my mom isn’t here to see me go to college and see me working as an EMT is really tearing me up. On top of that, the girl I’m with is going to college in Hawaii and I’m absolutely terrified that our potential long distance relationship will collapse. I try to work through it but recently all of this has been weighing heavily on me and I can’t take trying to work through it myself. Would anyone be able to tell me anything about managing stress with long distance relationships, and not having a mom to see you moving forward in life?"
Changing jobs.,"I'm very complicated. 
Have started to plan to change company.

I've been in this company for a year and a half, firstly I used to make (reasonably still do) big bucks and have had a chance to spoil myself many many times. But now my pace of life has drastically changed (married and expecting a baby).

My current position is customer relationship agent (salesman) and for the past 7 months it has brought me nothing but stress, however the company where I am right now is trustworthy and has proved many times that it can be dominating the industry.

The other day, friends from my previous job had an offer at their startup company which has potential to go crazy, but I cant get out of my comfort zone to leave this job, just because the company is not yet fully functional.

Critical me is telling me to wait (for something I dont know) and the other gullible me is just putting me in a lots and lots of stress.

Please give me something, i dont want to discuss it with friends, because well friends are friends outside business."
Any advice please help,"So recently I've been super stressed over lots of personal matters that have been happening in my life. But I have no idea how to deal with it. I keep taking it out on people close to me especially my boyfriend. I can't help it and I really try to control it. 
I have discussed what's stressing me out with my boyfriend too. Then I'll just get so moody and be very sharp with him etc.

I really want to try relax and learn how to control my stress because I know that if I keep carrying on like this it will only push him away."
Living Your Life In Truth!,"Everyone is going through or has been through SOMETHING! Been hurt or has harmed someone physically, mentally or emotionally. The problem with life or life obstacles is when we become stuck and our mind body or soul isn’t at peace because we can’t move on past the pain. We develop walls that people have to tear down just to get close to us, or we hide from our pain.

The process to knowing your truth is to first acknowledge your hindrances. What is preventing you from being the best you? For example, if you are overweight here are some question you should ask yourself:

· Why? Is it habit? 

· Were you obese as a child? 

· Did your parent/parents not provide healthy meals or enough daily exercise or activities?

· Why didn’t you change the habits when you became of age?

· Do you cook?

· Are you too busy?

· Have you made a daily planner of your day to be able to notice where you have an opportunity to be able to prep meals and cook more?

· Have you taken a nutrition class?

· Do you have a gym membership?

· Do you have any physical mental or emotional ties to eating?

Once you internally diagnose your pain have a professional help you to answer the questions that you can’t answer or come up with an action plan. The type of professional you can speak to are: life coaches, consultants, or even therapist. Also, build a support system; no matter how difficult speak to some you trust about your daily or life stresses.

The importance of discovering your life’s truth, is to make sure you don’t become stuck. You don’t want to exist or get caught a perpetual system of contentment. Facing your truths allows you to progress at work, in your social life or just on a mental, physical or spiritual level. You will find yourself facing less depression, anxiety or even stress. "
Brain damage related to stress?,"So without going into much detail, about 2 years ago I wound up in a high stress situation I really couldn't get away from. It followed me everywhere. I'm still in it.

At first the stress didn't affect me too much. It was just there in the background. Then one night I thought, ""I can't keep living like this. It's going to start screwing with me."" Sure enough, about 8 months ago I started having memory issues. I also felt like my problem solving/thinking abilities were starting to decline. I really started losing my edge. Now I'm at a point were I wonder if I'll ever be able to get back to normal. I feel completely out of control of my mind. Emotions run wild. Thoughts are scattered and I can't control them. I struggle with any form of discipline. My life is falling apart.

I read that chronic stress can cause brain damage, but I haven't found much on whether or not that's permanent. Does anyone know? And has anyone gotten to this point and been able to return to normal function?

Thanks in advance."

Introduction To a Stress Headache:
what is a stress headache 

The reason for writing a detailed post on stress headache is my encounter with this monster. Like everyone else I also have my own shares of ups and downs in my life. I have an encounter with a headache a lot many times. Sometimes I was able to understand the reason behind a headache and sometimes I was NOT.

The country from where I belong, headache is not taken very seriously. Most people treat it as a very ordinary thing and they take some medicine for temporary relief. Most people aren't aware of the problems that a headache can lead to.

A headache can be associated with symptoms such as 

Vertigo
Nausea
Vomiting
Vertigo
Stroke
Tenderness of the Scalp.
And many more...

Can you die from a regular headache?

Any Guess?

The answer is Yes.

Before I answer this question, let's discuss a technical term 'Thunderclap'. It is also called lone acute severe headache that is sudden and reaches a very high intensity in an idiosyncratic span of time.

Many doctors believe that the blood leaking from a brain aneurysm causes Thunderclap kind of a headache and there are chances that it can lead to the death.

Again an important question I would like to put in front of my readers.

Can you get a brain damage because of a headache?

Again my answer is Yes...

A migraine is a form of a severe headache and frequent migraine can lead to brain damage.
You will be surprised to know that 20 MILLIONS of AMERICANS suffer from a migraine.

As published in AmericaMedicalal Association Journal, frequent Migraines are associated with an increased likelihood of brain lesions.

The real reason behind a migraine is still a mystery. Some connect it to the genetic while other beliefs a person having Migraine problem has a sensitive nervous system.


Migraine Headaches

So let's define a stress headache, It's a common type of a headache that can lead to mild, moderate or intense pain in your head, neck or back of your eyes.

 Sometimes stress a headache gives a feeling of a tight band around the forehead. Many people call this kind of a headache as an episodic headache because of the repetitive nature of the occurrence, mostly once or twice a month.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, chronic headache affects around three percent of the US population and women are at the higher end of getting affected as compared to men.
Cause Of a Stress Headache:
A stress headache is mostly caused by muscle contraction in the neck and the head region. There are many aggregators for a stress headache. Sometimes a cold temperature can initiate the headache symptoms. A long drive or sitting in front of a computer for a longer period of time is, in fact, the two most common reasons behind a stress headache.

Other triggers involve:
Alcohol
Eye Strain
Dry Eyes
Fatigue
Smoking
Caffeine
Poor Posture
Emotional Disturbances.
Sinus Infection.
Cold or Flu.

cause of  stress headache


Symptoms Of A Stress Headache:
Tenderness Around The Forehead And Scalp.
Pressure Around The Forehead.
A lot of people get confused between a stress headache and migraine. Both are very different kind of headaches.
To make a differentiation between the two, the best way is to cross-check the symptoms."
standardized tests and surgery recovery- what should I do?,"I just need to vent and receive some advice/ encouragement. 

I just went through major jaw surgery (I replaced the TMJ joint disk with a fat graft) and my mouth is now wired shut for the next 9 months. To fill the time I would have spent talking, eating, and generally having a good time, I have instead been studying for all the standardized tests I need to go to a good college. I studied at least 4 hours a day and put a strain on my recovery (this is because my upper body muscles were strained which affects my jaw and subsequently my new disk). Luckily, my hard work payed off. I got a 1500 on the SAT and 35 on the ACT! Yay!

I thought I was done, boy was I wrong. Apparently to apply into the bioengineering field for my preferred schools, I also have to take two SAT subject tests (math 2 and preferably biology M). 

This is a huge shock to me, I worked my ass off with the expectation that once I had finished the ACT and SAT I would be done with the soul draining activity of standardized testing. Studying physically hurts me as I should not be at a desk or hunched over (the default pose for studying), but I don’t want to give up now. I am so damn close, but I just can’t see myself going past that last hurdle. Not to mention all my summer homework, which I’ve been neglecting to study for these tests, still needs to be done. This is just a shit show that I never saw coming. 

What do you think: should I 
A) forget about the SAT subject tests, apply to colleges that don’t require them, and let myself rest?
B) push through this, take the tests, and give myself better access to the best education?

I genuinely don’t know what to do. "
I'm failing my classes. Advice with struggling with depression?,"I know this may seem so small, but it's really stressing me out, since I already deal with major depression, and it's just making my grades worse every semester.

I'm a 21F that's a senior in university. I have about a year left before I can graduate, but that seems like it's becoming unrealistic. I took summer classes so I can graduate early, but I'm failing those classes and they end in two days. My depression has gotten in the way of my education (I spent a couple of days last month in the crisis stabilization unit after stress cutting myself) and I have been drowning ever since. I unintentionally got off my meds after that and ended up publicly drinking and using drugs at 7am and blacking out by noon. Got arrested for a PI. So both of these events have led to me disinterested in my studies and now I will probably receive two F's in two days, when I already have a 2.8 GPA. Which makes me highly stressed as I still have work to attend to 'til then.

Has anyone gone through similar events and have they turned out better or worse for you? I guess I just need reassurance that I'm not the only one, but I feel like I will struggle more with my depression if I never come up from this."
Vent of expensive life,I am a 17 year old girl who is scared that I won't be able to do my masters let alone be able to pay for my university (undergrad rn) and at the same time pay for rent when my parent's leave when I become an international student. I am so stressed that I wish I could change time and have thought a lot of things better and clearer. Everything is pretty indecisive about where I am heading off to and I hate the fact that my life has become so money dependent. I am currently doing a part time job that I absolutely hate but pays better than many places so cant complain. I cry pretty much all day due to the bitter realization that life isn't what I thought it would be and how fucked up a lot of things are. I have considered student loans and probably will get some but won't be enough at all.  I wish I wasn't born so I wouldn't have to go through something like this and wouldn't be such a burden for my parents 
I did a video on stress,"Hey folks! My teacher said something very wise about stress and I had to make a video about it. I just want to add to it that the theory of stress is only applicable if the stress isn‘t about survival, like for many of you folks. I just hope it helps a bit!

Being alive is so expensive?,"I am drowning in bills and rent like everyone else. I always make it, but I'm so constantly on edge worrying that I won't. I feel like it's taking a toll on my life. When I'm not working, I float between the two extremes of deep cleaning my entire house or staying in bed all day and hiding from the world. I wish I could find a happy medium. I'm having a hard time devoting time to friendships because I'm so wrapped up in my own head and stress routines. It's hard to reach out because I don't want to be a downer. The space behind my oven sure is clean though, so I guess that's a plus.

I know I'm not the only one, so how do you cope with the stress of being alive?"

Work stress,"I have worked part time retail for 20 years. The past year has been more stressful than usual.  My area of work is actually 2 departments. There was 18  of us 6 weeks ago and now there is 12 due to some transferring departments and others quit.
  2 coworkers only have to work 1 deoartment the rest of us work both  , 1  or 2  days a week I work both departments by myself for 4 or 5 hours of my shift. I have had only 3 weekends off this year while 1 coworker has every weekend off.

Does stress work like this?," Hi everyone, 

I've had a really difficult six months. Most of that difficulty has now come to an end. During the time that the difficulties were ongoing, I didn't experience any physiological responses to stress. However, now that the stress is mostly over, I've found that I've

1) Increased the number of seizures I have. (I'm epileptic)

2) Developed constipation

3) Developed headaches

Am I correct in assuming that, sometimes, the physiological effects of stress manifest themselves once the stressful circumstances have lifted? 

Any thoughts? 

Thanks. :)"
Seven ways to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder,
Severe subconscious stress?,"So I've had stress symptoms for a few years now but it's always been subconscious. To the point where I've always gone to doctors and they've checked physical stuff, and thr conclusion has always been stress. For example, numbness in different places of body, burning/hunger sensation in stomach, intense stomach pains and cramps, pains in head, grinding teeth, very tense head muscles and jaw muscles (couldn't eat).

Anyway, it's really tearing down on me now, feels like it has really grinded my soul away. Starting to get depressive symptoms as well.

What's the best way to tackle subconscious stress? I don't really feel stressed as SUCH, so not sure what to do. I know I used to be stressed because I forced myself to stay with my ex in a town I didn't want to be in (she said she would kill herself if we broke up, long story, whatever). 

But It's been more than a year since we broke up now, and 3 years since the whole ""I'll kill myself"" thing. In the year since we broke up and I went back to my hometown, my stress symptoms have gotten worse, at least the past half year.

Have any of you dealt with subconscious stress before? Is this possibly residual stress? "
Does stress work like this?,"Hi everyone,

I have had a stressful few months. I felt psychologically awful, but did not have a physical reaction to stress. 

Most of that stress has now gone, however I’m having some minor health ‘issues’ now. For example, within the last two weeks I’ve had 

- constipation 
- headaches
- fatigue
- loss of appetite 

Is this the way that stress can work for some people? That the physiological effects of stress can ‘kick in’, once the stressful incident has passed, rather than during the stressful time? 

Thanks. :)

Cant sleep,Please help me. I am so stressful. I cant close my eyes. I think I will say good bye my life :(((
"Stressed, overwhelmed, unmotivated, depressed, you name it","I am struggling through my current semester of school. This is semester 4, and up to this point I had a 3.76. That is sure to drop. One class has been brutally difficult and the teacher doesn't seem to care. So I guess I've stopped caring. But then I get stressed over it more when it's time to do the tests. And my not caring has caused a lack of motivation in my other classes too. I am feeling ill over the stress. I feel like I have so many things to do between school and life that I end up thinking how best to accomplish everything and then end up doing nothing. I'm getting lethargic. I'm single and live alone, so it's hard to force motivation for myself (yes, I'm one who needs to be pushed). The more overwhelmed I become, the more unmotivated, then more stressed. I cannot fix the overwhelming level of school work or inability to get the grades I know I can get in other classes, so how the heck am I supposed to fix the steps that come after?

I'm at a point now where all I do is cry over how bad things have gotten. I'm nearing a breaking point, and I'm not sure what will happen then."

My girlfriend wants to wait..?,"We are both 18 and we have been dating for a year now.  We don't really see each other that much alot , because we live 40 mins away and we didn't not have cars. And our parents dislike each other. But we still make it work and when we do see each other were happy. ( I never go to her house because my mom doesn't allow me). But the main thing is, she's been saying for a while she wants to wait years to have sex, which is perfectly fine. But then just today she says she and her mom talked and she wants to now wait to do anything sexual until she's done with school... I know I can't force her to do things.

I’m in the final semester of my masters program and all I want to do it quit. I really need advice.,"I’m struggling to finish my masters program in biology. I feel like I’m having a crisis. I have my thesis defence next month and my report due 2 weeks later. 

The thing is.. i hate what I do. I have no motivation anymore to complete it. I think I’m going through a burnout and it’s excruciating at the moment because of the workload. I have thoughts of making a complete career change and sometimes all I want to do is walk into traffic so I don’t have to deal with the stress anymore. 

I also became attached to the idea of becoming a scientist and am experiencing a bit of an identity crisis because it hasn’t lived up to my expectations. 

Basically I want to know what I can do and if anybody else has gone through this kind of experience? I want to finish the program and go back home, but I’m scared that I simply can’t do it. Are there any coping strategies? How do you work when you’re feeling burned out? Did you come out better on the other side of this stress? "
Seeking advice,"I am round the clock stressed out and I switch from one emotion to the next for what seems like no reason. I’ve had A LOT of HUGE stressful events happen consecutively within three years. My first son dying, my mom(who was my best friend) died suddenly of cancer, to name a few.

"College, relationships, senior year, STRESS, please help me find a solution and make a plan.","Hi. I'm 17 years old and about to enter my senior year of high school and I couldn't be more lost. I know I want to pursue nursing it's something I've always wanted to do, but I have no idea where I want to go. I have 2 local schools in mind. School A is in the ghetto, but with scholarships and aid I could go for very cheap. But I wouldn't want to live there because it's in a bad section of the city and it's small, I don't know if I'd miss out on the college experience. I toured school B and it feels like I'm redoing high school, it's cliquey and small, but it is very reputable and tightly knit with the hospital in my area. I'm pretty much guaranteed a job with this school, but I don't want to live there either because it's SOOO SMALL. School C I have toured many times and it's a good size, I could live there, it's only 30 minutes away, it's perfect. On the downside, admission requirements for nursing are a 1220 on the SAT and I got an 1130, but the required GPA is a 3.3 and I have a 3.5 so maybe they would consider me? I also have a feeling it's too familiar already, and a lot of people from my school go there that I hate. School D has many study abroad opportunities , a beautiful campus, but it's an hour and a half away, and I am currently in a 3 year relationship and I don't know if I can leave my boyfriend behind. School E is a state school that's only an hour away, so classes might be too big. Then on top of the schools I'm considering, I could go out of state to Florida, or even New Hampshire or Montana. Or I could stick around and work and move in with my boyfriend after 2 years of college (he's 19 so 2 years ahead) and still go to school and commute and figure things out. I just am picturing my life going in so many directions right now and I'm overwhelmed and considering just not even going to college anymore. I don't want to have to make a decision like this. I know I probably sound like a sissy but it's been stressing me out so bad I've never found myself in situation where I am completely lost. 
I know you'll probably all say that high school relationships are nothing and all that, but we've been dating since my freshman year, for 3 years in the fall. Yes, we have our occasional ups and downs but we've never broken up, we can always figure things out and being around him just makes me so happy. He came into my life when my parents just finalized their divorce after many years of substance abuse, vicious fighting, and taking their problems out on me. Before him, I didn't believe that families could be so functional and right. He changed my perception of the world so now I focus on all the good in the world, and how the bad things are really so insignificant and difficult. I see him every single day, we work around our busy work schedules just to see each other on lunch breaks. I know he's going to be successful, I love his family, I love him, he's handsome, charming, outgoing, and I just want to stay with him. I've told him all of this and he just wants me to do what will make me happy, but I have no idea what that is. 
Part of me craves a life of adventure. I want to see and explore all of my options before I settle down and work and have a family and a routine rest of my life. I know I love my boyfriend, he's everything I could ever want and need. He's my best friend, lover, role model, and even a parent when he needs to be. I wouldn't trade him for the world, but a part of me is just dying to know what I could be missing. What if I find someone else in college? Even the thought of possibly meeting someone else makes me feel sick to my stomach. But the other part of me wants to stick around, and keep working at my part time job, and move in together early. Then we could both be commuters, save a lot of money, and see each other all the time. Distance scares me, but also excites me, and I think that's what really scares me. Then I thought what if when my boyfriend graduates he could come move the hour and a half to where I go to school and find a job? Is that outrageous? 
So am I overreacting? Is an hour and a half really a HUGE distance? Can long distance relationships work out? Where do you think I should go to school? Should I just not go? Are you really at college that much anyways? I know there are a ton of breaks, and I guess I could come home on the weekends, but how am I supposed to go without seeing my best friend every day? Should I stick around and save up my money? I mean college A and C are pretty good choices right? A is almost free and I could make the best of it, and C I could always figure things out my freshman year and then commute, and we could still see each other. Do you think we see each other too much? Should I limit my time with him?
I just want to say THANK YOU to whoever took the time to read through this crazy, late night scatter of thoughts and problems. I greatly appreciate your time more than you even know, and am eager to hear your vigorous opinions and criticisms. Thanks again.

"Alright, I need help with this stupid thing.","So my summer holidays next month are coming to an end, and I have decided to learn a bit of more programming to get ahead of my class. Ad the weather was quite nice I decided to take a few days off and enjoy the nice weather, which is rare where I live.

Now when I try to ger started with coding and programming, I just get anxious like hell. I kind of start to panick a bit, and I don’t know why. I watch toturials and I get more worried when I watch them, because when I try to follow them I get seriously anxious and impatient, to the point where I just slam my laptop and lay down on my bed. 

Anything to do with this? I don’t want to bother my parents anymore about such stuff, it’s just stupid :("
Dealing with stress,"I'm a student on summer holiday and in order to get a nice looking CV, I signed up for voluntary work during Easter in a hospital. Also signed up for aviation camp because why not. Everything was fine and dandy until i decided all these were unpaid work experience and I needed some pay and interviewed for a part time job in a local fair ( Basically all-year indoors winterwonderland . Now the rules of the company is that I need to at least work one weekend per week, and the hospital has trainings nearly every 2 days. And aviation camp is 5 days per week for 2 weeks. Seems all planned out and neat? Well here's the kick up. I've been working 10 hour shifts everyday for 3 days now despite being a part time employee and instead of being an ""attendant"" I am basically repair man / cashier / cleaner and warehouse management. All for about 5 quid an hour. Its really doing a toll on my legs and head, and this is me working at ONE place. Now the hospital needs me to go work morning shifts too, I basically have to shift my actual job to late shifts or other weeks, which cause 2 problems. 1. I wake up at 7 for either places of work and return home at at least 1am. 2. I have to shift my hospital shifts to later weeks as paid work has timetables I take priority in, and it clashes with my aviation camp. Long story short, I put too much on the plate to eat.
I have not gamed, slept, relaxed or played music for 5 days (Yes its a big deal to me sorry I'm a failure ) and I am so stressed I can't sleep well or think straight, when I most need to be in order to not let these time clashes occur again. People at work work me like a donkey and its quite tough opening and closing a fking carnival when your supervisors just stand there and chat. 
Any ways to de-stress or advice ?  More details can be provided if anyone is actually willing to help."
Worried about losing new job,"I feel like I might be having second thoughts about my new job. I enjoy the work and I’m trying my best, but I’m starting to think maybe it’s not a good fit for me. I’m working at a local State Farm office, doing mostly entry level stuff. I have made some mistakes, and since this is a field I’m completely unfamiliar with (I know next to nothing about the insurance industry, and this is also my first office job ever), I feel that a few small mistakes are inevitable. However, I feel like these mistakes are being held against me. I’ve been working here for about a month, and I’ve already almost been fired twice. I want to keep this job, but I also feel like maybe I should look for something that doesn’t expect me to hit the ground running in a type of job I’ve never had before. Does anyone have any advice?"
To everyone in college far from home,"I'm about to go to u of arizona, more then 1k miles from home. While I know I'll be ok when I'm there, the thought that terrifies me now is actually leaving my family and the life I've built in my town in the last 18 years. My friends are all going around the country, and I know just about every incoming college student probably feels the same, but the stress and nerves are eating away at me. How did you guys best cope with this? I'm so exited to go off, but how do you leave your whole life behind without feeling like this? #sadboyhours"
Physical reactions to stress,"So I'm dealing with a lot of stress right now from a new job, and I've noticed my body behaving differently after I started working. I've been coughing a lot lately, I feel like I can't breath, some discomfort in my stomach from time to time. I don't know if this is normal? I was perfectly fine before the job, but should I go see a doctor?"
My previous mental and stress problems,"I used to suffer panic attacks and anxiety problems after I dropped out of college and my father suffered a cardiac arrest. It was a very, very tough time to deal with, but somehow I dealt with it. 

Thank God my Dad is feeling better now, and later I decided to do find a solution to manage my stress level and that was when I came across [this free audio guide](http://krymp.nu/w5) which aids stress easing anxiety."
Stress abt fading hair color??,"The title may be misleading.

I get stressed and anxious and overly OCD about everything, but right now it’s about my hair. I have dark dark brown hair, nearly black and I recently got streaks of purple. I had to bleach my hair of course first. Now the hair color is fading and is turning into an ugly blonde-pink color and I’m just stressing so bad about it for no reason. Help?? Somehow? ://"
Ways to reduce stress from noise?,"I've always been, what I can only describe as, sensitive to noise. The overflow of sound from people's crappy headphones, people watching videos on their phone with the speaker on, whistling, any repetitive speaker sound, tapping of feet, eating with mouth open etc. 

I've had a lot of additional pressure at work lately and it seems to be manifesting itself through an increase sensitive to sound.

My wife watches a lot of videos on her phone, but doesn't like to use headphones, so what are my options? I want to sit with her even if we're not doing the same thing, but it's driving me crazy inside. It's not just home though, I need to deal with it better internally. I find myself clenching my teeth as even the slightest noise starts to grate on me.

Do noise cancelling headphones work? Are there self-help books for this sort of problem?

Just to end on a lighter note, the irony of this is that I love music by the likes of Aphex Twin, Venetian Snares, Animal Collective - which many would describe as noise. And I used to be a kids teacher and that sort of noise doesn't bother me at all.

Well it was therapeutic to write this out, but if anyone has any advice it'd be much appreciated. "
Stress is making my irrational thoughts skyrocket and I don't know how to manage,"The way stress affects me is pretty weird. It makes me hyper-aware of any small changes in the way people close to me talk to me, then I start having irrational thoughts about *why* those changes would happen (we're talking about super small stuff here), concluding the worst. 

Usually, with everyday moderate-level stress I can manage to keep the irrationality of such thoughts at bay by means of CBT method. However, during the last 1.5 months I've been under constant, high-level stress (it didn't even really get better on weekends, and yes, I've been trying all relaxing techniquest, meditation, phyisical exercise, kept my sleeping rhythm in shape, doing whatever else I could beside the work I *had* to do that could help keeping my brains occupied in a helpful way. Didn't really help.) and even tho I'd managed to keep irrationality at bay on a day-to-day basis, it somehow still managed to add up inside me.

On weekend, I stopped for a bit because I was really tired. That was the moment when the gremlin inside my brain decided it's time to connect all the small things I've been noticing in the way a person close to me was behaving towards me in the previous 2 weeks, into one Big Horrible Thing that I *need* to panic about right *now*. One thing led to another, I panicked, said some stupid irrationality-based things to the person in question, we fought. The day after I realized what I did and apologized and explained.

Even tho me and person in question in this event made up, I would like to ask if any of you has had similar experiences. If you have, how did/do you manage? I would like to get more control of my thoughts, especially in those moments when they all seem to start connecting into this Horrible THing I need to Panic About, but I don't know how. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. 

P.s.: I currently have no financial means to afford actual therapy. If I did, I would definitely go, but alas that's not a viable option just now. So I'm looking for any ways that don't require therapist, anything I can do myself. "
Advice on juggling multiple things,"At the moment I have a number of unavoidable things in my life that are causing me stress - a difficult job that I currently cannot leave, along with studying for a career-based application i  a number of weeks and focussing on my diet and fitness.

Stress or Medicine related?,"## Anxiety and/or Depression?

Hey all,

I am in my 30s and have dealt with stress/anxiety since I was a child due to family trauma that kept in states of fight/flight periodically throughout a year for at least 7-8 years. As puberty came I was an overthinker, very sensitive, a bit obsessive on certain things - particularly romance.

I had my 1st panic attack in my mid-20s and did 7 years of on-and-off again therapy (CBT/DBT), which has helped give me perspective but has not been a solution to my personality type/anxiety/stress.

Recently, I have been under an inordinate amount of acute stress and while the external stressors have dissipated my body hasn't seemed to adjust back to baseline. As I entered into the period of acute stress I was prescribed Prednisone and then stopped it abruptly after having several panic attacks, combined it has been about 6-8 weeks of random physical and emotional turbulence.

Symptoms:

1. foggy head
2. random spells of light-headed/dizzyness (particularly after working out)
3. Days of intense workouts make my symptoms worse
4. Intermittent blurry vision for distance - only started around acute stress and prednisone
5. feeling weak/out of body experience almost daily (comes in waves sometimes)
6. almost daily headaches
7. eyes feel dry
8. mouth feels dry despite drinking a ton of water and getting enough sodium in
9. Random days of panic (particularly in the evening and after hard strenuous workouts) after a few minutes of the physical symptoms then it is followed by thoughts of impending doom (life is pointless, i'll never be in the lifestyle/position I want, i'm unhappy, nothing is worth it, etc.)

These symptoms come and go, some together, some separate, some days/weeks better or worse than others. My blood work shows that I am very healthy except my White Blood Count is low even for me (normally 4.7 and currently 3.7) and Red Blood Cell count is a bit low as well.

Has anyone experienced these symptoms in isolation or together?"

Job leads to occasional near-debilitating stress,"Hi all. So this is my first time posting here. I am a Project Manager in the petrochemical industry and needless to say there is a lot of accountability. In addition, I have in the last 2.5 years probably had 4 weeks without overtime, 1 of these when I took a week's break to go to the coast and the other when I got sick on my return. Working so much overtime combined with a fast paced, high demand work setup often leads to times of near-events, such as near-anxiety attacks or near-debilitating stress events.

Today I had the latter and I'm concerned that I may reach my breaking point soon and ""snap"". This will obviously not be good for me if I do, so I was wondering if there are people out there that have similar experiences, and what you do to cope?

Lastly, I think it adds to an existing begrudgement that my work relocated my family and I to a small ""oil refinery"" town just as our firstborn was about to arrive. This also took us away from our support structure right when we needed them most. Now we are planning our second but my stress is also detrimentally impacting my personal and family life in this and other areas. Although the remuneration may be lucrative, I feel that regardless of this I am not in a good place at this point, and need to instil a series of coping mechanisms to get through the multiple layers of stress. I am also the sole breadwinner as my wife is a stay at home Mom with the family planning phase of our lives. This probably adds some sub- or unconsciouss stresses.

Thanks for hearing me out. Your thoughts and comments are highly appreciated."

It's call ""the Booth"".... it's a personal space where allows the users to vent out their anger and frustration anonymously.... there are no log-in or registration required, so the users will not experience the repercussions.

With this app, I hope that I'm able to help the community that struggle with mental health..... This app is still work in progress, and would really appreciate some feedback.

Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you,"
Stressed about a mistake I made at my job that no one noticed yet.,"I've been at this job for a year now, I'm still not used to all the corporate processes so most of the time I ask for guidance from my boss. Last February, my boss assigned me the task of processing the payments for a publication my team was in charge for since the person in charge of it just resigned.

Last month, we received the billing from agencies we hired for that publication. My boss told me to fill-up a form that should be submitted to Accounting, I attached the billing invoice that was fully signed by the execs and had the form signed by my boss...and just only my boss.

I submitted it to accounting and they processed the payment in behalf of me. The following week, I got another invoice and I did the same thing. My boss then told me that she shouldn't sign it, the COO should sign it, ""All payments should be signed by the COO"" . I was like (O\_O).

Now, I haven't told anybody about it since the payment was already done and processed by Accounting but I'm really stressed that this might come snowballing at me (and my team) after a few months. My only assurance is that the payment was processed and can be backed up because the original invoice was signed by the COO.

Jesus, corporate really takes the soul out of you."
"DEAR STRESS, LET’S BREAK UP! [stress]",[https://chetnatripathi.com/2016/12/22/dear-stress-lets-break-up/](https://chetnatripathi.com/2016/12/22/dear-stress-lets-break-up/)
I have final exams this mon-thurs and it's safe to say I'm quite stressed,"so my school did a shitty job of spacing out my finals, and now I have a final every day. I'm also quite scared because of my geometry regents exam (a state final given in NY) and it seems freaking impossible. I feel like it's worth mentioning that when I get this way I try to suppress it by not facing it. So in this case, avoid studying like the plague. Any help would be appreciated.
Thank you."
My wife doesn't handle stress well and won't seek help.,"Hey guys,

Been married for about a little over a year. I had an inkling before we got married that the wife was an anxious person but it was only after we got married I realised it was much more.

She has weekly breakdowns over minor occurrences at work and comes home cursing and screaming about what goes on. (Not at me, but that repeated venting does have its toll on me as well mentally.

The most recent example; she had a very early interview via Skype for a job she didn't necessarily want, mainly because she had already secured another job she preferred. Morning of the interview I'm violently shaken awake because the company's HR department couldn't get her on Skype and she was panicking. We sort it out but she continues shaking and crying moments before the interview for this job she doesn't want. She apologises for waking me, so i reply (in a calm and gentle tone) that it's fine, just next time be a bit more gentle because its not the nicest feeling to be woken like that and she breaks down again.

I've approached her multiple times about seeking counselling and maybe CBT, definitely not anxiolytics, meds would be a last last last resort. However she shuts down everytime I bring up the topic and don't know what else I can do. I only want her to learn how to handle these things better and also so that it doesn't affect our relationship negatively.

Any advice?

I eat chocolate,"I eat it when i'm stressed, which means alot!"
Math exam is stressing me out. I need help...,"For the past year and a half, math has been a huge load of stress for me. I'm understanding the classes, and I am fairly confident, however the exams are a nightmare. I feel like no matter how much i study, how much I try, I always end up failing. It's not because math is my weak point. I'm in the top class. I used to always get at least 90&#37;. Last year, a new math co-coordinator arrived, and since then, the exams have become impossibly hard, and I've dropped to 40&#37;, went up to the sixties for the next two exams. 

With the results of around 60&#37;, with the addition of the fact that we had done this content both this year and last year with a few additions, I thought That I might get a great result. I start off well, relatively relaxed, when all the sudden half of my time is gone, and I'm nowhere near finishing. I skipped multiple sections and ended up rushing the last section, leading to silly mistakes like forgetting to square a number.

I got my results back yesterday and nearly had a heart attack. 30/80. Around 37&#37;. I'm trying to wrap my head around this. I burst into tears when I got home. This is rubbish, I studied so hard to get yet another test that was far too long. This is really stressing me out, and I'm no longer looking forward to going to class. My mother believes that I could have finished it had I studied harder, despite the fact that 50&#37; was considered a high mark. I almost feel like pleading to go down to the third highest class, because I hear that the second class, which has the math coordinator, is even worse, and more stress inducing. I've even entirely scrapped the idea of going into advanced Mathematics for my senior years.

I don't know what to do, and I'm hoping that someone can help me. This is all becoming too much."
How does daily stress influence your life?,
How can I relieve stress while still being productive?,"I feel like my question could've been super easy to just Google, but I'm really in the mood to hear some human responses directly to me rather than reading another self\-help article. When I have a stressful day in the office, like lots of people my response is to have fun when I get home\-\- playing video games, binge\-watching Netflix, ordering takeout instead of cooking, skipping household chores for a night, maybe having some beers, doing some retail therapy etc.

The problem is, even if only a little bit, those things set me back. An example relevant to my present situation is skipping chores\-\- I skip one day, and the next day I have to catch up, but now that it's a bigger mountain to climb (more stress), I avoid it. I have people coming over this weekend, so at some point I'll \*have\* to clean (stress again). So on this morning's commute I thought ""What if I have a stressful day at work today?"". Now I can't \*afford\* to skip a day of chores anymore at least for this week (even more stress), which means I don't really have a way to come home and escape my stress. Work and home have both become my stressors instead of one being a stressor and the other providing relief. 

I feel like I'm struggling to find the sweet spot between the minimum level of relaxation needed to sustain living day to day without breaking down, and the point of relaxing too much where my other problems just pile up around me and become bigger problems, because I'm too stressed with other problems to deal with them.

Any advice?"
Stress is a GOOD thing. Embrace it.,"Stress has become the go\-to word used to describe inconveniences (big and small).

**We use the word to describe our mental state when:**

* We feel out of control with life
* Our to\-do list gets too long
* Deadlines are approaching fast
* People aren't behaving the way we think they should
* Circumstances aren't going as planned

When we experience too many of the above scenarios at once stress levels start to rise. It can become an icky mess pretty quickly.

But I have a suggestion. **What if instead of dreading stress we embrace it? What if we stop complaining when we feel stressed and start seeing it as a guidance system?**

Because that is the reality, **stress is your body's way of guiding you in the right direction.** When you're stressed your body is telling you that what you're doing is not working. You must try things a different way.

**Stress is not the problem. The real culprit is ignored stress.** When you ignore your ""guidance system"" for too long it will continue to escalate. Eventually, it will turn into burnout, depression, or anxiety.

But you don't have to wait for stress to get to the tipping point before you do something about it. Check out this video [8 Tips To Manage Stress, Overcome Overwhelm, And Find Inner Peace](http://sandrathemomboss.com/2agd)

* Reverse this mental state by doing some inner work

Please help me by filing out my survey on the Relationship of Perceived Stress and Depressive Symptoms on Dietary Habits among Adults in the Greater NYC Area. Link is below.,https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/Stress-Depression-Diet
Way too overwhelmed with everything,"I can’t seem to grab hold of anything anymore, I am just way too stressed out. My depression is like through the roof lately and I am constantly either angry or stressed out. I’m working two jobs right now and pretty much doing shifts back to back with little breaks in between. My sleep schedule is shit and I hardly have any time to really take care of myself at all. I can’t really go to the doctor and try to take meds (I haven’t ever been on antidepressants before but I have been given like short acting anti anxiety meds and those didn’t really help because I feel like I’m getting most of my stress from constantly hating my fucking life. I can’t go on meds because I literally don’t have TIME to go through crazy mood swings like everyone in my family does when they go on meds). Home life is a mess and I’m kind of the only “good” one who keeps it together so I can’t really have a full blown meltdown (that I feel could happen any minute) because I’m the only stable one while everyone else is too busy losing their shit. My relationship isn’t doing great because we both feel really distant but we don’t have any extra time for each other and we keep pissing each other off. I have school coming in September and I have no idea how I’m gonna pay for it when I really need to save up for a car. Also I’m fucking tired of people telling me to just “relax, take t easy this summer. Travel the world or take an art class” WITH WHAT FUCKING MONEY. I am waayyy too overwhelmed!!!! "
When my dad used to spend hours yelling at me my vision used to go foggy.,"He used to make me sit in the living room and would proceed to shout at me for what felt like an eternity and after a long while of just silently looking at him while he shouted at me my vision used to have this grey fog form right in the centre of it, not like blocking my whole vision but just like there in the middle, did anyone else get this? Is that a normal response to stressful situations?"
Can anyone help?,"I've known friend X for about 15 years, we used to be really close and have many memories up until 5 or so years ago, which is around the time Y got involved. He was doing extremely well in his day job and is pursuing a DJ career also, but his performance is suffering in both arrears due to greif from Y. X has a hearing at work in a few weeks and I've told him that he needs to step up and tell them everything that is going on with Y.

I also get a lot of hassle from Y and I really want him out of life, as does X. Y is controlling, manipulative and aggressive when things don't play out to his own agenda. Example: constant contact on a daily basis; if X doesn't answer his phone Y won't hesitate to spam him with phone calls, text messages or any other form of social media medium. Then the abuse starts, the threats, driving to the bottom of X's street or mine, or driving around looking for us both. Y makes fake accounts on social media to try and get in contact with X. Y has even gone to phone boxes and started calling X's phone. X has tried to block Y several times and even has gone to the extent of paying £600 to cancel his phone contract so that Y cannot phone him. Y insists that he picks X up from work every night without X's consent, and HAS to be there at every one of his DJ gigs, further causing hassle for him at work. If I spend time with X we have to be secretive about it, otherwise Y will become aggressive and once more, start making threats towards us both. X has lost a 2 year relationship because of Y's interference, and struggles to maintain relationships with girls because Y cannot stand him having a relationship with anybody bar himself. Y has begun to dress like X, pressures X into teaching him how to DJ (But when X gets Y a gig he turns it down), and regularly buys X unwanted gifts etc... Then when things go south Y has already saved a list of everything that X owes him back, causing more grief. 

Obviously me and X can't have a friendship that we once had because of Y's influence, we both don't know how to approach anyone because of this as we don't really have the confidence. We both know that the grief has to stop because it is making us both very depressed, and at 22 years old, it's pathetic. Y's backwards approach thinks that voilence will solve everything, hence the verbal abuse and physical threats but both me and X are better than going down that route. 

Has anyone ever been in a situation like this before? With someone who is obsessed with them? How did you get around it? Can anything be done?

Already screwed up at new job and I feel terrible,"I just started a new job, haven’t even been there a week yet, and I already screwed up.

How stress almost ruined my 2017,"Hello fellow redditors, stress can be a real issue if you don't start to take countermeassures in the right time, just what happened to me. I am 19 years old, and in 2016 i ended senior high, with great school grades, and even 2 weeks before because of my behavior and excellent tests. In 2017 i went to college, but, to be honest, i never cared so much, i'll usually study only at college and  then i would spend the rest of the day doing nothing or playing videogames, which caused me a handful of problems when tests started, so i left it in May, and i started working at a computer repair shop (i tinker with electronic apparatus from when i was 12 years old), and started doing courses from my house. This caused me a loss of self\-confidence on myself, as it was my first self inflicted failure, but after some days all started to became fine. Then an important date came, and i became ill, i didnt wanted to eat, i suffered headaches and abdominal pain. the first time was the day before starting college, the second time was in June, before an important event, same symptoms. And lastly, when i went abroad with my mom, my aunt and a cousin. One of the last days abroad, we have a little discussion because i bought a psu for another cousin with my money, but i forgot money to pay the taxes in the customs. After that discussion, i started to feel ill, without energy, and i didn't wanted to eat. Later we talked and make up with mom, so that was a relief.

After two days we came back home, in October. I went to my cousin's house to give him his psu and to pull some overnighters and play LoL, i was very upset when i didnt stand up for too long, at 1 AM, i was already sleeping. the next day, i got up feeling crushed, without voice and with fever, surprise! I catched a sinusitis in the trip back, so, by medical order, i took some antibiotics and antiflu. After 14 days, the illness was gone, but, my laptop broke, and with it, all my courses work, my clients list and a huge backlog of games i was playing in my free time. A week later, while i was using my mom's PC, the antivirus ran and destroyed 10 years of her work (even by today im still asking wth happened) and she was really upset. So, i became i'll, again.

To add things up, i crashed my dad's car, not a big deal, but because i disobeyed him i hit a tree with the rear and scratched the paint job. By those days, i was eating less and less everyday, i suffered from constant neck pain and headaches, i felt like if a train hit me every time i got up from bed at the morning, and this pain in the stomach.

One day, in November, my mother and my father went abroad, so i stayed home with my two brothers. All those days, because i didnt have my laptop (was at a repair shop in another city) i was staying all the day in my parents bed, watching netflix and lamenting because i couldn't eat anything without causing me intense stomach pain and even throw\-ups. A week later, my parents came, and my mother noticed i was like, very skinny (i always was big, not fat, but i weighted 207 pounds in middle July). My clothes became too big for me, and my parents became very worried. One dya, i went to a pharmacy to meassure my weight and. og boy, i weighted 163 pounds! (in my country we use kilos, so, i used to weight 94kg, and ib between October and November i lost 20 kg) We visited a doctor, who sent me to a gastric specialist, and after a month, i was diagnosed bacterial gastritis.

Because of the piled up stress (that i wasn't noticing) i got this gastritis and headaches, but, i became paranoid, and started thinking that the headaches were because a cerebral cancer (i look now and i feel so pathetic lol) and my life went to hell, each and everyday, i would torture myself thinking of the non existent tumor in my head, and so on. The year passed, and 2018 started.

After a long, long talk to myself, and after going to a doctor, i acknowleged that the headache was caused by a poor alimentation (after the gastritis diagnose, i didnt get a diet so i kept eating unhealthy food) and stress. I started a diet, i righted my life, and the headache was gone, at last!

So after a year, i finally got rid of the headache, i managed to improve my life quality and stress is starting to fade, but, i learned my lesson with this, never underestimate the power of the human mind, it can be a real life ruiner if you dont keep it controlled."
Headaches,"So I get this severe pain in my neck and get headaches, and what I believe is that stress is causing them. Does anyone else suffer with these, or have any advice?"
"I'm freaking out, guys!","So I'm selling my house, and moving. All of this is, in totality, a positive change. But as with any major life changes, it causes an crazy amount of stress. We've collected a lot of crap over the years, and I'm in charge of the process of sorting through it, trashing anything not used in the past year, and sorting the remainder into boxes and bins to be moved to storage so we can show the house.

I've started with simply sorting. Four bins: keep, sell, toss, donate. Have made significant progress with that. Unfortunately, I have a toddler, AND I care for my mom, who is pretty severely mentally disabled. Neither can be really left alone for any significant amount of time. 

I keep finding that my biggest problem is getting bogged down in the details. Example - I need to take all the stuff off the counters in the kitchen in order to photograph it. I start by unplugging the appliances, then I wiped them down, wrapped the cords, and started packing them into bins. Here's where I should have stopped. But having gotten that done, the next logical step was to start wiping everything down and REALLY cleaning the kitchen. Unfortunately, no. I should have moved on to packing up the glassware in the glass door cabinets. We have maids coming to do the scrubbing. I guess what I'm asking is, how do I stop at the end of a task? Idk what happens, but it's like I'm ""in the zone"" or something. My brain goes to autopilot and I find myself freaking out over the small things and losing focus on what I really need to do. Help!"
Virtual worry stone,"I developed a virtual worry stone app for Android. I can understand it's maybe trivial to most, but maybe it'll help someone.

When I was a child, I worried and worried. My worrying would build stress and often prevent me from sleeping, hooked on revolving thoughts of ""what if"". My parents assured me, but the worrying would continue. My parents would then give me a small oval-shaped stone. They told me to rub the stone and my worry would disappear. 

I was resilient at first and didn't quite understand. Yet, while rubbing the stone, my mind would drift away from the negative thought toward a mix of more neutral thoughts. Nowadays, fidget cubes and spinners serve similar purposes.

Anyways, I am inspired by my experience as a child and created a virtual worry stone. I thought I would share with r/stress

You can download it free from Google Play: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tekniika.android.myworrystone](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tekniika.android.myworrystone)

It is 100% free with no ads!

I've included a series of inspirational quotes which is rewarded after wiping a worry. Sometimes reading another's words can uplift someone to see a new perspective and release tension of stress for growth. Please share any quotes that have inspired you!

This sucks so much right now,"So it's finally happened.  My mom got a transfer to Florida and is selling the house in the next few weeks.  I'm trying to keep myself in a positive mood but every time she calls there's added worry and stress.  I've lived in New Jersey since I was two year old and leaving puts my anxiety through the roof.  I'm going to have to leave my job, my car, my friends and the house I all love.  She's been in Florida for a few weeks living out of an AirBnB and has procured an apartment which I'm worried she didn't take the time to investigate entirely.  She wants me to get a some form of transportation that will carry our things there but the cost of the smallest U\-Haul is $1700.  She's gone through all of this without an ounce of what it will entail and she's dragging my family and me through the mud.  The only solace I get is when I'm asleep but then I wake up again to this nightmare.  My little brother and my older sister aren't stable and my grandmother has to live with an a person she doesn't even like.  My life has been a living hell for months and I honestly cannot take this anymore.  Everyone expect her loses here and the only thing she tells me is how beautiful Florida is which gives very little relief if any."
3 ways to calm your mind and reduce stress,"I use these three practices to reduce stress and calm my mind. They can be done anywhere, anytime.

1\) Get into your body

In body scan meditation, you slowly bring your awareness to the different parts of your body. You can simply notice the sensations in your body or consciously imagine softening and relaxing that part of your body. At first it might be difficult to stay focused on your body and your thoughts might take you away. But slowly, with more and more practice, it will become easier to remain focused on your body as you scan through all my body parts. You will start to feel more and more sensations and become more aware of your body as a result. You will notice where you hold tension and stress and be able to release this tension.

2\) Get into your breath

The simplest breathing technique can help you calm your mind. It's called diaphragmatic breathing. Simply, place your hands on your belly, then ribs, then upper chest and practice breathing into your hands.  At the end, you place one hand on your belly and the other on your heart and breath into your belly up to your heart and back out again. By placing my hands on your body, you can choose a certain number of breaths to count and focus on the physical sensation of your hands rising and falling. Not only do you stop thinking while you’re doing this, but also you come back to your day feeling refreshed and full of energy.

3\) Get into your senses

Another great way to stop your constant monkey mind is by getting into your senses. This one can be a meditation exercise or a writing exercise. Just going one by one, notice what you see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. Spend 5 minutes and think it, say it out loud, or write it down. This is a great practice to get you back into the present moment. You may even notice things that have been around you all along that you completely forgot. You may even find that you smile or laugh at something you never even noticed.

What do you do to calm your mind and reduce stress?

I'm looking to interview a few busy and ambitious women looking to overcome stress and exhaustion and unlock their inner energy. If your available for a 20 minute interview over the next week or so, please PM me or leave a YES! in the comments.

In exchange I am happy to offer you a FREE \(no\- pitch\) private call with me to pinpoint the top thing causing stress in your life and 3 strategies to unlock your inner energy.

Thanks!"
"At work, saturday night/sunday morning, doing a solo deployment of significant code changes with no QA validation, in a company of 10k+ people","So I work for a multi-national company. Due to ""It works for me"" and ""If It Ain't Broke Don't Fix It"", and ""That's the way we've always done it!"" We use an antiquated technology -- Lotus Notes. A significant minority of the company requires it for tracking various tasks throughout their workday.

Due to some changes in our _actual_ product line, we have had to make some changes to lotus notes. This decision came down the pipe _at roughly the exact same time the previous person in charge of administering lotus notes quit_. The day before that I had been a QA engineer, developing automated test cases, the day after I was the sole administrator for all lotus notes related activities within the company. Unfortunately, the company is trying to starve the beast -- make getting changes and maintenance to notes so impossible that more and more teams drop off, but that doesn't appear to be the end result.

Anyway, back to tonight's issue. I'm deploying this major change, some of the code written on the first day I'd ever seen lotus script (read: bad horrible code). I've tested it to the best of my ability with help from one other team member in the company -- I'm fairly confident I didn't break anything that wasn't already broken. It should be noted that I was not in the minority that used lotus notes prior to this responsibility shift, so I also had to get a major crash course in the business logic these notes applications followed.

That said, in this company the smallest possible entity to assign blame to is a team. Every team, regardless of size schedules regular meetings to try and root out implicit assumptions and unknowns -- ergo we can assume that whenever there is a failure, it is the entire team that failed. I'm not gonna say consequences don't occur, but they generally occur on the team level.

Except I'm a team of one, I'm here on saturday night, alone, deploying major changes while ensuring backwards compatibility and hoping and pretty and checking and double checking and triple checking that nothing explodes during my deployment. It's a wee bit stressful (and I think slightly ridiculous) that in a company the size of the company I work for I am the only person who is responsible for this without any help."

Embracing the change in weather- I choose to say no to the 'winter blues' and flip it to see the positives (more downtime)!,The weather is getting so much colder in New Zealand at the moment and causing the winter blues for many. I admit I really don't like the cold but I am embracing it as a chance to slow down a little and take some much needed down\-time. Flipping the mindset and seeing the positives. Have you had any mindset shifts/wins lately?

Secondly, I think it is amazing that you are posting in here to get advice on how you can help your girlfriend- that really shows that you care. I'm not sure whether she knows that you did or not but if she did I'm sure that she would be grateful.

I am mainly using Reddit to add value/provide advice for people experiencing high stress (I am a life coach in training- specialising in stress management) and to help people develop tools to reduce overwhelm so they can have the time and energy to do the things that are important to them! At the moment I am looking to do some short market research interviews to help me with an upcoming programme I am creating on stress management. By any chance do you think your girlfriend would be interested in skyping with me for 15 minutes and answer some of my questions around stress? In exchange, I would be more than happy to offer her a FREE (no pitch) 20 minute coaching session to really help her hone in on some techniques she might not have covered in traditional therapy. I have a number of tools which I can teach depending on what would be most beneficial to her personal situation. I look forward to hearing from you!

Navy and college stuff,"So this might go over a lot of people's heads; this first part anyway,  but I'm in the Navy and I basically got told I'm getting a P eval which is not a good eval for a promotion. I suppose in the grand scheme of things it means nothing, I plan on getting out of the navy. It's just made me think about myself though. I feel like I work really hard but now that this outline of me has been created it makes me think that I can't cut it in the outside world. I'm studying a lot of math right npw taking calc 3 and physics 1 most people would say that's impressive but I feel like it's fake because I'm going to an online school. This all leads up to me transferring schools to a nice brick and mortar university where I can study electrical engineering, because I like my job as an electrical aviation tech. That eval makes me think that I can't make it in the real world and that I really don't work hard. I feel like I work hard though am I right in that I'm just lying to myself? Is all of this college just a facade? I took 12 classes last year and I feel like that's a proud accomplishment something a lot of people wouldn't normally be able to do but in the Navy's eyes its almost worthless?   


I feel like I'm trying to reason my situation though. I'm listing off things that a person would associate success with but I'm not seeing the things I'm failing at. Or maybe I do and the Navy is just exaggerating the things they want out of me? I feel like the Navy is easy and I don't put a lot of time towards it \( I mean qualifications\). When I'm at work I feel like I really  focus in on a task. When I get told I'm not performing up to standards it makes me think that me saying ""The Navy is easy"" Is just a big lie. How can I say the Navy is easy if I'm not performing to the standards but at the same time how can I be taking 12 classes and working a full time job and not be working hard? I don't understand?   


This feels like the same kind of crisis every person with an inner dialogue has about everything in life, an unexplainable circumstance that can't be validated. The only way I can know that I'm smart enough is if I go out and become and electrical engineer and that's very stressful and even then will this go away? Will I always be living with the fear of not being good enough? I feel like I'm good enough for myself and I work towards goals I want and value but then the Navy tells me those things aren't what they value. I wish I had a message from an all seeing god to tell me that ""YES YOU ARE A HARD WORKER AND YOU ARE SMART, YOU NEED HOLD YOUR GOALS IN THE HIGHEST REGARD"" I have nothing though I'll have to just try as hard as I can. God I really don't want to fail I'm so scared of failing when I get out. I feel like my whole family is watching and they all think I'm extremely smart and that I'm the only one doubting myself or that knows the truth that I'm just a colossal idiot and the Navy knows the truth. Maybe I'm that book smart person people talk about and that would be some shit. I hate that I don't like that book smart mindset, smart people should just be smart and this is too fucking long to read and I have to study and I don't know what response I want from this. "
"Is it justifiable to quit a stressful inbound call centre job with nothing else lined up, if it's impacting your mental and physical health ?","Long story short: Worked in a call centre for 4 years for a vehicle breakdown service, starting to not be able to cope with it any more due to a combination of things (change in management, not enough staff for a constantly expanding customer base, rewards based on whether your face ""fits"" rather than actual demonstrable achievements, etc).

Unable to relax after work, constantly thinking/dreading going to work. Get random mood swings about it, either intensely rageful, or wanting to burst in to tears. Headaches that go on for 3 or 4 days at a time are now a regular occurence. Starting to manifest in other physical ways (unable to sleep, constantly weary, having a lot more sickness than usual).

Desperately trying to get out of it, but the current job drains me that much I don't seem to ever have the time or energy to properly hunt for a new job, as it cuts into the fleeting time I have outside of work to spend with family, partner and enjoying hobbies. Work and the negative thoughts about it seem to devour and consume all my spare time and energy. Most of my thoughts are usually about bad calls I've had during the day, or dreading having to go into work after time off.

My family and partner have said they are willing to support me, and just want me to be happy, and I must admit, leaving this place would help enormously (free time to relax, get back to being a happier me, and time to invest in job hunting something I actually want to do as a career).

I just want to know what impartial unbiased people think. If a job is making you feel so bad that it manifests in a constant fight of flight feeling, tightness on the chest and in breathing, headaches that go on for days and generally sour your view of life: is it a good idea to just hand in my 4 week notice and spend the free time fixing myself and job hunting, in the UK's current job climate?"

"In a stressful, anxious and lonely period. How to cope with it?","Many things have happened in just 7 days.

I broke up with my boyfriend, it was a toxic relationship lasted a year.
Even tho it was all toxic I miss him, to distract myself I should hang out with people, but honestly.. I'm not good with people. I don't have lots of friends, and they are not even good..

My third year in high school is ending and it's really stressful with last tests. I have 3 more weeks to go but it feels like eternity.

I decided that I will study more to get a 3.0 GPA so that I can access to college. But to attend college in America.. I will go there and live by my own. So all these thoughts are making me exhausted.

I feel like I want to isolate myself more than I already am. Like, as soon as I finish my school day, I'll head home and try to relax. I don't want to see anyone and talk to anyone. My mother said that it's been too much time since I actually made a real smile, not a fake one.

It's just that I have priorities (like college) and I can't seem to mantain friendships because I'm so emotionally beaten down and stressed.

I see everyone like an enemy now: I started to dislike everyone for their shitty behavior. Everyone is just so annoying and kinda mean these days.

It's also me whom is messed up with emotions and ugh.. how do I just cope with all these emotions and all this stuff?"

What is it called when someone is so stressed they snap at the first thing that draws their attention?,"Last night I was cooking dinner for my gf while she was setting up a sprinkler in the front yard. She had been out there by herself for several minutes while I was working in the kitchen not knowing that the following factors were causing her to become stressed: a weak hose that kept kinking so water wouldn’t flow through it, the three neighbors dogs barking at her through the fence (they were within three feet of her, and trying to connect two hoses that did not want to fit. 
When I finished getting dinner ready, I happily went outside to let her know dinner was ready. Up to this point we had been having a lovely evening and I never suspected anything was wrong so my mental and emotional defenses were down and I was not expecting anything. After I told her dinner was ready I stood waiting for some response while keeping our dog busy, mowing she might get in my gfs way. She turned around a yelled,”You don’t have to rush me!” And went back to doing what she was working on, clearly angry. 
I had no response and could only stammer that I wasn’t rushing her and finally gave up and went inside and sat on the couch to figure out what had just happened.
This isn’t the first time she has snapped at me when I am not the source of stress on her but after the inevitable argument and makeup she told me how she had been stressed by all the things I had listed and believed I had come out to hurry her along to dinner. 
She is seeing a therapist now for about a year but only once a month but I think she should be seeing them about twice a month but she always has excuses why she can’t. So I want to know how I can avoid her snapping at me like that again in the future. How do I keep her from getting stressed out by ordinary, as I see them, things?"
Does anyone else shower more often when they get stressed?,"This is something I've noticed myself doing often the last few years. When I'm stressed \(not always consciously\) I feel this really intense urge to shower more often and if I don't I feel really gross, as if I haven't showered in a week. So when this happens I usually take three \(sometimes four\) showers in a day.  I know it's terrible because I'm wasting so much water but I can't seem to help it. Does anyone else get this?"

What to break to relieve stress,"So far, I've been ripping paper, tearing tissues, and breaking pencils to help relieve stress. My parents have been fucking me over recently. I know you're going to say they do it because they love you, buy I have no time to be myself. I come home, work 'till 11, and am dead tired in school. About 2 hours of that is required homework. Is there anything else you reccomend breaking that hopefully has more than a one time use? Pencils have worked the best so far, thanks!"
school stress,so recently i have been extremely stressed because the end of the school year is coming and my economics grade is a 4. i calculated that i have to get a 5 minimum to pass on to my last year of high school. it sounds easy right? well some reason economics is the only subject where i get really deep bad grades and if i don't pass my parents will kill me because the school i go to hella expensive and this is tearing me down. i just feel so depressed because of this shit and i don't know what to d.
Best ways to manage stress?,"I've become a huge stress monkey.  This is new to me, and to the point where it's negatively impacting my health, intellect, and family life.  It's all work related.  I'm late career and have never been in a work situation this bad.

I know I need to get out (working on it).  Realistically, because of geographic lockdown, (needed) pay grade, etc, it's going to take a good year for me to switch.  I need a way to maintain until I can get out.  A couple of years ago, when it started getting bad, I coped by drinking a lot more and being a couch potato.  But that's bad for me and my family, not working, so I've stopped.

I went on a two week business trip.  I didn't realize how stressed i was from it until I threw up after getting off the plane, and then sleeping 24 hrs straight.  I know this is negatively impacting my performance. Even now when I think about the office tomorrow, my shoulders seize up and I get nauseous.  So...what are the weapons grade stress relief techniques?  The ones that will help me be my best me while I figure out how to be that best me somewhere else?  "
Completely lacking time to destress,"I'll quickly list some stressors that have created this situation although I can't quite express what I'm asking everyone here. 

1. For the past four years I've usually worked well into the night and worked weekends, and my work hours are so extreme because I have to do other people's work. In my organisation there are many, many people who do not do their job, knock off early, and pass their work to others. 

2. I have completely given up hobbies and interests outside work. I do not have time to engage in them. Things that I could normally do to relax, like exercise or yoga, are absolutely out of the question because I work 16 hours a day. 

3. I am frequently sleep deprived due to my work hours. 

4. I have given up two relationships which broke down largely due to my work hours. 

5. I frequently, like at least weekly, lie awake thinking about how much of my twenties I have given up so that other people can knock off early. 

6. Every time I have tried to directly address this issue I get told this is just the way it is. If you are good at your job you get huge, unreasonable amounts of work. 

I am likely to leave this job in the next 12 months but for now, I need help to just destress and get some sleep without actually having time to do anything relaxing. Thoughts? "
How do I relax and not be stressful when I'm in a state of hopelessness?,"Hey guys im so stressed out right now,this past 2 days I've walking around the house aimlessly I have mild headache and feelingness of vomiting and I feel a lot of blood in my head (like think my blood pressure is raised high)

I'm 18 years old and have to talent and skill. I've never been good at anuthing. I suck at school and everything 

Learning, taking notes, memorizing, applying, summarizing

I'm focus on Japanese and piano but I feel so lost. I quit my piano lessons because I've done it for 7 years and none of my teacher never teach my according to my goal. I feel like the way they teach me doesn't really help me. 

I want to be able to compose and improvise but I guess no one can teach me. I guess it's because i lack creavtivity and I'm not good at applying things . I've always had trouble writing things in school because it turns out dull and unimaginative and I'm just not good at it. 

I'm always stuck at the basics. And my learning sucks because before I even internalize it I've already read or go through the the material hundreds of times so I know the material if I see it but i cannot apply it.

My mother tell me to stop pressuring myself and trying to take in too much but I'm saying that I'm stressed is because I cannot achieve this skill not because it's too much. I want to understand and internalize it and move on execpt for being stucked in the basics and it's boring

(This is the way I write so believe me when I say my writing is terrible)

What am I suppose to do? "
I get stressed at EVERYTHING... advice please?,"I’ve just taken two weeks off work for anxiety related issues. The anxiety is about my health. 

For the last 4 years, I’ve had constant health issues of one kind or another. It started when my wife had a miscarriage. Abdominal pain, lots of gas... thought it was my appendix. Doctor said it was stress related. 
Then it was glandular fever which caused me to lose weight, lose my appetite, became completely fatigued. More abdominal pain, headaches. Again, was told it was stress related. Thought it was bowel cancer or pancreatitis. 
Then it was muscle pain which I thought was male breast cancer or lymphoma.
Last year, back pain, neck ache, abdominal cramps... had an XRay, blood tests, ultrasounds... all fine!

About a month or two ago, I realised that I had tremors in my hands. Just slight usually when gripping. Also had slight weakness in my knees, pains all over my body in my muscles, twitches. My brain went to MS

I keep getting told it’s stress. Another blood test last week, all fine! I’m being sent to a neurologist and I’m having another ultrasound to check for a hernia. But the doctor thinks it’s stress. 

Here’s the thing. Everything stresses me out. My son wakes me up through the night (he’s 2), my wife is messy, my commute is long, my work is in London and stresses me out, selfish people in cars or on the street, lack of consideration from people, shoddy workmanship, no time to exercise... every, single, thing gets to me. Unless I’m running through the countryside, or sitting watching TV, or having a drink with friends. 

I am so so worried that I’m dying all the time that other little stresses just add to it. And now I’m worried that my heart will give in due to stress. 

How do I get over it and stop stressing about stuff? "
I’m actually not okay with it...,"So I’ve just finished my first year of uni. I stayed in Halls and luckily I’m good friends with 3 of them and we are moving in together. We found a flat and have paid the deposit which is great but the only problem is the room situation.

There’s 4 rooms. A really big one (1), a not so big but quite big one (2), an okay sized one (3) and basically the smallest room (4) which you can fit a double bed in but its more long than wide. There is quite a big cupboard across from it but no one wants the small room. 

We decided to draw fair and square out of hat. I feel it’s important to mention what my flat mates study. I’m a fine art painter, there’s a graphic designer, the other two study forensic science and business. I for one always have the worst luck when it comes to drawing names out of a hat, so for me I had lost all hope of getting a bigger room. 

Right enough I get the smallest room.... it was inevitable. 

The order went (1) - Graphic Designer, (2) - Businessman, (3) - Forensic Scientist And then me (4) - Painter. 

I thought I’d be okay with whatever I got... but I’m honestly not. I dunno if I’m just being plain selfish or if I’m worried about how much room I’ll have to do my work. I’m not gonna lie I felt like either me or the graphic designer actually need the space. The other two need a desk to study but that’s about it, but I also understand that it’s nice to have a big room. As me and the graphic designer are art students we often have more hands on work that sometimes requires more floor space, but the wall can sometimes be used instead. I would have liked to get my easel in my room so I can do some commissions in my spare time but that doesn’t seem likely anymore and I’m a bit disappointed by that. Ill have to work in the kitchen or living room....

Am I just being selfish? But why do I actually feel so bad about getting this room? The flat itself is quite expensive and I think I am the only one who’s parents aren’t paying anything for them. Maybe I just feel like I’m not getting what I’m paying for? Like it’s so much money but I’m stuck in this tiny box room while the rest are freely moving around in theirs? When my name was last I felt my stomach twist and I could have cried. My mind isn’t in a great place right now either so that could just be it. The room might not be as small as I remember it but it still just feel so upset by it...

I’m disappointed in myself for being disappointed in my room. It was all done fairly but yet deep down I feel like it’s unfair to me. Why am I being like this? I’m upset with myself because I’m being so selfish. Why can’t I just be grateful I’ve got somewhere to live for the next year....

Sorry for this long post, I just needed to write out my thoughts and try relieve some stress. "
Stress at Work,"I get so stressed at work. I feel like women get all the preferential treatment. Also, the few women who are in charge just spend their time micro\-managing the men while letting the other females just slide by doing minimal work. I don't get it. It causes me huge stress because I feel like im living in an unfair world and I don't know what to do about it. I am working harder than the ladies I work with, but I get micro\-managed and can't relax at all, yet the ladies doing almost nothing just sit there and talk all day and nothing happens. What do I do? Also, I don't think getting a new job is a solution because I am pretty sure it would happen at any job. Its just like, how women work?"
Poor Stress Response...,"Hello everyone --

I'll try and keep this post short just to get to the main points!

Up until 2001, I was very healthy with no issues at the time, and nothing very stressful going on. I woke up one summer morning feeling totally out of sorts...  It was hot and I couldn't cool down and stop sweating, I felt dizzy, etc...loud noises were easily stimulating.. strong smells were suddenly stimulating.. basically any kind of stressor, even mild, wasn't being handled well by my body.

This has now gone on up until this point. I've done my due diligence and been to multiple doctors and specialists who've done pretty much every test you can think of... psychotherapists to see if it was anything psychological going on....etc.   Nothing has come back abnormal.

Yet, my body overreacts to any kind of stressor or stimulation very erratically. By the time the day is over i'm physically and mentally exhausted!  

I've exercise regularly (which I have to keep moderate as too much is too stressful... ), i eat healthy (tried a multitude of different diets over the years), I meditate.   I've tried every supplement known to man which has zero effect, I've even been open and tried SSRI's when my Dr's had no other answers, but even these seemed to do nothing, only side effects. My mood has always been good surprisingly throughout all of this...

I'm kind of at a loss and wondered if anyone else has experienced anything like this and if you'd had success in treating this?

Thanks in advance!

Sleeping is now just an annoyance that I use simply to transition into the next day easily. I roll around my bed uncomfortably for long periods of time and the rising temperatures aren't helping. I eventually fall asleep and wake up feeling like garbage no matter when I fell asleep or how long I've slept. I guess I'm just tired of life and the same old BS, but this feeling is so strange that I just wanna see if anyone else has felt this too. I also just wanted to vent a little.... "

Does living in more disorganized country reduce stress?,For example in the western first world I hold myself to a high standard for everyday things. Being late somewhere is unthinkable and severely reprimand myself if I fail. However as I've been told in many third world countries nothing runs on time. So for example missing a bus and arriving late at work or whatnot is considered the new normal. I wonder if just by living in a more disorganized place I would be less neurotic. Or perhaps this would just exasperate the problem.

I am in my final year and have applied for a high rankinf unuversity which has been my dream university since I decided to go and study there. The thing is that I've got an conditional offer and that I need a certain mark to get in. At the moment I am 1 point under it and have been studying my ass off. Consequently, I have trouble dealing with eveything and I am at the verge of not getting the mark, so I'm really stressed out which has been leaving its mark on me. Anyone have a few tipps that help lessen it or make it feel as if its lessend?"

Recent Neurology Study Finds 6Hz Theta Wave Binaural Beats Gets You Deep Into A Stress-Reducing Meditative State Faster Than Meditation Alone...,"From the study:

""The brain responses to the 6-Hz binaural beat revealed in this study showed that theta activity was enhanced similar to that observed in a meditative state within just 10 min of exposure. Therefore, a 6-Hz binaural beat on a 250 Hz carrier tone could be utilized as a stimulus for inducing a meditative state, as meditation has several advantages, such as stress reduction. However, achieving such effects via meditation require a deep meditative state that often takes a long period of time. With this binaural beat, a meditative state can be induced in just 10 min and may be more feasibly implemented in modern lifestyles.""

I just made this pure 6Hz Theta binaural beats track, like the one they used in the study, for myself to use during meditation. And I  decided to share it on YouTube in case others want to use it to reduce their stress, too.

I find this to be perfect for stress reduction, and have included a link to the study in the description of the video.

How do people deal with stress in general?,"I'm really struggling here; I've got familial stress, work stress, and general day to day stresses and the only thing that helps is when I swim.

However, I can't afford to swim every night (the only hours open for swimming in my home town are 9-10 at night, and that means I'm tired for work the next day!) and can't rely on this forever. The stress is now affecting my health, and I really need a way to just... Alleviate the stress, if even just by a little!

Please help me out?"
High Schooler needing Help,"I feel guilty. Why? My mom and our dog.

We have a black labrador and my mom tends to walk her every day (of course they need exercise).

More often I don't come with her nowadays...  because she tends to guilt trip me and I just thought she was putting our lives at risk by going out. (I used to go with her often but I have gotten lazy throughout my sophomore and my current junior year due to the damn fact that I got school, school, and school)

I hate making excuses and feeling guilty.

How can I just take risks and go out every now and then to walk my dog with a condescending, but hard working mom?

Thank you.

Stressed lol,"My mom's got Alzheimer's, my dad's working his was off to support my family, and my sister's in school. I quit my job to become a fulltime caretaker but cannot afford to really survive. As a result I have neglected my health and now have intestinal issues that haven't gotten better in over a month. I went to doctors but even with Medicaid can't afford the tests or prescriptions. My family is in the midst of losing my uncle and I can't expect anyone in my family to help us. Everything costs money. Our physical and mental health is declining and Im getting worried I'm about to be the next loss in the family.  I'm also 21. On top of this my friends mom had knee surgery so I'm also driving their family around having to wake up early and keep up with their schedules. Dont know where to turn - suicide is not even an option lol.  But.  Hopefully I'm not bumming anyone out I just don't have friends that I can talk to and I'm tired of having mental breakdowns in my room by myself so I'm trying to vent here a little bit. Have a good day if you read this,  please. If you can be happy then do it for me. Do it for you. Peace."
Advice for De-Stress for University Exams Finals? (Especially when only a weeks worth of cramming left),"Hey there,

I'm currently an 18 year old (nearly 19) finishing up freshman year (a course in general sciences with modules in Physics, biology, math, geology) with my first university finals in about 8 days. 6 separate exams, from the 2nd of May until the 11th. 

Since about April 10th, I've uninstalled my Discord and logged off social media and can not express truly how happier I've felt in a while, I've been able to talk to my family more and control the amount of energy I have. (and also bring the life in the room when I'm in group study with one of my friends that we booked together studying for finals)

Anyway I've been studying (or rather just reading off the slides) quite pacefully from 6am to 10pm every day since so nearly two weeks now, and I've been experiencing many emotions like anxiety, stress, fear and some disappointment. I've been constantly making check-list plans but never meeting them, probably because I list too much priorities that I have to do for the day. (The coursework is huge, and you can't deny it. It would be quite difficult to cram if I'll be honest.)

I just want to get a perspective and know how it's possible to do it altogether, not lose my motivation and also not regret not working hard or doing much work over the past 7-8 months since I started university, and now I'm cramming a year's worth of work (two full semesters) with all I have left. 

My classes finished on the 8th of April, so I've pacefully or maybe slowly worked since the 10th, and now it's the 24th, and even at this slow pace, I'm a tad bit stressed out with what I'm doing since I constantly feel I'm not doing enough yet I'm overwhelmed by feeling I'm doing too much.

Who says study-cramming two modules of physics [with three submodules per semester], one semester of geology, one semester of cellular and molecular biology and two semesters of math(s) [with two submodules within each module] can be a walk in the park while I'm doing it all simultaneously?

I want to just get your guy's perspective on this, preferably offer me some good advice, help me destress as I do fall victim to my generalized anxiety disorder and Aspergers, but I don't want to regard it as a disability, rather a speciality at my own expense which is a good thing I can acknowledge about myself.

I suppose my downfall was being cast under the illusion seeing everyone else enjoy themselves and understand and share the material being learned, while I just sat there with my friends sitting passively and not giving a fuck to whatever they're doing. (I have some smart enthusiastic friends who are pretty ego about their course and have some sense of certainty to what they want to do in the future at only like 18/19?)

I'm not the smartest or brightest kid in my year but I do want to be hard-working, I live in a very smart family and I see my younger 15 year old sister studying everyday in high school, locking herself in her room and chanting french verbs, memorizing geography paragraphs to herself and stuff or the like. (I'm a pretty sensual person in all honesty) So seeing all that really puts my competition in perspective, I've always wanted to feel like I'm not lazy or that I can be better. Everytime I see people work hard especially at my university library, I can get pretty overwhelmed and constantly get negative thoughts that they're studying harder (mostly I've noticed it's always girls who are there even on Saturdays from 9am in the morning when I come in for a group study with a friend - although I don't want to create these closed-minded ideas in my mind either) and better than me. I let these negative thoughts overcloud my mind and it makes it harder to control it overtime as I keep trying to improve myself constantly day in day out. 

I am always trying to be fully aware because I want to be a fully calm and collected person and to also perform well in exams while cramming and not feeling guilty about it. I want to impress my parents, my family and not end up dropping out of the top university of the country. I want to do things I finally enjoy like play badminton, play videogames which I haven't done in a year, watch netflix or something.

Yet I don't want to waste time either and not fall victim to de-motivation or procrastination when I become overwhelmed or see other people exceed at a higher potential as a result of locking themselves in the room studying and working 12 hours a day.

I was always one of the best in my high school year so I've still yet to get used to being outperformed by most of the cohort in my year. For example, I was the only one in my Physics lab to get a B in my lab assessment when everyone else got A's in my last day of classes and I can't express how disappointed and depressed I felt that day coming home by bus. 

But I want to feel rejuviline again, not constantly worry about studies, work, even though I'm cramming. I want to trust the process and understand I might not be able to finish everything in time even if given the opportunity to study for three weeks without classes. It's still not a lot of time to get everything done, and I'm only in my first year of university.

So peace and lots of care, I hope you guys read this, maybe share your experiences too which would help, thoughts, criticisms and opinions appreciated! 

I'd like to receive help at this point and feel free from the chains of my negative thoughts that lock me in this pit of darkness.

[Help] Stress/Anxiety is making me sick,"Hey r/Stress,

I am not too sure if this is the correct place to post this, but give me a read and if its not I will find the correct place to go. A little background before I explain, I am a senior Mechanical/Aerospace Engineering student in the US getting ready to finish up the semester and get married, all within the next month.

Here is the problem: I am failing a class right now that would seriously hinder my future success if I do not pass \(my perspective, anyway\) and it is seriously hurting my productivity. I am sick to my stomach \~70&#37; of the time , cannot sleep on a beneficial schedule, and am finding myself with no discipline/motivation for anything. The main source of this stress is a scholarship I am on that requires payback if you lose it, meaning I would be in the whole about $20,000 if I fail and get kicked out. The contract states you can either be kicked out or placed on probation, but I cannot find any precedent on what direction they lean. Without diving into many specifics on this class and the great, and I emphasize great, impact it can have on this scholarship \(I wouldn't be able to get my AE degree\), I was hoping I could find some advice on increasing my productivity and generally improving my mental/physical health.

I am reaching here, I really need some help. My fiance, bless her heart, is not much help because of planning the wedding and I don't have a lot of close friends/confidants."
"stress, expectations & social comparison","I watched today ""Brad’s Status"", a 2017 movie with Ben Stiller, man going through his midlife crisis, troubled by ideas and ruminations related to social status and how he thought he failed in life when he compared with the lives of his old friends from college.

Without trying to spoil you the pleasure of watching this movie, I'd like to stress out how much comparing oneself to others can ruin one's wellness. We seldom if ever compare ourselves with people that fare far worse than us, but usually with people who seem like they succeeded in life: having money, status, fame or a beautiful wife. I do that quite often and that is stressful and it turns away my attention from things that are in my power to change, like small things that better the everyday life.

They say that in this very moment we don't have problems. And there is this Zen saying : *“If the problem has a solution, worrying is pointless, in the end the problem will be solved. If the problem has no solution, there is no reason to worry, because it can’t be solved.”*

How to get my bod to calm down - tips?,"Hey everyone! First post here. I've got a bod that seems semi-permanently caught in fight-or-flight mode and I'm trying to find ways to fix it. Any tips would be welcome. Here, let me give you guys a quick overview of the situation.

It used to be just the breathing, as in feeling like you can't breathe in enough. Hands get sweaty, getting the jitters, you probably know the feeling. That was about six months however, and it's not really improved at all. In fact, it's gotten worse recently. A lot of muscle groups in my upper body (shoulders, chest, right below the rib cage,) are tight or sore, and rubbing them doesn't seem to do much. These past two nights have been a bitch.

I've got some over-the-counter sleeping pills to help relax, but they don't seem to do all that much. I'm trying to do meditation, but that only appears to work on the short term.

To give you an idea of where this stress comes from: I moved countries last year in June and have started my own business. Initially, that meant a lot of new stuff, like getting registered here, sorting out a bank account, squaring everything over with PayPal so I can have a business account and transfer funds to my new account. Then there was getting clients, doing work, trying to find a balance between work and free time. Of course, those things can cause, and in my case have caused, stress. However, I have set limits already and don't bite off more than I can chew anymore. I keep regular office hours, don't work full or even partial weekends or evenings anymore. It's been that way for close to a month now, but the stress symptoms have only escalated.

How can I make it clear to this fuckwad of a body that shit is actually fine? It can calm down now? Oxygen is nice? I'm beginning to forget what it's like to not be stressed and I don't want that. So yeah, any advice is welcome.

Btw, I did get in touch with my doctor's office to get an appointment to get his opinion, but their system has yet to get back to me. In the meantime, I'd love to hear what you guys think.

EDIT: I wanted to thank everyone for their replies! They've been very helpful and I'll be looking into all of the things you've mentioned to some degree or other. The breathing tips are a more immediate help, but exercise is definitely also something I want to get back into."

How can I help someone to de-stress,"In the last two weeks my mother has come to my house stressed by work issues (pressure from the boss) and says that sometimes not being able to do something they ask makes her feel stupid and stressed, from personal experience my mom is a bit more suseptible than the average of people with respect to what others think of her, so I think she try too hard to do everything perfect and fast, also she says that in the office people care about the visual aspect and always try to be arranged as best as possible because of that too.

So far I have tried to listen to her problems so that she feel released, but what advice can you give me to help her more?

Stress Management journey: reflecting,"It is hard to believe how stress and anxiety can affect your life.

Getting fatter.

Becoming ill.

Having a hard time to sleep.

Procrastinating.

Having low self-esteem.

Stress prevented me from doing the things I loved.

Going up and talk to that cute girl I had been admiring but never had the courage to tell how I felt.

It is hard looking back at this for it fills you with regret.

Comparing my future self to others.,"I am currently in college and have not yet had a full time job. I feel like I am constantly stressed about how much money I will make when I get out and I can't rap my head around how much money is enough. I know people that are making $80,000 jointly a year and have three kids and are doing well. I know other people that make $170,000 jointly and are deeply in debt. I can't figure out how much you need to make to be at any specific standard of living and I have been spending several hours every few days just hopelessly scanning Youtube and Reddit in the hope of figuring it out. This is wasting hours and hours of my time that should be dedicated to studying, but once the stress comes in, it's been impossible for me to get rid of it for the rest of that day."

I don't wanna be a failure,"A couple years ago in college I failed 2 classes and started taking less classes.

I can't fail anymore classes, I'm working to the best of my abilities and feel like if I can't handle this how can I manage real life?  All I do is work at a grocery store and have class, other than that I have nothing in my life. There's a part of me that just keeps saying ""run away"" but what the hell would I even do. I barely know how to cook for myself. The only thing keeping me from killing myself now is that I learned in Catholic school that if you kill yourself you end up in hell. I have no dreams, I just don't wanna let my mom down again. She's the only person I actually care about."
Losing net neutrality is driving me up a wall with anger and paranoia.,"You all know the story. Ajit Pai and his corporate masters hated Net Neutrality. Net Neutrality was repealed because there were more Corporate whores than actual Americans in the FCC.

I have been doing my absolute best to pass but the subject were very difficult on my own....I have tried studying and watching old lectures and everything but the syllabus was too long in several cases ( mathematics was much more difficult and longer than abitur according to our professor) and exams were just too hard for me in my situation so I failed.
The thing is she linked this with studying with my friends which I only recently started doing it because they were very helpful and my progress increased significantly. She now commands me to just cut all relations with any friends that I have made whom for the first time in my life are ones who i looked forward to seeing them the next day because I enjoy there company. On top of that she demands excellent grades in future not knowing how hard it is or how hard I have worked. I dont know how to deal with her anymore she just shouts or demands things I cannot fullfill atleast as of now which gets me so much stress, fear and tears. How to deal with that?

Everything is going to be ok,"To anyone out there who struggles with stress, anxiety or just the constant bombardment of life’s obstacles, I’m here to tell you that everything is going to be ok.

As someone who has battled life’s stressors, as well as falling down to rock bottom several times, I can promise you that these hard moments you’re going through are only temporary. Nothing is permanent. Your pain and hardships are merely a fleeting moment through time that presents itself to define your future self. 

Remember that every difficult moment of your life has now become a distant memory that in some minor or major way, has shaped who you are today. Be proud of that. Embrace it. We all wear scars underneath our skin and we’re bound to be wounded again in the future. That’s just how life works.

Some people are lucky enough to just “coast” through life without having to deal with financial stress, heart aches or other bullshit that life throws. But I’ll tell you what. Some of the most interesting people I’ve ever met are those that have faced anxiety and stress. 
You are one of those interesting people. Never forget your worth.

Take each day as a stepping stone toward your goals. Don’t see a mountain as a giant hunk of rock to climb. See it as a bunch of little steps that may take a little while to reach the top. But you will eventually get there. It’s inevitable. And sure, some parts of the mountain will be harder to climb than others. Some days are going to suck. You’re going to want to cry and curl up in a ball because life’s too hard. And that’s 100% ok.

But remember, as long as you keep pushing forward, you will succeed. And baby steps are ok, in fact they are usually better than unpredictable long strides. If you have a bunch of shit you have to do today, or this week or this year try to aim to complete 1 important task per day. Make a list. Cross tasks off your list as you complete them. Make your bed every morning, that’ll automatically give you a headstart for the rest of your day. Get rid of negative, toxic people from your life. You don’t need that shit. All you need is you to get through life. 

Whoever you are, stay strong. You will get through this. Just breathe. And listen to Into the Black by Chromatics. Great music to calm down to. "

Social Media is stressing me out.,"I'm trying to find a way to use social media and not lose my mind. And it's going pretty well, I just want to type out my ways of media here on this post to relieve some stress. 

So I have this motive that Facebook can be used as the Headquarters for all platforms. And what I do is I just keep it as simple as possible. I will only use one platform a day. (Today is reddit) and I only use that platform to clear my head with thoughts. It turns out to be really beneficial to relieve stress.. I guess just talking to someone in general is a great way to feel good. And also to hear or see your own words for some reason helps me to relax about that thought. 

So I just go throughout my day using one app to talk / type to the camera. It's like truly sharing what's on your mind for once. I don't have to force content on the platforms. 

But what has me stressed now is where I should put all this content or if I should just keep it as simple as possible and just keep the Headquarters and keep alternating. You also have to keep track of all these passwords and just need to become familiar with so many different applications. Even though they are pretty similar, they just all have their different uses and advantages. 

I've tried to quit social media before and I loved it. I hate social media man. I don't want a smart phone. I wish I didn't need to do any of this. But it's hard to ignore the opportunities to grow on these platforms and use them as a tool for success. If you can be truly successful with social media/ marketing/ branding yourself, the sky is the limit and that's something I can't ignore. 

So i'm going to just try and keep it simple, alternate and just have a presence on each platform and just stay consistent with it. Give it a few weeks and we will see. 

But I've come to find things I like about social media as well. I enjoy making the videos. It really does help, especially when I haven't said much to anyone all day. It's like you always have someone to talk to with a smart phone. "
Worst Month. (longish),"I'd like to submit this March as my personal Worst Month Ever. I barely remember what the first half of the month was (thinking back now, I don't recall anything except my birthday. And having to work that day.) 

Later this month I went out of state (borrowing money from my mother) for a business competition. I want to start an animal rescue. I didn't get any of the templates or tabletop info until an hour until I had to get on a plane. I lost to a group that is selling potted plants. 

I have been struggling with finances recently, but was getting back on track. From this Wednesday until Saturday, someone had gotten ahold of my debit card info and started with small purchases. It escalated Saturday/Sunday to wipe out my whole paycheck. My bank didn't notify me at all, though a lot of the transactions happened outside the country. I currently have about $8 to my name from my savings, which has since been overdrawn. 

I have been looking for a new job, staying at this one because I have a good boss and because it pays above minimum wage. People effortlessly walk all over her, and though she gets mad about it, company policy as well as her personal precedence, has really tied her hands. I'm one of about three reliable people, and get saddled with the shifts no one bothers to show up to. A coworker gets three weeks off for a class, without asking. He just told her he'll be out those weeks, and it happened. What. 

As a side note, I am trying to move out. Been postponing it due to school. Had to talk to landlady because I won't be able to pay rent on time due to my money being in Germany. My hands and feet are dry. My legs are scratchy because I've forgotten to shave.

I feel myself heading towards the edge of..something. I had a breakdown/major depressive episode when I was 17, spending a whole summer watching x files, going to the doctor every week. I lost 20 pounds. One of the worst times of my life. I know a lot of my issues aren't immediately rectifiable, but that knowledge isn't stopping the stress. 
Any advice is appreciated. Thanks for the vent."
I'm trying to be calm,"I don't like being stressed. I really, really don't. When I get stressed, I get frustrated and annoyed by little things. They build up to the point where I have to shout at people because they're either not listening or bothering me when they shouldn't. Sometimes I feel that some people are doing things just to upset me and I don't know if it's just me over thinking things or if they're actually seeking out my frustrations to make themselves look better. 

I don't believe that I'm a ticking time bomb. I believe that my mind can only be pressed so far before I snap into what feels like the angry crabs from Mario Brothers VGA. I wish there was something to help me take my stress down, so that I didn't feel this way. I don't believe that any walk, tea or hot bath will calm me down. "
Finding the source of my stress,"In the last few days or maybe even weeks I have been very stressed.

I always have been a nail-biter but at the moment my nails are so far gone my fingers started to bleed and I even started biting the skin above my nails a little. I also seem to have developed some eczema on my hands.

The thing is I don't know exactly where my stress is coming from. Nothing really changed in the past few weeks. My wife and I had some things that caused stress, like a remodeling project in our home and when her grandmother died.

But those things are in the past now and I expected to feel better and less stressed, but somehow it seems worse now.

I haven't meditated in a long time, so I'm thinking about giving that a try. But I don't really know what else I should do. Is there an effective way to find out where the stress is coming from?

I even feel bad for being stressed, because from the outside it seems everything should be great. Good job, nice house, wife, cat and dog etc. On paper my life is pretty great.."
"Long term chronic stress - health issues, adrenals, HPA axis","Have been chronically stressed for a long long time. Now over the last year have lost alot of weight. Constantly tired, now have allergies, asthma and bad sleep apnea which I never really had. I am 23 and suffered trauma as a kid. I am a high achiever and very conscienscious. I believe my adrenals are very over run in the long term. Whenever I have prednisone for bad asthma flares my sleep, energy and well being sky rocket. I therefore want to heal my hpa axis. As I go in cycles of high stress being strung out and then crash and have nothing. I am going to see a doctor about this hypothesis. Ive been doing alot a research and want to look into supplementation of dhea and/or pregnenolone. I will only do so under doctor supervision but I highly doubt any doctor will take me seriously as I am so young. What are peoples thoughts? (I use cpap so therefore apnea is cured) "

Stressed and depressed.(long),"Hello everyone,
I would like to thank you in advance if you make it through this whole post and give me advice.


Let me start by saying I know I am incredibly blessed and fortunate with everything I have, but I am completely miserable. Let me explain my situation.


I am a 28 year old male living in the eastern United States. I am married, I have an 8 year old son from a previous relationship and my wife and I have a son due in July. I work as a merchandising manager for a well know and very successful retailer that has locations world wide. I make just a hair over $70k (salary) a year with no college degree. My wife works in the same industry, but she is an hourly employee and makes about $40k per year. We own a home, but the house is in her name only (We bought it before we got married) due to past financial difficulties for me that resulted in bankruptcy and losing my first home with my ex.


I make good money for never going to college and I have outstanding benefits, but I hate my job with a burning passion. I hate everything about retail... The hours, working with the general public and the fact that I feel unaccomplished because I basically work in a grocery store and I’m almost 30. Although I am a Manager and a leader I feel like in the grand scheme of life I’m not contributing to the world like I would like to. I hate having to throw away thousands of dollars worth of expired food every day. I hate dealing with employees who work a 4 hour shift stocking shelves or working a cash register and act like they have the hardest job in the world. I hate how retailers grossly under hire and expect their salaried employees to work 12+ hours a day 6 or 7 days a week to make up for it.


My work life balance is absolute zero. Here is an example of my typical day and week.
I am a merchandising Manager which means I work early in the morning to reset the store, restock the store and work in new merchandise. I am personally responsible for a staff of 4 in my department, but being a manager I have to authority to delegate to any employee below me in the building. My secondary responsibilities every day after the floor is set and the store is open are scheduling, making maps or planograms for new items expected to come in, making reports on shrink and destroys, employee reviews, employee discipline as necessary, talking with upset or angry customers, answering general phone calls, scheduling service or repair for anything in my department that is not working, ordering supplies, inventory of my department, planing and executing a weekly cleaning schedule for the department, building displays for new items, reading and answering company emails, walk the store with the GM and make notes for things to accomplish the next day, making benchmark reports, following up with employees not meeting benchmarks and generally helping to run the store (Cashier if the Front is busy, help customers load heavy items.. etc..). Due to budget cuts and staff reduction all managers usually work 6 days a week, however during a holiday week or if something else is going on (expecting executives to visit) we work 7 days a week. I wake up at 2am and I need to be at work by 3am. I will arrive with at least one other manager and we will look at what we are going to receive that particular day and come up with a plan for the store. Hourly employees start arriving at 4am and then myself and the other managers will delegate the days plan to the employees. We are typically very understaffed to be able to work in new items, recover the floor and excute the GM’s planned item moves for the day, so after we delegate the managers become stockers and work alongside the hourly employees to get done. I don’t mind physical labor and hard work, it’s actually my favorite part of my job, but it’s hard to run an operation as large as restocking and remerchandising a 200,000 sq ft facility while you are stuck stocking. The store opens at 9:30 am at which point I will try to start my administrative tasks, but just like in the morning the building is usually understaffed so it’s more common than not for me to be either cashiering for several hours, or helping out in the deli and/or bakery. Some days I’m lucky enough to get a lot of time in the office to complete my daily tasks, but most days I do not. This is exhausting and draining because while I’m getting literally screamed at about an email not being answered immediately, I am also getting screamed at about why the bakery is low on product even though I'm not the bakery manager and I’m just trying to help us run smoothly. The expectations of my boss and my company as a whole are ridiculous. I am one person and I can only accomplish one task at a time. I can’t write a schedule while I’m expected to be baking cakes for hours after we open. I also need to mention the fact that as a salaried employee we do not get breaks. If you want to eat something you better do it while you’re working and pray you don’t get called to help somewhere because you need to respond immediately. Working over 12 hours without getting 15 minutes guaranteed to eat something really sucks.


I leave work most days at 2:45pm (salary) because I pick up my son from school at 3:15. Usually when I am checking out with my GM for the day it turns into an argument about how I’m not allowed to leave because I haven’t gotten a single administrative task done that day or I have answered all my emails ( yeah because I’ve been on a cash register for the last 5 hours straight.), but I need to get my kid so I leave. If my wife has off and can get my son from school I usually don’t get out of work until 5pm give or take an hour depending on how much I need to get done that particular day. On the days when I get my son I leave work and usually need to speed to get to the school on time because the 5 minute arguement about me leaving has made me late. I pick him up and take him home. My wife actually closes on the days that she works so on days when I get my son I have zero help. When we get home I’ll grab him a quick snack and then we take the dog for a walk. After we get back from walking the dog I will start making dinner ( I absolutely love cooking and I enjoy making a real homemade meal, even though I’m exhausted at this point and it’s draining). While I’m cooking my son will usually start homework. After we eat dinner I will check his homework and I will have him help me clean. Time to take the dog for another walk and then my son will get a shower or bath depending on his mood that day. After his shower we usually have about 45 minutes to finally relax and we will watch a show or draw together or play. His mother comes to pick him up when she is done work.
It is now about 7:30pm and I have been up since 2am and I need to be back up for work in 6.5 hours. Remember how I argued with my boss earlier about leaving before everything was done, well it still needs to get done. I will work from home making reports, doing schedules, sending emails and making maps. Usually getting everything done takes me until about the time my wife gets home (a little before 10pm). When she come she comes home I usually say hello, give her a kiss and pass out because now I need to be up to do this all over again in 4 hours. Twice a week when my wife is off this routine is a little easier. She picks up my son, so I stay at work until about 5pm getting everything done. She will make dinner on her days off so on these days I get to come home, eat, help my son with homework and then go right to bed when his mother picks him up.


Since I work retail weekends are an absolute must to work. I have my son every other weekend so on the weekends I have him I barely actually have him. Since my wife and I both work I will leave him with his mother and pick him up when I get home usually on the weekend around 4-5pm. My wife gets home around 7pm on the weekends and I’m usually asleep on the couch by 8. My wife drops him back off to his mom the next morning on her way to work and repeat. On my weekends without him I usually come home and pass out trying to make up for getting 4 hours of sleep a night since my last weekend without him. I feel terrible because we never do anything fun. We never go to the zoo or go to the movies because it’s usually too late and I’m too drained by the time I pick him up.
Needless to say this lifestyle is absolutely killing me. I am miserable. I have zero friends, I see my wife a few hours a week because of our opposite schedules and I’m drained. Getting 4 hours of sleep a night is becoming ridiculous. I have zero life. I have no hobbies because I have no time. I have gone stretches of 30 days+ without a day off and if you look at what I make compared to the hours I put in then I’m barely making minimum wage. I feel like I lost who I am and I can’t sustain this lifestyle. The turnover for managers is huge because of the work life balance and it’s not like the company is trying to hide it. They are very upfront about the fact that when you accept a management position your job becomes your life. I have been a manager for 7 years and I just can’t take it anymore.


My dream is to get a job outside of retail, but I have no idea how to achieve this dream for several reasons.

I don’t have a degree and I have absolutely zero time to persue one. Even if I took classes for something online I am only getting 4 hours a night of sleep to begin with.

Child support. I pay my ex a little over $900 a month in support and that’s after my lawyer got it lowered from $1100 a month. The way my state works I can’t take a job with a lower salary to start fresh somewhere else because I would still be required to pay the same amount. In my states eyes if you can make that much before than you can make it after. I’ve talked to a few lawyer and there’s is no way around this without my ex agreeing to take less (Haha yeah right.).

The house. Unfortunately (and fortunately) our town has kind of turned into the place to be. Lots of new restaurants and shops has made the area desirable. Our property taxes have nearly doubled since we bought the house 3 years ago and we are barely getting by.

The new baby. Although we are both very excited we have no idea what we are going to do when the baby is born. We are already struggling financially as it is and now we need to pay for infant daycare which costs $830 a month and that’s the cheapest we have found. We have nowhere near that. Not to mention the fact that we both work weekends and daycares are not open on weekends. We have no family within 50 miles that can help us out with the baby on the weekend and my ex definitely wouldn’t help us even if we paid her. We honestly have no clue what to do about this.


So what would you do if you were in my shoes. The obvious answer is suck it up, but ive been sucking it up for years. I quite literally hate my life right now.  I’ve been on depression medication for a year now and the stress is killing me. How can I get through this."
Stress and cortisol levels?,"My tolerance to stress has always been fairly low, and over the years this threshold has dwindled to practically nothing. I currently get anxious over the simplest of tasks, and was wondering if this can be directly correlated to levels of cortisol (or some other hormone) and if so, what kind of doctor could have it measured for me? Thanks in advance."
Feeling super gulity staying at home..,"Hello everyone, recently my mom was diagnosed with cancer, and I've been calling in sick a few times to take care of her at home. Only problem is that I feel extremely guility whenever I have to miss school. Since I was planning to keep my mom's diagnosis private, I haven't spoken to any of my teachers about my recent absences. But I can't shake off the feeling that they see me as lazy/unresponsible for missing class. "
Stress Boiling Over to Family,"I have dealt with a great deal over the last few years, including PTSD and survivors guilt that went undiagnosed and was mistaken for bipolar disorder. It negatively affected my life and family for some time, but after conquering it and getting on track, stress took over. I can't seem to find a coping mechanism, and this morning I broke down, screamed at my wife to leave me alone, and created a horrible situation for everyone. It spooked me. I'm not sure what to do or how to keep myself sane and keep my family happy and content."
"I just realized that I believe that if I'm not constantly under a lot of pressure, I won't perform well.","In pretty much every aspect of my life.  It doesn't matter what I'm doing, I always find a way to psyche myself out.  It's pretty exhausting and I want to stop.  I feel like in a way, I have an addiction to it.  "
"Feeling emotionally fine, but my throat hurts the same way it does when I get upset or angery.","Seems to get better after doing relaxing things like cleaning or showering. Any advice on how to be more relaxed while working though? (preferably things that dont take alot of time)


Or is there any chance that this is from starting to take a liquid iron supplement recently? I'm also sitting a lot at my desk while working on my computer, writing or drawing, so maybe posture playes a role...? "
Super stress finals week. I just want to go home.,"I have finals week. Finished 1 on Saturday, three more. One today, one tomorrow, one Wednesday. I'm so stressed. My parents just called and they said my dog fainted while running. He's a very hyper 12 year old pug and I love him so much. He fainted for his first time while eating. 
I'm going home Wednesday after my last exam. I'm really worried about him and I just don't want to deal with these exams. 
I also applied for transfer. I only have one more chance of getting into mechanical engineering at my school and so I applied to threw colleges as a plan b. I just received an email saying the the city college (best chance) just withdrawn my application because I didn't complete one course. I don't know if I can get into the other two since they are top ranked UC and I don't know if I can get into mechanical at the college I'm currently in.

"I don't know if I can keep this up, I'm way too stressed out.","I'm not sure on what to do anymore, I'm in college studying computer science and I'm struggling a lot that I'm considering dropping out. I'm already going to graduate late and I don't know if I'll be passing the current classes I'm taking.

I just can't take the work load anymore and I'm just so afraid of failing and getting more and more held back to the point where I feel like I'll be kicked out. 

I'm trying so hard to study everything and trying to ask my teachers for help but they are no use and there's no tutoring support at my school for the courses I'm taking so I'm on my own. 

I just don't know what to do and I really hate what I'm doing now, it's killed my passion for computers and I just don't like anything anymore. College has literally killed most of my passions because every turn I've been put down and I don't know what I'm good at anymore.

What do I do now?"
I'm stressed.,"I've been tossed aside like a piece of meat. My girlfriend left me because I can't fuck her IRL. She's in America and I'm in Kenya. I would have been patient with her because there's no one else like her anywhere. People are very lame. Yet I lost a diamond.

I don't know how long it will take before I find someone like her or even better. We kind of shared the same taste in music. That is what brought us together. It was magical...

Now I'm stuck with losers who I don't want to date. I'd rather fap to death than hang with some people.

The world around me is really lame but I'm going to change it myself. I know there is someone out there. I know it.

I hope all of you are having a good day...

I need to play some Need For Speed now."

Eating my stress away,"I binge eated today the whole day because I feel really stressed, scared and I'm trying not to forget all those things.  
And now I feel really disgusting 😭😔"
Stressed about high school,I cant seem to find motivation to do any school work. I lost my motivation after February vaca. And now im 2 weeks behind in school. I have so much pressure put on me to do good in school and get into college and its just so much on me. What do I do. (SAT's next week:( )
Am I being unreasonable?,"Hi,

I'm a 25-year-old student in a vocational school for special needs people. I study office work and accounting.

I started in autumn 2016, hopeful that I would finally be able to complete something in my life. But all this school has done for me so far has been stressing me out with mundane, repetitive tasks. For a full year now, I've been the only one responsible for the accounting of our student organization and that's pretty much the only thing I do at school. My teacher keeps saying I'm the only one in our group capable of handling it. 

I'm both bored and overloaded at the same time. After school I'm too tired to do anything fun. Whenever I tell my teacher about this, he tells me to just wait. Sometimes I think about giving up, but I wouldn't be able to live with the guilt of leaving yet another school."
does stress keep you up at night yet keep you constantly exhausted?,"For a while now, I have been getting very little sleep. Maybe an hour or two at the most every night. I’m exhausted throughout the day despite being at work surrounded by very enthusiastic people 6 days a week. Yet when i get home and I’m alone, I can’t sleep even though i am so tired. My worries and my stress is constantly nagging me. It’s impossible for me to sleep anymore. I find myself shaking throughout the day and at night I can’t lay still for more than 10 seconds."
I'm burning out,"I just can't deal with anything anymore. Currently a high school senior, and it feels like the past decade of work I've put into academia has just been unavailingly futile. Got rejected by Caltech yesterday. Probably means four more rejections over the next few weeks. Research paper for an internship due in five days that I haven't started on. Two tests tomorrow that I haven't bothered reviewing for. Instead I'm on reddit complaining about this. How petty can I be?"
"Grandma's Funeral, Aunty's Funeral, Family Fighting, sibling moved because of the fighting, grades dropping, work piling up, Anxiety Attacks, self-doubt growing help me please","It's the last straw for me i've been suffering through this immense fear and stress due to me not being able to do anything right the reason why my family fights and why I couldn't do anything to keep my sibling from moving out the house, not on my families terms causing more anger from my parents that they love releasing on me or each other. Gosh I have so much goddamn work I don't know what to do I keep messing up I think I do grade A studying but I don't get the grade I want cause i'm a stupid person who can't mess up along the way gosh why am I like that I feel like other people succeed and don't even try and here I am dealing with the whole burden of my family, my work, and the fact that I can't do anything cause I'm such a stupid person gosh I don't know what to do these anxiety attacks are preventing me from doing anything and I'm messing up more please help me 

Gosh, am I really who I think I am? I can't even get my driving license cause my parents won't let me as they think I'm not ready yet and so much yelling and them rubbing it in my face that I can't get it yet and everyone has gotten it. I could be doing something about my life but instead, I'm stuck at home where they don't wanna drive me even to school gosh I just the feeling of finally getting it won't even be nice as I have so much crap associated with it so many people around me so happy about geting it and getting great grades when they don't even remember half of the things they learn gosh I work so hard but I mess up on one thing and then that totally ruins me I just oh my gosh why am I like this I can't do anything right withought messing up "
"Just Plain Out, Stressed Out!","So, here I am. I feel like I am on the verge of cracking up. My family and I are under a great amount of stress. It first started out with my wife's relationship with her parents. You see, we live just back through the woods, behind her parents' home. When we bought the house six years ago, I never thought of that as being a problem. In fact, it really hasn't been much of a problem for me, but it has been more of an issue for my wife. 

The biggest issue I've had is that if something breaks or needs attention to on the house, instead of allowing me, the man of the house, to find some time to get things done, my wife calls her dad. Now, I don't mind whatsoever if her dad helps me out with the house. In fact, I do often call upon his help for things that I either don't know how to do, or don't have the tools to do them. But, often, I'm kind of an afterthought when it comes to being the master of my domain. 

Anyway, that's not the point of this post. The point is, my wife is often going toe to toe with her mom, because of our son. He was born three years ago, premature. He was born with heart failure and needed open heart surgery to survive - which he did of course. But during the four months that our son was in the hospital, and even afterward, my mother-in-law got so attached to taking care of our son, that in her mind, she felt like she was raising him along with us. So, my wife and her mom tends to butt heads often when it comes to parenting techniques. Because of this, my wife and her parents have all had to go to counseling. 

So, part of my stress has come from the relationship my wife has had with her mother. I often come home to hear them going at it with each other on the phone. Last Father's Day - the day that should be ""MY"" day, they started arguing about something that I had no idea what they were arguing about, and then my wife snapped at me and we didn't talk for the rest of the day. Pretty much ruined my Father's Day. Now, it's not all bad with her mom. They do get along as well, but just the way they communicate, especially in front of our son, often stresses me out and gives me a great deal of anxiety.

The biggest point of my stress has come from our finances. Ever since we've gotten married, we have struggled. Money issues is a huge thing to me. Some people are OK as long as they are left with $10 in the account at the end of the month. That stresses me out. We're often living without a net under us, and every year for the past three or four years, my wife has been in the hospital or emergency room. Either because she got really sick, kidney stones, gallbladder, or something. Not blaming any of that stuff on her, but we never, ever seem to get ourselves to a point where we can start putting money back for emergencies, and that stresses me out a lot!

So this year, part of the ""healing"" between my wife and her family is for us to move away from each other. Not too far away, just to get out of the same neighborhood. We need our space, her parents need theirs. I'm not against that, and in fact, selling our home (since we have built up a good amount of equity), would help us to wipe out all of our debt and re-start with a clean slate. And that would really help my stress out!

But, right now, I'm stressing over finding money to get our house up to show ready and in the meantime, our dog has gotten sick and we've had to take her to the vet, yesterday. She's in a lot pain (yeast infection in box ears, an infection on her foot), and that has stressed me out. We've had issues trying to train our son to sleep in his own bed by himself at night - another stressor. And back to finances, we have a lot of medical bills and credit card bills, and my wife keeps talking about wanting to send our son to private school when he's ready to go to school.

All of it seems to be crashing down on me, and I feel like I need to unplug and take a time out. I always equate this to some sports analogy. The flow of the game is not the flow I'm wanting us to have, so I feel like we need to take a time out and regroup. Also doesn't help that our weather has been nasty the last few weeks. Cold, raining, dreary. I don't do well in weather like that. I have been in such a bad mood lately that I can't even stand myself. I don't sleep well. Our doggy hasn't slept well in the last week. My wife doesn't sleep well. My son doesn't sleep well! I need a vacation but can't afford it! LOL!

I think this was, if anything, a rant thread. So, I apology for taking up anybody's time, I just needed an outlet!

Working three jobs and slowly losing my mind,"At the moment, I am working three jobs and slowly but surely it is getting to be too much for me.

I am a Salesforce Administrator at a university by day, then work as an actor in the evenings at a professional theatre, and also work as the Business Manager at a different theatre company. I love each of these jobs in their own ways and consider all of them to be great opportunities for my professional development. The SFDC admin job is a great career opportunity and pays the bills. Acting is my passion and what I really want to be doing in life, but work is sporadic and sometimes doesn't pay well. I am getting my MBA right now too (but on a break because I'm working on a show) so that  is why I am passionate about being a Business Manager. Unfortunately, the Business Manager gig doesn't pay but it is great experience.

On top of the stress I feel because of the amount of work I'm doing, I also have a commute that is at least 30-45 minutes one way in heavy traffic. Furthermore, I hate the company I work for full-time but by working there I get my MBA for free. 

Needless to say there is a lot going on in my life right now and I don't really want to quit any of it. However, I am realizing that this is not sustainable and something has to give. I calculated it the other day and I am working around 80 hours a week at least.

I would greatly appreciate advice on how to release stress and also advice on how to do everything I want to and still maintain my sanity.

TL;DR: I have too many jobs but am passionate about all of them. How do I deal with the large amount of stress and/or figure out how to manage all of this."
Hopefully this helps a few people! I've been very stressed out/anxious over the past 2-3 months and I tried something that worked.,"I read somewhere about eating a few balls of black peppercorn to fight stress and tried it out yesterday for the first time. Within about 20 minutes I started feeling pretty calm, then 2 hours I was like damn I feel pretty good and relaxed this is great, and by the end of the night I felt like I could accomplish anything. I was motivated, working on a ton of things I had to do around the house, playing with dog, and staying busy. Felt the best I had in a long time. I ate a few more today and I'm on top of the world again. I hope it helps at least a few of ya'll! Cheers"
"Money and stress, ways to reduce financial worry.","Finances and mental health
If you’ve ever experienced money trouble, you know how heavy it can hang on your mental health.  I’ve been so broke I was only able to put $2 in my beater of a car.  I’ve had to turn eat shitty, limited choices of food because I couldn’t afford anything else.  It sucks, and I’ve vowed never to return to that spot.  

Being in debt, not being able to do any fun things, constantly worrying about money takes a toll on your mental health.  It’s a huge weight.  



Since I’ve gotten interested in money and actively worked to get my finances in order, start saving and investing, and improving my financial literacy through reading, studying and staying up to date with the financial world.  I’ve found I am much happier and healthier in all regards.



How can you get smart with money and get your finances in order, to remove the mental strain of a bad money situation?  Here are a few strategies and tricks that have helped me.

Nursing school stress Help?,"After being in college for the past two years with class for only a couple of hours each day, I just started nursing school this semester and am in class from 8-4pm every day with tons of studying and homework afterwards. I am exhausted all the time and am consistently thinking about class and homework. What can I do to help relieve my stress, or at least to not think about school all the time? "
Senior Stress,"Hey guys, I hope you don't mind my mini rant.  My high school has a hall of fame that celebrates students for their acadmeic achievements. In order to be considered for the wall, students have to meet a 90 point requirement based on their GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and the amount of AP classes taken (a higher GPA and standardized test scores = more points). 

I'm under the point requirement, and I feel extremely guilty about it. I'm absolutely garbage when it comes to taking standardized tests, and I'm regretting not studying harder for it. Most of my friends have already met the point requirement for it, and I feel like the outlier of the group. They're amazing people, but I can't shake off the fear that they'll be disappointed and even look down on me for not having a high enough GPA.

Stress doesn't mean workload,
Stress from full work weeks; how to manage properly,"Hey there, this is partially a rant but mostly I would want to know how to deal with this stress with my full work week.

So I basically have a lot of things going on for me right now. I have to take care of my family and my chronically sick sister. They are pretty much counting on me. My boyfriend just recently moved in with me and is trying to figure out how to pay rent in expensive San Francisco (currently unemployed but doing small side jobs on the side while looking for a job). 

In order to take care of these issues, I have to get up around 6AM everyday to get to a government job that last about 8AM-4PM every weekday. Then afterwards I have a self employed job in order to make the extra needed to help my family get out of their debts and make ends meet. So usually this means 5:30-9PM I am at my other office doing work. Approx 10PM-11PM I get home and sleep within the hour. 

I literally take 1hr to drive to my government work, 1hr to get to my after-work work office, and at least another 25-30min to get back home (in a triangular fashion in this traffic laden place). I get home and barely get to see my boyfriend before I pass out.

Weekends I tend to have to go 40 minutes away to my father's house to take care of him, and I try to do my socializing and studying (to get ahead in life) during this time. 

This obviously makes it very hectic and difficult to have to do everyday. Sometimes I get overwhelmed despite as much energy and enthusiasm I am trying to put into this. I do get headaches and fatigue a lot going through the weeks like this, and I notice some white hair too. I think it might be affecting my health =/

So my question is, whats the best way to handle stress during the day? Whats the best way to make use of the limited time I have before sleep so I can have the best sleep possible? Also waking up is a huge issue for me because I am not looking forward to another day like the others being so exhaustive, whats a good method to keep it up?

**TLDR:** 
Schedule has 2.5hrs of driving time everyday
6AM get up
8AM-4PM Work
5:30/6-9PM Self Employed work
10/11PM - Sleep
Weekends: Help family and study.

What are good ways to manage stress so I can deal with day to day challenges better without feeling overwhelmed? Its health affecting."
Coping with stress eating?,"I'm currently in a highly demanding and stressful college program and I've started to cope by emotional eating. Any advice to try and manage this behaviour? It's getting to the point where I eat so much and so frequently that I'm getting sick, but I can't seem to control myself. "
Work environment stress,"So hi. I’m a new ish mechanic in the field. I know some but not all of my job obviously. I’m the green horn. At my job, we have few employees. It’s actually only about 4-5 mechanics, a shop boss and a couple others. For the most part the job is good. 

Good pay, good training opportunities, good foot in the door. There’s just one problem. One of the most experienced mechanics on the floor, is the grizzled vet type who doesn’t sugar coat things and makes me feel pretty worthless and dumb if I approach them for guidance. 

The stress or anxiety of even thinking about approaching this man is to a level where my  stomach physically churns. (This is not an over exaggeration). Each day I dread more and more, going in to work. I’ve never had to deal with this kind of environment, stress, or person before. The kind of being that can instantly make you your stomach turn to knots. I just don’t get it. I’m miserable. I’m miserable in a job I thought I loved. 

Help me. Please. "
How do you prioritize when . . .,"I know you're supposed to ""prioritize"" things, but how in the world do you ""prioritize"" when every.single.thing seems like it's a priority??

I have multiple health conditions.  I have a child with autism.  I have a messy house.  We're paying back debt and I work from home in order to do it.  I attend church and a ladies' church group partly to fulfill my spiritual needs and my social needs.  But everything seems like it's coming down on my head and underneath it all is the fear that things will never, ever get any better."
"Stressing out, need to rant.","So, it just hit me that I am taking the NCLEX in less than a month and I don't feel prepared at all. Everyone keeps telling me that I will do great and I shouldn't worry but them telling me that makes me stress out more. I don't know how to deal with failure. I'm afraid of letting everyone down. I know I should focus on myself and block everyone else out but I just can't. I keep telling everyone not to tell me that everything will be ok because they don't know that. But they just shrug my comment off. I don't know what to do anymore because I'm trying to study as much as I can but I don't feel like I'm retaining anything. I just feel like giving up right now and hiding under a huge rock. 

Ok. I'm done. Thanks for reading. "
After Anxeity my life has been worse,A
AP Classes,"So right now I’m in my junior year. I recently met with my counselor and she put me on for five AP classes to which I reluctantly accepted. Now I’m have even more second thoughts about that decision, because during my senior year, I really want to focus on my private pilot’s license.

So should I stress myself out next year, hopefully finding a way to cope with it or go for honors classes (which are below AP classes) instead?"
Procrastinating = worse time of my life,"I have procrastinated on all of the assignments for IB: tok essay, ee, history ia, math ia, 11 artworks, etc. 
Now all of this is due in the next week, and I haven't started anything. I think it just stems from the due date not being set. I have no fucking clue when it really needs to be turned into IB. I have no clue what's due and when it's due. I fucking hate it. I have so much pressure on me now due to my actions. I think after this week, I'll look more into how not to do this shit again. This is too much to do in a week. My heart is already weak and this just stresses me out too much. "
Orientation day at University and already feeling like shit,"I had to take this English test at orientation day which was 30 minutes and tested you on basic English skills. I guess I did poorly in it since I'm being called back for a 2 hour test. I know I'm not that proficient at English but I feel horrible that I might be really weak at it now. I am an immigrant but I moved here when I was 5 and I've been fine with English ever since. I hate that if I do poorly in this test and am required to do a special course, I'll feel super stupid. There's no way you can revise for the test either. I just want to cry."
A Stressed Student Rant,"So, lately in school (I'm home schooled btw) Things have been really hard. I've been getting hit with projects and essays left and right and my school system I'm taking has set dates and I'm just getting so behind... I act cool around my mom because she has enough to deal with, with my brother but i'm really starting to struggle and I'm starting to sacrifice quality for quantity. I can do each assignment 2 times, but on tests and quizzes i only have one attempt and they are really big portions of my grade. I'm a straight A student with really high A - A+ usual grades when i'm in a good place which makes it even harder for me to do things quickly because I want to do well and if I tell my mom I got a bad grade she'll want me to redo it which would suck up even more time! She's an only parent, my dad left a long time ago, and I have an older brother who goofs off in his studies half the time. I have been caught up in 4 of my easy classes, but the other 2 are my hardest classes which are Language Arts (Large Essay) and Life Science (A Graph Project) I'm getting really stressed and soon i'll have to go to my grandma for her 80th birthday the first to second week of March and I won't be able to do school work over there and It is almost manditory that I get a week or two ahead in my school work for that period of time. I'm really stressed and I don't want my mother to not trust me with my school because I lied saying I was only 2 days behind when I'm now 10 days behind in bother things, bring my daily workload to 33 - 42 assighnments in about 8:30 to 6:50 time wise... 

I'm really lost... I'm 13 and I know that I should consult someone but because I'm home schooled I have no friends. I have no one that would help me, and because my mom always tells everyone in my family how good of a student I am and because of how high my grades are I can't look to them, they all think I'm the smart little cracker that has no cares in the world. I play piano to try to calm myself and it helps me to forget it, but only for about 20-30 minutes...

I've created mental lists of the subject I need to work on but I always get sucked into my little lair of anxiety of what will happen if I let another day go by. Time passes so quick, I hate it, I hate it so much I feel like I'm being timed always. 

I don't know if this is where I should post this, but I just had to vent this off my chest so I could try to sleep... Good night..."
Stressed about job,"Im new here to this subreddit. Currently working as an engineer. 1st 3 months was pretty enjoying as I am learning stuff and working at my own pace and I could see my own growth. But as when the 4th month starts, I am directly involved in a project where I am in charge of a significant part. Dealing with my team leader is super stressful as I am slow in learning things and I tend to take more time to understand and pick up stuff because he is impatient.  I lost alot of weight last month and was really exhausted mentally and physically. As of now, I am still stressed when he comes around as if more troubles is coming to me. I am also stressed on myself due to not being competent enough to fit in the team as my team consists of excellent engineers and I am the only newbie there .How should I relieve myself from all these stress?"
Stress relief from taking Confianza,"Hey everyone! I’m a 21yo female that has been suffering from GAD and depression since I was 9. Recently, I have been under a lot of stress with school, which has caused me to lose focus on keeping my body healthy. I stopped eating healthy and working out because I just didn’t feel like I had the time or motivation.  I felt like I was losing control over everything. One of my close friends recommended that I try Confianza (an herbal supplement that helps with stress relief).  Ever since I started taking it, I’ve noticed a huge difference!! I finally feel like I’m not running in circles with no end in sight. I’m also back to eating healthy and working out regularly. Seriously, if you feel like you have run out of options, shoot me a message and I can try to help!! "

"I'm new here, and I admit that this is a vent.","I have a long list of chronic stressors, and there are days I get discouraged to the point where I don't think things will ever get better.  I keep a running list called ""the plate"" (as in, too much on my . . .) and it's a page and a half long.  

I have a number of chronic health issues (before you ask, yes, I have been to doctors):  back pain, possible adrenal fatigue, a skin rash that doctors can't figure out, a chronically painful bladder, TMJ, sleep apnea (for which I use a CPAP), and I'm sure I'm leaving out something.  Mentally, I deal with depression and OCD (and I take my meds faithfully and am in therapy for it.)  

My mother died of dementia in early November.  (My dad died back in 1993 of ALS.)

My husband and I have one child who just turned 19.  He has high-functioning autism.  Although he can take care of himself pretty well, he'll never be able to live without some sort of supervision.  Dealing with his issues day in, day out can be very frustrating at times.  

Past events, such as bullying and being part of an unhealthy church in college, affect me as well (part of the reason I'm in counseling).  

We are also dealing with financial problems.  I went back to school several years ago hoping to get training for a job that would earn enough money to keep my son from having to rely on a safety net that may or may not be there for him when he needs it.  That backfired and I was not able to finish school.  I'm paying back student loans now by at-home proofreading.  It's going to take a number of years to do it.  We're also paying down credit card debt as well, and in the last two months, we've been hit with two unexpected expenses (repairs on our crawlspace and a new washer).  My husband's working a bunch of overtime to earn the money to pay for it.  

There's also the day-to-day stuff of running the house that gets to me.  We have a mess at the moment in my house.

Perhaps some of you can relate.

Can stress cause sickness?,"I have a lot of stress on me. Sometimes it feels like more than I can handle. Money is very limited, which has negatively affected my marriage. I'm a teacher, but I'm the only one brining in money while my spouse tries to get a business up and running. Sometimes the stress is so much I get sick to my stomach and I always have headaches. Has this happened to anyone else? I can't afford to go to counseling to help cope with it or help my marriage. It's just so overwhelming sometimes.

Anyone else sick from stress? What did you do when counseling wasn't an option and the thing that will fix it is out of your control?"

How to cope with stress that is 24/7?,"I am a college student trying to transfer to a top notch university with the most competitive program in my field and I cannot stop worrying about it (I have been for months). Not only do I need to finish my application essays but also have to make perfect grades in all my classes and then find out in June if I got accepted or declined. No matter what I feel so much anxiety in my bones. I workout, do yoga, have chill time, and eat right, but nothing will get rid of this constant anxious feeling. It’s exhausting.

Life goes up and down too quick for me,"I think I bring this stress upon myself by overthinking but anyway this is what has happened and is happening. I just need a place to vent.

Firstly, In 2017 I lost one of my best friends, they didn't pass away, they're just no longer apart my life. Moving on from her has been really difficult but I think it's for the best. I still miss her from time to time but it isn't as excruciating as it used to be. 

Secondly, I'm working on getting my passport renewed for a trip that I'm going on soon and it's in the state now where if the passport doesn't arrive on time, I won't be able to go on that trip.

Thirdly, I went snowboarding and fell pretty badly and haven't been able to walk properly for a few days now. I called in work to make sure they knew I won't be able to come but I still got a call today to come in for a shift that isn't on my contract but I had agreed to sign it on my contract, just hadn't gotten around to because I haven't got to talk to my manager. I really do want that shift because it's perfect for me I just hope it's not taken because of this one day. Also, in my report for work I haven't accepted many shifts and it's a 2/5 rating. This is because of having to look after my little sister while my parents are at work. I get scared every time that I'll get fired because of not accepting other shifts, I feel so bad, but I genuinely can't. 

Fourthly, my stress is for university. It's my first year this year and it starts in 2 weeks. I haven't had any help from anyone sorting anything out for university, I've had to take care of it all on my own which has been a pain because I don't know what I'm doing. Anyway I have an appointment at the university tomorrow to help me sort things out and I hope I can make it as I can barely walk. 

Lastly, their is nothing more in the world I want than my drivers license. It would make my life so much easier, but my dad never does and I fear that I am a horrible driver even though I've had a fair amount of practice. 

The entirety of 2017 was like this for me and I just felt like I could never catch a break, I feel like I still can't even though I'm in my summer holidays.

How do I stop ?,I have really bad social anxiety and just stress caused by existing. My problem is the way I coop with all of this is eating even when I'm not hungry I've been dealing with this on and off similar to my depression for years. I drink a lot of water in between meals even tea but I still eat to comfort myself. I've tried weighted blankets and going to a psychologist. Sometimes I can get a handle on it but it's not a self image problem. I have to be a certain weight for work because I'm military. I'm also vegan I eat plenty of veggies but too many carbs. The longest I've kept my weight down was a month with out someone constantly looming over me.
I’m constantly stressed about money even though I’m debt free,"I’ve had a normal upbringing, my parents were firmly middle class and saved up a lot. But they came from poor families. So they expect me to be as wealthy as they are (and more). 
I don’t have any debt which is great, and I’d like to get a mortgage soon as well, but I keep worrying about money. My partner has unsteady income which stresses me out on his behalf. I have a steady job, don’t make a fortune but it’s safe and have career prospects. 

I read somewhere that most milenials are worried about money. That doesn’t surprise me. Anyone else out there feel the same? "
Just needing a place to vent,"My 2017 was just a pile of crap. I had multiple family members die, our dog got hit by a car, I got investigated at a job and fired because someone made up rumors about me, got fired from a second job for no reason, and finally got into sales on strictly commission. Then there was a hurricane. We lost our home, so all of our stuff is in storage and we are living in a bedroom with family. Sales started good and now it’s dead. 

We have nothing. We have negative hundreds of dollars in our bank account because of auto-pay bills with $15 cash to our name and I won’t get paid again next week. I don’t know what else to do. I’ve looked for other jobs, but nothing matches my previous salary that we built our bills around. Our credit is bad and relatively new, so we can’t refinance cars right now or skip payments and we can’t get loans because my partner doesn’t make enough and I haven’t been at this job long enough. I don’t know what to do. I can’t get a second job because I work nearly 52 hours a week. My partner works full time and uses the downtime to do the laundry for me and run the other errands I can’t during the day. I’m just at an impass. Our family members don’t have money for us to borrow. We have no credit cards.

I just feel like everything is spiraling down and I can’t control any of it. I was hoping 2018 would be better, but so far it isn’t.

Anyway, if you’ve stuck with me this long, thanks for listening. I hate to burden my family with this kind of stuff because I feel guilty. I know there are are people who have absolutely nothing. I have clothes on my back and a roof over my head, but I’m still worried because I don’t have gas money to get to work or buy groceries. It’s just a very helpless feeling.

Thanks again to anyone who is reading this. I appreciate you. "

Quitting Smoking Weed After 7 Years Of Daily Use,"Hello all, last week I got very sick to where I didnt feel like smoking and so I didnt, my main and sole focus was to just feel better as i felt very very ill. I tried smoking two times during the week i was sick but both times i just felt worse. i feel like my vision is constantly off centered. i am dealing with alot of anxiety and i try and calm myself my saying everything is going to be ok. but when i buy into the fact that im getting dizzy i start to go into a panic (heart racing, shaking, short of breath) Im just wondering if anyone else who quit cold turkey has dealt with anything similar, or anyones personal experience. Nothing is triggering me to panic other than the fact that i start to feel like something is not right. Can anyone relate? "
"Things that cause panic in someone which correspond with P, A, N, I and C","Can anyone at all think of anything that might panic you (Big or small) that begins with the above letters?

I'm attempting to make a short film about panic attacks/anxiety for university and want to show that its not just the obvious things that might affect people.

I'm thinking of stressful everyday situations that might cause people to just go ""Oh crap"".

So far I have:

P - When your pasta boils over the rim of the Pan A - When your alarm clock goes off sooner than expected N - Not having enough money to buy things in the shop I - Not knowing the answer to a question in a test (this is the one I'm struggling with the most) C - Crossing the road when a car is a bit to close.

ANYTHING would be a massive help. It doesn't necessarily have to be exact because I know mine are a bit vague, it just has to correspond."

Can Stress Cause Nausea and Loss of Appetite?,"I've been going through a really stressful time with my relationship currently. I live with my girlfriend and am honestly scared to tell her that I haven't been in love with her for two months now. The reason I'm stressed is because she owns the house and I'm worried that if I end it she'll kick me out and I will have no place to go. I know that's most likely going to happen, but the thought of her kicking me out and making me straight up take all my stuff with me right then and there (I don't have a car) or kicking me out and destroying all my stuff (which she's destroyed my clothes and thrown stuff at me during arguments before) is scaring me."
I have finals tomorrow. It's 1am and I'm too worried to sleep,All I can do is think about how bad finals are going to be. I hate it so much. I'm going to be so tired. I'm going to fail. My grades are so low I have to do great to keep them above passing. And the girl I loved is gone from my life too which makes me feel worse since I can't vent my feelings to her rip. why am I like this? What's wrong with me? Why do I get so stressed and anxious I can't focus and bomb everything 
"In the final semester of my degree, starting to doubt if I chose the right field for me","Stressed so bad I could vomit, what even is sleep anymore?

Internship like a full time job, lost my only parent at the end of last semester and had to take 2 incompletes in other classes, working on the weekends to feed myself so I never get a day off, honors project and a student award that require me to travel and present at conferences (when the fuck am I supposed to have the time to go with all of this piled on me now?), handling the estate of the deceased parent I mentioned earlier, and the list goes on and on.

My heart isn’t in this anymore. Me 3 months ago could have probably handled all of this, me now wants to fall apart at the thought. It’s hard to set your sights on graduation when you’re trying to keep your sights on staying alive.

And I’m even more stressed because I know that parent wanted me to finish more than anything. I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do."

My mom annoys everything about me, everyday nonstop. My relationship is essentially at a standstill. School just resumed and it's sh*t. I can't get a break, I am going to snap. I am either going to end up hurting someone or myself.
Edit - Talked with my friend which is also girlfriend's friend, she looks so stressed according to her, due to exams, and may be busy into the holiday(China)."
Revision and Exams,"I am trying so hard to revise but it isn’t working.

I just don’t enjoy what I’m studying. It all feels so jarring. I might decide to transfer to another course but student loans will prove to be a problem.

I don’t know what to do."
"I feel like life is getting harder, and I am completely overwhelmed. I don't know what to do.","Recently I have started to feel more stressed with things in my life. I am 17 and live with my mom and sister. we often fight on most nights. We are moving soon and to top that off my mother has to get shoulder surgery and cannot work. We are selling our house and moving into an apartment. Also recently, while it was snowing, I got into a car accident. I can't stop thinking about that and the financial impact it is having on my family. I can't stop thinking about the future and where I will go to school and what I will do once I graduate. This along with the hundreds of other things just makes me want to escape. Can anyone give me advice please?"
School stress,"I am in a cycle. I don't do my homework, which makes me stressed and angry. This makes me not want to do homework. This makes me stressed and angry. Does anyone know how I can stop this? And I've tried to ""just do"" my homework. It doesn't work. I have pretended to be sick to give myself more time but that just ends with me procrastinating and getting a bigger work load."
"Tonight has been too stressful, and it's only getting worse","First, I had a surprise birthday party for my 16th that gave me a lot of stress because I hate surprises, and since the party was watching a movie, that stress lasted for hours. Then, I procrastinated again (as usual), and I haven't finished any of my homeowork, and it's 3 AM. I'm just so stressed and I don't know what to do. I don't have time for breaks, so I know it will only get worse."
I am done,"I have given my all to work. I have given almost my health to it. I have a troubled background that forced me to take responsibility early in my life.

Since that I have been taking responsibility of everything and landed in a high profile job leading a sales company. 

Now I am empty. I can barely function. The company is not doing well. I can’t change that even if I try as hard as I can. I have made a big decision and resigned but my contract keeps me there for January. 

How can I push this month and all the challenges there still are? How can I show example to my team and keep them pushing. I have nothing to give.

I gave too much. My stress is keeping me from eating, sleeping, smiling. 

I am done."

Almost blacked out from stress?,"Hi guys first post here, i wanted to start a discussion to see if anyone else has experienced this. So this has happened to me a few times (8-10). I’ll describe what just happened to me today. 

So i took my dad to a cheese shop to try some cheeses. I felt a little stressed out but not a lot. I tried some cheese and some had pretty intense flavors and being an highly sensitive person this i think caused some stress. We stood for about an hour when i felt this dropping feeling in my stomach. I knew this was a sign to get some food and sit down but my dad was very happy checking out cheeses so i risked just waiting and chilling out. Then my whole body felt that dropping sensation and my hearing started going. I started getting warm and it felt like pin needles on my body. I got a chair and sat down. I started to panic realizing that my vision was going at a fast rate and my hearing was almost gone. A worker rushed and got me some water and dried apricots. I rushed to the bathroom and sat against the wall and smashed them as fast as i could. I immediately felt relief and the downward spiral had stopped 

Anyone else?"
Why did my ex pick his friend over me?,"At first my ex boyfriend's roommate/friend was alright then it seemed like when my ex and I argued, he would get in the middle of it. One night the roommate was very drunk with his friend and I was upset cause the friend was hitting on me and kissed me on my head. My ex boyfriend's roommate told him his friend never did that and that he didn't see it. The other guy said it didn't happen either when it did. I felt completely ganged up on and hurt that I was being made to look like a liar. Plus the first time the guy hit on me, my ex wasn't even mad and said I should take it ""as a compliment"", he didn't do anything about it. My ex didn't even stick up for me and said he doesn't take sides, even though it was clear that he did. I felt like the roommate had this sense of control over him and was trying to make him be who he wanted him to be. He was always trying to invite him to random parties or clubs even though my ex said no several times. I think he wanted my ex to get away from me. Apparently he didn't like my ex's previous two gfs either and he thought I was a drama queen. Not saying I'm perfect, but maybe you should stay out of it? 

He was always trying to make me look bad. They almost went at it that same night he was really drunk and once my ex walked away so we could talk, he's trying to pull him back in with supposed text messages that said I was checking him out when my ex would be working, which wasn't true. Why did he have a toxic friend like this?"

"Working on a production line, being the last guy, fucking up, and having to deal with ALL the other worker’s anger","I work at an auto body shop. I’m the polisher/detailer, so my job is to polish the paint, right after it comes out of the booth, and get rid of any imperfections. Paint jobs will always have dirt in them, unless the booth is a total-vacuum, so you have to use a sander to lightly sand the surface (WITHOUT going thru the clear-coat) and cut that dirt out, then buff out the scratches after. 

It’s very difficult. I accidentally fucked up on a truck last week, and burnt through. The painter was upset, cause he had to redo that panel, but I was forgiven. Then today, I fucked up not once, but TWICE, on the same car. I’m very new, and still learning, so it’s understandable, but I still have to deal with the rest of the Shop getting pissed off at me. 

I am so stressed right now, I’m about to throw up. It’s not totally my fault. They are giving me inadequate tools, and the paint job could have been better, but that doesn’t change the fact that it’s MY responsibility to make shit happen, regardless of circumstance, and the Shop doesn’t really take the tools/bad paint into consideration. 

So yeah, this car is gonna have to be repainted. And the painter works on commission, so he’s going to lose money because of me. Im crying and shit in my car on my lunch break. Having such a hard time dealing with this. 

And on top of that, I have a lot of severe health issues that are affecting my performance and making concentration difficult. I have chronic daily headaches, and fibro-myalgia, so I’m always in severe pain. And it’s really hard on my body. 

Gah. So not wanting to deal. "

Sudden change in grade...,"I remember checking my AP Physics grade a few weeks back after my teacher entered in our test and seeing my grade (which was a 82.8%--the class is extremely difficult for me and I'm barely hanging on a thread with this class). A few weeks later, I decide to check my grade again and and for some reason, my grade has dropped to a C. Except he hasn't entered any new assignments. The percentage on the screen still reads 82.8% except it's a C instead of a B. 
It might just be a mistake, but I'm afraid that I might've angered/offended my teacher in some way shape or form. The only thing that comes to mind is the fact that I missed two classes last time and both were for a family emergency. He's usually an extremely understanding teacher, and I've never seen him angry before which worries me even more. Any thoughts on how to approach this situation? Thanks for reading this and I'm sorry for the brick wall of text! "

Help me understand how stress works???,"I just cried a few minutes ago....just laid in the shower and cried. You'll have to forgive me if this post is a little random, but I'm just trying to figure out whats happening....

I don't quite understand how stress works. I've had anxiety for about 8 years now...since I was in highschool...and I've gotten MUCH MUCH better with it, developing and practicing coping mechanisms which have helped me go from barely being able to leave the house to complete everyday tasks, to basically being able to have a full on ""attack"" and sit down, breathe deep for a few minutes and go right back to whatever I was doing just fine.

But lately it feels like I've been very stressed over almost nothing but my anxiety. Personally it feels like on a stress scale of 1-10 where 1 is perfect zen and 10 is heart attack, ""Laying on the shower floor and crying due to stress"" is like a solid 7

Does this mean I'm only a couple steps away from my stress actually causing me serious issues???

The first thing that confuses me is that I don't feel SUPER STRESSED, honestly I was fine all day long today until a couple hours ago, sitting on the couch I got an overwhelming sense of sadness. It came from nowhere and doesn't seem to be attached to anything specific, just, ""congratulations your chest suddenly feels sad now"" (now side note: this feeling has been coming over me for the past couple months almost every day, it feels like I have to cry, but I haven't allowed my body to cry because it feels like I legitimately have NOTHING to cry about, so this time I decided I might as well just give my body what it seems to be asking for?? It feels very weird to feel like you have nothing to cry about, then cry, and then go back to not being sad right after you cry....)

I just don't get it....I thought stress was something that built up over time....like you hop from 5 -> 6 after a few months of continued stress...Is that not how it works?

Does stress fluctuate between 1 and 10 on a daily basis? And how much do ""stress relieving activities"" actually help? I just cried does that mean I'll go from 7 to 5? or down to 3? and will it stay that way for a day? or do I not have to worry about these feelings again for another month????

I just don't know anymore..."
Involved in multiple court cases (domestic violence victim),"I was the victim of domestic violence in 2016, and there's been a tremendous amount of fallout in the courts since then. Non-stop legal cases for over 15 months now, with more coming.

I'm in the middle of a trial for custody of the baby we share, and there's also child support cases, and a doctor that sued me in a tangentially related case. 

There are lawyers involved where needed, but the other parent is extremely rich so its a bit of a uphill struggle.

I have no motivation to do anything I only revise because its all I can do. no amount of baths or trying to tidy my room helps what do I do?

Ever feel like you have no where to turn to?,Like no matter where you go there’s going to be nagging you about this or that? I’m a stressed out college kid. It’s taking me longer than expected to get into nursing school and be done with the thing. My parents are riding me everywhere I go about when I’m going to graduate which makes being at home unbearable. It’s almost as if they think I’m not trying my best. If I go to my boyfriend my stress will affect him and I might start yet another unwanted fight. Being out with friends annoys me because I feel like I’m wasting time. How am I supposed to cope with all of this? Any answers would be very much appreciated.
How do you manage stress?,"I’m so mad. Since April I spoke with four professors: all for course evaluations and two for letters of Rec. They all agreed and I send them the necessary documents. I just called to check the file at my university and out of all those professors, only one submitted a course evaluation. I apply for a masters in a month and have no letters, despite having periodically emailed to update these professors. I email them now and they don’t reply. It’s ridiculous. I honestly don’t even want to apply anymore. This masters is just to improve my application for medical school but at this point, I don’t see it in my future.

How do you cope with stress?"
So much going on... it’s taking a toll on my body,"So this is my last semester of college. I have my internship and I am planning my wedding. I have to look for a job for when I graduate and I have 2 weeks left of school. All my papers, presentations and finals are coming up in the next 2 weeks. Since August I have been sick with a cold at the end of each month for like 1-3 days. I literally have never been sick so much. Normally if I get sick at all it’s when allergy season comes, so like once a year. My hair is definitely falling out way more than it normally does. Has this happened to anyone? I know it’s almost over. But I still have the stress of finding a job and planning my wedding. Which I feel once school is done I’ll have a huge weight lifted but like why do I keep getting so sick? I don’t have time for this!"
Today was a big day for me,"So, I have been very stressed because of work for the last 2 years. I have always been a person who strives for perfection. I also was raised in a troubled family and was forced to take responsibility of my younger siblings and later even parents at young age. This has made me very responsible and by nature I take care of others better than myself.

In work this kind of combo has made me a perfect employee for company. It has it perks for me as well as within few years I have been promoted into a country manager. Outside everything looked great. Great position, great salary etc. But inside, my stress grew, I got very anxious and it started to be hard to even get out of bed. I couldn’t sleep, eat etc.

So today, I resigned. I left a great position, without any idea about the future. It’s been a big day. I know I made the right decision. Still I have felt very sad and felt that I let down many people, including myself. I know that is not the case, but it was a very hard decision for me. I wanted all to work out, but you can’t force something that isn’t there. Mixed feelings, but I feel a little bit less anxious at the moment than before. Still need to work some time before it ends. 

But phew.. life.."
"Understanding Stress, No prescription needed!","(The names used have been substituted for privacy reasons.) 
 
The Bay Area today has become a pinnacle of modern innovation and social trends pushing every second the boundaries of human potential in technology. A place I wonder if Babylonia would be envious that so many wonders come out of this area surrounded by a bay. Being in such a competitive environment this sprit definitely permeates areas of daily life like driving and family relations. 
 
In the bay area I have seen a common trend. After reading an excellent an insightful article by Rachel Nuwer there was an interesting concept that I commonly have seen not just in cities but also in the proximity of homes. A common response heard when asking directly on the well being of a person the response tends to be “Busy.” Rachel writes on the influence our societal norms may have on our understanding, if stress is good or bad for us. Society portrays stress as if a badge or banner that gives a high “self-worth.” Addiction to stress is something that if not aware of its existence we can go throughout life unknowing this non-controlled substance may have hold on our life stronger than heroin or methamphetamine. (“Are you addicted to Stress?” http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/19/stress-addiction_n_5689123.html) 
Although this is a general concept that may affect both young and old, I would like to bring light to the long-term effect of stress by sharing about a friend who is 25 the 3rd time (75 years old). It is a way to look into the future of many of us. 
 
Clark is in his late 70’s, a man who I used to work for in home care. He spent 40 years working for the grocery business, was married to a woman who early on developed mental health issues. Eventually obesity and heart failure would take the best of her until she passed away a couple of years ago. 
Clark has 2 sons who both live in San Jose. Mike battles with mental health issues and lives with Clark. Clark now has weight limitations that impair his mobility and a fall 2 years ago affects the normal use of his right hand. When I worked with Clark we would talk for hours. He would always mention his Cabin north of Redding. He would tell me, “Manuel, if I can get you up there you will not want to come back!” 
In February 2015 I took time off and took Clark to his cabin and then again in September. On the second trip I decided to search for a job in Redding and in late October I moved to Redding. Clark and I would call each other to update on how my medical credential process was going and he would share about his family. He would always repeat to me, “Manuel, I don’t know how much longer I can handle the fast pace of the Bay Area. People are in a rush and they don’t even know what they are in a rush for.” One of the new grievances was the “Avenue” he lives on that he jokingly calls “an expressway.” The sound of constant vehicle traffic is definitely a contrast to an area previously filled with orchards. 
 
There were Sundays where I would be present during the visitation of his family. I would always notice how after a couple seconds of listening to his younger son John and the challenges of work, Clark would change his countenance as if morphing into a sage and keeping a serene composure. From the stillness of his wheel chair I could see how he would steadily glance at his two granddaughters running around with their uncle Mike then look at John’s wife Grace who sat silently in a patient manner and then return to listen to the challenges faced in the life of John. Clark would give John suggestions on his challenges with the hope he could see his son come down from the state of overdrive. I could see how Clark knew this was key, and if John were less stressed, this in turn would benefit the family as a whole. 
 
When we work and get paid for labor it drains our body but I have noticed there is another drain that also happens that I call the drain of virtue. I noticed that Clark was giving his son John and the rest of his family much of his patience. In the same way we eat and rest to regain physical strength, virtue when shared is replenished and physical vitality is better restored. Sometimes a simple call or email (letter) could inform a loved one they are loved and therefore enrich their day and well-being with this gesture. The best are hugs, and no matter what inflation does to our economy, these are still free. 
 
In late March I had a window of time and brought Clark to his cabin. As I helped him up the stairs he nearly jolted up to enter his haven, forgetting completely his weight and limitations. During his stay he would tell me how the water in the Shasta region was considered the best in the world. There were nights while looking at the expanse of the universe that Clark would say, “Manuel, this is my heaven on earth.” 
 
As we age stress seems to be less tolerable. These stressors can be physical (extreme temperature or any sensory stimulant) or psychological in nature (stress from relationships). When the stressor presents itself, this activates our nervous system and stimulates the release of stress hormones. In turn their effect on the body is the acceleration of the heart rate, increased respiration, and blood flow redistribution from the skin to the skeletal muscles. The term commonly used is “fight or flight.” (“Alcohol, aging and stress response.” Alcohol Research & Health, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1999) 
The difference brought by age or chronic stress is the inability to bring your body back to baseline once the stressor is not present. Therefore there tends to be an over-activity of the stress system in our body. It could be compared to a racecar that has the gas pedal full throttle while having the emergency brake set. (“Alcohol, aging and stress response.” Alcohol Research & Health, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1999) 
 
I do not plan to lay out a method to follow since we all respond differently to different things. I will say that it is important to know how your body responds to certain stimulus. Be conscious of how much time you expose your body to chronic stressors. Find something what helps your body to calm down. In the past couple of years I have noticed a frenzy for yoga, mostly by women. Women that have a tendency to multitask are now flocking to the afternoon Yoga session. Alcohol stills seems to be a favorite stress antidote but there are some things all should know to prevent health spoiling effects. 
Alcohol, although producing a sedating effect, overtime there is the development of tolerance. Since more alcohol is eventually required to produce the same sedating effect, it increases the release of the stress hormone that may have a rewarding effect in turn producing a vicious cycle (“Alcohol, aging and stress response.” Alcohol Research & Health, Vol. 23, No. 4, 1999). 
Although, in the medical field there are hundreds of studies and known facts on the effects of chronic stress, the clock continues to tick and not many take time to find a balance that will provide well deserved and needed upkeep. All this is to ensure the longevity of our body since it is the only one we have.
 
Clark has definitely found a means to refill his virtue bank. Physically each time he drank water right out of the tap Clark would tell me, “ I just never get tired of drinking this water.” In the mornings we would sit on the deck and watch the deer as they visited Clark. As I watched his eyes I could see how the serene breeze, and the squawk of the overflying eagle were taking care of charging up all other areas needed. 
 
In medical school I was taught that your patients would tell you 85% of the time what is wrong with them. Listen to your loved ones. Many times the stressful lifestyle has become such a routine that they are unaware of being high-strung. Have patience with them, young or old, since most do not know how to come down from the “fight or flight” state. Some may become even anxious when letting go of old ways due to the fear the new method will not produce the desired results in their life. In this case Clark even gave me the medications best for him. Although the effects of being at the cabin are temporal, and there may be a more absolute solution, right now he is convinced this is what is best for him. 
 
I truly believe there is a season and a time for everything we do and not all things are truly urgent. Stress can be addictive, it may have a long-term effect on your body if chronic and the body changes with old age on how much stress the body can buffer. With this, I hope you can find the balance in your life, find your source of living waters and a consciousness about this information as many other creatures have learned to do."

How do I deal with stress in a healthy way while in the stressful situation?,"Most advice I find is for when you are out of the stressful situation, like exercise. I have a stressful job and I don't think about it when I'm home, but when I'm at work (I'm an RN in a hospital, 12 hour shifts) I binge eat fatty/sugary foods on my lunch break, and I even sneak into the break room to breathe for a minute and usually scarf whatever donuts/cake/whatever is available in there.

Playing Mobile Games to fight stress especially during travel. (Based on experience.),"Hi guys! Office worker here and everyday I travel for almost 3-4 hrs giving me a lot of stress, making me more irritable to others even in my family. This stress was almost on me on my first 3 months on the company. So I tried many different ways to fight stress while travelling like eating, sleeping, reading books, etc and they did worked but the most efficient way I tried is through mobile gaming. 

Because as you can see almost everybody has a smart phone for practical use so I tried to DL random free games on appstore and found some fast paced game that are addictive but not in a point that you forget your own priorities. Playing really did help me a lot in forgetting the time stuck in the traffic. It also relaxed me especially the slow paced game and make me think in a strategy game.

Some games that I played that I really saved me from boredom are:

- [Dodge Hard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ikinagames.dodgehard&hl=en) : Shooter game and my Favorite
- [MonsterCry Eternal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nyouinc.monstercryeternal&hl=en) : Card Game.
- [Nine Stones](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.infovine.ninestones&hl=en) :Tycoon game with Medieval Fantasy genre.

I suggest that everybody try to find a hobby when doing nothing like reading or playing really helps a lot to pass time instead of being attacked by Paranoia or Anxiety. 

So that's all guys, hope I had given a little help to those people with the same problem as I. Have a good day!"
"Out of touch with stress, but physical symptoms","A month ago I ended up in emergency with chest pains, which turned out to be acid reflux and some inflammation. Determined to get to the bottom of it I've started eating extremely healthily (or rather, cut all GERD triggers and started FODMAP because my system has always been a bit off), but the doctor said stress was a contributor. 

I got an appointment with a psychologist who took my patient history (sexual assault 5 years ago, finished my PhD, now in a new and unstable job, 2 massive life changes coming in the next year, and mum got a life changing diagnosis the week before my chest pains started and I'm not able to travel home) and then laughed and said it was little wonder I'm stressed. 

The thing is, aside from grinding my teeth at night, occasional desire to cry over my mum, and being anxious about everything, I honestly hadn't considered myself stressed. I do my 8-5 and then it's just pottering about at home. I don't have the energy to take on extra responsibilities or activities, so I don't push myself to. I sleep 7-8 hours a night, and rarely drink. Maybe I've just been under pressure for so long that it doesn't strike me as odd. 

Anyway, what's the best way of dealing with this? I'm going to see the psychologist again but I think he's going to focus on anxiety rather than stress. "

He asked the other neighbors and he was asking for the apartment that called them about the bill, he said that they had low income so they were trying to see if they can figure out what to do with the bill or something along those lines. (So my mom tried telling them that after using the heater ONCE in the winter, the bill was $300) After hearing that, I told my Mom about it. We have low income because my mom is the only one working and she doesn’t have her green card yet, our dad also left us so it’s harder for her to clean houses for money. So anyways I told my mom that we could’ve saved money. She said it doesn’t matter, I told her that I know that my mom can’t earn money. That’s why I always try to find ways to save money. I’m only 12 and Im aware  going through puberty so I get mad easily. I was shouting back, asking her why she never tried to save money. She doesn’t respond and starts laughing at me, I’ve been getting stressed out a lot this past week and my mom just doesn’t help. She laughs whenever I get stressed, she tries to communicate to others about useless things with her extremely broken English, and she keeps using her money on useless things. Overall I’m fine with all the other things but I just get way more stressed when my mom keeps laughing at me when I get upset. It is unlikely for me not to start crying when she starts laughing. She then starts laughing at me even more, I’m having second thoughts on her being a nice person. I’m starting to think that she bullied others, all I know is that my mom fought with other kids to be at a “higher level” of a clique, a leader, I remember her telling me about a mark on her back from fighting. I know I went off topic a bit while typing this but I’m just really annoyed that my mom laughs at my stress and calls me insane for shouting. I’ve tried many times, asking her not to laugh at me while I’m stressed out, it never works. I have no idea how to make her stop, I was wondering if anyone could suggest anything to make my mom listen.

"I love my job, and my manager is awesome, but my stress causes lots of missed work..","I have this great job, more at my speed (I don't work well under pressure), and my manager is a fantastic understanding guy who would bend over backwards just so someone could tell him to deal with their shit, more specifically, mine. I have stress in nearly every other aspect of my life, and it causes tremendous physical pain sometimes, which then means I have to call out for work. Now I'm beginning to stress about this too because again, job is perfect for me, but I'm still in my probation period and I have called out several times, most of which at short notice. I'm about to have to do it again (tossing and turning, getting less than five hours a night of sleep, for the past week, and now I've slept maybe an hour, grinding my teeth away) due to sevre bruxism flare up. My mouth guard is worn out just from this week alone.

My question is, how do I explain this to him without sounding like I'm just a weak little kid? I'm 22, and a hard worker, but I call out at least once every month and a half, sometimes more. This will be the 3rd time in a month I'm calling out, each time for a different source of stress induced medical issues. I don't want to lose this job, I haven't been able to keep one because of it and I even had to lie about references to get it. I know if I say it right he will be compassionate and understand, but I'm terrible with these things, believe it or not, it stresses me out. Help..!"
How do I release stress from my neck?,
Everything is too much,"So, I am so stressed and it is causing me to be overwhelmed, confused, and ill motivated. I bartender and work late hours and I am a full time student. I was working really late and missing classes but I caught up. Then I changed my schedule at work so I didn’t have to work late, now I am making less money. Also I just got out of a relationship and I am talking to new people and it’s so distracting. I’m late on a few assignments and don’t know where to start. Can anyone relate?"
Stressed about college. Please help,"Hello all, I need help. I am a 23 male, I live in New York City, and am currently a college student. I am currently an upper senior, which technically makes this my last semester in school. I am currently majoring in political science and have basically earned my 4 year degree in that, and its an albeit useless degree. 

Out of despair and the hope of a better future, I added computer science as a second major, which would be fine but I can't seem to focus on the courses, I can't seem to pass the math classes, and I am very stressed because being a senior now, it would take me an additional 2 years to complete the course work and get a BA in CS. I honestly don't know what to do and I had a panic attack earlier, any tips on how to manage my stress so I don't break down again, and how do I get my life together?

Stressful Semester,"I am currently a high school senior and am dealing with a semester that includes a Gifted University Prep Functions and Relations, University Prep Physics and University Prep Chemistry. The Functions and Physics are what's giving me problems. I had a 95 in my Functions course last year and this year it's down to a 75-ish despite me being much more attentive and engaged in class, and doing hours more homework. Physics is at a 73-ish but the teacher is very tough and I get the impression that this may actually be above the median. Still, most of the university programs I am considering require an average in the mid-80's or higher. I have already deleted all my main social media for productivity's sake and am attending extra help and average of about once a week.

Work stress...need relief,"Hey I'm a working adult in the midst of a mental breakdown. I have been working in my current company for almost 2 years. I'm prepared to work ot from the start since the position I'm in usually required to ot in month end. 

But the workload is too overwhelming. When I first joined, they was migrating from myob to sage, mid way migrate from sage to crm and then from crm to some self created system by an outsource co. 

My boss keep stressing that this will make our workload lesser and easier as time goes by. But this 2year have been physically and mentally exhausting, beside changing system 3 times, there are colleague who came and left mid way 3 times. I have to endure workload of 4 to 3 person 3 times for a few month each. 

Furthermore, boss said that industry is changing and they add in new biz function, but you know what, Our current of 4 is reducing to 3 as one of them is going on maternity leave. And our boss dont intend to hire more to assist.

I'm like is it even worth it to continue staying in this company.

To be honest, my current workload is like 2 times worse than previous. And the emails keep piling, I dont even read them anymore unless the person call me. 

This is the sign to leave right ? Ah........................

Ulcers?,"Hi, Im 17 and I have multiple serious mental illnesses and disorders, and Im in the middle of my senior year. Stress! Everywhere! On top of that, boy problems, I have like no friends, my dog has cancer, my grandpa was just diagnosed with his third brain tumor, and Ive been crying nonstop all week.
 Recently, for the past week or so, Ive been feeling a really sharp upper abdominal thing. I knew from an interview I saw of kurt cobain that ulcers are often caused by stress so I asked my mom and she said that my family is extremely prone to ulcers. I learned my grandma had most of her stomach taken out and btw, shes fucking nuts now (unrelated to the ulcer but mental illness does tend to come more from her lineage). So thats the hand im given and I was hoping someone here might know some good ways of keeping the pain at bay or worsening it? Getting a new body isnt an option unfortunately :/

Looking for my stress but can't find it,"Hi;

I suffer (infrequently, fortunately) from migraine headaches. Three years ago, I had a migraine that wouldn't go away - more than a week. I went to a pain doctor who prescribed meds but they weren't helping, so I went for an MRI and saw a neurologist who pointed out that I had high blood pressure. Went to a cardiologist who ran a bunch of tests and we determined that the BP was related to stress - I was in the middle of a life event that was fairly stressful. The BP meds helped bring things back to normal and I went on with my life.



Now, three years later, my BP has been elevated recently - much higher than usual. I'm still on the meds, but they aren't helping as much. It's causing headaches and I'm constantly clenching my jaw, even while sleeping. I'm going to see the cardiologist again later this week, but I'm trying to figure out the root cause and I just can't find anything in my life that's that stressful right now - at least not compared to three years ago. 

I'm assuming it's caused by stress again... but can't figure out what's causing it. Any advice on how to figure it out ?

MAKE YOUR OWN STRESS BALL!,"Hi Check out this video on how to create a slime stress Ball!!!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yA922dxyqM&t=1s"
How much is too much?! Somebody tell me...,"I don't even know how to begin writing but here goes..

My long term partner and I split a few weeks ago, and I pushed him away because my mind is swimming. I've got a really demanding job that recently has been piling up with more and more stress. My department was gutted and I'm basically the last one standing - doing the work that 4 people used to do. On top of that, I'm doing a full time accelerated MBA which, until this point, I've been able to handle.

Here's where it get's stupid.. 

I volunteered for a really exciting extra-curricular project and got accepted (yay!). It's a huge initiative and requires hours and hours of reading. The people in my group are incredibly experienced and well versed on the topic (Think Managing Directors/Corporate Sustainability Directors etc) and I feel way out of my depth amongst them, let alone contributing.

I've been practicing yoga 5 days a week which helps, and developed an obsession with incense but my mind is constantly running. 

On top of all of this - the breakup has left me stressed emotionally and financially and I don't have a car to even to my groceries. To go shopping I have to lug around huge bags on either arm and walk 20 minutes to and from the shops, often in muggy and horrible weather.

I know a lot of it is self-induced. The extra-curricular, the MBA, the demanding job, the break up.. but it's beyond the point of return. I can't drop one or any of these stresses. I can't keep on top of everything and feel like the only thing that relieves me is yoga - but I have to do yoga in my lunch break and then I miss out on eating and am stressed that people at work are gossiping because my lunch breaks often go beyond an hour (Due to getting changed, walking to the studio etc).

I needed to type that out. Thanks guys. "
Working with my wife,"So I’ve been working with my wife now for two years, she’s head admin and I’m a senior teacher in a school. Over the last few months we’ve both experienced extreme stress whilst working together. As you can guess, we both take it out on each other, thus also adding stress to our relationship. 

Has anyone encountered anything like this before? Or does anyone have any tips on how to deal with it either work or relationship stress? Any suggestions welcome! "
Malevolent Stress,"Greetings,

This is going to be excessively long, and I understand if no one reads it. My presumption is that I will be looked down upon for these unfortunate truths so I've created a new user ID to tell my story and explain why I'm stressed. I do hope anyone who does sit at home in their most comfortable of places, forgives my selfishness. This action is more for me personally as I feel the need for an outlet of this kind. Again, I'm sorry.

As all unfortunate things begin, it is with devastation of some kind. In 2005 hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and myself and my mother were unable to return home for a few months. Prior to that event I had a job, and my life had promise. Coming back home I was optimistic, but a few days being in the place I grew up quickly turned into a nightmare. Initially I was unable to work because that area was still flooded. Even after returning to work weeks later many of my co-workers did not. Initially I found myself doing the total work of three or four people for pay that wasn't even anywhere close to what I deserved. Surprisingly I kept at it for almost a year, and right I was becoming far too exhausted to continue my work place closed its doors due to less demand for their service. The ever-growing presence of the internet and easy to use phone apps had more or less made them obsolete.

If we fast forward to October 2007 we see that i, your writer, was at that time unemployed. I decided to take a break from it all for just a small amount of time, and towards the middle of that month I started having pains. In my lower back I would have the most excruciating pain, and it felt like it would travel up my spine. For about one to two hours I was immobile. After that the pain would pass. This happened every two weeks with the eventual result being a trip to the emergency room. When I went to the hospital I was told it was due to being obese then shipped off home. Yes I am what you would call a fat guy but that pain just didn't measure up to a fat person's problem. What could I do? At least that is how I felt. Yet again a short time passed and I was in pain once again. This time was different, this time it was horrifying, it felt like all the oxygen in the air around me was somehow gone. Truly I felt like I was suffocating but for whatever reason I tried to get through it. Maybe the doctor was right. I'm not a medical professional by any means. Slowly I learned to breathe regardless of how difficult it felt too. The pain however did not leave as it had before. After one hour I was moving into every position my body could possibly handle in small hope one of them would make me feel better. After a few minutes of that prior action I unexpectedly had to relieve myself. Quickly I move to the appropriate room and I apologize for the imagery, but this liquid is not supposed to be the brown almost black color that it was. Still I was either being arrogant or ignorant or both because I had not left yet for the hospital. Shortly after I had an unquenchable thirst, which was nearly immediately followed by excessive vomiting. Nothing too gross here as it was literally all water. Again the pain got worse. Finally I went to the hospital with my mother. On the way there I vomited more water, and in the waiting area twice more. After being placed in a room it was only after a few minutes that a doctor came in. Less than two minutes from his arrival he left, and less than two minutes later a few people were rushing in with medicinal bags and all other sorts of medical equipment.

It just so happens that I had pancreatitis. Apparently I was more than less close to death. Obviously it was painful, there are no words I can actually use to describe it, but I didn't feel like I was dying. Maybe like someone was dragging nails across my back, slowly tapping one in, and then forcing it down in one stroke with a giant hammer. Again that doesn't do it justice. At any rate I was officially hospitalized. For three weeks I lay immobile in a hospital bed. Every four hours I was allowed dilaudid, at times I was allowed the pain medication every two hours or so. I honestly can't tell you all that what happened while I was in the hospital because I was so heavily medicated that I was usually busy doing just a few things which were mainly being asleep, talking to people who weren't there and not really remembering it, or feeling like I was moving and being someplace I wasn't. Therefore we can skip to the part where I was discharged, met a few doctors a week later, was told I could or could not ever have pancreatitis again, that I should have surgery, and that after that ordeal I just felt like I couldn't and declined.

The night I was discharged I thought i would be fine. I was sent home with a prescription for percocet. When we almost reached our house I started feeling unbearable pain but as it was late we had find a 24 hour Walgreen. My point being that for a few months I was still stuck on pain meds. I became excessively lazy and depressingly had gained more weight. Unfortunately I hit an all-time low. More than a few bills were depleting me, my clothes didn't fit, and I hadn't seen my friends in a long time. Suddenly I became a recluse. Depression, was setting in. A few months of me being physically healthy passed by. I found a little inspiration to get off my butt and start looking for a job. No one was calling back.

In November of 2008 I once again had pancreatitis. So much for that possibility of it never happening again. This time I went to the hospital after less than one hour of suffering with it. To my surprise it was somehow worse than before. At least thats what the doctors told me. During this stay at the hospital I spent exactly one month and two weeks there. I was told I was required to have surgery during that time. The day I had surgery I was brought to a very large room with wide open space, on each side against the wall were beds with some having closed curtains but many left open, the floor was simply concrete, and medical equipment and metal sinks of some kind were at its center. To be perfectly honest I never imagined a room like this would exist in a hospital. It felt like the room was pulled out of my worst nightmare. To this day it still gives me the creeps. After being pushed through this room on a bed I was brought to a much smaller adjoining one. In the middle of this room was a plank of some kind I was expected to lay on and around that were surgeons and nurses. I was promptly explained to what was going to happen, given some type of medicine, and a large breathing mask was attached to my face. I was told to count down from one hundred and at some point I fell unconscious. All that build up is for this. While I was unconscious I was screaming in my own head. The kind of scream that doesn't end, presumably because it didn't require oxygen. I don't know how much time exactly past but I didn't stop until I woke up in that very same room prior with sweat pouring off me. Moving ahead I spent my remaining time in the hospital with a tube inside my abdomen and on the end of that tube was a neat little bag which retained a black liquid we call bile. On the day I was sent home I had a six inch scar where my gallbladder used to reside, but the tube and bag stayed at the hospital. I was discharged on December 23. On December 25 I awoke on Christmas morning with a need to urinate. Before even getting halfway to the bathroom a half gallon of thick clear yellow liquid spilled out on to the floor from below my navel. I forgot to mention I was also cut open vertically from my navel down a few inches. Right back to the hospital I went. Of course I did use the bathroom first though before leaving. Promptly I had to have some type of scan by a radiologist, an anesthesia expert came in and gave me morphine, the radiologist proceeded to remove a few stables from my six inch monster of a scar and then he stuck a tube inside me which sucked out almost three gallons of bile. Now that I think on it I did have a lot of abdominal pain at home. I also had far too much pain then as I wasn't given much morphine. Maybe it also had to do with the fact I am allergic to morphine, which I found out that day. In the hospital I stayed yet again until near the end of January 2009. Up until July of 2009 I had regular doctor visits, regular refills of pain medication, and I almost forgot regular checkups on me and my new friend or old friend if you prefer the bag and tube I had to carry everywhere with me. It's so much worse than I'm writing now but I'm trying to shorten this novel.

Once again I was on the mend. Yes I was still on meds for another two months but my staples were removed and that horrible tube and bag were gone. Unfortunately I gained a bit more weight, an all time low of depression hit, and it was followed by chest tightening stress. After this point I actually became a hermit. I shut myself off from the world because one day in it as per usual was just one fucking day too much. I had been through too much in just a few years, and I literally couldn't take it anymore. So I used alternative means to escape reality. They didn't involve drugs I can promise.

At a point I became poor. I had nothing except a roof over my head. Everything I own was breaking from age. This tablet in fact is my cousin's. In 2012 my mother became sick. I took care of her every day when she came home until she got better. I don't want to explain what happened to her as that was more painful for me than what I went through myself. When my mother got better I shut down again. At that point the stress was so much more prominent than any other feeling. A few times I had awful panic attacks. 

In 2014 after that whole ordeal I woke up one day and decided enough was enough. How much time had just slipped by? Was I really going to live like this? Was I going to let this series of unfortunate events ruin me? I decided to move forward, but no one would hire me. As it so happens I'm very good with technology. Basically I can spend a day with any new tech and have a solid idea of how it works, how to maintain it, use all features, troubleshoot problems, and even repair it. It isn't that big of a deal but apparently many people don't adept to it very quickly. On top of that I'm good at building computers, repairing desktops, and laptops. I had a somewhat marketable skill where I could fix things for people and through word of mouth I was out and about mainly repairing desktops and laptops for money. It wasn't a real job per say, the money was hardly adequate, and I have a strong dislike for strange environments but I was able to pick myself up a little. Still though I had responsibilities to my family, I was all over the place every other day, and I just couldn't get a job. I was stressed no matter what. 

Then my mother got sick again... To this day she still is. My full time job became taking care of her. In the past few weeks she's really made strides. After an infection around her heart, in her blood, and two strokes that woman can walk now. Mind you she can't walk far but it's none the less impressive to me. Unfortunately I'm without a job again, but i don't blame her. Technically I haven't had a real one in almost a decade, but I absolutely need one. I'm in the worst way where I can't even dress for an interview. My old clothes don't fit me, my funds don't exist. I don't know what to do. I don't even remember how to properly find a job. And getting a job I'm happy with? Forget about it. I have to accept a job that doesn't match my intelligence. Yes my mother will get well physically, but mentally she has been recently diagnosed as bipolar. I don't know that it is a life long condition, and if it is why it had not really shown much until recently. Every so often though, she degrades me, excessively. It just adds on to my stress. Today is one of those days. Contrary to my story I've been really active for a while now with daily exercise. I've also changed my diet. I've been trying so hard, but I'm still fat and I have no job. A part of me wants to embrace solitude again. I can't allow it to ever happen again. So everyday now is just a trial. Yet I want release from all the responsibility still. Paying all those damn bills, running errands everyday, being yelled at, trying to find money for clothes so I can show up for an interview, not even knowing ill get a call as I'm apparently radioactive to work places, cooking three meals a day, taking care of my mother... I do it, I don't complain, but it stresses me out. It's just all too much. It's all as listed above and then some. As I've typed on I just found myself unwilling to be thorough and precise in regards to the intricate details because they all pain me so much and make me stressed. At first it felt therapeutic and now it's just painful. So this is where I will leave my word.

Best wishes"
Right now in my life I am so frustrated,"Right now in my life I am so frustrated with everything around me that it has left me tired. Everyday I search for a moment of happiness to feel good about myself, but there is nothing that makes me feel good. I keep myself busy in my studies(started my masters this August) to take my mind off negative things. but everything around me hits my mind so badly that i cannot control the impact of anything. I no more have control on anything that happens to me, everything just happens and I just respond as I am supposed to. People around me are always demanding, they want something from me every now and then, and its not friendship that they want but just some favors I know they will never return. And right now I don't even have any friends to talk to, to deal with everything with me or even to keep me sane. Everyday has become exhausting and I just feel like to leave everything, do nothing, no studies, no job , no people, leave everything and live somewhere in peace. But I know I cannot just cut off from everything, I have to have masters degree, get a job., but this journey is so stressful, I wish I could have someone just to listen what I have to say about everything going on with me. and I wish I could just get a moment to breathe."
Gonna need some serious help on this one,"Okay, so I'm a 16 yr old guy and am having some stress lately. I usually assume that it is my teenage mind blowing thing out of proportion but now I have noticed some stuff. To start, I cannot remove myself from any of the situations that are causing me stress because they are either important (school) or I have no power over them (dying grandfather, great uncle just died) so what I am looking for is a way to really fix it by changing my view. At first I tried to relieve it by going over the situation I am in but there is a lot so I find myself pacing for HOURS around trying to come up with a plan to organize but thing just kept coming so then I started to crumble. School started so I'm locked in to a lot of stuff too. I started to eat less and stay up until 3 AM worrying about life. Then when that started to effect my grades and other schedule stuff (lack of sleep and energy) I just felt worse. I had a lot of other emotions like guilt and regret. I felt like there wasn't a good end to where I was. I have a twin brother who is in everything like this but never worries about thing so he is doing great. I started to crumble more until I was on the verge of tears. I then chose that even being emotionally numb and calm was better than the stress and a wanted a way to block everything out. That's when I cut myself. I cut myself again the next day, and the day following that. I felt EXTREMLY calm after doing so. It was more calm then I had felt in months. But then I remembered, scars. That has stopped me since those three days of calm. I only have few scratches and cuts and one glass cut but I easily hide them with a few wristbands and a watch. Thing is, everything scars and if I keep going, its going to affect me later in life. It always starts with a few scratches but then that's not enough. Even after a few days I went from just pain to not feel my problems to needing the sight of blood. The only thing stopping me now is, well, more stress. I'm now hoping that the cuts don't scar too badly and am stressing about hiding the scabs on my wrist. My family (luckily) is very loving and close to me. That means little privacy so I can't continue without them noticing. I wish that left me at square one but even square one is better than this. Now I have tried everything I have thought of to deal with stress and none of it will work without hurting me in the long run so now I just need a change in the mind. I need a new mindset to view life in general."
Easy Stress Management Ways!!!,"**Indulge in Exercise or Movement**

Exercise means endorphin and endorphin mean happiness therefore it’s about time you got on the treadmill. However, the treadmill may not be everyone’s piece of cake but movement is the best way to battle stress. A walk in the park or a punching bag may be the best stress reliever of all time.  If at work then walk away from your cubicle to change your surroundings and allow the anxiety to subside.  Staying in one position may be equivalent to drowning in your sorrows and letting the stress balloon into a extremity.

**Call a Friend**

Never ever underestimate the power of a strong support network as it can work miracles for the stressed individual.  A different perspective is all one needs to understand a source of stress, an intimate connection or their own experience may provide the much needed perspective. The simple therapy of talking may provide the much needed relief and laughter never hurt anyone. If one doesn’t feel comfortable with talking to the near and dear then joining a support group is always a good option as it allows the comfort of familiarity with a tinge of anonymity.

**Crave Some Time**

Stress is bound to be experienced when we are working two jobs; balancing social work and personal life it all may seem too much and rightly so. Stress from everyday activities may build up and create leave you with a sense of missing identity. This can avoided or tackled with the help of some designated “me” time which will help you reclaim your life and give a sense of belonging. Rubbing with shoulders with people and socializing too frequently may also be source of stress as the soul and body needs to re-energize it frequently. This is similar to the phoenix rising from the ashes to become a stronger self- a dramatic example which, yet all too relevant.

**Leave your Comfort Zone**

The familiar can also be a cause of stress ass the more used to you is to familiarity the more stress any unknown element will give you. It’s best to change ones surroundings and indulge in new activities to push yourself to your limit. Sign up for a new course, or a class, make yourself do things which you’ve always been afraid of to allow mental growth and better composure in the face of unknown elements.

**Avoid the Junk**

Getting that bottle of wine out to drown your sorrows may seem the best way to cope with stress but reality its only making the problem worse. The same way that tub of ice-cream, binging on comfort food or the balcony smoke will not solve the problem only aggravate it. As much as it may attract you, it’s best to stick to the healthier options to allow the body to support your aggrieved soul. Snack on fruit and cut up vegetables to avoid adjoining problems such as weight gain and health issues.

Advice,"I'm not sure what to do so wondered if anyone can help?

 I've felt so stressed the last couple days, normally I distract myself and then I'm good  (or try breathing deeply, grounding, the normal stuff) but today nothing is working and I don't know what else to try to calm down.. 

There's no real reason that I can think of as to why I'm feeling like this either so I'm stuck!"
Why don't you want?,"I am doing a double-shift to secure my family life. After-all how long is it going to be that I would be able work a job, having already spent half of my life earning a very decent salary. We have always kept our wishes in check so we have enough savings, but we have never compromised on any important stuff. 

Just today I asked my wife to have a look at the website I was making and she outright said No! I don't want to have a look! I mean, what!? 

> Why don’t you want?
> What is this attitude?
> Why don’t u want to see my work, my website? 
> You are my wife! What’s wrong?

How to cope with stress when you are supporting others,"hey all, really need advice here.
I am a forces veteran that is now working for the health service, my career ended after I had a car crash and did damage to my spine. My wife was a victim of child rape/incest and as a result has not of justifiable issues that I try to help with. My only child has autism. My father has a terminal illness and I try to support my mother with this whenever I can.
that's the basics over and done with, I have always had to be there for so many people and I think ive managed it relatively well, but some things are now happening that are little things that I am really having difficulty with. really simple things, like people in work parking in disabled spaces who shouldn't, or people not washing up cups. These are things that I have normally let go, but over the past few weeks they almost fill me with rage.
is there any handy tips to be able to cope with the sheer amount going on? I used to relax by playing video games or painting, but ive recently developed tendonitis in my dominant hand so using a thumbstick/holding a paint brush now hurts.
I was considering yoga maybe"

"Wife under extreme stress from current job, feels stuck, not sure how best to help.","My wife has been an insurance adjuster for about three years. She's extremely good at her job, but she's also very introverted. She deals with claimants over the phone and these folks can get pretty nasty. There's been times before where she's had periods of heavy stress, and it's tough on her, but she comes out on top.

This week however seems different. Yesterday she called me very upset from her office after a call that seemed to really get to her. This morning she was on the verge of tears. I told her she should stay home and try to take the day off. I said ""it's just a job"" (which really just made the situation worse). She said there are commitments she set for today and legal action that could be taken against the company if she fails to meet deadlines. 

We've discussed finding a new job, but she feels stuck at her current work place. Our health, car and renters policies are all through her company (I can get health insurance through mine and we can shop around for the other two). She also feels stuck because we have a sizable (~25k) in debt that we are paying. We're going on vacation in two weeks, but I'm afraid it won't get here soon enough, or she won't be able to relax and enjoy it (either because she still feels stuck having to go back to her current job or the stress of finding a new job).

I think logically she gets that it's not the end, and that she can find a new job. However, emotionally this whole situation is really taking a toll. I'm not sure how else I can help, esp, when like this morning my supportiveness comes off as trite. 

Tldr: wife has been stressed at work before, this week has been worse than normal. How can I help?

Thanks~!"
Stress doesn't have to be a killer — here's how to use it to your advantage,"I found this interview useful:

Anybody uses sport as a stress reliever ?,"Hi,

I grew up as a sportshead, stopped in college, got extremely sick and lost my future life, capacity to run or even jog. My life is still shit but my body is back and now that I can jog I often feel the need to just rush out and run. And even though it feels a little neurotic and a non solution to other problems, done just enough I find it very very (very very very very) effective to lower stress.

Even a bit of workout (slow pushups) will calm me down.

If others do too, tell me. If you never, and your body isn't too fragile, give it a try."
I keep screwing up at work,"Hey guys I'm new to reddit but Ive browsed many times.

Anyway, I've been at my job as an application specialist for a software company for a year and a half now. On top of supporting our application for customers I also build computers for new employees. 

As of late I feel like I keep making mistakes. I forget to map drives, forget to install certain things that are needed, name a PC wrong you name it I've probably done it. What doesn't help is a few weeks ago we laid off about 15 people in sales and one person in tech so now we're all extra paranoid about getting fired. What makes it even worse is I was told that the one person that was fired from tech; my boss wanted to fire him since April but was ""waiting for the right time""

Im constantly paranoid that I'm next. I've been trying so hard to not screw up which of course makes me screw up more. I feel like I can't do anything right and I'm just getting on my boss's nerves. I don't play on my phone, I take as many support cases as I can, and I'm on the phone all day. In my logical mind, there is no reason to get rid of me but if I continue messing up like I am who knows. I honestly don't know what to do. I feel like the most useless member of my team and that Im due to be canned any minute. 

Am I being irrational? "
Could Functional Medicine be the Key Medical Treatment You’ve Been Looking for your Entire Life?,"If you’re like most of the people working and living in LA, you wake up after too little sleep, you skip breakfast to opt for the gym before driving through traffic and working an 8-10 hour workday, coffee dripping through you like an IV instead of a proper healthy lunch, and dinner is perhaps your first real meal of the day and even that is eaten at 8 instead of 6, then you go to bed around 1am or later, because you’re stressed, uncomfortable, or something else is bothering you, but you just don’t know what and why.  The next day is the same and repeat, repeat, repeat until one day you look in the mirror and you’ve got your first patch of gray hair, dried crusty skin, extra 20 pounds around the waist and deep facial wrinkles that make you look worried all the time.  It can even lead to depression, migraines, insomnia and other problems that make you want to scream.

Is this you?

If not, you’re one of the lucky ones.  If so, then you know whatever fad diet you’ve tried for the excess weight and/or premature aging is just not cutting it.  You know whatever medical or psychological treatment you’ve sought and paid for for years is not solving the problem, and you know something has to change.

My guess is when you think of natural medicine, you think only of vitamins and a change of diet and perhaps a new exercise routine and sleep habit, or maybe even a prescribed change of job.  And if you’re like most people, these things are not easily done.  So, people in this frame of mind, tend to do nothing and the condition worsens.  

But what may surprise you is Dr. Anju Mathur’s treatment and methods are unique and do not give you tasks you just aren’t going to complete.  There are life-changing treatments available at Dr. Anju Mathur’s Angel Longevity Medical Center including, IV infusions of vital vitamins and necessary nutrients, Ultra-violet blood irradiation treatment (which although hails from the 30s and 40s is like space-age technology!) and detoxification treatments of heavy metals.  These treatments and more are designed around the patients after intensive patient history study, testing, and trials.

A patient at Angel Longevity Medical Center is given time, care, understanding and true results by our doctors.  Not only can one truly obtain help for diseases and ailments but one can obtain anti-aging and vitality results not seen by just taking vitamins, or going to a health spa.  The results speak for themselves.

Changing Stress,"Everyone has stress in life, but still what I don't understand is how people cope with stress better than others. 

A college student has alot of stress...
A business owner who works <60 hours a week has stress..., yet the business owner is very successful, while the college student is struggling. 

I'm assuming when Bill Gates was starting Microsoft he was full of stress, and Elon Musk owner of Tessla has to have stress he freaking reads 8 hours a day. 

Is there any resources where I can learn more about stress? There has to be a way where I can teach myself to not respond to stress. There has to be a way where no matter what happens I will feel minimum stress. So how does one accomplish this?"

Not a fun break up,"I know no break up is fun, but you know what I mean.
Without going into too much detail: she was unhappy, cheated on me, broke up with me, started dating other guy. We also live together.

UK,Are there any English people out there? 
I recently started college,"I just started Uni about two weeks ago and I feel like everything is just overwhelming. I'm struggling to understand some of the curriculum, but i plan to go to after class help for it with a friend. There's just so much work and the year just started. I feel like the pace will pick up and I will be even more behind than I already am. I was wondering if anybody else has been in a similar situation and what could possibly help keep stress down?"
I'm following in my father's footsteps..,"I had a wake-up call today from my partner. He told me today that when I'm not working, I'm sick to the point of being almost bed bound, or I'm at the hospital with an emergency. 

I turned 29 this summer. I have always been a little off, gone 'round the bend' so to say. Now this, in and of itself is just fine, I'm perfectly okay with that fact. 

I have, since childhood, been a surrogate mother to my siblings and friends, been the one to take charge in a power vacuum as nature abhors a vacuum, been a peace keeper, money manager, the list continues. 

Needless to say, I have always been a bit under stress. Add to that, my closest sibling in age and blood is a  psychopath, and you kind of can see where I'm coming from. 

I have worked since I was 7, picking up trash where my father worked for a dollar per trash bag. It was something to get us out of his hair I guess, and it taught me delayed gratification skills. 

I don't know what not being under stress is. I have no clue what people are talking about in regards to being stressed out.  

I don't feel stress, but my body has symptoms. It basically starts shutting down. No stopping it. First time I was under extreme prolonged stress was during my ex's first deployment. I found out that I have a stress activated heart condition called Wolff Parkinson White. Glorified ventricular Tachycardia in my case. Ended up having heart surgery twice. 

The next time, I was in nursing school, my appendix burst and I fell down a flight of stairs. 

Next, I was in a new job, and had just been told that my kid was having a hard time with a kid at school and I was trying to get a divorce and was working full time. I started having seizures. 

Every time any ""normal"" person would be under a great deal of stress, my body goes into shutdown mode. Any advice on how to stop this would be welcome. I have taken vitamins, psychiatric medication, and I am an herbalist in training. "

Felt overwork this week,"I am writing to describe all the stresses i had this week. 

I am a full time college student majoring in business and this semester i am taking 4 upper division classes along with an online course. Thankfully these classes are lecture classes and the year has just started but the readings are slowly piling up as well as presentations that are creeping after every week.

My second and biggest stress this week is a business club organization that im involved in for my extracurriculars. I am the secretary for the club and my duties include a lot of clerical stuff like registering for the organization, booking stuff, and sending emails to people. It is taking a huge chunk of my time and work and i am heavily invested in it. 

So this week happens to be recruitment week and we have to present in different classrooms as well as in our orientation meetings which we had twice this week. I presented a total of three times on wednesday which had me really anxious before that and again the next day. Our orientations made us interact with prospective members and socialize a lot with others. I am not introverted but the stress is taking its toll on me and i already felt too drained even before the social interaction. Thankfully I did not have to present on friday which I was brain dead by that time. 

Not to mention at work at a campus job in the fiscal/accounting department my supervisor is being a complete asshole to me by picking on me and disrespecting me. For some reason it felt like this week was the worst of his behavior and it really felt like he was purposely grinding my gears without knowledge that i was struggling the entire week mentally and emotionally. 

Physically I lost sleep and i grew dark circles around my eyes, and my eyes have been red from the overwork and tiredness. My face has visibily thinned and i can barely muster a smile when i see people. Ive also lost weight as I checked the scale this weekend. My eating habits have been normal however ive got barely any exercise the entire week because of my exhaustion. Ive also experienced headaches and fatigue from the stress and anxiety.

My only ways of coping with the stress have been managing my errands as the secretary and sacrificing work hours/cancelling a group meeting with my other class. Ive been receiving emotional support from my mom and a friend whom i trust and understands my situation fully. 

Emotionally I feel down because Ive been feeling unappreciated and lacking positive attention from my fellow executive board members of my club. They dont give me the credit i deserve because my work as a secretary involves a lot of ""behind the scenes"" work and its been a hard load Ive been carrying on my shoulders. 

Tldr; this week was heavily invested in extracurriculars as a club executive secretary, supervisor picking on me at work, and falling behind in classes already. Had trouble coping and my physical features started looking worse by the day "
Underlying stress I’m not feeling?,My girlfriend brought it to my attention a few weeks ago that I was grinding my teeth at night. At times it was so loud it would wake her up out of a sound sleep. I have not been feeling well rested for the last couple months and am wondering if the teeth grinding is preventing me from fully falling asleep. I went to the dentist and he said 9 times out of 10 teeth grinding is stress related. But here’s the thing. I really don’t feel stressed. I used to feel it much worse years back when I had started a new job and was trying to save to buy a house and get my adult life started. That feeling was noticeable. I felt anxious a lot too. Now I feel totally fine. No stress about money or bills. My job is fairly easy just long 12 hour shifts. The hardest part is staying awake. My house has been coming together nicely. Anyone who knows me would never think I had a worry in the world. And really I don’t feel like I do. Over the last week my left eye has started to twitch randomly. In doing some googling I find that can also be stress related as well. So I guess my question is... is there underlying stress that someone can’t pinpoint? Is that a thing? How do you diagnose something you’re not sure you actually have? I’m so full of questions. Hoping someone can shed some light on this. I know how bad stress is for your body and health. I’m at a dead end road here... 
I want to switch majors/schools but I don't know how to tell my parents,"So long story short I was majoring in Bio and my uni is a fairly difficult school. The profs are only interested in their research and not teaching, causing me to have a pretty low GPA, and I also kinda don't like the courses I am taking. I want to transfer to another Uni that is around the same distance as the one I currently go to and I want to major in Neuroscience instead. I have Indian parents who are pretty strict about school, and I have no idea how to tell them about it. I've been stressing and I have no idea what to do "
"At work, I think the computer screen is causing stress. Need your opinions.","I recently started as a community manager. I used to work as a researcher and didn't spend a lot of time behind the PC. At my new job I arrive perfectly fine, after 2-3 hours behind the screen I start losing focus, blabber every time I speak, have difficulty finding words, my neck hurts, I feel irritated easily and can't seem to adjust my voice. When I get up and go to the bathroom my eyes become frozen and I keep looking at the wall for a minute or so.

I recently quit smoking cigarettes, it's been 2 months now and I don't want to go back. I exercise, eat healthily, meditate twice a day. Everything goes back to normal when I come home and hit the gym.

Is this stress? and if so, how can I fix this at work so I feel good like I do in the morning before going behind the laptop.

Thanks, all."
[REQUEST] Source for daily writing prompts or questions for journaling for stress relief.,"Lately my life has been so chaotic. New job, new home, two young crazy (but mostly well behaved) kids, money problems, marital problems, etc.

I've heard and read about the positive benefits of journaling for stress relief. I've tried it a little but I always feel dumb doing it with no aim. Just ""doing it"" is awkward for me. I have no idea what to write and I end up just doodling. 

I need some direction. Is there a source for quicky writing prompts? "
Stress related to loss of my dad having serious impacts on health??!?,"Since losing my dad 3 months ago, I've noticed a lot of changes in my health. My hair is thinning rapidly, I'm gaining weight despite no changes to my diet, my body is struggling to cope with food.

I'm trying to work out if this is stress/anxiety related but I'm honestly scared to google it because I don't want to stress myself out more.

The fact I feel like I'm going to lose all my hair at this rate is destroying me mentally. I've never seen it so thin and I'm honestly just looking for any advice people can give/to see if anyone has had similar experiences. 

It's been a rough few months to say the least!"

Everything falling apart.,"I was doing so good until about a year ago. Then I lost my job and started falling behind on rent. Landlord was really flexible.. but then job after job something always happened that put me in the same situation. I was never able to catch up on rent, and now that I'm about to get a decent job and right before the interview I got a text.. ""I'm sorry man.. but this is your 30-Day Eviction Notice."" I fell almost 1500 behind on rent. I've had a huge migraine ever since then, so many thoughts have gone through my head. I'm trying to cope but I can't seem to do it. I thought everything was going to start getting better, but I have a feeling finding a new place is going to be the same as the job thing. How do I cope to this?

School problems,Hi I'm an upcoming sophomore in high school and I just got my classes. All my classes are standard classes for a 10th grader except science. I was supposed to take chemistry as a sophomore but instead I got physical science which is a lower class. I think me taking physical sciene is a waste of time because it won't help me with chemistry and is way too easy. I really regret not putting in as much effort before and now Im stressing over it. Do you guys think I should ask the counselor to change me to chemistry? and if so how should I convince her to change my class

Paranoia? Eating disorder? Schiz?,"My day consists of explaining to people I don't have an eating disorder while I contemplate on throwing up my food. 
Most of my head is running on conspiracy theories on how my body is shutting down every second of the day, how I have some disease or cancer. I think I'm dying. I don't like having Tvs plugged in when they're turned off because I know someone's watching/hearing me. 

Everyone thinks I need to 'chill out' but I snap at every time they think to come up with a healthy way of making me sane. 

I'll convince myself for hours and hours, days upon days that something's wrong with me. A few weeks ago my lymph node swelled and I convinced myself I had neck cancer and I spent nights crying, staying up till eight in the morning, research, thinking I had a five year plan. 
After I got blood work and found nothing, not to mention everyone around me was acting like I was crazy. Asking if I'm schiz and if I 'need to go in.' 

I didn't think my eating habits were this poor, i skip my period every six months or so. Seems that the only cause could be from the lack of nutrients I have. 

I'm positive my cat has the plague even though I know that's it's not possible but I saw a flea and now I'm sure she has it and I'm sure I'll die in my sleep. 

Great."

fuckfuckfuck,"Recently my lymph glands have swell around my neck, behind both ears. My back hurts like hell, they're pretty sore to touch. 
Luckily I don't have cancer like I thought, even took a few blood tests. 
However, my health is plummeting and my stress and anxiety level is out of control. My environment doesn't help. 
I'm constantly crying, mad, working out and not painting like I used to. Also, eating? Yeah right. The most you'll get me to eat is my small protein shake and a handful of fruit. 

I'd love to know some ways to reduce stress so my body doesn't die from it. "

How to live a stress free life with mindfulness,
Understand your emotions & never suffer again!,"My passion is to make you happy, to give you a kind of happiness that doesn’t come and go but an happiness that stays with you forever.

So in order to do that, I want you to understand what does your emotions mean, why do you feel them and how to use them in the most simple and intelligent way for you to feel amazing and to have an extraordinary life living what you want to live.

Emotions are meant to be a compass, a guiding system to help you know when you are going in the “right direction” or when you are getting “off track”. We can experience an infinite amount of emotions in many degrees, within a range going from Unconditional Love to suicidal depression and n between we may feel, happiness, fun, peace, confidence, relaxation, courage, anger, hate, sadness, jealousy, and so on.

Emotions have just one simple meaning: If it feels good it is true, if it feels bad it is not true! 

When I have a thought and that thought makes me feel good, it is because that thought is true, that thought is in alignment with my true nature, according to my higher self\infinite intelligence that thought is correct, it is the right way for me “define” myself and to go in life.

When someone says to you “You are beautiful”, “I love you”, “I enjoy being around you”, … That makes you feel good, because those thoughts are TRUE, those thoughts are showing you who you are, you are loved, you are beautiful, you are and incredible person to be around with.
(In my case, I feel in heaven when someone says to me “You make me feel amazing” 🙂 )

The same goes with your on thoughts and perspectives (that’s what you attract every time btw), when you define yourself/think of yourself in a way that makes you feel good, like “I feel worthy”, “I love myself”, “I love being me”, “I truly like my new shirt”, “I’m having so much fun”, “I’m at peace and relaxed”, you are going in the right way, the right direction,  forward and aligned with your dreams and passions.

From feeling fine to feeling ecstasy and Infinite Love, it is true for you, those thoughts and perspectives are the ones that will serve you in amazing ways and that will bring you the tremendous benefits for you and for your life, keep choosing them, believe in them, bathe yourself in them. 😉

On the other side of the scale we have everything that makes us feel bad. Get this printed on your mind forever, when something feels bad, no matter what it might be, IT IS NOT TRUE.

You you think a thought that is out of alignment with your true nature, with you truly are and does not benefit you and serve you feel bad! That is your Higher Self/Infinite Intelligence letting you know “Hey that is not true!”, “Don’t believe it in”, “Don’t go that way, it won’t bring you any good”.

From a slightly discomfort  to overwhelming depression, it is NOT TRUE, you are not meant to think, believe, act and behave in that way. “I’m bored”, “I’m tired”, “This is so sad”, “My life is falling apart”, “Nobody likes me”, “I don’t like me”, “Nobody will ever love me”, “I’m not worthy”, “I just wanna die”,… no matter it might be, it is bad, so it is NOT TRUE.

It goes the same way for other people reactions upon you (that are just reflections of what you are believing deep inside), “I hate you”, “You know..you will never be good enough”, “You are not capable”,  “You are fat”, “You are ugly”, “He/she is doing much better then you”… These kinds of things that most of us grew up listening from people that are close to us and believing in it because we didn’t knew any better… ARE NOT TRUE.

You don’t need to believe in anything that doesn’t feel good to you! Even if comes from your mom, your dad, your boyfriend/girlfriend, dog, cat,…if it doesn’t feel good than it is NOT TRUE.

Other people don’t know Shit! ;P They don’t know a thing! Their intentions can be good, they might even love you, don’t judge them and always feel love for them, but don’t let anyone define your life and how you should feel about yourself.

If someone says anything that you don’t like, don’t believe it, ignore it,  feel the opposite. That’s how powerful you are 😉

So from now on, every time you feel bad, automatically you will know what is going on! “Wow, this feels bad, so it is not who I am, it is not true for me”,  then you can choose to investigate that thought and let it go and don’t believe in it anymore or to simply turn your attention 180º in the opposite direction and feel good anyway. 😉

Understand that the core reason for you to feel bad is that because you are in fact so Good!
You are so perfect than you think/experience something else you automatically feel the contrast.  Imagine yourself being used to heat, imagining always living in high temperatures, the second you step into something that is cold, you immediately feel it, you immediately feel the contrast of it! “God this is so cold..this is nothing like myself!”.

So whenever something feels bad to you, just relax and remember that you are feeling it because you are indeed the opposite of that, you are perfection itself. Doesn’t it feel liberating to know so ? 🙂

Your emotional guidance system (name given by Bentinho Massaro), are always working on your behalf, listening to it all the times.

When it come to decisions, choices, ways to go in life, the same way goes, what makes you happy, vibrant, excited, loved it is true, it is the way to go! What feels contracted, not so good, mediocre, sad, horrible, it is not for you to choose.

You are the one responsible for your thoughts and  what you choose to believe in! Your Higher Self/Infinite Intelligence is there guiding you all the time, but you will always have the free will to believe and choose the definitions and thoughts that you want to choose.

Don’t be confused anymore, always pick what makes you feel good, define yourself, define your life, define your reality in a way that makes you happy, there is the way to go all the time.

That’s the way to make your dreams come true, that’s the way that life is supposed to be lived.

You are perfect and you have the power to believe in nothing less than that.

Stressed out,"Stress I have this trip coming up that I really can't get out of and don't have the money for, like literally going to vegas for 9 days  on a one way ticket no ticket home yet. I told my friend not to get my ticket until I was 100% sure I could afford it but she went ahead and did everything and bought my ticket there with her free miles. I have to pay 317 for my Graduation by the 10th or I can't walk. I'm trying to find a job in my field and gotta come up with 500 more for rent by the 5th."
Weird incident...,"Hi all,

So this is a random one which might be in the wrong subreddit - let me know if you think I should move it!

Basically, I witnessed an assault last night and want some reassurance that I did the right thing/wasn't a failure. Please placate my anxiety!

To keep context short, mine and my partner's bedroom overhangs a canal, on the other side of which is a load of abandoned outhouses and some factory debris. Behind that is a train station. At 2am this morning we woke up to hear yelling coming from around the factory - after about 30 seconds - the echo caused by the factory buildings made it really disorientating - we worked out it was a woman shouting for help and a man shouting abuse. It sounded like she was in pain. 

Like I said, there's a canal between us at this point, to cross over which would involve a few minutes' detour and turning in the opposite direction to the incident. Our instinct instead was to open the window and yell, which we think drove the man away as a moment later the woman appeared, sprinting towards the station. I immediately phoned the police but the guy had apparently run for it already. 

Because the area has no postcode I know of, my directions over the phone were terrible, and my partner and I feel quite bad - should we have done more? Should we have run down and intervened? I know in my heart that's not true, but I suppose I'm just stressed that ultimately, we just shouted from our lovely, safe bedroom while she was potentially being raped. It was just all so confusing - there can't have been more than 90 secs to 2 mins between waking up and calling the police. We're gonna issue a formal statement at the station after work, because the place didn't open until 8am. 

Sorry, just want someone to say we did the right thing, I guess, cause my partner's taking it really hard and I have anxiety issues which he isn't currently able to settle. "
Just burst into tears at work.,"So, I've been with my company for 16 years. Always loved it. Good at my job, if I do say so myself. In January I got a big promotion, to supervisor. Last month I got another to a salaried management position.

I'm quarterbacking a very major project involving integrating our facility with a corporate call center. It's going to change daily life for us forever. We're launching this week.

Guys, we're around ten people short. There's no way we can even do basic daily functionality, much less all the crazy shit this project entails. I'm working 12+ hours a day at least 5 days a week, and usually going in for 5-10 hours over the weekend. I'm working so much just to fill holes because there's literally nobody else to do it. All my people are working overtime and burned the fuck out.

I came in at 4am to do some stuff nobody else was able to do last night, and then I was working on payroll and looking at this absolute abortion of a schedule any I couldn't help but burst into tears in front of my crew. Not like ugly crying, but stoic like silent tears.

I'm exasperated. I'm not an emotional guy but I feel like I'm having a nervous breakdown. I'm being an asshole to my family on the rare occasion I ever see them. It's causing a lot of problems, but my field is extremely limited. Not many opportunities around here for me. I'm just a schlub with no degree and an easy certification and I feel like I'm drowning.

If I had people it would be easy, but getting people in here takes months with this sloth-like corporate structure. 

I seriously am just sitting in my car on the side of a country road right now, just not knowing what to do. I'm feeling completely spent and empty. Thinking about the place makes me want to cry again.


Ah well, feels a little better to just talk about it."
"Job stress rant :,(","I have started working at a retail clothing store for a month now and I really like the job, the workplace and the co workers and the manager. But the only thing that gives me stress is being pushed to sell the retail credit card to every customer...
I have to open 1 card per shift apprently...
My first month working here, I have a grand total of ZERO cards...
I'm going to try harder next time but everyone just keeps saying NO!!! Why? Because they all smart enough to know you shouldn't open up a credit card without thinking through it at a store by listening to only the good things about it!!!!"
Life is hard.,"I have a good life, I just finished my first year of college and I have a great family. I guess I just feel like I have to disclaim that so people know I am complaining for no reason. But I'm so incredibly depressed... I have declared a major in computer science, and am taking a summer C++ class, and I just cannot understand the logic. This class is incredibly hard for me because it's only 6 weeks long (less than half the length of a normal college course semester), and I feel like I am jamming all this information into my mind. I'm also working 30+ hours a week and babysit a few times a week, and I feel like I barely have time to myself to self care. This subject is really frustrating me because I feel like I have no time to figure out the logic, and studying takes a long time. I have been missing work days and have slipped into an extended depressive state (sleeping but always tired, loss of appetite, no motivation to work out or see friends). Part of it is a boyfriend issue, but this class on top of that and my busy schedule just makes it the fucking cherry on top. I know I don't have it the worst out there, but honestly I'm so incredibly stressed and I feel like I'm not good enough. My dad tells me that I ""don't have the right brain for a computer scientist"" and that's just so degrading to me. Granted, I have been an artist my entire life, but I'm also incredibly skilled at math (mostly Calculus), so I hoped that Comp Sci would be easy for me to pick up - I thought wrong. Honestly my first comp sci class was so easy; we learned HTML and that was a blast. I like C++ too, but I think what's hard for me is the fast pace and lack of time to study as much as I want. I just feel like a failure because my parents are spending so much money on my education and I hate to feel like I let them down. I want to be good at coding, but I can't be good enough for the pace of this class. I know that if I take this class again during the fall, I will understand it more thoroughly, but my mom pulled the money card on me and it just made me feel incredibly guilty. I don't know what to do. If I fail this class, I'll just break down and I will feel so bad. I only have 1 week left of it and my grade is a 35%, I have to finish 2 more projects and 8 mini exercises, plus study for the final exam, as well as get enough hours in at work so I can get a decent paycheck. My life's a wreck, I've accepted it. 

Thanks for reading this far, if you did. It means a lot. Any advice really is helpful, I'm just basically at my breaking point but also lowkey accepting my failure. "
Recommended prescription medicine / drugs for chronic stress?,"I will be seeing a doctor about this but was hoping for some feedback from others first before going in so I can do a bit more research first. Has anyone had any success from prescription medicine/drugs for chronic stress? Any particular antidepressants etc? 

Basically looking for something to try when everything else has failed :). "
Worst experience ever,
Stress research study,"Hi all,

I'm a research student at University College London and I'm currently recruiting participants for a study investigating how stress evolves throughout people daily routines. The study uses your smartphone and an automated chatbot to regularly sample your stress level throughout the day with one 2-second question, over the course of a week. As a thank you, participants are entered into a prize raffle for a £50 Amazon voucher.

The reason we are doing this study is we are trying to figure out when exactly it's best to target relaxation methods and to identify any typical trends (stress building, reclining or staying elevated etc.)

The Cost of Moving,"Welcome to Los Angeles County in California. We are known for some of the worst rent and rentals in the United States. Go us?

It's supposed to be a move to a better apartment. A place with less roaches, ants, and termites. The place is technically bigger. My husband got a raise and the higher rent is supposed to be affordable. We can park off the street for less even.

It sounds good but it has already cost me over $3000! It's $1300 for the rent and the security deposit each. The moving supplies, if I added it all up, I would estimate was around $300 so far. We need to rent a truck and pay someone for help with furniture which will be another $300 - $400. 

Oh my gods! We have not even moved yet and I feel like I am being buried. I've barely slept the last 2 weeks. I have found it impossible to rest at night. I toss and turn then get up because my husband still has to be rested to work. I have to try my best to be awake and attentive to my 8 year old too. 

The thing I think I fear the most is if my son realizes he is getting the short end of the stick in this new place. He will have a room only 2/3rds of what he has now. I want to make more room for him by getting a loft bed with a desk and dresser built in from Ikea that he fell in love with but it's nearly $500! I feel guilty I cannot get it even though it's perfect for him.

When we are not outside or about we are big on hanging together in our living room. That is where this new place excels in space. The living room is huge! We will have great space for our books, music, computers. We don't have cable but we can watch movies much more comfortably from the net. 

Still, stress and guilt. 

I've tried focusing on my breathing and some past lessons on meditation but I am still wound up here at 3am. "
Hatred of sound,I think I have noise anxiety it's because I keep hearing vehicle sounds in the area where I live. I did overcome the stress earlier in the last months but it seems to happen again now and I maybe just overwhelmed enough to yell at every driver that cause the sound.
"Whenever I'm stressed, I often have random moments of brief relief.","I suppose you could say it's similar to getting a high, except it's from nothing, and as far as I'm aware, it's caused by nothing. I'm not sure why I get these, and they only last for a few seconds before I'm feeling like shit again. Does anybody else get these? And can anybody explain them to me?"
Any kind of athletes here? Did stress fuck your stomach/gut up and therefore affected your performance?,"Sorry if I kinda missed the point and I know you guys are going through worse stuff than me, but I am desperate to get this problem fixed.

tldr, I play soccer amateur level since I was a child, but take it pretty seriosly.


Alright, so very often, >50% of the cases, my stomach would completely block my true performance levels, my reaction times are slower, I can run significantly more slow than usually etc etc. Now, I kinda do stress myself before the game but I have never expressed any kind of stress I had through life (and I had lots of stressful situations, life, finances of parents etc) and was kinda proud of myself for it never affecting me. **So could it be that I am not showing stress mentally, but that stress then goes to my gut/stomach?**Anyways, I think so much about the game a few days before it, get hyped, want to prove myself, and then the game comes and this weird feeling, very hard to describe. Like something is blocking or blocked inside my stomach, maybe something related to nervous system?


Interestingly enough, I have gone a few times totally hungover, 2 hours of sleep, smoking the night before (I only smoke when drinking), to a game and then turn out to be among the best players on the pitch.. no fucking sense.

So I think that, because I was having fun partying and drinking the night before, I didn't stress myself over a pointless amateur level soccer match.

Did or does anyone experience the same stuff as me? I tried taking some stomach, acid reflux pills but the problem stayed at the same rate. I am aiming for this subreddit because I am now suspicious that this feeling in my stomach is a direct result of myself stressing over the game."
What is the opposite of a panic attack called?,"My response to emotional stress is to shut down, my body gets very lethargic, I feel a slow molassess like energy flow through my body and I just get incredibly sleepy. My body feels so heavy. Is this a thing? Does it have a name ?"

I don't have any methods for stress relief.,"All of my old techniques for managing stress either are bad for me, or they don't work anymore. Every time I get anxious, stressed or angry I can't resolve that feeling in any way other than waiting it out, this is really putting a lot of strain on my relationship, work and hobbies. 

I feel as if I'm not in control of my life anymore and it's all just spiralling away, does anybody have any suggestions on new ways to resolve stress, or ways to manage it?

The only healthy management techniques that worked for me was creative outlets, but as I get older, I feel more obliged to use these in a more formal way and I can't put as much emotion into any of the work I do. Everything I had is slipping away and I can't maintain hold of anything I enjoy in life.

Does anybody have any ideas?"
My future relies in my own hands and I'm confused.,"So, I have the option of getting my GED through a college or I can do this Gravity program. 
High school was not mixing with my mental health, after so many years my mental health got really bad and I'm just now starting to fix it (being out of school for almost seven months.) 
I was going to do the GED through the college with my friend but not since her school district is different she had other options and one of them isn't that. She really got me hyped up for it so I went to the orientation, got papers and planned on taking an entry test before going to another information class for actual classes this summer. 
Now that she's not going I'm really at a loss. Originally I was going to do gravity, for some reason it seemed more comfortable but soon as I attended the orientation for the college it felt better than I thought. 

Well, what do I do? Do I do this college even though it's a big campus and I'll be by myself? Benifits of everything that comes with a student card and the expierence. Possibly meeting new people.
Or do I go to Gravity? I could end up by myself, I could see people from my old school but they'd help me out with my future for sure.

Behavioral Strategies for Coping with Stress,
Dealing with doctors,"I don't need to write a whole story here unless it's needed but I've had a real horrible 2 years where I've seen my GP regularly about my mental health (voices in my head, suicide thoughts, absent days) and I'm getting no where. I'm in the uk so I'm seeing NHS staff either my local surgery, mental health clinic or mind (mental health charity that offer counselling). I'm at a stage where every day I do very very little because I can sense it's going to lead to a breakdown or worse so I need to go back to my doctors. I have no idea what to tell them that they've not been told before. How can I get the help I'm not getting?"
Blocking out the past,"There's so much I'm starting to remember from when I was really young and I hate it. I open one wound and the others unwind.
I don't want to face them, I've never dealt with them and that's why they're shoved away. "
Stressed,I got kicked out of my relaxing spa I used to go to because of my bipolar mania.  Now I'm trying to get through a bankruptcy and it's awful.  I need my taxes and I didn't even file in 2015 due to my bipolar mania.  I'm afraid to tell my attorney.  I could barely sleep last night because of my boyfriend's loud snoring.  my clothes are all dirty and I couldn't wash them because my boyfriend was using the washing machine.  I'm taking meds but it's not enough.  I feel like I can't appreciate life.
Unrequited love or naivety?,"I will try to explain this as clearly as possible but I'd like to share my story to hear what people have to say. My friends and mom have gone through this with me so I already know their opinions and it's still a popular topic we talk about today, even after almost two years ago. 

Keep in mind I've always been the weird, loser with only a few friends, Im far from special or popular. 

It started two years ago, towards the beginning of the school year my mental illness was plummeting and it's around that time I had opened up about the mess that was about to be unleashed. I had told one of my pe teachers that I couldn't take it, I needed to open up to someone and they brought me to the school counselor. 
No one ever used our counselors we had unless it was for school, graduation stuff or things along the line but I had never heard of a personal connection with ether counselor. 

Also, keep in mind that I had liked teachers plenty of times before but nothing like this.

For a short description of the counselor I got, he was a light I had never seen before. He was something I had never been introduced to before; every time I think about him I think of what happiness would look like. Seriously, it was like some god had answered my prayers from when I was younger to meet a guy that was going to fix all the shitty problems that I had been dealing with. 
He had the sweetest voice and only the kindest heart. 

I had started talking to him for a month or so, by then we had gotten to know one another well. He had told me a little about his past as I slowly opened up about mine, sometimes I wouldn't even talk but I'd still sit in his office and he'd make every gesture. Sometimes we wouldn't even talk about my problems but other things in life and what we were into. It was hardly ever about school, it was like I had a friend that developed into a crush real quick. 
I noticed that towards the end of my stay at the school he had grown protective, maybe flirty. We were constantly talking, he would pull me out of classes ,I hardly attended, to talk. He would cut someone's counseling session short to see me sooner. If any other authority figure tried to talk to me he was quickly my shadow. 
He had set me up with several services to do with therapy (I had already seen a lot but he made room for more.) even when we weren't talking, we had emailed simple stuff. 
Once, I remember that he had even said I reminded him of his wife. 

So, I end up moving schools. This school is okay, great at first but in the end doesn't work out. 
I invite him to this talent appreciation thing we're having to show him my art and he shows up. Between the short months of being there I had realized how much I missed talked to him.
Anyways, he shows up dressed really nice and we hug for awhile, I show him my art and my mom talks to him awkwardly for a bit. Him and I go around the corner, out of where the thing was happening and where there's no people and he's kinda bumping into me. We hug again and take awhile to let go, we talk a little bit about how things are going and then the day ends. 
I don't hear from him for the next six months? 
My mom emails him, I email him tons of times. 
Not to mention, not only was this guy the best person I could ask for but he was amazing at helping me mentally. 
My mental health plummets again and here I am. Went through more shit, getting help currently but missing him terribly. I had talked to him a few times within the last two months and he replied really late and bluntly.

I forgot to mention another thing; my friends have spotted him everywhere with his family and they all seem to say they always seem like their fighting. He looks guilty or weird every time he sees my friends because he knows their my friends. 

What do you think?
(I posted this on another thread to get different advice.)"
maybe god will help,"I have been nonstop hearing about the bills, money, my living situation, food and our cars for the past forever but these last years it just gets worse.
My parents never learned how to use money correctly in the first place because they were young parents and really fucked up their future. 
I can't step out of my room without hearing about money. 
It's been seriously making me want to blow my brains out.
Not to mention, every time I earn money from selling shit I barely have or art I have to use that money for 'the finer things' like clothes or food, stuff that I need to have to survive. I'm never doing anything nice for myself because of it and getting a job is a lot harder with my schooling situation and not to mention it's hard to get a job regardless.
I really hate life right now, I don't know what to do. "
My life and how i fucked it up !,"Hi guys,
I'm Yash, I'm 21. I want to write this not seeking for advice or help, although i deeply appreciate whoever it is who is trying to help or be concerned. From my childhood I've had the reputation of delaying things till the last minute. I love my parents and my sister so much , but I've never failed to disappoint either. Yes, there were good things that they were proud of but most of the time I fucked up. I dint know what to do. I've always wanted to be the cool guy and fucked almost many situations. There is a saying that goes he who understands that he is a fool won't be a fool anymore. I'm a fool , i know it, but i can't really help and I still continue to be a fool. My parents on the other hand are very hard working. My dad (greatest dad) worked from scratch to become a multi Millionaire . He literally dint have nothing. My mom on the other hand understood and helped my dad and gave him so much emotional and financial support. 

Now the worst thing is although i know all of this. I've never acted like their son. I have so much ego inside me that one day when my parents were scolding ( they did it for my good) i back-lashed at them saying something, very offensive, i.e I told them I don't deserve such parents ( Its true, for what a dick i was i never deserved them). They felt very bad and assumed they had a flaw in their parenthood. Trust me, they were very nice people they dint have a single flaw in fact i should be really lucky that i had such good parents. 

Later i joined for university, Where i started to smoke up and did drugs , alcohol. I dint do it because of peer pressure. I did by myself and i wasn't an addict also. I could control it but still i'm a faggot. My parents were so worried about me. I've lost myself in studying there. All my friends have graduated but i remained there for 6 more months because i couldn't finish the course. I've literally broken myself from the inside. I dint have any girlfriend since childhood( I'm a not a virgin). I always used to let others have a take on me. Sometimes i feel like dying but looking at my parents and my sister , I refuse to die because they wouldn't want that , my parents have worked so so so so so hard to be in very respectable positions as they are today ,they came from nothing to the top , for first they don't deserve a faggot like and second they will be very traumatized by this if it comes out to be true (which is what also they don't deserve), although if i die i wont be aware of their trauma , i cannot do that to them. 

I had so many dreams and i'm now worried about all of them. I used to study really well until my 12th std ( 97%) , i failed in school once in a year(5th class) but secured a decent score at school with 8.4 CGPA. Now in university my CGPA is below 5 out of 10. These numbers are very drastic and are at complete opposite ends. Basically i did well in my 12th because i studied by myself rather than listening to some teacher in the class. 
But in engineering i could have done everything right but i used to smoke up every day and ended up spoiling myself. I just don't know what to do now. I have no clue as to what career should i choose. I always wanted to be a billionaire ( Lol  Me!) , but that's an altogether different story which i know i'm simply assuming all this and satisfying myself by giving fake hopes to myself. I'm an idiot . I don't know how to act. 

I'm not proud of myself at all. Please don't be like me. I urge whoever reading this to learn from my mistakes. I broke into tears writing all this, this is not fake or some sympathy gaining trick i'm using. 
"
I'm really stressed out with my mom.,"my mom is so mean with me. When I get a grade from school, (it's like a A-) she gets mad and says hurtful things to me. I just don't understand why she is like this. It's frustrating for me and I wish I could scream to her. It doesn't matter how good I am, I know I will never be good enough to her. It's stressful because after the whole argument then she acts like if everything is okay. She is the most double faced person in earth. "

Finally reached my breaking point.,"I tend to take on my responsibilities than I can't manage and am fine for a while until it all catches up to me. 

I'm in high school, and am a part of my schools tech team. We do all the assemblies, events, and performances at our school (which is a lot) aswell as payed jobs for musicals and talent shows etc for other schools. I also am going to be doing the tech (lighting and audio) for our schools improv team every Friday on my own beginning next school year as the girl who usually does it is graduating. There aren't many improv gigs left this year, and I'm starting to realize that there's no way in hell I can do it. I have no idea what I'm doing as in our tech team I do projection and spotlight. I've never done audio or traditional lights. 

Due to my involvement with the improv team, I also help out with tech for my schools Drama Council. 

The next two weeks are packed with tech jobs for me, including payed and not payed, and exams are right around the corner. I'm beginning to fall behind on school work and am very overwhelmed. I'm at the point where I have a constant feeling of wanting to cry when I think about all I have to do, but I can't let people down by quitting. What should I do at this point?

2. **Don't be apologetic!** If you're working hard and it's stressing you out (this includes setting a limit on the amount of overtime you're willing to work per day/week), let your higher-ups know that you have reached your current, maximum utilization. They will appreciate you letting them know instead of, after the fact, expecting a result that never had the chance to come to fruition.

3. Always act with integrity and genuineness. Nobody, and I mean **NOBODY**, likes passive-aggressive and/or dramatic co-workers. If you practice *not being* these things then people will always take you seriously and accept your advice as constructive.

4. Spend 75% of your effort on the task at-hand and the remaining 25% managing  your stress/anxiety and being mindful of the next step. <-- This may seem difficult at first but once utilized regularly you will soon find yourself leaving work on-time and with your daily, achievable goals more accomplished.

5. Be the creator and manager of *your* emotions. Never let your difficult co-workers or customers dictate how you feel about the task at-hand (eliminates the desire to negatively alter the relationship based on a one-time, in-the-moment transaction). The prior 4 steps will never leave you with loose ends that can be used against you (as it turns out, nobody is immune to interoffice politics).

6. Near the end of your workday, become very mindful of what you would like to do with the remaining hours in the day. Having an after-work plan will allow you to avoid the cycle of: Wake up => go to work => go to bed => and so on. The weekend plan is critically important.

7. Continuously build your résumé. This practice will allow you to realize the progress you've made in a particular field and where you want it to go."
Stressed. Too much is happening at one time,Well a girl at schooled squealed me out and now everyone knows a secret about me i didn't want them to know. It really pissed me off in embarrassment and im not sure what to do plus im going to NYC soon so i cant handle anything when im not there.
Been getting ill a lot lately because of stress,"For the last two years I been very stressed and this in turn have reduced my immune system. I had a lot of headaches, sore throats and ear aches. I have now finally made changes to my life which have reduced stress by quite a lot. I have been dealing with things that I always worried about and I started a new hobby. 

Now I am wondering, will my immune system ever get back to what it used to be before the stress?"

New Found Stress,"Hi All. I am looking for some help/tips here because I am at the end of my rope with the amount of stress I am giving myself lately, and, I know it cannot be healthy

Ever since the new man in the White-house has been in charge, my stress level is through the roof (Let’s please not turn this into a political discussion. I am only saying what the source of my stress has been)

Not only am I worried for our country’s future, but, I also work directly for a call center that handles Obamacare appeals. So, if it goes, my job goes as well

I follow the news closely. But lately, it has been an overwhelming roller coaster ride of ups and downs.

Following news this close has been consuming me. I have done everything I can (write senators, donated to fighting the cause) so, at this point, I am just making myself more and more upset when I watch the news, read the news,..etc…etc because I know there is nothing else I can do about this at this point.

I suppose it doesn’t help that I have an RSS feed customized to deliver news to me from CNN either. One of the steps I am taking is removing any major news feed from my RSS reader.

If anyone else out there is in the same boat as me, what do you do to let this go? I need (NEED) to let this go because I am going to put myself in the hospital with the amount of worrying I am doing about everything. Worrying wont change anything. But, I NEED to let this go.

PLEASE, if anyone has tips, PLEASE share. Because I don’t know how much longer I can do this.

4/5/2017,"Well here i am again with my feet up, sat at my PC listening to depressing songs and making it all worse lol. 

Basically this weak i have realised that i have soooo much work to do in very little time and im not even sure if its possible to complete it all. 

Ive been working hard and trying to get things boxed off but it's incredibly hard. 

My family. Il start this as a new part because my family constantly stress me out, im being reminded 100+ times to just do simple tasks that im already about to do. They treat me as an idiot and if i talk back and say anything trying to defend myself, it makes me the bad person. 

Its gotten to the point where im spending most of my time asleep. I dont see sleep as a need, i see it as a hobby. I like locking myself away and relaxing being passed out where no one can talk to me and annoy me. 

I should say that im not always asleep, i do like to just lay in bed quiet without any light and just have a calm few hours, get up and do a things i need to do then straight back to chilling in bed, it's literally my own little paradise. 

The only reason i am downstairs at the moment on my PC is because my family aren't here. Unfortunately they will be here in a few hours and thats when il go back to bed. 

Also my love life is like train crash on a plane crash. I have no idea either but thats another post for another day, if i wake up..."
Suffocation,"I feel like I'm suffocating from all of the stress that I'm dealing with. I'm broke, no money for gas, food, or bills & asking my husband for help always ends up in an argument. He helps with most things, but I personally pay most of the bills - It's stressful and I'm trying to file for bankruptcy to help get out of the constant debt and drowning each month. I now work two jobs to help pay for everything and I have no time to see my kids when I get home.  

I just need a damn break - I do not know how much more I can personally take & now I'm getting pains in my chest when I think about all that needs to be done. To much to worry about - too much stress & I'm missing my kids more and more and they miss me... Today life sucks. "
How do you manage your stress?,"Everybody deals with stress in one way to another, but how they handle it is a different story. I used to response to stress and anxiety really horribly, but have approached it in a much more mindful and calm manner after taking a deep look at how I want to live day to day. I would like to hear from you how you manage your stress. What do you do? Meditate? Take a walk? Read?"
Stress from work advice,"Hello everyone,

since last October, I've been overstressed with work. I'm not even sure if I actually love my job anymore or if I am just grateful for the opportunity.

Last Tuesday, my coworker took 2 weeks for stress leave. Since he left, my workload has doubled...I've since gotten snappy with customers, friends, and family. TBH, I still have another week with this workload...And a second job requesting my weekend....I honestly feel like I'm going to fucking snap at any minute....Between calls, I'm screaming and smashing my desk...At what point, do you realize enough is enough?

Ive never even thought about stress leave from work but I'm at the point of no return. If I didn't have a car payment, I'd quit right this second. Can anyone provide me some advice? I feel like i'm taking crazy pills. "
Can you get tonsillitis due to stress or period?,"Been to the doctor several times, I get tonsilitis every month, sometimes if I am really stressed I get it twice that month. I have asked to have them removed but it such a long process in the UK. I just would like to know if this is a common thing and if more people suffer from tonsillitis at an adult age and get it as often as me."
Newly burnt out - having trouble passing time,"Hi guys,

I've been home from work for about two weeks now and I'm having trouble finding activities that can help me relax and pass time.

I'm a highly competitive person and everything that served as stress relief earlier now lands me in anxiety attacks as I get stressed out about doing my best or not being good enough. Beerbrewing is a no-go, running lands me in bed. I can no longer play multiplayer games, and cooking has been reduced to as simple meals as possible. I've been advised to stay away from programing, which was my main hobby as well as my profession. 

I now spend my time binge watching series as it seems like the only thing I wont get upset by doing, but it's tearing me apart.

Any ideas?"

Having an off day today,"Hey y'all,

Just needed an outlet to get some stuff off my chest. I'm going to a community college right now doing an engineering degree. I've been at the CC for 3 years almost and I'm so ready to get out of there and go to a 4-year school. My motivation has seriously tanked this year since I don't have anywhere near the prerequisites needed for transfer and I don't feel like I'm moving. I'm tired of the way people look at me when I tell them I go to community college. 

Got some of my worst grades on exams in my upper math classes this semester and I can't seem to get motivated enough to do better. 

4/6 colleges I've applied to have denied me so far. I'm still waiting to hear back from the other two. I feel like I can do so much better with the opportunities I've been given, but I'm just so mentally exhausted from trying so hard with little pay off. 

I have a fantastic job working at a research facility. Out of 800 candidates I was chosen to be one of the 15 to work there, and out of the 15 I was one of the 4 chosen to work year round. Without a doubt, my skills in my field are above average and it annoys me that I have to jump through all these hoops to prove this to the academic community to get accepted into a semi decent college. Once I'm at a 4-year I will flourish for sure, but I'm just stuck in community college where I'm juggling prerequisites that may not even lead me towards anything since every school requires something different and there is no way I can do it all.

I have no problems spending another year at community college, but I just have no motivation. 

Thanks for listening!"

Can't figure out how to relieve any kind of stress- i feel helpless.,"Lately, I have been feeling super stressed with no idea how to fix it. I'm in the middle of moving, just got promoted at my job and am at the end of my semester. I don't know where else to post this, but I am having a lot of trouble trying to balance everything out.

My neighbours are depressing me,I have just moved into a new place with my partner and unfortunately the insulation is awful. I wish I knew this before moving in. My neighbour downstairs is so loud and shouts all the time on the phone. I can hear word for word. Then the neighbours upstairs sound like constantly there's a group of lads playing games and being loud amongst themselves. They sound like they're just having fun but it is all getting too much. I don't want my partner to think it's affecting me this much but it is honestly making me so stressed and upset.  There's never just 5 minutes of quiet. I don't know what to do 
How can you dumb it down?,"I get super stressed in life, Im extremely hard on myself, Im extremely organized at work. I find that when people are dumb, they seem less stressed, non important important things dont matter, their more care free. Perhaps the term ""dumb"" is incorrect, but its sometimes the illusion they display. But sometimes I see people like this and I think theyre wise. "
16/04/2017,"So. Here is number 2 of my texts. Im not sure if anyone is even reading this but it doesn't bother me. I have come to the conclusion that i dont have any friends. Haaa. Anyway. The only friends i have are older work colleagues and that they are also into music. So people my age i dont get on with. They are childish. 

So im thinking more about my ex. I still have feelings for her but after 2 years they are going eventually but slowly. There's a few girls i like but not sure if they would feel the same way about me. I mean how could anyone feel that way about me. 

I am in the middle. I want a relationship but i dont want one also. I want someone to be able to help me and be a partner with me in life but it is so difficult trying to find someone that is compatible. 

Im sat looking at my PC waiting for files to copy over and im listening to music. It makes me want to go out and get wasted. But my bank account says no lol. 

So what could i do. Im not making enough money to pay bills. My job is very fun and all good but at the moment its not making enough money to support myself on. Hopefully that will change soon. 

If anyone has any questions for me i am more than happy to answer. Thanks. "

No time for myself,"I've realized at this point that I've never spent any time trying to help myself, only other people, and now the stress and anxiety almost to much.

Stress over a dispute few days ago; fear of dealing with a false accusation,"On Monday, on the monday morning rush hour peak train, where it is always extremely packed, i was accused of hitting my backpack against a guy, whom spoke very aggressively against me. I apolgized repeatedly but he still spoke to me in an agressive manner, with a body tone and mannerism of someone wanting t pick a fight.

 It was so horrible that I had to ""gently suggest"" that we both approach the station staff.

I apolgized again but made a police report. i issued a feedback to the train company on the same day, i expect that they are checking CCTV footage but I hope that they will get back soon.

I keep having this fear that this guys will issue false accusation against me."
I don't even have the basic skills required to deal with stress,"I'm a drug addict so I've always used drugs to deal with stress.

Today and as part of my recovery I need to better handle stress.

Im a fairly sensible person but its not really great as when im home alone and im not stood in front of an audience. Im pretty confident speaking in front of crowds of hundreds of people but talking to someone individually isnt great. Also please ignore the grammer and spelling mistakes, im dyslexic.

Im trying this as a way to vent stress. I have bills coming up that look to big for my bank, i have just gone through my first serious breakup. Well about 2/3 years ago an i dont even know where the girl is but its still there. Im writing in this to hopefully create and sustain a healthy mental state.

I dont know how often i will write here but hopefully i can keep writing every few days or at least once a week if possible. Anyway i just wanted to introduce myself.

Stress-related acne,"Hi /r/stress. I've noticed that in times of heavy stress (something I'm currently experiencing), my skin has a direct and noticeable response. I tend to break out very badly on my face and all over my back. My skin has always been prone to acne, but my back seems to explode in blemishes when I'm under severe stress. As you can imagine, creams and treatments don't work as well because I'm not targeting the source of the problem. I was hoping you could give me some advice to deal with this issue and treat my skin quickly and effectively."
Stress is piling up - do we ever get a break?,"I turn 30 in a week, and life is just too much right now.

In the past 2-3ish weeks:

-Grandfather is 90 - had a heart attack and gallbladder surgery- is home and doing better, but still very weak
-Grandma is losing her mind slowly - barely talks, but when she does, she talks about my grandpa dying soon
-Other grandpa has health issues and leaves tomorrow for a trip across the ocean - we are all worried how the flight will impact him (history of blood clots - but he insists on going)
-Father diagnosed with non-alcoholic cirrhosis of the liver - still waiting to find out how bad it is but people keep telling me about people they know that died from it and how ugly it is

On top of it, Hubs and I have been house hunting for 8 months, and trying to get pregnant for 6 months. 

I started a new job 2 months ago and it is a lot to learn, so that is still stressful too.

Please tell me that adulthood gets easier? Or at least calms down for a few years at a time? I need a break. My hub's dad died 2 years ago and we are just really starting to heal from that, just to have all this happen with my family now.

I think I am handling things okayish right now. I tend to burn out by Friday - but how do I take care of myself while still being there for others?"
how would you handle a customer like this?,"Ok so today I was at work at my local gym. It's in a relatively mixed area of town and theres a wide variety of people use it. Anyway there's a guy Ive not seen before comes in. He's mid 70's, a solicitor and apparently he's an ex-member whose jumped up and arrogant as all fuck and known for being aggressive.

Anyway he asks me about what the timetable is and we currently dont have a paper copy or anything because it's being renewed tomorrow and we'll have them monday morning. I told him this and he begins to swear and 'bloody hell, this is nonsense, you're useless etc' at me. Rude.

Anyway, I he goes away for a while and finds the old one on the wall (months out of date btw) and comes back yelling at me and telling me I need to 'engage my brain' and 'listen when his lips are flapping.' I continue to explain it's not only out of date but being replaced TOMORROW and we dont have copies of the new one just yet, but he is welcome to use our facilities and gym for today.

ANYWAY, he then leans right over the desk and gets really close to me with a big scowl and demands my name so he can make a formal complaint because i dont listen or help. I tell him my first name and tell him that communication works both ways and his agression isn't needed. He leaves and I find my anxiety rises up really high and felt very sick.

I felt threatened and that he was deliberately being abusive. He did this in line with a camera that caught all of it. I still feel a bit shaky though. I was trying to help and he took an attitude. 

Apparently he's known for trying to pick fights but this was ridiculous."
Feel like I am burning out (again...) Help: what do I do?,"Hey guys, first time posting on this sub, so I hope you can help me out!

I am so stressed and I feel like I just can't any more. I'm 19F and I burnt out two years ago, I did improve at some point, but now it's even worse. I constantly feel like I'm about to puke and/or cry, it feels like my heart is about to stop and my head is just going to explode. I have so many piled up stress from college, being the main invester in a LDR and just all the extra stuff that happens in life. I just don't have time to relax, but even if I do try to relax my head is just screaming....

I can't focus and miss a lot of classes and that makes me even more stressed. I can't do anything to take away the stressfactors, because I'm allready trying to do (and failing) the bare minimum.

I eat less than I need, because it only makes me feel sick and I can't talk to anyone. People either tell me to stop worrying about it, or in the case of my mother, get mad at me, because stress can't make you that sick, so I'm just being a wuss.

Really what do I do? Is there a miracle mantra, because I feel like I can't hold on much longer..."

I am not doing ok.,"I recently moved into my sister's place. It's my first time moving out of home and every one said you'll love the freedom and such. However, I'm hating it. I'm far away from work with no licence or car - what was a car trip that takes 20 minutes is now a bus and train trip an hour and a half long. Thankfully, my dad is still agreeing to drive me home when I finish late.

My sister is a shift worker - works around the clock at ridiculous times. I asked her (before I moved in) if she could sometimes pick me up from work if I worked late and if she could help me with my driving - she said yes. I've now asked a her a few times if we could drive somewhere she has said: ""no"", ""just because"", and ""I'm sick and tired"". She's lazy and selfish. I've asked her once if she could pick me up from work (as my dad was unavailable) knowing for a fact she's not working and I get a response saying ""I'll pick you up at the bus stop down the road"" - which doesn't help me at all. I'd still have to travel an hour and a half, come back at 11pm to shower, eat dinner, and then get my things ready to leave for work at 7 in the morning (waking up at 6), and I'd be travelling alone at a late hour in the night. My job requires me to be on call and if I get called in at 9am to start at 11am, I would only have 30 minutes to get ready vs the hour I would have at dad's.

I can't deal with it anymore. I'm sad, frustrated, always tearing up. Haven't eaten a proper meal in over a week. I have constant headaches. I'm back at dad's house during the day just so I don't ""interrupt"" her sleeping as there nothing for me to do here except watch tv and browse the internet. Her personality is not the nicest either. She screws her face up every time I talk to her as if I'm annoying her, talks down to me as if I'm a child. I can't stand up to her because I'm afraid of her. Puts me down whenever I feel the slightest of emotions (any, angry, sad, happy). I've given her so much money over the years and not asked for a cent back (and she has s full time job), the least she could do is help me out once in a while. 

I thought moving in here would be a good idea, but it's only made my situation worse. I'm further away from work, my sister only wants me here for rent money, the commute is very taxing and tiring, I'm not comfortable living with a lazy and selfish person.

Moving back home would be beneficial work-wise as it's closer to dad's house, but then I would be letting myself and everyone around me down. I was told that my sister didn't think I could move in, that I wouldn't go through with it, even though she WANTED me here. 

I just don't know what to do. Going back home would be a step backwards in terms of independence, but then again, I'm still not fully independent, but moving back home would so much better for getting to work and back.

TL;DR I am not coping with my living situation. I'm too far away from work and my sister is lazy and selfish."

Need some help dealing with everything.,"I'm just going to jump right into it, I recently moved to California from Connecticut which was a huge change for me. I left my entire family and friends behind to come out here for school, for a new job and for my girlfriend. We spent roughly $2000 getting my car fixed so I can drive it out here. Within 2 months of being here, I got into a really bad accident and my car was deemed a total loss. I still haven't received the money from my insurance company from the accident for a new car, I've been relying on others for rides. I just found out i owe over $1000 to my school as well as having no car, and no insurance money. My glasses broke during the accident luckily my mom sent me backup. Today those just broke.

"New job, things are doing a bit downhill","I recently started my first full-time job in September since graduating college (almost 2.5 years) after doing struggling to find a stable job as an editor.

I thought I hated the industry because of how dull it seemed at the last job. With this new job, the first few months felt great—I started out as a freelancer and they liked me enough that I was offered the FT position within 3 weeks instead of the 3-month grace period. I actually find the work interesting, now that I am only one of the two people in my team (compared to 20+ people at the previous job)—my manager has done an phenomenal job taking me under her tutelage and teaching me almost from scratch, especially when work is at a rough, high volume. My supervisor is also really sweet and looks out for us. 

However, at the nature of the industry, we've lost business and there is an enormous amount of pressure to keep pitching with presentations, so there have been layoffs and people are worried about their jobs. Going in, I knew how much responsibility I had to take—all these uncertain late nights, the burden of making factual errors, staying on top of almost every project because we have to look at almost EVERYTHING and being consistent. I'm an editor and the editing and fact-checking is play a pivotal role in our work, especially having to work around the FDA. 

I hate to sound like I'm sugarcoating it, but the first few months were pretty great, but now I'm starting to see the cracks of the company and it bothers me. 3 people (whom i thought were doing okay) were let go and I am constantly frightened that I can get fired any minute. I can't help but feel like I'm fucking up a lot and getting nitpicked at for doing something incorrectly because I didn't know, and it doesn't help that my manager can be a bit passive-aggressive about things in an open-space office, where we (as in the entire company) all sit so closely to each other and can hear a pin drop. I am really trying my best and I like the challenge of the job and learning about the health scope and the people are really great, but I just feel so overwhelmed and at most times, extremely inferior and useless because I don't know as much (compared to my manager's 20+ years of experience) and I don't get filled on things as much as I'd like to. I feel like I'm constantly being rushed when I'm given such tight deadlines and it burns me out. Ideally, I'd like to stay at a company for 1.5-2 years but I'm getting so burned out already and I'm worried it might not look good in the future. 

Things are also not looking great at home—I'm having a fallout with my parents. They just bought a new house and I want to take this opportunity to move out but I need financial stability to sustain that, which is why I fear for my job most of the time. "
Stress by too much thinking,I don't have much bigger problems but I take stress into small small problems also. I think way too much about even small problems. I can't even handle big problems. I see people wouldn't worry even about larger than larger problems and here I have an anxiety even on small problems. I also have a lack of confidence in myself and for even a small step I would think of what will people will think about me. This has severly taken a toll on my mental health. If anyone have any ideas regarding how I can improve in this I would highly appreciate it.
The Relationship Between Hormones and Stress,"Hormones and Stress 

The holiday season is upon us! Although this can a wonderful time filled with love and laughter, it can also significantly increase the day-to-day stresses experienced by many people; this can easily turn into chronic stress. Did you know that chronic stress can have a significant impact on your normal hormonal responses? Read on to learn more about the effects stress can have on your body and what you can do about it.

Hormones and Stress Panic Attack From Stress And Worry
The Normal Stress Response

The Hormones and Stress feeling that we all know so well is part of the body’s normal response to a real or perceived threat. However, your body does not differentiate between serious physical threats and “normal” pressures, and so a heavy workload or demands from your family can build up over time and have a detrimental effect on your health.

The stress response is commonly known as the “fight or flight” response, and it begins in the brain. When a stress is perceived, the amygdala sends a signal to the hypothalamus, which activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers the release of adrenaline from the adrenal glands into the bloodstream. Adrenaline then accelerates the heartbeat to pump more blood to the muscles in preparation for “flight.” In addition, the pulse, blood pressure, and breathing rate all increase to enhance the amount of oxygen inhaled. Other senses, such as sight and hearing, become sharper.

During the second phase of the stress response, the hypothalamus releases corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which stimulates the release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then stimulates the release of cortisol from the adrenal glands, which ensures that the body remains on “high alert.” Cortisol levels remain elevated until the threat passes; the stress response is then shut down once the brain perceives that the threat is no longer there (http://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/understanding-the-stress-response).

Hormones and Stress

The Effects of Stress

Prolonged periods of stress prevent the shut-down of the normal stress response because the body remains on high-alert and producing cortisol. The long-term exposure to cortisol and other Hormones and Stress has a number of negative effects throughout the body, including:

In the respiratory system, the accelerated breathing rate could lead to asthma or panic attacks (http://www.apa.org/helpcenter/stress-body.aspx).
In the cardiovascular system, prolonged periods of an elevated heart rate and increased blood pressure can increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, heart attack, and stroke.
In the liver, the increased levels of cortisol stimulate the production of glucose in anticipation of increased energy demands. Such prolonged exposure to elevated blood glucose levels might increase the risk of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.
Some animal studies have suggested that chronic stress can reduce testosterone levels and sperm production and maturation in men; it can even lead to erectile dysfunction and impotence.
In women, chronic stress can lead to an irregular menstrual cycle, worsened premenstrual syndrome symptoms, and reduced libido.
Stress can also dampen the immune system.
Emotionally, stress can affect your sleep, increase irritability, anxiety, and depression, and reduce concentration.
How to Reduce the Effects of Stress

There is no need to worry: there is a lot you can do to counteract the natural stress responses that occur at this time of year. It is important to understand what makes you stressed, as well as what makes you relax. For example, there are several lifestyle changes that can help reduce stress  (http://www.webmd.com/balance/stress-management/stress-management-relieving-stress):

Take time out to do something you enjoy Express your feelings
Use relaxation techniques such as meditation Exercise regularly; exercise is one of the best ways of reducing stress Because many of the symptoms of chronic stress are also associated with low hormones, such as sleep loss, fatigue, and low testosterone levels, we recommend getting your Hormones and Stress levels checked if you experience any prolonged, unusual or unexplained stress. At AAI Clinic, we can measure your Hormones and Stress and make recommendations regarding any hormone replacement therapy or supplements that could alleviate your stress-related symptoms.

Feel like I'm at breaking point sometimes,"My whole life is a mess.

I am abused by my narcissist parents (who I am also full-time carer for, which makes it all worse). No, I can't leave or get other carers in please just accept that you don't know the whole situation, thank you.

My sister (married, 2 kids) never even offers to go grocery shopping (she drives, I don't) for them and when I say to my parents they should ask for her help, they don't want to 'bother' her. Yet they fawn over how amazing and hard working she is. I get called lazy cos I 'quit my job to scrounge government money, using their disability as an excuse'.

They don't refer to me as their daughter, they call me their carer. They treat me like a maid, like staff.

Yet when my sister does help, it's with things my parents have refused to let me do. So then they come round on Sunday, do the thing, and I feel like it makes me look so lazy. Then when I make a point 'you said no when I offered to do that', I feel petty.

Some bg on my sister:

- Never got beaten by mom, I did
- Never left me alone with her kids
- I got to change one diaper when they were babies
- Refused to teach me how to drive
- Never calls me or invites me to her house
- Gives me the general impression she doesn't want me around

My mental health has never been great but lately... I am just crumbling into a state of nonexistence.

- I have no desire to shower, brush my hair, even change my clothes.

- Because of my mental health, I forget all birthdays and events and never have the money to give them unless I go without food to do so. They say it's fine but I get that *look*. You know the look. That 'oh, here's the family fuck up again' kind of look.

- I drink daily (not loads, just every evening I drink low alcohol wine), this brings on the binge eating which makes me feel sick, sometimes I am sick

- Due to care work I can't take days off, or breaks. Due to lack of support this is even less possible. 

I'm sorry this is all over the place. I just don't know what to do. I hate my life. I hate myself, and who I have become. This isn't me. I used to be so happy, life of the party, I used to dress up and feel pretty.

I look so fat, stressed and tired I loathe catching my reflection these days. I just hate myself. Been to doctor's TWICE (different ones) they don't give a shit. One laughed at me the other said I don't ahve time for your life story, and just shoved tablets under my nose, offering me free counselling which doesn't work. I need a therapist, not someone to nod at me and ask how I feel about that."
Been saving up for months to build my first ever PC and now I'm having some trouble :(,"I did so much research on what I wanted to buy. What PC components, a good desk and monitor, etc. But now I've found several mistakes and need to return a whole bunch of it.

The case, CPU cooler, and desk I all need to return and I'm not sure if the return fee will allow me to retain enough money to buy the different parts. I'm super stressed out and I don't know what to do about it :("
Caught in a rut,"Hello Everyone,

First time Im posting here (this is also a throwaway). Where do I begin? I am genuinely concerned about the way I have been thinking and much of it has to do with stress. For background information, I am a senior at a university who is almost done his degree (BS in Computer science w/ Certificate Computer Security) so I already know that im in a stressful program. Ive never really had a problem with my education until this semester, I feel mislead in my classes i.e (I do great on the homework and then I end up failing the tests). This has lead to me failing or doing not up to my standards in my other classes and its beginning to effect my own self worth. Instead of being confident in myself im resorting to internal hatred and just overall sadness. I am in a relationship with a very loving girlfriend but I feel that if I bring my problems into it, it could go sideways and I dont want that. Because of all of this my sleep schedule has not been exactly ideal, I usually go to bed at midnight and wake up early for class and the quality of my sleep is not what I would call good (tossing and turning and frequently waking up). I just feel like I have been in this high tension environment and one false move could literally ruin everything for me. I really have no idea what to do or how to cope with this, I literally go to every class on the verge of tears because I guess I have so much pent up inside of me. What do you think?

TLDR: Extremely stressed out college student on the verge of graduation, problems with internalizing emotions and staying positive (typically im a very positive person)"
I keep failing my classes,"I keep failing my classes, i try really hard and I have a lot of tutoring too. Im so fucking done, i cant pass anything. "
Constant miserable stress and anxiety..,"Hello, (id like to start by saying i know how dramatic this post will sound and I'm fully aware that it's unhealthy the way I think daily.) my biggest issue is the constant state of stress I am in and how overwhelmed I feel everyday. I wake up in the mornings with a burning ache nauseous feeling and a throbbing chest. The nausea dies down normally once I've been awake for a little bit but the chest throbbing and feeling of emptiness doesn't. I am at the verge of tears all day everyday and the smallest of things can set me the wrong way. I have panic attack after panic attack and I truly just don't know what to do anymore. No matter how I explain the severity of my situation to people, they STILL somehow seem to not understand just how miserable my mind makes me everyday. I get intrusive thoughts like about how something terrible could happen to my family, or a lot of ""what ifs"". My mind is running 24/7 and it's driving me insane. I have a terrible fear of dying along with an even more crippling fear of something happening to my family (my parents, brothers..) all day long my mind plays thoughts and scenarios that leave me sad, scared, constantly wired with fear, and over all exhausted. I have talked to my therapist about this issue but medicine isn't helping and the thoughts won't go away. Not to mention my issues with school. I do online school due to health issues and mental issues (I was bullied a lot) but even that doesn't take away the stress of school. I open up my schoolwork, take a long look at it and immediately feel overwhelmed and anxious. I procrastinate and can never seem to be at ease with school. Doing just everyday things have gotten to be way too much. I also get chest pains all through the day from regular daily activities. I'm miserable and I can't keep living like this. Does anyone know what I can do to not feel like this? I've tried everything I can think of. I've taken up yoga, meditation,breathing exercises, and many coping exercises to try and help that my therapist has written down and given me but they don't work either(just temporarily as in 5 to 10 minutes then I'm back to how I was before.) I'm sorry for the length of this post but I figured this was my best shot of finding someone who has this issue and can at least take away the edge I feel. Please no one leave any negative feedback, I understand you may not feel this way or even see how someone can, but I'm just looking for answers. Thank you so much"
Help With Exploding,"I have always been a fairly stressed out person. This has been true of me since second grade and I have real problems with handling it.

For years I had some good primary methods. I had a consistent group of friends who played games with me and that helped. I actually had a fairly active social life that allowed me to escape it all.

However, in the past year, a lot of that has changed. Many of my current friends are complete introverts, things with school have hit the fan and there is no sign of slowing, and I'm dealing with some personal issues at the moment that present themselves stressfully.

My method through this has been to rant. I talk to my mother, I talk to my girlfriend, and I talk to my friends and teachers about how stressed I am. It became apparent a few months ago that this would not be sustainable when I almost lost my girlfriend due to this.

I had another one of those moments today.

I'm essentially looking for outlets. Something easy that does not take a ton of time that can help me mitigate this stress. Meditation has somewhat stopped working for me so I'm kind of at a loss."
18 Sr in Highschool also dual enrolled in college classes pursuing associates degree in business,"Junior year in High School I was excepted into a program in which I would start taking college classes for the first half of the day, then after take some high school classes. The idea is that the college courses also count for my high school courses. Also the program is fully paid for and is 3 years long. So I will graduate high school this year in 2017, but get my associates for free by 2018, by continuing to remain in the program and finish classes. 

Recently during my 5th total semester I have a Quantitative Reasoning class which consists of applied math skills w/ some excel work. I was excited because applied math is something that can be very useful in the business world of which I aim to pursue. But everything went downhill very quickly. My professor gives no lectures, which I have never encountered, but to my understanding, this isn't uncommon. But from reading, usually it is weird for professors to do this is basic 100 classes at the collegiate level. She doesn't lecture, all the work is online, all the text is online, and is unreliable when responding to messages/emails. I have discovered that online work is harder for me to learn from and efficiently complete, for me personally. My brain just doesn't work the same. But the class isn't ""online,"" it is a sit-in on Mondays and Wednesdays. 

Last week a girl in my class asked a couple of questions on some examples in our workbook, and my prof responded with, ""you are asking to many questions."" It felt like she was getting extremely impatient for no apparent reason. The professor is not teaching us anything, everyone in class is struggling, and she is not helping. Also it is a 4 credit class so about 8 hours is expected to be done out of class (study, homework, etc.) but we have been doing around 13-15 hours a week on this one class. I know some of this is just college but I am nervous that I will not pass this class and am extremely worried, stressed, and frustrated with everything. Keep in mind I am still a senior in High School, and have more homework for that and the other couple college classes I take weekly, and I have a job. Any advice would be appreciated. Very worried "
What better way to flush out the stress?,"Laughter loudly could be the best way to flush out the stress.!! So,

Friend Management,"I'm just having a hard time trying get to keep up with friends after college. I'm dealing with a 9-5 office job, living back with parents, and juggling personal and social life.

I really want to stay friends with the people from college. Most of the time we talk via discord and do a lot gaming. 

However lately they are getting really serious with the whole 'esports' mentality. I want to play and talk to them more but I just don't have the time or freedom to dedicate to that. I would love to play more and get better with them (because they are my best friends).

At the end of the day...it's just really hard and stressful to manage the different schedules of friends. 

How do you all manage scheduling among your friend groups?

Sorry for any grammar mistakes.  I'm using my phone to post this."

Stress resolution challenges.,Hello all....What are some common challenges everyone is facing with stress? 
Stressed about life in general,"For starters I have GAD, so of course I'm going to be worrisome. But, here is what's going down: I'm 19 and never had a job. I'm literally applying everywhere, and no one wants me. I need a job, because I want my life to be worth something; I want to go to college, eventually... But, in high school I lost all motivation for anything and everything, and barely tried in all my classes, even ones I enjoyed. So, I don't have the best transcript. On top of that, I also haven't taken the ACT, because I didn't think I'd even consider college. I literally feel like I know nothing and am completely unprepared for the ACT no matter how much I study, because I never payed attention in my classes. 
More things stressing me out are politics and family. But, not as much as the school / job thing. And I haven't reached out to anyone to tell them how stressed I am, and I feel it seems so stupid, and I'm sorry. "

Need Help! How do I manage feeling super anxious and uncomfortable at school and in all my classes?,"I just started my second semester if Grade 12.

I am taking an outdoor physed course where I am expected to engage socially with people in my class, and also film where I'm surrounded by a hunch of really artistic people and a really intimidating teacher.  Then in my other classes there's a bunch of people that just make me super uncomfortable.  And to make things worse, I need to have really good grades in all of my courses to get into university.  

I just dont know how to cope.

Time for a break - The lesson I learnt from breaking my foot.,
"Change affects me so much, the stress is debilitating.","My dream job (from home) is ending. I still have a job, but hours are changing and the workload increase is huge. 

I still have a job, 3 wonderful kids and a wonderful wife. Why the hell am I so stressed? I've been applying at all sorts of online jobs, manual labor jobs, I even called the military to see if I could get in as an officer. Now I'm debating on going back to school for radiology. Which means I would have to quit once I was in the program (if I even got in!)

All in all I need to calm the fuck down. But I can't stop thinking/worring about all this change. I don't want to take any pills, but I can't sleep well at night now. 

I went through this about a year ago when our 3rd baby was a giant surprise to us. Love her to hell and I was totally wrong about it, but at the time I was a wreck. 

How can I calm down? How can I alleviate this stress? (Gym and sex didn't help!)
